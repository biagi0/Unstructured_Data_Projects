29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2019",2019-04-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3376.0,1714490.0,67305357.0,Presenter Speech,Ruth Porat,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Ellen. In the first quarter, total revenues of $36.3 billion were up 17% year-on-year and up 19% in constant currency following a strong 2018. Once again, our results were driven by ongoing strength in mobile search along with important contributions from YouTube followed by Cloud.
For today's call, I will begin with a review of results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google followed by Other Bets and will include with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which we will take your questions. Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter.
Our total revenues of $36.3 billion reflect a negative currency impact year-over-year of $1.2 billion or $1 billion after the impact of our hedging program. With respect to Alphabet revenues by geography, U.S. revenues were $16.5 billion, up 17% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $11.8 billion, up 13% year-over-year and up 16% in constant currency, reflecting weakening of the euro and the British pound. APAC revenues were $6.1 billion, up 27% versus last year and up 31% in constant currency, reflecting primarily the weakness of the Australian dollar and the Indian rupee. Other Americas revenues were $1.9 billion, up 10% year-over-year and up 21% in constant currency, reflecting primarily the weakening of the Brazilian real and Argentine peso.
Turning to profitability. In our earnings press release, we provide a table to highlight the impact of the European Commission fine on operating come, net income and EPS results in the first quarter. I will comment on results both with and without the impact of the fine as I review the results.
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues including TAC, which I will discuss in the Google segment results, was $16 billion, up 19% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $9.2 billion, up 27% year-over-year primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The biggest contributor was costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, followed by content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube and mostly for our advertising-supported content but also for our newer subscription businesses, YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which have higher CAC as a percentage of revenues.
Operating expenses, including the impact of the EC fine, were $13.7 billion. Excluding the impact of the fine, operating expenses were $12 billion, up 20% year-over-year. The biggest increase was in R&D expenses with headcount growth in Cloud as the largest driver. Growth in sales and marketing expenses primarily reflects additions to headcount. Growth in G&A expenses is primarily due to legal matters, including the effect of a legal settlement gain recorded in the first quarter of 2018.
Stock-based compensation totaled $2.8 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 103,459, up 4,688 from last quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were in Cloud for both technical and sales roles.
Operating income was $6.6 billion. Excluding the impact of the EC fine, operating income was $8.3 billion, up 9% versus last year for an operating margin of 23%. Other income and expense was $1.5 billion. As I trust most of you are aware, in 2018, this line item was meaningfully elevated because of the introduction of a new accounting standard that requires recognition of unrealized gains and losses on equity securities. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.
Our effective tax rate was 18.3% for the first quarter reflecting a sizable impact from the nondeductibility of the EC fine. Net income was $6.7 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $9.50. Excluding the impact of the EC fine, net income was $8.3 billion and earnings per diluted share were $11.90. 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $4.6 billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $12 billion with free cash flow of $7.4 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $113 billion.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $36.2 billion, up 17% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenues were $25.7 billion in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year. In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by mobile search with a strong contribution from YouTube followed by desktop search.
Network revenues were $5 billion, up 8% year-on-year, continuing to reflect the performance of the primary drivers of growth, AdMob, followed by Google Ad Manager. Other revenues for Google were $5.4 billion, up 25% year-over-year, fueled by Cloud and Play and partially offset by Hardware. 
Google Cloud Platform remains one of the fastest growing businesses in Alphabet with strong customer momentum reflected in particular in demand for our compute and data analytics products. Strong growth in Play was driven particularly by performance in APAC. Hardware results reflect lower year-on-year sales of Pixel reflecting in part heavy promotional activity industry-wide given some of the recent pressures in the premium smartphone market. We provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $6.9 billion or 22% of total advertising revenues and up 9% year-over-year. Total TAC, as a percentage of total advertising revenues, was down year-over-year reflecting a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites as well as a decrease in the network TAC rate. The sites TAC rate was flat year-over-year as the impact of the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC, was offset by the growth in TAC free sites revenue primarily from YouTube. In Q1, the network TAC rate declined year-on-year primarily due to a favorable product mix shift.
Google stock-based compensation totaled $2.6 billion for the quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Operating income was $9.3 billion, up 11% versus last year, and the operating margin was 25.8%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $4.5 billion, reflecting investments in data centers, servers and office facilities.
Let me now turn to and talk about Other Bets. Revenues were $170 million primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss was $868 million. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $59 million. Key recent accomplishments include: Waymo recently announced that it will expand its activities in Michigan opening a facility in Detroit that will be the first factory dedicated to the production of L4 autonomous vehicles. Last week, there were exciting announcements from 2 additional Other Bets that were originally incubated within X. Loon announced a long-term strategic relationship to advance the use of high-altitude vehicles to deliver connectivity with SoftBank's telecoms growth, HAPSMobile, which will invest $125 million in Loon. Wing became the first drone delivery company to receive air carrier certification from the FAA, an important step toward beginning a commercial service delivering goods from local businesses to homes in the U.S.
Let me close with some observations on our priorities and longer-term outlook. As we highlighted on our last call, there was a significant swing year-over-year in the impact of currency movements on our results this quarter from a big tailwind in the first quarter of 2018 to a headwind in 2019. These affect both revenues and operating income given the majority of our expenses are in the U.S. Based on the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to key currencies, we expect a continued headwind to our revenues and operating income again in the second quarter.
In terms of our key revenue drivers, with respect to Sites revenues as we indicated last quarter, the timing of product changes in ads at times can have an impact on year-on-year growth rates. We will continue to make changes with a focus on the long-term best interest of users and advertisers. We remain confident about the sizable opportunity ahead to improve the advertiser and user experience through our ongoing commitment to product innovation, in particular by leveraging machine learning across our ads, products and properties.
Turning to the key drivers of growth in other revenues. We are pleased with the momentum of Google Cloud Platform with balanced growth of both new customers and expansion within existing customers driving revenue growth. With respect to Hardware results, while the first quarter results reflect pressures in the premium smartphone industry, we are pleased with the ongoing momentum for assistant-enabled Home devices, particularly the Home Hub and Mini devices, and look forward to our May 7 announcement at I/O from the Hardware team. 
Turning to profitability. With regard to Google OpEx, the first quarter results once again reflect our ongoing commitment to investing for the long term. You can see that in R&D, where we continue to invest in technical talent for priority areas like cloud, search and machine learning.
In terms of sales and marketing, the pace of investment in Q1 reflected a timing shift in spend, and we expect these expenses to pick up in the second quarter. In Other Bets OpEx, we are still early in the life of these companies and do plan to continue to invest meaningfully for the long-term opportunity.
With respect to CapEx, the year-on-year decline reflects the purchase of a building in New York in the first quarter of 2018. As discussed on our call last quarter, while we anticipate that our full year CapEx investments will exceed those in 2018, the growth in investments should be at a meaningfully lower rate than in 2018. We continue to expect a sizable investment in both compute requirements to support long-term growth as well as in office facilities.
In conclusion, we feel confident about the opportunities ahead, and we continue to invest thoughtfully for the long term. I will now turn the call over to Sundar.",1657
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2019",2019-04-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3376.0,1714490.0,67305358.0,Presenter Speech,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Ruth. It's great to be here with you all. Q1 was a very busy quarter at Google, and it's only going to get busier. Later this week, we'll host YouTube's upfront event, Brandcast, followed by our annual developer conference, Google I/O, next week and our advertising summit, Google Marketing Live, later in the month. You'll hear a lot more from each of these teams throughout May, so I hope you can join us.
We've always been a company that's focused on the long term willing to make investments that will help our businesses and our customers' businesses succeed as technology continues to evolve. You saw this in the transition to mobile computing years ago, and we are seeing that today in the shift to AI. We feel very positive about the enormous opportunities ahead involving Search and Assistant, capturing new ad budgets, cloud computing, AI and other areas.
What gives us these opportunities is Google's position to help people, businesses and society in countless ways through our products. Today, I will start by talking about our core mission of making information universally accessible and useful. Then, I'll provide an update on our computing video and advertising platforms. And finally, I'll discuss our Hardware and Cloud efforts.
First, an update in our mission to make information accessible and useful is helping people every day. A big focus for us is building products that are designed to help people in their day-to-day lives. Our Duplex technology within Google Assistant can now help you easily book a table at your favorite restaurant on all Android and iOS devices in 44 U.S. states. Just tell the Assistant where you want to go and when, and it'll do the rest. We've also begun testing AR walking navigation in Google Maps, which uses augmented reality and your phone's camera to show you where you are relative to the surroundings as you're walking.
Just last week, we announced an improved job search experience in the U.S. that helps people easily discover quality remote jobs allowing them to work right from home. As part of our Google News initiative, we kicked off the Local Experiments Project working with local publishers to uncover new approaches to their business models and operations, so they can continue bringing great local content to their readers.
AI is now spurring a new era of computing, which is more predictive and more assistive. We are committed to doing deep research and working to advance this space in a responsible way. AI is deeply embedded in our products from Search to Photos to Google Home, and we are also expanding others' ability to build on our advancements.
Recently at TensorFlow's Annual Developer Summit, we announced TensorFlow 2.0, making it easier than ever to build and use ML through improvements like TensorFlow Privacy, which helps train models with differential privacy, meaning that users' data is better protected.
Now on to our computing, video on advertising platforms. There's tremendous momentum across the Android ecosystem and our other computing platforms as we head into Google I/O. In the first quarter, we released the beta of Android Q, which brings added privacy protections, new tools for developers to engage users and more. Android Go edition, an optimized version of Android tailored for smartphones with 1 gig or less, delivers a powerful fast and secure experience specifically optimized for entry-level smartphones. Today, roughly 70% of entry-level Android devices are now activating with Go like Samsung's J2 Core.
We are seeing great momentum in Android Auto as well. At the Chicago Auto Show, Toyota announced that it'll include Android Auto in upcoming vehicles starting in 2020. That means all of the top 10 carmakers now support Android Auto.
And in Google Play, first-time buyers grew by nearly 50% year-over-year. I'm very pleased with how these platforms are growing and creating amazing experiences for users, developers and partners. Our newest platform, Stadia, which revolutionizes the way gamers access and play their favorite games and brings together the best of Google's infrastructure and open ecosystem approach. With Stadia, you'll be able to play advanced AAA games on any type of screen instantly without ever needing to download the game or install updates. The reception from gamers in the industry has been incredible, and we look forward to sharing more when it launches later this year.
Next, our video platform, YouTube. YouTube's top priority is responsibility. As one example, earlier this year, YouTube announced changes that reduce recommendations of content that comes close to violating our guidelines or that misinforms in harmful ways. There are a lot more improvements which we will be rolling out in the next few weeks, and our work is ongoing.
We have also expanded the content offering, availability and the functionality on some of our newer YouTube experiences. YouTube TV is now available nationwide with many new networks and channels added in Q1. YouTube Music and YouTube Premium are now available in 43 countries, up from 5 markets at the start of 2018. In mid-March, we launched YouTube Music in India, one of YouTube's fastest growing markets. Since launch, the YouTube Music app has been downloaded more than 15 million times in the country.
YouTube's ad business for both brand and direct response campaigns continues to grow and support our creators. In Q1, we again saw how YouTube is the go-to destination for watching the Super Bowl ads before, during and after the big game. This year, viewership of Super Bowl ads on YouTube during the game rose by nearly 60%. More broadly, across our ads business, our advertising product team, led by Prabhakar, continues to build new products for marketers with more than 100 enhancements introduced every quarter. We do rigorous testing on each of these improvements to ensure that we are creating the best experience for users and advertisers. Our focus has always been on investing for the long term rather than managing for results quarter-to-quarter.
I feel really positive about the opportunities ahead and the innovations that we are bringing to marketers, many of which are powered by machine learning. Philipp and our business teams have done a great job helping advertisers take full advantage of these new capabilities. For instance, more than 70% of our advertisers are already using automated bid strategies in Google Ads, and these ML powered technologies help customers get better results for their investments.
In Q1, we began testing new shoppable ad units in Google Images, so brands can highlight multiple products available for sale in sponsored image results. You've also seen us make it easier for people to buy products and take action when shopping on Google Assistant and Search with a universal cart on mobile, desktop and Google Home devices. Since we launched these capabilities a year ago, the number of participating merchants has increased sevenfold.
Lastly, at the Game Developers Conference, we introduced a host of new advertising solutions for developers like App Campaigns for Engagement, which help developers reengage players with relevant ads across Google's properties.
Next, I'll give an update on our Hardware and Cloud efforts. First, Hardware. I'm very proud that in only a few short years, we have built a strong foundation in Hardware. For example, demand for our Google Home family of products remains strong, especially the Home Mini and Home Hub. The breadth and depth of our product lines across Pixel, Nest and Home is amazing, and you will see us continue to develop this incredible lineup. The team has also done a lot of work to scale our operations, and we'll continue to optimize our distribution, branding and points of presence.
We also announced a new campus and engineering hub in Taiwan largely to support our Hardware efforts. Not only are features like Night Sight and Pixel winning industry awards, but Net Promoter Scores tell us that many people who use our Hardware products truly love them, which is particularly important as we move into this new era of computing. We are still early in our Hardware journey, and when I look ahead at the portfolio that we have created across Pixel, Home and Nest, I feel really good about the range of products that we have.
And finally, our growing Cloud business. Thomas has really hit the ground running. Just a few weeks ago, I was on stage with him at our Cloud Next event, where we hosted a sold-out crowd of more than 30,000 attendees. As I said at Next, moving to the Cloud should be simple and seamless. I was excited to announce Anthos, which gives customers a very elegant solution to both hybrid Cloud and multicloud in a single technology stack.
The early feedback from analysts, customers and partners has been really great. We also announced innovations across many of our other products that enable developers to build and deploy AI, help enterprises to better secure their data, allow Android users to leverage their phones as a security key and much more. We are also deeply committed to becoming the most customer-centric cloud provider for enterprise customers and making it easier for companies to do business with us thanks to new contracting, pricing and more.
Today, 9 of the world's 10 largest media companies, 7 of the 10 largest retailers and more than half of the 10 largest companies in manufacturing, financial services, communications and software use Google Cloud. Some of the companies that we announced at Next included the American Cancer Society and McKesson in health care, media and entertainment companies like USA TODAY and Viacom, consumer packaged goods brands like Unilever, manufacturing and industrial companies like Samsung and UPS and public sector organizations like Australia Post.
Finally, to support our customers' growth, we also announced the addition of 2 new Cloud regions in Seoul and Salt Lake City, which we plan to open in 2020. These new Cloud regions will build on our current footprint of 19 Cloud regions and 58 data centers around the world.
20 years in and over 100,000 employees strong, I'm incredibly proud of the work that our teams at Google do every day. We have so many bright opportunities ahead, and seizing those opportunities starts with our investment in the communities where we operate around the world and right here at home. In the U.S., not only are we expanding our workforce across the country, but we are helping people in every state gain the digital skills they need to succeed in today's economy.
In fact, just 1 year after kicking off our collaboration with Goodwill, 0.25 million Americans have learned new digital skills and 27,000 have found a job. We also feel a deep responsibility to make sure that we -- that as we grow our business, we are doing it with minimal impact on the environment. Today, a Google data center uses 50% less energy than a typical data center while delivering 7x more computing power than we did 5 years ago.
Since 2017, we have matched 100% of the electricity consumption of our operations with purchases of renewable energy, and I'm proud that Google is the world's largest corporate buyer of renewable energy. I've never been more excited about Google and where we are headed. I want to thank every Googler around the world for joining us on that journey.
With that, I'll hand it back over to Ruth.",1893

29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2019",2019-04-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3376.0,1714490.0,67305361.0,Question,Eric Sheridan,,Analysts,6,"Maybe a couple of parts on the revenue performance in the quarter. Ruth, you'd called out potential volatility on the Q4 earnings call. Wanted to understand a little bit about what you were calling out in Q4 and how that might have manifested itself in Q1 on the product side of the equation, so we could just better understand how much of it was isolated to Q1 or it might be a headwind as we move through the year. And as you look at the individual performance of the ad divisions inside Sites, desktop, mobile search, YouTube, it seems like you were still calling out strength in mobile search and YouTube. So could it be desktop search where we actually saw some weakness in the quarter?",126
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2019",2019-04-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3376.0,1714490.0,67305362.0,Answer,Ruth Porat,,Executives,7,"Sure. Thanks, Eric. So I tried to step back and start at the highest level. Obviously, on a reported GAAP basis, revenue growth in Q1 reflects the FX headwind that we talked about in contrast to the tailwind last year. And as you know well, we don't report Sites revenues on a fixed FX basis, but the delta between fixed and floating growth rates at the Alphabet level is a good proxy for the effect on Sites revenue. Beyond that, I tried to draw out that the year-on-year growth rate in part reflects our strong 2018. And then more to your question, as we indicated last quarter, the other item is the timing of product changes in ads can impact year-on-year growth rates. And we make changes with a focus on the best interest of users and advertisers. 
Over the long term, we do not manage by quarter, so we are introducing enhancements only after product testing. And that was -- it's sort of the overarching color that I was trying to give you. And in terms of desktop, it was a modest contributor to revenue growth. It does remain an important form factor for certain more complex tasks such as planning vacations or assessing insurance options. And as we've talked about on prior calls, we continue to see the ongoing importance of desktop for many users and many tasks, notwithstanding the growing utility of mobile. So I led with the items that are really driving the growth, but that was a bit more color on desktop for you.",259
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2019",2019-04-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3376.0,1714490.0,67305363.0,Question and Answer Operator Message,Operator,,Operator,8,And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan.,10
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2019",2019-04-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3376.0,1714490.0,67305364.0,Question,Douglas Anmuth,,Analysts,9,"So 2 questions. Just following up on Eric's on the revenue growth. Ruth, can you just give us a little bit more detail on the paid click growth, the decel that we saw to 39% from the 50s and 60s last year. So that's just a comp issue or something more specific? And then just on the spending side, wanted to understand a little more just how you're thinking about spending relative to 3 months ago. I know you talked about both CapEx moderating and also headcount moderating 3 months ago. Just curious at least if headcount is still in that camp for your thinking, just given that it seems like there's a pretty big ramp expected under the new Cloud CEO.",122
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2019",2019-04-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3376.0,1714490.0,67305365.0,Answer,Ruth Porat,,Executives,10,"Okay. So starting with clicks and CPCs. As we've discussed on prior calls, the biggest driver affecting both CPCs and click trends is YouTube engagement ads with YouTube clicks representing the vast majority of total clicks. And so while YouTube clicks continued to grow at a substantial pace in the first quarter, the rate of YouTube click growth decelerated versus what was a strong Q1 last year, reflecting changes that we made in early 2018, which we believe are overall additive to the user and advertiser experience.
And then in terms of your 2 spending -- the investment questions. In terms of headcount, first, we do continue to expect the growth rate to moderate slightly in 2019 from the year-on-year growth in 2018. And as I indicated in opening comments, we are continuing to invest in technical talent for priority areas like Cloud, search and ML. And so Cloud has been and continues to be the primary area of headcount growth and as Thomas indicated as well and I think Sundar did as well.
In terms of CapEx, just to fill out the last part, I think, of your question, relative to my comments last quarter that we expect the full year 2019 growth rate for CapEx to moderate quite significantly versus the year-on-year growth in 2018, there's no change in our expectation for the year on that point either. The first quarter last year obviously included a sizable real estate acquisition in New York. But overall, we continue to invest meaningfully in our technical infrastructure given our outlook for compute requirements to support long-term growth. Technical infrastructure is the biggest driver of CapEx growth, but we do also continue to invest in office facilities. In fact, as we announced in the first quarter, we expect CapEx of over $13 billion in 2019 just in the U.S. in data center construction and offices with major expansions in 14 states. And more generally, while we're investing aggressively to support our outlook for compute requirements, we're also very focused on improving efficiency with our technical infrastructure. And you can see that through our innovations in things like custom server hardware and TPUs, which can be more cost effective especially for machine learning workloads.",371

You guys are obviously talking more and more about it. But when do you think you're going to be in a position to share revenue figures or even growth rates similar to what the others have been sharing for quite some time? And then, I guess, a couple follow-ups to that are what would you say the biggest competitive differentiators are of GCP. And what also -- what changes has Thomas implemented for 2019? What are any of the big changes he's focused on that maybe are different than what you were doing before?",101
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2019",2019-04-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3376.0,1714490.0,67305368.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,13,"Thanks, Heather. Good question. Overall, I would say I think you saw it -- saw the momentum coming out of Next. And I would say at a high level, the key differentiators, which we are focused and which we hear from customers too, the 5 key things are security and reliability, being really open about hybrid multi-cloud customers don't want to be locked into any 1 cloud provider. We want to be a platform for open source, and so we're really working well there in enabling options, AI, ML as a capability. And finally, as customers think about digital transformations, we bring all of Google's advances to bear to help them through the journey.
I think I would say, Thomas is really building upon a strong foundation, but we're really accelerating and scaling up go to market both internally and through our channel partners has been a huge focus. I'm incredibly excited that we just announced a couple of weeks ago that [ Robbins Linness ] joined us to head go-to-market. And just along with Thomas, both of them bring close to 3 decades of serving enterprise customers. And so that reflects the commitment we have.

We noticed that larger than expected slowdown in the properties TAC in the quarter, that includes cost of mobile search, while the other cost of revenues, which includes YouTube content costs, seem to maintain that expected growth rate despite what you said about more moderate turns in Hardware. So just wondering if that's a wise way to infer anything about the relative performance of mobile search revenue versus YouTube from those cost lines in the quarter. And then on Waymo, maybe for Sundar. We're hearing more and more about collaborations between ride-sharing networks and AV providers. So the idea of mixed fleets or part human, part AV as a means of potential deployment of AV technology, so can you just comment if that mixed fleet approach would be something that you think Waymo would consider versus its own full ride service network?",151

We've discussed this previous -- on previous calls. We have expected the year-on-year growth in the TAC rate would begin to slow starting in the second quarter last year. And you saw that through the balance of 2018. And this quarter, the constant TAC rate versus last year reflects ongoing growth in mobile, but it also benefited from growth in YouTube, where the associated content and costs are included in other cost of sales. And so that's the most important thing to point to. The other is --we've previously discussed is TAC as a percentage of revenues is also affected by a number of other factors such as changes in product mix, device mix, partner mix, et cetera. So I'd really point you to the first point there.
And then as it relates to Waymo, I guess a couple of things. We continue to be most focused on the ride-sharing business here. We're pleased with the expansion in the number of Waymo riders that we've added since the last quarter. But as we've talked about on prior calls, we do continue to pursue a number of other opportunities, long-haul trucking, we've talked about, logistics, deliveries, personal use vehicles, last mile solutions for cities and then probably more to your question, licensing our technology. And we did announce in March that we're making one of our 3D LiDAR sensors available to companies outside of the self-driving car service beginning with robotics and physical security, in other words, in -- for warehouse use or for farming. And our view is that, that can provide further operating leverage to our business. So we're actually looking at it in a number of different ways, but the primary focus continues to be on developing the ride-hailing business.",304

How are your conversations with some of the larger PC and console publishers going right now?

And so we are having conversations across the board, and I think people are definitely engaging in a very committed way, and they're investing in it. And so it's up to us to bring it all together and have a [ coupling ] service later this year, and that's what the team is, heads down, working on.

The first one, let's go back to the product changes. Ruth, any more color on sort of which products or regions are most impacted by these changes? And just so we can understand a little bit, can you just help us with the key user experience you're trying to solve for and sort of the message to your advertisers who may be spending -- who may be growing their spend less now, but why that's going to be positive for the long term? And then, Sundar, just go to your comments about YouTube. You mentioned more potential changes coming on YouTube in the next couple of weeks. Can you just talk to us about that a little bit?",121
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2019",2019-04-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3376.0,1714490.0,67305377.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,22,"Maybe I'll start with the YouTube comments. I talked about, in the area of content responsibility, we are definitely focused on making sure we are constantly improving how we are handling both in terms of reducing the content that shouldn't be there on the platform and then more importantly, making sure, when we recommend content, that we are recommending high-quality content as well as reducing harmful content or low-quality content being recommended. I think we had a set of launch, which we have rolled out, but I think there are more launches coming, which will constantly improve what you see in YouTube and continues to be the most important area of focus for them.
On the first question in terms of products, I think we are -- I presume when you say back to product changes, I think you're talking about the advertising experience. I think the main thing I would say is, I mean, we don't -- I think we have a long, long-term way of thinking about where we want to go and we have a disciplined framework by which we think and evolve our products. We don't necessarily look at it from a quarter-on-quarter basis, though we obviously have had consistent performances. We approach our work differently, and so you are going to have quarter-to-quarter variations once in a while. But we remain confident about the opportunities we see. And I'm looking ahead to that, and we are focused on that.",245

And of course, each of them -- each of those businesses have their own goals and targets. But we also hear -- continue to hear more about your teams working together, for example, a large cloud engagement leading to higher ad spending from an enterprise. Can you talk to us just a little bit about how you balance having your leaders grow their own businesses with also incentivizing them to work together? And then second and kind of completely differently, would love to just hear your updated views on data collection and use. I'm sure you've continued to have some dialogue with politicians and regulators. We've seen some reports on more potential changes in Chrome or within the advertising platform. Would love to hear how maybe your latest discussions are in view -- are informing both the near- and long-term view on policies with regards to data collection and use.",173

And I mean you're right. These are a couple of very busy months, and it's particularly busy leading up to I/O. And I would say in terms of how we work together, first of all, as a company, I think we take our OKR process extraordinarily serious in a very committed way. And we do write cross-company OKRs, and it really reinforces ways by which different groups can work together. And we measure them and we will hold people accountable to that. That's an important part of how we get at businesses, both while they focus on their product areas, their business, they need to work together. Second, as a leadership attribute, it's something that's really important to me. And so it's something that the leaders across the table share that goal, and I think it's largely cultural as well.
Vis-à-vis, privacy, and it's actually one of our most important areas. As a company, we've always tried to stay a step ahead. User expectations around privacy are constantly evolving, and we stretch ourselves to meet them. And as part of that through this year, we are continuing to do a lot of work just with the overall goal of making sure privacy works for everyone and it's actually simple to use. And as part of that, we'll have more changes through the course of this year, be it Chrome. Chrome is super committed to making sure it's best in class in privacy and security, and we always put user experience first and follow through.
Through all these changes, we need to be mindful of the content ecosystem and the publisher ecosystem. Advertising continues to be an important way by which they create value and they see value. And so we are very thoughtful about how we approach our work.
And there's been a lot of interest across the board. I think we early on engaged with GDPR, they are big supporters of it in terms of being constructive and working early to get ready. I think it's important U.S. supports -- has a clear framework on a federal basis for privacy regulation, and it's something we feel is timely as well. And so we have called for it and happy to be thought leaders as well as engage where needed.",381

First one, follow-up on the revenue growth dynamics, specifically the sequential growth trend. I wonder if we should assume now that there's greater seasonality in core search just given the increasing mix of shopping and product ad formats. And Sundar, question on AI and machine learning. Since clearly this remains an area of significant strength for the company, I'm wondering what stage of development you characterize these stools at being today? And whether we should expect the overall pace of advancement from AI to accelerate in terms of products and services?",95

There are a few patterns, which are consistent year-on-year, but there are always one-off events, which happen. So there is in-built variation, so, which we work through every quarter, and so I think that's a natural part of what we do. There's definitely seasonality in businesses like Hardware, and that you are right. Commercial behavior has seasonality associated with it. But we do deal a lot with one-off events as well and -- but we always work our way through it.
On machine learning, I do think we are at very early days. I'm excited that, over the last 3 years, taking an AI-first approach, we've really incorporated machine learning core -- in a core way across our product to benefit our users. And that's true for advertising as well. I think we are in early stages of making it easier for businesses to understand what they're looking for and us taking care of more and more work, and we are doing it across the board.

First, Ruth, on mobile search, can you let us know how that did versus your expectations? I know there's a lot of noise from YouTube in that line. But how's mobile search doing? And what are the key drivers now for mobile search? Is it queries? Is it driving higher click-through rates, ad format changes? What are the drivers as you think about the next couple years? And then, Sundar, could you just -- on the Hardware business, I think there are some concerns that it's just not getting off to really strong trajectory, some comparisons to Microsoft 10 years ago. Really just help us understand how that Hardware business is important to Google and how you're thinking about it long term.",130

And we're focused on digital playing a bigger role in that and tapping into other marketing budgets by offering an attractive ROI.
And then apart from people spending more time on digital content, to your question, we know that better measurement, better ad delivery, better user experiences all help grow the pie for everyone in the ecosystem. And then more broadly within YouTube, as we talked about last quarter, we do continue to see significant growth in direct response, and we remain excited about the upside potential there. Brand advertising is still the largest part of the business. It's growing at a strong pace, but we called out direct response given what we see as the upside potential.",204

We really see this incredibly important to drive the future of computing forward and to make sure our services are presented to users in a -- in the way that we intended them to be. And so overall, we view this as a hugely important opportunity.
When we look at the business even for -- given we are more recent to it, we already -- if you take areas like Google Home and Assistant product, we are doing really well. We see strong momentum. I think we are market leaders in the category and especially when you take a look at it on a global basis. And so for -- computing will continue to evolve even beyond phones. And so we want to make sure we are in there, and we are very committed to it for the long term.
Our phones, definitely across as an industry, I think they are working through a phase where there is definite year-on-year headwinds. But I do think -- especially the ecosystem is constantly pushing it forward. I continue to be excited about the innovation speed, 5G coming or the early look into foldable phones, which Android plays a big part in driving. So I do think there is a lot more to come, and we are focused on it. And I -- when I look at the product quality, how it's improving, user feedback in terms of Net Promoter Scores and the range of lineup that we are working and how our products are getting better year-on-year, I remain very excited.",282

So why did Europe and U.S. -- Europe ex FX and U.S. growth rates drop off much more than Asia and then other? Any comment on why the decel was more pronounced in Western markets? And then stepping back, we've seen pretty solid growth rates from the digital ad sector broadly in the first quarter, and you flagged a lot of this back in February, so clearly, this isn't a surprise to you. But how much of the deceleration in Sites ex FX was from maybe advertiser demand issues in these markets versus proactive changes that you may have made on your end to the product?",126

The -- I think the -- you had the U.S. -- U.S. and Europe had about the same delta year-on-year. Other Americas was more pronounced. That was really more of the impact of Hardware. And then APAC, I think maybe is what was guiding some of your question, continues to be a very strong performer and continue to deliver in the 30% plus or I think 31% on a fixed FX basis. We're well positioned, growth throughout the region.

I would say more broadly overall in terms of go to market, our long-term investment thesis remains unchanged. We're excited about the opportunities ahead. We do continue to invest to ensure we remain well positioned for the long term. That applies across the businesses. And so there wasn't a change that anything other than the comments that I had made. I think if I could just maybe expand on the investing pace, as we're looking at the pace of investing and supporting growth around the globe, what we're really looking at is what's needed to support long-term revenue and earnings growth. The operating margin did benefit in -- as I noted in my opening comments that -- from the fact that Q1 marketing expenses growth moderated, but that was a timing issue.

Q2 was an exciting quarter at Google. We made several big announcements at I/O, YouTube's Brandcast and Google Marketing Live. They're all part of our broader vision to build a more helpful Google for everyone. 
When we say everyone, we mean users, developers, creators, partners, advertisers and all the customers of our growing cloud business and the communities we call home. From the beginning, Google's mission has been to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. Over the years, we have evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that helps you get things done. Today, I'll share how we are approaching this work.  
Building a more helpful Google starts with advancing our core information mission. In Q2, we have made a number of improvements to our founding product, Search. We redesigned our mobile search page and brought our popular full coverage feature to Search to better organize news results. We are also integrating augmented reality into Search. So if, say, you're searching for new shoes online, you can view the shoes in 3D or even superimpose them onto your wardrobe to see if they match.
Thanks to advancements in AI, we are making significant improvements to the Google Assistant. The next-generation Assistant can process requests up to 10x faster, making it easier to multitask, compose e-mails and even work offline. With features like Duplex on the Web, the Assistant will soon be able to help users book rental cars and buy movie tickets. 
If you are searching for the fastest way home, Google Maps will now tell you when your bus is delayed or how packed your next train will be. We have rolled this out to people in 200 cities worldwide. 
Google Maps can also help people stay safe in times of crisis. Last month, we added more visual information and a new navigation warning system to help you understand where a natural disaster is and better anticipate where it may be headed. 
Building a more helpful Google for everyone means that everyone should be able to access and enjoy our products. That's why we are applying the latest advances in AI to dramatically improve experiences for people with disabilities. One example of this is captions, which make content more accessible to the almost 500 million people in the world who are deaf or hard of hearing. In Android Q, we can now add automatic live captions to any media playing on your phone such as videos, podcasts and voicemails. 
We are also developing technology for the next billion users coming online in places like India, Brazil and Indonesia. Yesterday, we introduced the Gallery Go app. It's a way for people living in low connectivity areas to manage their photos and videos while off-line. Google Photos continues to be one of our most popular and beloved products now with over 1 billion monthly users, and we are excited by the potential of Gallery Go to bring these benefits to the next billion users. 
Building for everyone also means ensuring that privacy is equally available to everyone. In Q2, we announced privacy improvements to give users clear choices and more control around their data. We're making privacy controls more easily accessible, expanding our popular Incognito Mode to maps and adding new auto delete controls. And we continue to challenge the notion that products need more data to be more helpful. For example, we invented a new technique called Federated Learning that allows us to train AI models and make products smarter without raw data leaving your device.
To make products work even harder for you, we have continued to invest in our hardware business, bringing together the best of Google's hardware, software and AI. At I/O, we introduced some new additions to our hardware lineup, including Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL. By taking advantage of our leading software capabilities, we can offer users a premium phone experience at a much lower price point. 
With the launch of Pixel 3a in May, overall Pixel unit sales in Q2 grew more than 2x year-over-year. In addition to Verizon and the Google Store, we successfully expanded our distribution to T-Mobile, Sprint, U.S. Cellular, Spectrum Mobile and additional partners, which has greatly diversified our sales footprint in the U.S. Finally, we're also pleased that the Pixel 3a launch was met with our highest Net Promoter Score ratings to date. 
We are also doubling down on creating a helpful Home, bringing all of our Home products together under the Nest brand. In Q2, we launched the Nest Hub in 12 additional countries. Demand across our helpful Home products continues to increase as we expand to new markets. Our new Google Nest Hub Max, a voice-activated smart display powered by the Google Assistant, will be available later this summer. Stay tuned for even more on hardware this fall.
Beyond hardware, we continue to develop the open platforms and ecosystems that push computing forward such as Android, Google Play and Chrome. At I/O, we showed some exciting improvements to Android Q. It's the first operating system to support 5G, includes support for foldable phones and has nearly 50 updates focused on security and privacy, including more transparency and control over the location data you share with the apps. 
And we continue to feel the excitement from users, developers and publishers following the announcement of our new gaming platform, Stadia. We recently announced pricing, availability and over 30 games coming to Stadia in time for the consumer launch in November. 
Another area where we are investing deeply is YouTube. Every day, users come to YouTube to learn new things. As a result, YouTube has become one of the world's most accessible educational platforms. We see strong growth in a number of areas. Creators continue to build engaged fan bases on YouTube. Channels with more than 1 million subscribers grew by 75% year-over-year. Thousands of channels have doubled their total monthly revenue by using new monetization products like Super Chat, Channel Memberships and Merch. And we are building momentum with our subscription services, YouTube Music and YouTube Premium, now available in over 60 countries, up from 5 markets at the start of 2018. 
At Brandcast, we introduced 2 important changes that help advertisers reach new audiences with premium content. First, new YouTube Original series, movies and live events will soon be made available for free supported by ads. Second, YouTube TV, with its 70-plus channels, will be accessible as a stand-alone lineup in Google Preferred. 
As we continue to invest in the platform, responsibility remains our top priority. One significant change we made in Q2 was to update our hate speech policy, and we continue to be vigilant about removing harmful content quickly and at scale. In the first quarter alone, we removed more than 8 million videos that violated our community guidelines. The vast majority of those videos were flagged by machines and removed before getting a single view. We are also working to raise up high-quality content and support our creators, who are our next generation media businesses. These are a few of the many investments we have made to protect the community. The work is ongoing and we are committed to it.
Moving from YouTube to broader advertising platforms. At Google Marketing Live, we introduced new ad formats such as discovery ads, which offer a new visually rich mobile-first ad experience across Google properties. We also announced a unified shopping experience and universal shopping cart, all of which help to make Google more shoppable. We also announced Google Travel, a new centralized travel destination, where people can plan and organize all aspects of their next trip all in one place, from booking flights and accommodations to planning activities.
Now on to our Cloud business. Q2 was another strong quarter for Google Cloud, which reached an annual revenue run rate of over $8 billion and continues to grow at a significant pace. Customers are choosing Google Cloud for a variety of reasons. Reliability and uptime are critical. Retailers like Lowe's are leveraging the cloud as one of the important tools to transform their customer experience and supply chain. 
Customers need flexibility to move to cloud in their own way. Anthos, announced earlier this year, provides advanced security and open architecture to support multi- and hybrid cloud environments. That's important to many companies, including financial services customers like HSBC and new clients such as KeyBanc.
Scalable data management and analytics solutions are another strength of Google Cloud. Vodafone is using cloud to drive real-time customer and network analytics; and BrightInsight, a leading health care platform for connected devices and drugs, uses our solutions to improve security and compliance.
Finally, Google Cloud's AI and ML solutions are also helping health care organizations like Sanofi accelerate drug discovery and [ Ascension ] improve the health care experience and outcomes. We continue to build our world-class cloud team to help support our customers and expand the business and are looking to triple our sales force over the next few years.
Finally, to support our rapidly growing cloud customer base and all of Google services globally, we broke ground on 3 data centers and launched our new Osaka cloud region, the seventh in the Asia Pacific. We also announced plans for a new cloud region in Las Vegas, our seventh in the United States. 
Lastly, beyond investments in products, we are investing significantly in the communities where we operate. In Europe, we recently announced EUR 1 billion data center investment in the Netherlands as well as the opening of our Google Safety Engineering Center in Munich, Germany. And right here at home, we announced a $1 billion investment in housing across the Bay Area to help address the chronic shortage of affordable housing. 
Earlier this week, we invested $50 million in Housing Trust Silicon Valley's TECH Fund, which furthers our goal to help communities succeed over the long term and expands access to housing for those who need it most.
Finally, I'm excited that Google is an official supporter of the Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020. It's particularly special since that's where we opened our first international office back in 2001. Ahead of the games, we are working with the City of Tokyo to ensure Japanese businesses can better serve new customers and help visitors make the most of their time there using products like Search, Maps and Translate.
At Google, we feel incredibly privileged to have the opportunity to help so many people every day in moments big and small. There are many reasons to be optimistic about the direction technology is taking from the applications of AI to address disease to the potential of quantum computing to deepen our understanding of the world. 
I want to thank Googlers around the world for another great quarter. With that, I will hand it over to Ruth.",1817
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2019",2019-07-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3511.0,1827716.0,71468983.0,Presenter Speech,Ruth Porat,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Sundar. In the second quarter, total revenues of $38.9 billion were up 19% year-on-year and up 22% in constant currency. Once again, our results were driven by ongoing strength in mobile search in particular as well as YouTube and Cloud. I will begin with a review of results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google, followed by Other Bets and we'll include with our outlook. We will then take your questions.
Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Our total revenues of $38.9 billion reflect an acceleration in both reported and constant currency revenue growth across all regions compared with the first quarter. Details of our results by geographic region are available in our earnings press release.
Turning to profitability. On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I will discuss in the Google segment, was $17.3 billion, up 25% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $10.1 billion, up 35% year-over-year primarily driven by Google-related expenses. 
The biggest contributor was costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, followed by content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube and mostly for our advertising-supported content, but also for our newer subscription businesses, YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which have higher CAC as a percentage of their revenues. This line was also impacted by growth in hardware costs associated with the launch of our line of mid-tier Pixel 3a smartphones.
Operating expenses were $12.5 billion with headcount growth as the largest driver across each of R&D, sales and marketing and G&A. The biggest increase once again was in R&D expenses reflecting our focus on product innovation. Growth in sales and marketing expenses also reflects an increase in advertising and promotional expense primarily for the launch of our Pixel 3a lineup.
Stock-based compensation totaled $2.8 billion. Headcount was up 4,187 from last quarter. And consistent with prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were again in cloud for both technical and sales roles.
Operating income was $9.2 billion, up 13% year-over-year excluding the impact of the EC fine in the second quarter of last year for an operating margin of 24%. Other income and expense was $3 billion reflecting sizable gains, which are primarily unrealized, from investments made by CapitalG, GV and more broadly at Alphabet. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Net income was $9.9 billion and earnings per diluted share were $14.21. 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $6.1 billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $12.6 billion with free cash flow of $6.5 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $121 billion.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google segment. Revenues were 38.9 -- $38.8 billion, up 19% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenues were $27.3 billion in the quarter, up 18% year-over-year. In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by mobile search with a strong contribution from YouTube followed by desktop search.
Network revenues were $5.3 billion, up 9% year-on-year, continuing to reflect the performance of the primary drivers of growth within network, namely Google Ad Manager followed by AdMob. 
Other revenues for Google were $6.2 billion, up 40% year-over-year, fueled by Cloud, with an ongoing strong contribution from Play. Within Cloud, growth in GCP was once again the primary driver of performance with strong customer demand for our compute and data analytics products. G Suite continues to be a valued set of productivity and work transformation apps with results benefiting from both new pricing and seat growth. Play's results were driven by strong growth in a number of active buyers.
Hardware benefited from the successful launch of our Pixel 3a smartphones. We provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $7.2 billion or 22% of total advertising revenues and up 13% year-over-year. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was down year-over-year reflecting primarily a favorable revenue mix shift from network to Sites. The Sites TAC rate increased year-over-year primarily due to the impact of the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC, offset by the growth in TAC-free Sites revenues primarily from YouTube. 
In Q2, the network TAC rate declined year-on-year primarily due to a favorable product mix shift. Operating income was $10.4 billion, up 16% versus last year and the operating margin was 26.8%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $6.9 billion reflecting investments in office facilities and data centers followed by servers.
Let me now turn to and talk about Other Bets. Revenues were $162 million primarily generated by Fiber and Verily with an operating loss of $989 million. 
I'll note a couple of key recent accomplishments. Waymo now has over 1,000 active riders participating in Waymo One and has reached 10 billion miles driven in simulation. Waymo also announced that it has entered into an exclusive partnership with Renault and Nissan to explore driverless mobility services for passengers and deliveries in France and Japan. 
Loon was once again able to step in and provide connectivity in the aftermath of a natural disaster after the recent earthquake in Peru. This follows previous deployments of Loon after hurricanes in Puerto Rico and floods in Peru.
Let me now conclude with some comments about our longer-term outlook. Based on the strength of the U.S. dollar to date relative to the third quarter of last year, we expect continued FX headwinds again in the third quarter. As a reminder, FX headwinds affect both revenues and operating income given the majority of our expenses are in the U.S. Turning to revenues. We are pleased with the ongoing momentum in our revenue growth, especially on a base of nearly $150 billion in revenues over the last 12 months. 
With respect to Sites revenues. The strength in the second quarter again reflects our ongoing innovation in part from the benefits of applying machine learning. We remain confident about the ongoing opportunity set.
And within other revenues, once again, Cloud was the largest driver within other revenues and the third largest driver of revenue growth for Alphabet overall. In fact, in the second quarter of 2019, as Sundar mentioned, the annual run rate for Cloud revenues was over $8 billion and Cloud continues to deliver significant growth. 
In terms of our hardware business, we were pleased with the reception of the Pixel 3a lineup of mid-tier smartphones in the second quarter and look forward to the fourth quarter launch of our newest devices, some of which we showcased at I/O.
Turning to profitability. With regard to Google operating expenses, the second quarter results once again reflect our ongoing commitment to investing for the long term. At this point, we expect that our 2019 headcount growth rate will be closer to the 2018 rate, in other words, slightly higher than we originally forecast for a couple of reasons. Strategically, we are increasing our hiring in Cloud and are incorporating the impact of the Looker acquisition, which we expect to close before the end of this year. And operationally, we're taking steps to optimize workforce deployment by moving certain customer support functions in-house, which is both OpEx-neutral and enhances operational effectiveness. As a reminder, headcount additions tend to be seasonally higher in Q3 because that is when we bring on new graduates.
In terms of sales and marketing, consistent with prior years, we expect sales and marketing to be more heavily weighted to the back half of the year to support the holiday season. In Other Bets, we continue to invest meaningfully for the long-term opportunity we see.
Turning to CapEx and capital allocation. To give you more insight into our investment and capital expenditures, I will discuss the 2 major components of Google CapEx separately. 
First, the majority of our Google CapEx is what we refer to as technical infrastructure, which consists of our investments for compute, storage and networking requirements and includes data center land and construction, servers and network equipment. 
The second category of CapEx is for our office facilities, including acquisitions, ground-up development projects and related building improvements. In the last couple of years within Google CapEx, on average, approximately 70% was for technical infrastructure and 30% was for office facilities. Both the split between the 2 components and year-on-year growth rates can vary significantly from quarter to quarter due primarily to the timing of sizable purchases of office facilities.
For example, in Q1, technical infrastructure was about 80% of Google CapEx, whereas in Q2, it accounts for about 60% due to the purchases of office facilities we made in the quarter. As we discussed on the fourth quarter call, we believe there are 2 important factors when considering our pace of CapEx investing. 
First, we expect the overall growth rate will moderate quite significantly for the full year 2019 versus 2018. Second, in terms of the mix within technical infrastructure, we expect to see more of an uptick in 2019 in data center investments relative to servers in contrast to the ranking in 2018.
Growth in technical infrastructure is designed to support in particular our efforts in machine learning across our businesses as well as to support growth in Cloud, Search and YouTube. 
With respect to capital allocation. Our primary use of capital continues to be to support organic growth in our businesses followed by retaining flexibility for acquisitions and investments. We complement these growth drivers with a return of capital. As we indicated in our press release today, our Board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $25 billion of our Class C capital stock. 
In conclusion, we are confident about the opportunities ahead and continue to invest thoughtfully for the long term. We will now take your questions.",1702

I think investors will find that really helpful. 
Sundar, maybe for you. One bigger picture question. A lot of innovation on the product side in the early part of this year. Now those products are going to start getting rolled out in the back part of this year and into 2020. Can you give us a little bit of additional color on what's some of the key investments you're making, some of the key themes you're trying to drive after in terms of pushing the organization to collaborate on product launches and leveraging the strength within Google? 
And then the second part of the question would be as you lower friction for consumers on the product side, what are you hearing from advertisers on the monetization side about how those product might resonate on the monetization piece?",149
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2019",2019-07-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3511.0,1827716.0,71468986.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,6,"Thanks, Eric. On -- in terms of the key investments, we still continue. We have been focused on our investments in AI. So that continues to be kind of a foundational investment we are making across the board, including getting a lot of our engineers trained on AI techniques, et cetera, across the board. So it's an important area we are focused on. And making sure digging deeper to push our products to be more helpful is the main theme by which we are evaluating everything we do. 
Beyond that, be it the focus on Cloud has been a big part of it, continuing to scale up YouTube, including being focused on content responsibility. These are all some of the key things we are doing. And of course, deep focus on Search and Assistant being a core part of everything we do. 
In terms of the work we are doing on consumers and the impact it has on monetization, and I do think they go hand in hand. As we are making the experience better for customers, including on products like Discover, so just getting information to them more seamlessly when they need it, I think they all tend to have a commercial aspect at the right intent when users are interested in it. So we've always seen them go hand to hand. And so taking a long-term view, I think it will resonate on the monetization side as well.",240

I'll just comment a bit on the impact from Google Marketing Live that Sundar referenced at the outset. I think what's notable here is that every year at GML, we announce new changes to products and features, and most ads product launches are introduced in phases as advertisers initially experiment with new formats. And so as a result, the new products that were announced at GML typically are adopted over time. And so I just wanted to add in here because while we're excited about the new ads products we announced at GML last quarter, given they offer great new user experiences across new services, we don't view this year's slate of launches differently from introductions made in previous years.",142

It seemed certainly in the previous quarter to skew more to the Google Search side than YouTube. I was just hoping you could provide a little more clarity on maybe how the product changes that you've talked about in the past played out across 1Q and 2Q. 
And then just, Sundar, on user privacy and control over data. That was certainly a key theme across the multiple events in 2Q. Can you just talk about how you balance those initiatives as you're rolling out products going forward?",119

The strength that we've talked about here this quarter reflects the same underlying trends that we discussed previously. And I tried to really call that out in opening comments. And part is the benefit from applying machine learning to both the user and advertiser experience. And it really just -- I'm echoing a lot of what we've said in prior quarters, last quarters. Well, we remain very positive about the opportunity set. We introduce product changes only after extensive testing, which means there can be some variability in quarterly growth rates, as you've seen. But we are very positive about the opportunity set. 
And overall, as it relates to both Search and YouTube strength, just to add on YouTube, revenue growth for YouTube was strong in the first quarter. In fact, we called it out as the second largest driver of revenue growth across Alphabet. And in the second quarter, YouTube was again the second largest contributor of revenue growth. And we're really, really pleased with the ongoing momentum that we're seeing here.",182

So going forward, I think you'll continue to see us focus on it. It's one of the most important areas we are working on. But I think with AI, we are excited that we can give better experiences for users with less data over time. And those are the kind of directions we are pushing.
We are also -- we'll -- you'll see us continue to work hard to simplify user understanding of how their data is used and giving them better controls and making it more easy for them to manage and making sure more users actually exercise those controls. So those are all our goals, and we'll continue focusing on that as we move forward.",151

Just wondering if we can get some clarifications there. Does this include GCP as well as G Suite? And further, is this apples-to-apples to, I guess, the $1 billion that you -- I think Sundar talked about? I think that was during the fourth quarter of '17.

I wanted to ask, Sundar, how you've seen your go-to-market and partnership strategies change under Thomas? It does seem as if Google has become the more friendly cloud company, if you will, from a -- when you think about partnering with other software companies. And I'm wondering if there's any tangible benefits you can point to because of this, whether it's in win rates or partner momentum or anything else that you can call out. 
And then I also wanted to ask, you obviously made the acquisition of Looker recently. How are you thinking about organic versus inorganic product development? And I'm just wondering, has the thought process there changed with Thomas running the business now?",137

I appreciate it. Definitely, go-to-market, Thomas, has been heavily focused on it mainly with the realization that we are very competitive when we are there in the mix and so focusing on how we can scale up and really build a customer-facing organization. So we are investing heavily, be it in sales, service, partner and operational teams. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, we are looking to triple the size of our sales force over the next few years, and we are doing it aggressively in major markets around the world.
Some specifics. We did launch our new partner program, Partner Advantage. The SAP relationship has been super important to us. And so we've really focused on that, helping many customers. McKesson, Carrefour, Home Depot, Cardinal Health are some examples of that. 
And a big part of it has been really expanding our customer-facing bench. Several new senior executive hires in addition to our new global Head of Sales. We recently added a 25-year customer experience veteran to build out our customer support.
So I think you're going to see that focus of being -- serving customers. We have done it in our other areas. We are used to building ecosystems. If you look at an ecosystem like Android, this is what we do. And so that's going to be a focus for us. 
In terms of the second question about organic versus inorganic. I think we are clearly focused on the areas where we are differentiated. Data and business analytics was a key -- data management and analytics is a key area for us. And as part of that, we looked at gaps we have, which would help us complete the solution offering we have there for customers. And that's what drove the Looker acquisition. So we'll be customer-focused. And to the extent we see gaps there, gaps anywhere, we'll obviously look at doing it in-house versus whether there's an attractive opportunity outside, and take it on a case-by-case basis. But that's where it will come from.",342

First, Ruth, just any color on that $25 billion share repurchase authorization, why $25 billion, not $20 billion, not $30 billion? Any color there?
And then when you think about the ad business, we've seen this nice acceleration in Q2, but that's kind of back to norm. There's still this question about what happened in Q1. Was there something that happened in Q1 that you needed to correct in Q2? Is it just the normal rhythms of the Search and YouTube and advertising businesses? So I find Q1 still a little bit of a question mark. Q2 seems like very much the norm over the last several years. So any color on what could have transpired in Q1 and did that require a fix in Q2?",129

I tried to comment on that last quarter and reiterated again this quarter. We are pleased with the ongoing momentum in the business. And the key point that I'll just reiterate is that as much as there is a lot of innovation going on in the business, and we've talked about that, we introduce product changes only after extensive testing, and that means there can be variability in quarterly growth rates, as you've seen. And so we're pleased with the strength of the business. The team is extremely focused on ensuring we're delivering for users and advertisers. 
And as we're looking out, we talked in the past, we have introduced over 100 enhancements to the user set every quarter and no one change drives results. And as we discussed last quarter, there can be timing variability, and our view is let's ensure that we stay focused on the right things for the long term and the quality that we can deliver.
So there's really not much more to add there. And then on the capital return, I guess, the main point is we went back to the -- we're staying with the same capital allocation framework we've talked with you about before. The primary thing is we remain focused on investing for long-term growth and the primary use of capital really is to support that growth. And then the second use is really to support acquisitions and investments as we've already been talking about.
And given the -- our outlook on cash, our view was that it was appropriate to step in here again. We've increased our program 4x since we began the program in 2015 and pleased to have the opportunity to announce another increase here today, the $25 billion. And I think the main point is we view the repurchase program as an effective use of capital.",316

Ruth, your color on YouTube was really helpful on it being the second largest driver this quarter and last quarter. I guess with that as a backdrop, with the overall acceleration, can you just give us a couple of examples of what types of products or advertiser segments or regions resonated particularly well on YouTube this quarter versus last quarter? 
And then sort of a question for Sundar or Ruth. There has been a decent amount in the press about children's safety on YouTube. And so I guess I'd be curious to hear for advertisers and parents on the call, what steps have you taken to really make sure that YouTube is safe for kids? And what are sort of the biggest areas you're focused on to ensure it stays that way?",138
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2019",2019-07-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3511.0,1827716.0,71469003.0,Answer,Ruth Porat,,Executives,23,"So in terms of YouTube growth, just maybe to add a bit more there given your question. I already noted that YouTube revenue growth was strong in the first quarter and again strong here in the second quarter. 
To clarify, the changes in early 2018 that I referenced on the call last quarter regarding Sites click and CPC growth were not related to policy enforcement actions at YouTube. They had a negligible impact on YouTube revenues, just to be really clear. The revenue growth was strong last quarter. And so the click and CPC growth are unrelated to actions on policy enforcement.
And in terms of our ongoing efforts to protect the YouTube ecosystem, we do remain focused on taking the right steps in line with our goals regardless of the impact on revenues. But an important point is that our removal of content that violates our policies have virtually no impact on YouTube revenues. I just wanted to make sure that was clear. So consistent growth here.
Going into your -- the first part of your question. Where is that growth? Again, I'm going to reiterate what we've talked about on prior calls that we continue to see substantial growth in direct response. So brand advertising is still the largest part of the business. It's growing at a strong pace. But really, I would reiterate what we said previously that we continue to see substantial growth in direct response.",240

As part of our content responsibility work, it's one of the most important areas we focus on. You will see us -- this is why we have put a lot of effort into developing YouTube Kids. And it's a product you're going to see us focus more and continue to evolve, add more curated content there and make sure it's safe for kids and gives parents peace of mind. Also ensuring that the content responsibility work applies to family-oriented content on the main YouTube app as well.
So all the work we are doing, be it the work we are doing to just remove bad content, raise up authoritative content, higher-quality content and reducing the spread of harming content, all applies everywhere and we're really focused on it. Rewarding trusted creators is a big way we can help -- ensuring creators who produce content which is great for children, rewarding them, et cetera, are also important goals for us.",167

The first one here is based on a couple of comments you reminded us in your prepared remarks about YouTube, which was the inclusion of Originals and YouTube TV in the Google Preferred inventory. You've given us a little bit of color on direct response growth at YouTube over the last little while. Can we assume that those 2 additions were a bit of a boost to the brand advertising side of the business as that's more inventory available for that sort of high-quality type of brand orientation that TV advertisers are looking for? 
And then just second, coming back to Google Marketing Live, notwithstanding your comments, Ruth, that it takes some time for products to be adopted. Are there maybe 1 or 2 out of all of those announcements there that you would highlight as being potentially particularly material over the longer term?",157
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2019",2019-07-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3511.0,1827716.0,71469007.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,27,"On the first stuff in terms of YouTube for brand, I would say it's more secular across the platform promoting higher-quality content. Our work on brand safety, content responsibility adds up to it. Also, creators just generating better content. I think all have played a part. And as I would say, it's more crosscutting. 
On the second thing, on GML, in terms of things we were excited about. To me, be it discovery ads and gallery ads, I mean, they're both pushing us towards mobile-first, visually rich, immersive ad formats, which also offers a really great user experience. So I think I'm excited about changes like that, and I think they have the potential.
There is advertiser excitement. But as Ruth mentioned, it's early days. Anything we roll out now takes time to play out, but we definitely see excitement there.",141

I think earlier, Ruth had mentioned the importance of machine learning for driving growth in the quarter and I'm sure in many recent quarters. I believe many have kind of a hard time understanding exactly what that means. I was hoping you might provide a couple of specific examples of how the company is leveraging machine learning recently to help drive growth and improvements for both users and advertisers. And then, secondly, for Ruth, in terms of the Sites TAC. I know there are a lot of variables that go in the changes in Sites TAC. But when you look at the puts and takes, how do you see that kind of trending over the next year or 2?",124

Generally, using machine learning to simplify things for advertisers and make campaigns easier and give them better insights is where we see a lot of benefit on the ad side. So for example, processing complex datasets and giving back sophisticated, real-time insights really helps make a difference. And also, on the front end, for marketers, helping them find the right creator for every moment, helping them manage bidding in real time. And so every step in the consumer journey, I think machine learning is just making things more efficient, more easier to use and driving productivity for them. So that's what plays out through our systems.",125

First off, as you embrace more commerce and payments on the platform, broadly speaking, along with the new ad formats you've talked about, can you also talk about what role take rates might play in terms of future initiatives in revenue growth? And then secondly, on Assistant and Duplex, in terms of near-term search innovation, I wonder if you could characterize how important that is in terms of the momentum you're seeing and longer term how this might impact platform monetization.",87

There's a lot of discovery that happens across Google's properties and -- including Search and YouTube. And so anything we can do to make sure users have a better experience when they are interested in transacting will have a big role. So there's a lot more work underway to make sure payments work better. Sign in works better. Payments works better. And all of that, I think, will be -- over the long term will be drivers, drivers because it improves the overall user experience, especially for commercial queries.
In terms of Assistant and Duplex, I mean for us, Assistant is where we can clearly see we can really push our goal of being more helpful to users, helping them get things done, including things that matter in the real world. And so that's what we are focused on. And if we get that right, just like with Search, there are many things which users want to get done which do have commercial intent to them. And I think that's the value-creation opportunity as well. But we are focused on making sure the user experience constantly gets better, and we are investing to get there.",205

Just wondering how you think about a more intense regulatory environment, getting a lot of questions. I'm wondering if you think about that really affecting Google operations. And then, Ruth, definitely nice acceleration across the board. Of course, Europe accelerated as well. When you think about GDPR implementation last year and you're lapping that, is that helping Europe at all? Or was there really no impact from GDPR?",81

Today, we do operate under a lot of regulation, be it on privacy, be it on competition, be it on copyright, intellectual property, et cetera. And even in the U.S., we have engaged in the process before. To the extent we have to answer questions, we will do so constructively. And to the extent there are concerns, we'll address them as well.

Ruth, the Google segment operating profit was up 16%. That's the highest growth rate in about 2 years. So I guess how should we think about the cadence of that relative to your comments about the headcount growth and the Looker acquisition looking forward? 
And then, Sundar, at I/O, you mentioned that the active Android installed base is now over 2.5 billion. That's up about 10% year-on-year, and a lot of that is coming from emerging markets. So I guess just big picture, how do we think about the growth rates that you can sustain in mobile search revenue relative to that 10% active Android growth rate?",115

I tried to enumerate the things as we're looking forward very much to your question. Our overall long-term investment thesis is unchanged. We are very focused on investing to support the ongoing growth we see across Google in particular, as we're talking about in Search, while we're also investing to build new businesses, most notably in Cloud, as we've talked a lot about here today. 
And across all of Alphabet, we do continue to benefit from machine learning, that's both OpEx and CapEx. And as we both commented, given the opportunities we see with the application of machine learning across the business, we are continuing to invest. 
Our lens on the pace of investing does have 3 facets in it. First is investing at the appropriate pace to support long-term earnings growth. And then we were very focused, second, on optimizing investments within each product area. And finally, as we've talked about, investing to support operational excellence. 
But the mega point is that we are excited about the long-term opportunity and we're continuing to invest, which is why in opening comments, I wanted to make sure to call out what we're seeing with respect to ongoing investments in -- across the business, the increases in headcount and the reasons for them, the benefits of those investments as well as sales and marketing and the fact that, that is back-half-loaded and back-half-weighted, I should say.
And so tried to lay out the relevant points for you to ensure that we make it very clear. We are committed to continuing to invest for what we see as long-term opportunities.",271

We are definitely investing in Android with a focus on the next billion users as well as making sure the mobile experience continues to evolve. In terms of the mobile experience, I still think from a user standpoint, there's a lot of information overload. So being helpful to users and helping them navigate it, be it Search, Assistant, Maps and YouTube, I think we are focused on the opportunities there. 
And in terms of the next billion users, there's a lot of headroom there over time and we are focused on. That's why we take efforts like Android Go seriously. We are constantly working hard to lower the barrier so that more people can benefit from being online and participating in the digital economy. And so it will continue to be a focus for us.",140

Q3 was another great quarter at Google with strong revenue growth driven by mobile search, YouTube and Cloud. We celebrated Google's 21st birthday this quarter. While our mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful hasn't changed, we have evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that helps you get things done. 
Since the beginning, we have always invested in tackling deep computer science problems that can have a significant impact on society. The chance to be part of these fundamental engineering challenges is why so many people want to work at Google. In just the last week, we have announced 2 significant advances: first, powered by our long-term investment in AI, we dramatically improved our understanding of the questions people ask Google Search. It's the biggest leap forward for search in the past 5 years. It's all possible because of a new type of neural network-based technique for natural language processing called BERT, which recognizes subtle patterns in language and provides more relevant resource. 
Second, we recently announced a major quantum computing milestone. I was extraordinarily proud to visit our team in Santa Barbara. To demonstrate supremacy, Google's 53-qubit quantum machine, Sycamore, successfully performed the test computation in just 200 seconds that would've taken the most powerful supercomputers much longer time to accomplish. It's the hello world moment we've been waiting for and represents a distinct milestone in our effort to harness the principles of quantum mechanics to solve computational problems.
Turning from quantum to the quarter. Today, I'll talk about the momentum we saw across the business in the last 3 months. First, Cloud. We saw customer momentum across multiple areas under Thomas' leadership. In September, we announced a landmark partnership with Mayo Clinic. Using Google Cloud to secure and store data and understand insights at scale, Mayo Clinic will partner with us in many ways. Together, we'll work to transform patient and clinician experiences, identify new methods of diagnosing diseases, conduct clinical research and find new models for delivering patient care. 
National Australia Bank recently added Google Cloud to its multi-cloud strategy to help the company better use data and deliver new and improved customer experiences. Deutsche Börse Group, the fourth-largest stock exchange group worldwide, relies on Google Cloud to help them navigate the twin challenge of modernizing their digital operations and addressing significant regulatory requirements. Retailers are also turning to cloud solutions to help make the shopping experience as seamless and personalized as possible. For example, Macy's uses Google Cloud to streamline their operations from the distribution center to the shop floor. Public sector customers are modernizing their IT systems with Google Cloud with great results. For example, the State of Arizona already has more than 36,000 employees using our products to increase productivity, efficiency and security. And this quarter, it further extended our relationship.
We continue to extend our cloud services through partners including a new solution that enables customers to run VMware workloads on GCP for the first time. We announced a cloud region in Nevada. When it launches in 2020, it will be our seventh cloud region in the U.S. We also announced a new cloud region in Poland, our seventh in Europe. 
Turning to Google's products that people use every day. We are excited about new features launched in Maps including detailed voice guidance while walking that will make it possible for people who have vision impairments or are blind to get around more easily; new tools that will allow users to see all of their flight and hotel reservations in one place; and another new feature that gives transit riders in 30 countries the ability to see ridesharing and biking options near their bus or train stop. In search, we made a number of improvements to make it easier for users to find key moments in videos, easily find products within images via Google Lens and discover new podcasts.
Our Hardware business is still in its early stages, but we are continuing to build the business and a portfolio of helpful products. 2 weeks ago, we unveiled our new Made by Google product lineup, bringing together the best of hardware, software and AI. Our new Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL are the first phones with motion sense. This allows users to use natural gestures to get things done without touching their phone. The new Google Assistant now gives users the ability to switch seamlessly between apps all via voice. And the new Pixelbook Go provides many of the great features of our premium Pixelbook at a more affordable price point. We also unveiled a new more powerful Nest Mini speaker and Nest Wifi. Finally, the team is looking forward to launching Pixel Buds, our first truly wireless headphones, as well as Stadia, our streaming gaming platform, which will soon be available in the U.S., U.K, Canada and throughout Europe. We are encouraged by the positive product reviews so far. With the holidays coming up, I think there's a gift for everyone on your list.
On to YouTube. Keeping YouTube safe for our users, creatives and partners while preserving the openness of our platform is a top priority. This quarter, we continue to update our community guidelines and enforcement to protect users from harmful content, and we'll keep doing this work. YouTube Music and YouTube Premium continue to expand globally and are now available in 71 countries. In September, YouTube launched its new fashion and beauty destination called YouTube/Fashion. It's designed to meet the growing demand from consumers for better ways to explore and connect with some of YouTube's biggest fashion and beauty creatives. 
And I want to emphasize that as we build all these helpful products, we are committed to giving users more control of their data. This quarter, we extended one of our most popular features in Chrome and YouTube called Incognito mode to Maps. We expanded our auto-delete controls to YouTube history. These controls already enable people to set their location history and web and app activity to be deleted automatically after 3 or 18 months.
And to protect everyone's safety online, we introduced password checkup. It's a new feature that tells users if any of their passwords are weak, if they have been reused across multiple sites or if they have been compromised somewhere on the web. 
Now moving on to how we are helping advertisers. We are bringing our strengths in machine learning to help advertisers build their ad campaigns. Machine learning-powered tools like search auto bidding are gaining traction. In fact, more than half of advertisers' search spend is now optimized via full auto bidding. We now have more than a million advertisers using responsive search ads, an ad format we launched a year ago that uses machine learning to create the right ad for each search query. And our new video reach campaigns allow marketers to upload multiple video ads into a single campaign. From there, we use machine learning to sell the most efficient combination of these ads to help brands reach audiences at scale.
This quarter, we expanded inventory for our very popular app campaigns to include new services including YouTube Search, display video ads and the Discover feed. We also launched YouTube masthead ads for TV, which enable advertisers to reach audiences right when they opened their YouTube app on their connected TVs, one of its fastest-growing streams. 
It's also important for advertisers to have standardized measurement that's fair across all media and that delivers insights in a way that fully protects users' privacy. We're making it easier for businesses to do just that. Our next generation of Google Analytics unifies web and app measurement reporting for the first time to help businesses understand which channel is driving the best results. 
On a personal note, I was in Dallas in October where I saw firsthand how important Google is in helping small and medium-sized businesses grow. I got to visit Peacock Alley, a bedding and bath manufacturer in Dallas with 75 employees. They've been using Google Ads for over 15 years to help drive traffic to their stores. Their e-commerce has grown 52% in the past year. They credit the guidance Google Analytics provides as well as Google Shopping and Product Listing Ads for that growth. 
This isn't the only way we help small businesses grow and thrive. Our Grow with Google program has helped train 3 million Americans in digital skills including small business owners and entrepreneurs. Just a few weeks ago, we announced that our IT professional support certificate training course will expand to 100 community colleges. It's already helped tens of thousands of people pursue fast-growing, well-paying careers in IT support. I'm glad to see more community colleges offer this pathway to students.
Finally, to round out a busy quarter, sustainability has always been a core value for us, and I'm proud that we have been carbon neutral since 2007. In September, we announced the biggest corporate purchase of renewable energy in history. We are increasing Google's existing renewable energy portfolio by more than 40%. These purchases are happening globally, spurring the construction of more than $2 billion in new energy infrastructure including millions of solar panels and hundreds of wind turbines across 3 continents. 
And at our Hardware event, we announced that we are committing to roughly $150 million in renewable energy projects in key manufacturing regions. Our hope is that this will spur even greater investments in sustainability. 
So it's been a really great quarter. A personal highlight for me was our Take Our Parents to Work Day, which we held in September at our main campus in Mountain View. It was great to see thousands of parents take such pride in what their kids are building. I feel the same way. None of our work would be possible without our Googlers around the world. This quarter was another great example of the mission that brings us all together. 
Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Ruth.",1678
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2019",2019-10-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3255.0,1849945.0,72363033.0,Presenter Speech,Ruth Porat,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Sundar. 
In the third quarter, total revenues of $40.5 billion were up 20% year-on-year and up 22% in constant currency. Once again, our results were driven by ongoing strength in mobile search, YouTube and Cloud. I will begin with a review of the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google followed by other bets and conclude with our outlook. Sundar and I will then take your questions. 
Details of Alphabet's consolidated revenues by geographic region are available in our earnings press release. Regarding our key expense lines, on a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues including TAC, which I will discuss in the Google segment, was $17.6 billion, up 23% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $10.1 billion, up 31% year-over-year primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The biggest contributor again this quarter was costs associated with our data centers and other operations including depreciation, followed by content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube and mostly for our advertising-supported content but also for our newer subscription businesses, YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which have higher CAC as a percentage of their revenues. This line also includes the impact of hardware costs primarily associated with our mid-tier Pixel 3a smartphones.
Operating expenses were $13.8 billion with head count growth being the largest driver of year-on-year growth for both R&D and sales and marketing, which is reflected in both compensation and facilities expenses. With respect to R&D, the growth was again driven by the addition of engineering talent consistent with our focus on product innovation. The increase in G&A year-over-year was primarily due to a $554 million charge from our previously announced legal settlement in France.
Stock-based compensation totaled $2.6 billion. Head count was up 6,450 from the second quarter, and consistent with prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable head count increases were again in Cloud for both technical and sales roles. Operating income was $9.2 billion, up 6% year-over-year for an operating margin of 23%. Other income and expense was a loss of $549 million, which primarily reflects the impact of unrealized losses and marketable equity securities. As of September 30, the unrealized equity gain in the combined portfolio of marketable and nonmarketable securities was $5.8 billion. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Net income was $7.1 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $10.12. 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $6.7 billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $15.5 billion with free cash flow of $8.7 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $121 billion.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $40.3 billion, up 20% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites' revenues were $28.6 billion in the quarter, up 19% year-over-year. In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by mobile search with a strong contribution from YouTube followed by desktop search.
Network revenues were $5.3 billion, up 8% year-on-year, continuing to reflect the performance of the primary drivers of growth within network namely Google Ad Manager followed by AdMob. Other revenues for Google were $6.4 billion, up 39% year-over-year, once again fueled by Cloud followed by a strong performance from Play. Within Cloud, growth in GCP was once again the primary driver of performance with strong customer demand for our compute and data analytics products complemented by ongoing growth in G Suite, reflecting both new pricing and seat growth. Within Play, performance was driven once again by growth in the number of active buyers. In addition, the line reflects Hardware, which continue to benefit from the launch of our Pixel 3a mid-tier smartphones. 
We provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. Total traffic acquisition costs were $7.5 billion or 22% of total advertising revenues and up 14% year-over-year. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was down year-over-year, reflecting primarily a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites. The sites' TAC rate increased year-over-year primarily due to the impact of the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC, partially offset by the growth in TAC-free sites revenues primarily from YouTube. 
In Q3, the network TAC rate declined year-on-year primarily due to a favorable product mix shift. Google operating income was $10.9 billion, up 14% versus last year, and the operating margin was 26.9%. Google accrued CapEx for the quarter was $7.2 billion, reflecting investments in office facilities and data centers followed by servers. Investments in office facilities included the $1 billion acquisition of a portfolio of buildings in Sunnyvale and the purchase of 2 buildings to expand our presence in the Seattle area.
Moving on to the performance of Other Bets. Revenues were $155 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Other Bets had an operating loss of $941 million. I'll note a couple of key accomplishments in Other Bets.
At Waymo, we're extending fully driverless opportunities on a small-scale to participants in our Early Rider Program in Metro Phoenix. We're also testing long-haul truck driving on Arizona freeways, and we're continuing to test Waymo vehicles in various geographies. The newest of which is heavy rain testing in Southern Florida. In addition, we have begun 3D mapping in Los Angeles. And 2 weeks ago, Wing launched its first commercial drone-delivery service to homes in Virginia in partnership with FedEx, Walgreens and local Virginia retailer, Sugar Magnolia. Wing is now operating on 3 continents in early test deliveries.
I will sum up with a few observations on the quarter and our longer-term outlook. Based on the strength of the U.S. dollar to date relative to the fourth quarter of last year, we expect continued FX headwinds again in the fourth quarter of 2019. As a reminder, foreign exchange headwinds affect both revenues and operating income given the majority of our expenses are in the U.S. 
With respect to revenues, we're pleased with the performance of our advertising business. As a reminder, there is variability in year-on-year revenue growth rates from quarter-to-quarter. As we've often discussed, we manage our business for the long term and not on a quarterly basis, and we remain very focused on continuing to enhance the experience for users and advertisers over the long term. 
Within other revenues, in addition to continued strength in compute, Google Cloud saw substantial growth from data analytics as customers are seeing the benefits from implementing BigQuery. Cloud continued to see significant growth in each region globally. Our new lineup of Made by Google hardware was announced 2 weeks ago with Pixel 4 hitting store shelves late last week. With the introduction of the Pixel 3a in the second quarter, we expect the seasonality of our Hardware business to be moderated somewhat. 
Turning to elements of our profitability. With regard to Google operating expenses, while head count growth on an absolute basis in the third quarter was unusually high, reflecting the addition of new college hires, we do remain on pace for head count growth in 2019 to be in line with growth in 2018. Our investments in talent support innovation across our businesses and in particular support our ongoing momentum in cloud. 
Regarding sales and marketing expenses, as I've mentioned on prior calls, these expenses are typically more heavily weighted toward the back half of the year and tend to be particularly elevated in the fourth quarter to support the holiday season. In Other Bets, we continued to invest meaningfully and thoughtfully for the long-term opportunities that we see. 
Turning to capital allocation and CapEx. With respect to capital returns, consistent with announcing an increase in our stock buyback authorization last quarter to $25 billion, we were pleased to step up repurchase levels by nearly 60% to $5.7 billion in the third quarter. In terms of CapEx, as a reminder, over the last couple of years, the split between technical infrastructure and office facilities has averaged approximately 70% to 30%. Due to the sizable purchases of office facilities we made in Q3, technical infrastructure accounted for only about 60% of total CapEx and continue to be more heavily weighted to data center construction and servers. 
Looking forward, we anticipate the primary driver of CapEx investment will continue to be our expected compute requirements, particularly to support ongoing demand for machine learning across our business as well as for Cloud, search and YouTube. At this scale of investment, we remain very focused on driving efficiency through fleet optimization and tight management of our supply chain. 
In conclusion, we remain confident about the opportunities ahead. Sundar and I will now take your questions.",1492

First, Sundar, a big-picture question. It feels like the concept of the ambient computing was sort of prevalent at the Made by Google event recently. It started with sort of a bit of a shift in theme, from what I could tell, at the I/O earlier this year. Can you just talk about what some of the key investments you want to make to capitalize on that opportunity over the medium to longer term, how you think Google and maybe broader Alphabet is positioned to capitalize on that, how it might show up at the product service layer? So I guess maybe a 3-part question of more of a bigger-picture nature.",116
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2019",2019-10-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3255.0,1849945.0,72363036.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,6,"Thanks, Eric. We are very excited by the vision of ambient computing and evolving that. I think it's a continuity in the sense that, over time, computing should be more intuitive to users and computing should adapt to users, not the other way around. And the foundations of all this is all the work we have done with our computing platforms to date and the successful consumer services and the developer platforms we have built. And I think that's the most of the investments there. Phones will continue to be at the center of ambient computing for the future. So that's another important piece where we are already invested in. 
I think as we expand beyond, that's what the Made by Google family is focused on, products in your home with our Nest family of products and wearables, which we do with Wear OS and so on. So supporting that ecosystem, so whether you're at home or on the go or at work, and making sure it works. Our investments in AI across the company, I think, will end up playing a key role, AI and Assistant. I think they will be at the center of making sure we can anticipate what users want and serve them better.",208

And obviously, anytime we can better make sense of queries, we can serve users better, our search quality goes up, and people engage, and that's a -- engage more. So it's part of a long set of things we have been working on, but this is one of our bigger breakthroughs in terms of helping improve the search experience and search quality. And then BERT will help us in a certain set of queries. There are many queries which are already working well, but it helps us capture nuance and help understand human context better. And so I would just characterize this as a big improvement, which improves search quality and creates that virtuous cycle by which people engage more. Of course, a lot of times we take the same techniques, and sometimes it makes sense on the ad side and the underlying machine learning techniques, and we'll deploy it there as well.",179

I was wondering if you could just give us some color on the size of your GCP backlog. And maybe even if you just talk about the trajectory and how that's changed over the course of the last year. And then you mentioned the strength in the uptake of BigQuery. I'm just trying to think through how we should think of the margin level of a service like this versus the traditional compute offerings where you've seen strength to date. And just wondering if we start to see some positive mix shift benefits as some of these premium products start to ramp more aggressively.",121

Overall, I know we gave some visibility into our cloud business, and we'll continue to do that periodically. And the momentum has been great. Obviously, ever since Thomas has come in, he has continued to invest across the board. He definitely focused a lot on scaling of our sales partner and operational teams, and it's playing out well in this business. It's important for you to been asked many data situations as possible and get those wins which accrue over time. And so we are definitely seeing the momentum. Analytics is a huge area of strength for us, and it's an area which Thomas has a lot of expertise in as well. 
And BigQuery is such a strong product, so it's a natural area we are seeing strength. And my sense is as we get -- if I look at the TAM, the percentage of TAM for which we were eligible compared to 2 years ago to last year to now, that number is shifting aggressively due to either completing our product feature set or completing some of the certifications we need. And so I think there are several strong forward-looking indicators and look forward to sharing more at the right time.",204

Google My Business has been our major effort there. Actually, millions of businesses are -- reach and engage both through search and Maps. Specifically, in GML, we announced that we'll expand local campaigns. I presume that's what you're talking about. It's still early. And in general, we want to make it easier for advertisers, particularly SMBs, to come to Google and be able to reach users across our set of owned and operated properties, so be it search, be it YouTube, be it Discover, be it Maps, and that's the way we envision that.

We see tons of what I would call commercial user journeys across Google. Obviously, search is an important area. Image Search, YouTube, Maps are all great services by which I think users come with varying degrees of commercial interest, looking to discover and, at times, transact as well. So we've started thinking much more holistically about what are those experiences and how can we make that better. That involves helping improve the discovery experience, but when people are interested in it, being able to be -- making it easier to transact. So the equivalent of being signed in and being able to pay when you want and then of course fulfillment and logistics. So we are thinking through the end-to-end experience across all our services and are investing, but I see the user interest, and it's an area where I think we have significant opportunities ahead.",156

We realize users sometimes do searches through sessions, understanding what is their satisfaction across the session, what is their engagement, are they getting at what they are looking for. Those are all some of the deeper work we are undertaking. And also understanding by vertical how we are helping users. There was an earlier question around shopping and commerce, that's an example of the kind of vertical and what can we do to make that experience better.

And we haven't heard that in a couple of quarters. So as we look out towards like 2020 and beyond, do you feel like a lot of the product queue is in a good place as far as search and YouTube are concerned and that this product changes might be a little bit more subtle going forward? Or could we return to having more meaningful impact in the future? Just any color there. And then on the third quarter, the Asia region, the growth rate was solid but a tad lower than the prior trends. So anything notable to call out on APAC?",137

And as we've said since the IPO, we don't manage the business to maximize quarterly results, and we'll always do the right thing for the long term. We're very focused on investing for the long term, and I tried to make it clear in the opening comments that, as a result, quarterly growth can vary and have varied. And I think to your question, our view is that quarterly growth around the rates you've seen since the beginning of the year, for us, underscore the strength and the vibrancy actually in our business. And that's particularly true at our size. In the last 12 months, we've generated over $150 billion in total revenues. That's about $25 billion of growth in the last year, and we are continuing to invest in long-term opportunities. And -- but I would make the point that we do keep a lens to the long term. 
In terms of your question about geographies. When we look at performance on a fixed FX basis around the globe, pleased with the performance again in the third quarter. You aptly pointed out year-on-year growth in APAC in the third quarter was a bit lower than the second quarter. That primarily reflected slower growth in the network business, and that was in part due to policy changes. It also reflected the fact that the launch of the Pixel 3a was in the second quarter, which boosted the year-on-year growth rate in the second quarter. But I think also implicit in your question, at 26% year-on-year growth on a fixed FX basis running at about now $7 billion in quarterly revenues, we're really pleased with all that the team is doing in the year-on-year growth rate.",319

You gave us, I think, some updates on monthly active users or DAUs in the past. Any update there would be great or maybe any additional color on sort of how the total amounts of usage goes on there, as that's obviously been featured to users a little bit more. And then second, maybe just a follow-up for Ruth, Sundar spoke at length about your investments in renewable energy earlier. And maybe keeping with the theme of the earnings call, you could help us understand how that is or maybe is not helping drive efficiencies across the country -- or across the company and your operating cost overall?",147

I think it completes the other half of search. Search is -- we do our mission for our users and be helpful when they come to us looking for information. Discover is the other half, where we are proactively understanding what might be most helpful or relevant to them and getting it to them. And we definitely are focused on product quality and making sure the product is actually helpful to users. And when they engage with it, they find it useful. And it's definitely, we are making progress. Our investments in machine learning are helping as well. We are definitely able to better anticipate and give them information proactively. So over time, I see it as an important area for us, and it's done and closed. It's part of our search and knowledge efforts. And as we do that, you can imagine you may have started a query in search, and it's a session. Maybe you're looking to take a trip somewhere or you're researching a particular topic, we may be able to continue that session and the user journey in Discover, and that creates a virtuous cycle. So these are -- you want to be helpful to users in a way that makes sense for them more continually, and the combination of search and Discover helps us do that.",230

We do think that it's a valuable part of what we do, and we do consider the impact on the business and on the financials. It really cuts across every element of what we do: what we're doing in our technical infrastructure; the way we're thinking about our products, as Sundar talked about; what we do with our facilities; what we're doing with AI. And I think it was about a year ago we talked about how we were applying machine learning to energy efficiency in our data centers, and it did have a net benefit. It helped us reduce energy consumption, not only positive for sustainability but was an efficiency effort. Sundar talked about the fact that we are investing -- recently announced that we are purchasing -- making a meaningful investment in renewable energy part of our commitment to offset 100% of our electricity use with renewables. And in our view, this is catalyzing further investments in renewables. That is going to have a modest short-term increase in cost, but we think it's beneficial to catalyzing the overall growth in traditional energy.

I think in general, obviously, we have relied on advances in computing to be able to do what we do. And when we look ahead, we definitely see being able to drive the pace of change here fastest is an important need for us as well as, I think, a source of competitive advantage. As Moore's Law effects have diminished, I think we are looking at a variety of approaches to make sure we can continue doing what we need to. And in that, this is an important tool in the arsenal. While quantum will take many years to really start making a difference, we want to be at the cutting edge of driving it. I do think over time for sure, cloud itself, we do see a lot of interest from cloud customers particularly in cutting-edge verticals about quantum computing. And so that's an area where I think we'll participate in as a business.

Last month, we announced YouTube TV is now launching on select Amazon Fire TV devices. So there is definite -- the user satisfaction on the product is very high, and so we're focused on continuing our expansion, building out a great service and building awareness for the service.

We had a strong 2018, with total revenues of $136.8 billion, up 23% over 2017, reflecting the benefit of our ongoing investments to deliver exceptional experiences for users, and compelling returns for our advertisers, partners and enterprise customers. 
For the fourth quarter, revenues of $39.3 billion were up 22% year-on-year and up 23% in constant currency as we continue to benefit from ongoing strength in mobile search, with important contributions from YouTube, cloud and desktop search. 
For today's call, I will begin with a review of results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google, followed by Other Bets, and we'll conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which we will take your questions. Let me start with the summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. 
Our total revenues of $39.3 billion reflect a negative currency impact year-over-year of $724 million or $600 million after the impact of our hedging program. Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography. You can see that our performance was strong again in all regions. U.S. revenues were $18.7 billion, up 21% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $12.4 billion, up 20% year-over-year in both reported and constant currency terms, with a slight headwind, primarily from the euro. APAC revenues were $6.1 billion, up 29% versus last year and up 32% in constant currency, reflecting weakness of the Australian dollar. Other Americas revenues were $2.2 billion, up 16% year-over-year and up 26% in constant currency, reflecting weakening of the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso.
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I will discuss in the Google segment results, was $17.9 billion, up 26% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $10.5 billion, up 34% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The key drivers were, first, content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, mostly for our advertising-supported content in what is a seasonally strong quarter for YouTube, but also for our newer subscription businesses, YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which have higher CAC as a percentage of revenues. 
Second, cost associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation. And third, hardware-related costs for our Made by Google and Nest family of products. Operating expenses were $13.2 billion, up 27% year-over-year. The biggest increase was in R&D expenses, with the larger driver being headcount growth, followed by the accrual of compensation expenses to reflect increases in the valuation of equity in certain Other Bets. Growth in sales and marketing expenses reflect increases in sales and marketing headcount, primarily for cloud and ads, followed by advertising investments, mainly in search and the Assistant.
The growth in G&A expenses reflects mostly increases in headcount. Stock-based compensation totaled $2.3 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 98,771, up 4,399 from last quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were in cloud for both technical and sales roles.
Operating income was $8.2 billion, up 7% versus last year, for an operating margin of 21%. Other income and expense was $1.9 billion, which includes $1.3 billion of unrealized gain related to a nonmarketable debt security investment. We provide more detail on these line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. 
Our effective tax rate was 11.2% for the fourth quarter, reflecting a discrete benefit due to the reversal of an accrual made as a result of updated guidance associated with the U.S. Tax Act. Net income was $8.9 billion and earnings per diluted share were $12.77. 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $7.1 billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $13 billion with free cash flow of $5.9 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $109 billion. Let me now turn to our segment financial results.
Starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $39.1 billion, up 22% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenues were $27 billion in the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by mobile search, with a strong contribution from YouTube, followed by desktop search. Network revenues were $5.6 billion, up 12% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of AdMob and Google Ad Manager. Other revenues for Google were $6.5 billion, up 31% year-over-year, fueled by Cloud, Hardware and Play.
We continue to provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. 
Total traffic acquisition costs were $7.4 billion or 23% of total advertising revenues and up 15% year-over-year. Total TAC, as a percentage of total advertising revenues, was down year-over-year, primarily reflecting a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites. The increase in the site's TAC rate year-over-year was driven by the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC, followed by changes in partner agreements, offset by the seasonally higher proportion of YouTube advertising revenues in the fourth quarter.
In Q4, the network TAC rate declined year-on-year, primarily due to a revenue mix shift within our programmatic business. Google stock-based compensation totaled $2.1 billion for the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. Operating income was $9.7 billion, up 13% versus last year, and the operating margin was 24.8%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $6.8 billion, reflecting investments in office facilities, data centers and servers. 
Let me now turn to and talk about Other Bets. I'll cover results for the full year 2018 because it remains most instructive to look at the financials for Other Bets over a longer term horizon, as we have discussed on prior calls. Results for the quarter are in our earnings release.
For the full year 2018, Other Bets revenues were $595 million, up 25% versus 2017, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss for Other Bets was $3.4 billion for the full year 2018 versus an operating loss of $2.7 billion in 2017. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $181 million, down from $493 million in 2017, primarily reflecting investments in Fiber. 
Key recent accomplishments include: In December, Waymo launched Waymo One, which enables participants to use its app to hail and pay for rides; also, Verily recently announced a $1 billion investment of round led by Silver Lake as it advances on plans that are complementary and additive to its current life sciences portfolio. That investment, of course, was in addition to the $800 million it raised from Temasek previously. 
Let me close with some observations on our priorities and longer-term outlook. First, with respect to revenues. Our 23% revenue growth in 2018 was powered in particular by the ongoing benefit of innovation in our Sites business. With 8 products with more than 1 billion users each and more people coming online every day, we remain excited by the opportunities to continue to create valuable experiences for users around the globe. In particular, we see significant ongoing potential to apply our machine-learning capabilities across our businesses. 
In our advertising business, machine learning has enabled innovation in advertisers' ability to match consumer intent and to bid more effectively for improved ROI. It has also enhanced the ability of smaller businesses to benefit from advertising on our platforms. Machine learning is also driving differentiation for newer Google businesses, like Cloud and hardware, as well central to a number of Other Bets, most notably Waymo and Verily. 
Looking ahead, a couple of things to note. First, as we've said many times, we continuously work to enhance the user and advertiser experience. Because we make changes with the focus on the best interest of users and advertisers over the long term, the timing of the introduction of new experiences, particularly in search advertising, can vary, which can result in an impact on quarterly year-on-year growth.
Second, during 2018, the FX tailwinds in the first half of the year turned to headwinds in the third and fourth quarters, in line with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Based on the continuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we expect a headwind to reported versus fixed FX results in the first quarter in contrast to the favorable impact of FX in the first quarter of 2018. 
Turning to investments and profitability. In terms of gross margin, the biggest component within cost of revenues remains our traffic acquisition costs, reflecting our strong revenue growth in mobile search and the fact that mobile search carries higher TAC than our desktop business. As we've discussed on prior calls, while the pace of year-on-year growth in Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites revenues slowed after the first quarter of 2018, we do expect the Sites TAC rate to continue to increase year-on-year, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search. 
Within OpEx, we remain focused on prioritization in order to optimize resources for longer-term growth in sizable markets. You'll see us continue to support our priority areas with increased headcount, which will remain concentrated in R&D, although we expect the growth rate to moderate in 2019. 
In 2018, we also saw continued progress on our goal to nurture new businesses outside of Google, our Other Bets, with the model of independence. While I've said previously that there is no monolithic approach to how the Other Bets execute against opportunities, a shared principle is aligning employee interest with the long-term value creation by these companies. Since inception, this has been an important part of our approach at Google, with stock grants comprising meaningful components of overall compensation across our employee base. 
We're increasingly following that approach in the Other Bets with compensation programs that align employee and company interests. You've seen the impact of some of those programs in the fourth quarter as we accrued compensation expenses to reflect increases in the valuation of equity in certain Other Bets. While these expenses will recur, the timing of valuation events is unpredictable and can vary between bets, which can affect quarterly comparisons. 
Finally, on capital allocation, our primary use continues to be to support organic growth in our businesses, followed by retaining flexibility for acquisitions. After taking these needs into account, our board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 12.5 billion of our Class C capital stock. 
With respect to CapEx, we continue to invest in both compute requirements and for office facilities, although we expect the CapEx growth rate in 2019 to moderate quite significantly. 
In conclusion, 2018 was another great year with tremendous ongoing opportunity ahead of us. I will now turn the call over to Sundar.",1791

Last year, we set out to bring the benefits of AI to everyone through our products, and I'm proud of the tremendous progress we made towards that goal. From Smart Compose in Gmail to the new Google News experience, to call streaming on the Pixel and improving the overall safety of our products, AI is helping people get things done every day. 
Beyond our products, AI is also helping us drive our mission forward at the scale we couldn't have imagined just a few years ago. Google AI Lead, Jeff Dean, recapped the results of our efforts in a great post on our AI blog, like using AI to better detect the spread of breast cancer or providing flood victims with real-time information in a crisis. I encourage everyone to check it out. 
We also launched the Google AI impact challenge to help nonprofits find ways to use AI to solve social and environmental problems. In addition to our progress in AI, we saw great traction across newer areas, like the Google Assistant, Hardware and Cloud. And our core areas such as Search, Maps, News, YouTube and our computing and advertising platforms continue their strong momentum. 
Everything we do at Google is united by the mission of making information accessible and useful for everyone. Providing accurate and trusted information at the scale the Internet has reached is an extremely complex challenge and one that is constantly getting harder. But we have 20 years of experience in these information challenges, and it's what we strive to do better than anyone else. As we do this, we feel a deep sense of responsibility to do the right thing and are continuing to build privacy and security into the core of our products, keeping users' data safe and secure with the industry's best security systems and giving people better and clearer controls. You'll see us continue to do a lot more here in 2019.
Today, I'll start by sharing some of the new ways that we are working towards our mission, then I'll give an update on our video and advertising platforms, followed by the latest on our hardware and cloud efforts. And I'll close with a few thoughts on our investments around the world.
First, advancing our mission of making information accessible and useful. The Google Assistant is a great example of how we help people throughout their day, and we demonstrated that at CES last month with lots of exciting new partners and features. From the Lenovo Smart Clock that wakes you up in the morning, to real-time navigation that helps during your commute, to a built-in interpreter that translates conversations across dozens of languages on Google Home. And speaking of languages, over the past year, the Google Assistant expanded from 8 languages in 14 countries to nearly 30 languages in 80 countries. In that time, the number of active users has quadrupled. As we add more partners, devices and capabilities, the Google Assistant will only get better and more helpful. 
There's a lot of great progress in other areas, too. Last month, we announced the launch of activity cards in Search. Now when you search for a topic that you have previously explored, you can quickly see where you've already been and pick up where you left out. Thanks to our strength in AI and Search, Google Lens uses your smartphone camera to help identify more than 1 billion products. So if you see an item that you like, Lens can show you similar designs, along with useful information like product reviews. 
We continue to see great momentum across our computing platforms, Android and Chrome. In Q4, we announced that Android will officially support foldable phones with partners like Samsung introducing their first foldable devices this year. We see continued traction with manufacturer adoption of Android Auto. We recently announced new media and messaging features to significantly simplify and improve the car dashboard experience. And building on the speed, simplicity and security of Chrome OS, partners like ASUS and HP introduced a slew of great new consumer and enterprise Chromebooks last months at CES.
Now let me provide an update on our video and advertising platforms, starting with YouTube. We are seeing great traction in some of our newer experiences on YouTube. YouTube Music and YouTube Premium are now available in nearly 30 countries, up from 5 countries at the start of 2018. Last month, YouTube TV announced that it has expanded nationwide to cover 98% of U.S. households, with the rest to follow shortly. YouTube continues to invest in its thriving community of creators and build great features for its nearly 2 billion monthly login users. 
For instance, in Q4, we expanded access to tools like stories and community post that strengthen the connections between fans and creators. One of our newest tools, Premiers, is a breakout hit. Ariana Grande's premiere of her official music video for Thank U, Next in November holds the record for biggest music video debut in YouTube history, earning over 55 million views in its first day. We are driving revenue to the YouTube creator community, from established channels to newly emerging ones. The number of YouTube channels with more than 1 million subscribers nearly doubled in the last year, and the number of creators earning 5 or 6 figures grew by more than 40% year-over-year.
A big priority for YouTube in 2019 is to continue our work to quickly find and remove content that violates YouTube's content guidelines. It's an important challenge, and with advanced machine learning and investments in human reviewers, we are making continued progress. 
Now I'll touch on some of the recent highlights of our advertising business, which continue to go from strength to strength. Recently, Warner Bros embedded the first full length film with an ad on YouTube and reached a record number of people, over 17 million users in a single day. Viewers who watched the trailer for Lego Movie 2 on Black Friday were served the franchise's original film for free within the ad. It's a great example of how advertisers continue to delight users on YouTube. 
Performance advertisers loved TrueView for action, YouTube's direct response offering. Since the product launched in March 2018, over 30% of the advertisers who use TrueView for action were new to buying video ads on YouTube. In Q4, we also announced a global strategic ad tech relationship with The Walt Disney Company across their entire portfolio of brands and properties. With Google Ad Manager as its core platform, Disney will be able to sell across its digital properties seamlessly on the Web, in mobile apps, through connected TVs and even during live events.
Our shopping tools were also front and center during the holidays, helping retailers reach people during the busy holiday shopping season. In fact, the number of shopping daily active users on Google.com during the holidays doubled compared to last year, thanks in part to new features like productless modules that showcase the most popular products across the Web. Small retailers are also benefiting from automated bidding solutions, like smart shopping campaigns, which now has more than 20,000 live merchants, impressive progress since launching in April.
Now on to our growing hardware efforts. During the holiday season, our newest lineup of Made by Google devices topped many best of 2018 lists. The response from shoppers was equally positive. It was another record year for our Google Home family of devices, with millions sold this holiday season. They're helping people easily get things done around the house. For example, people use Google Home devices to cook over 16 million recipes this holiday season, 1 million on Christmas Day alone. Our newest smart displays were particularly popular. One out of every 7 Google Home devices activated over the holiday season was a Google Home Hub. In Q4, we launched significant advances in computational photography in our Pixel 3, with features such as night sight photo light photos. We also expanded availability to 4 more countries: Japan, France, Ireland and Taiwan.
And finally, our growing Cloud business. I want to thank Diane Greene for her leadership over the last 3 years. Google Cloud is a fast-growing, multi-billion dollar business that supports major Global 5000 companies in every important vertical with a robust enterprise organization. This was not the case just [ 3 ] years ago. What Diane and her team accomplished is phenomenal. Now, Diane's work is done, and she has handed the reins to Thomas Kurian, and I'm thrilled to have him here as our new Cloud leader. Google Cloud closed out the year strong with momentum across the business. Last year, we more than doubled both the number of Google Cloud Platform deals over $1 million as well as the number of multiyear contracts signed.
We also ended the year with another milestone, passing 5 million paying customers for our Cloud collaboration and productivity solution, G Suite. Our focus on helping customers digitally transform their businesses is paying off. We continue to see strong growth in all our major geographies and industries this quarter. 
In financial services, we signed agreements with 2 of the top financial institutions in the U.S. to help them transition their business to Google Cloud with our highly secure solutions. In retail, brands like Bed Bath & Beyond, DSW and Ulta Beauty are using our Cloud to manage data and provide more personalized experiences to consumers. 
In media and entertainment, The Telegraph in the U.K. is going all-in with Google Cloud because of our data and machine learning expertise. To support our global growth, in Q4, we launched our 18th Google Cloud region and announced plans for a new region in Jakarta. 
So as you can see, we are investing in the many incredible opportunities across our business. We are also investing in communities around the world and right here at home. I was recently in Europe opening up our new office in Berlin, which will help us more than double the number of Googlers who work there. 
Across Europe, we have invested more than EUR 4.3 billion in 5 data centers since 2007. And in Q4, we announced a new data center coming in Denmark. In all, it's estimated that these data centers have generated more than EUR 5.4 billion in GDP over the last decade. Of course, the amount generated by our creator, publisher and app developer partners across the region is orders of magnitude larger. 
We also continue our substantial investments throughout the U.S. Last year, we made significant investments in new and expanded office space. In Q4, we opened the doors to our new office in Detroit and announced that we'll be investing over $1 billion in capital improvements to establish a new campus in New York City, which will begin to open in 2020. We're also continuing to invest in data center construction and expansion. It is an important, long-term investment that lay the groundwork for our future computing needs, primarily to accelerate machine learning across our businesses, but also to support the opportunities we see in Cloud, Search, ads and YouTube.
More than 20 years in, there is still tremendous opportunity for Google to help people save time, learn new things, grow their businesses and build stronger communities. I want to thank every Googler around the world for making 2018 a great year for users and our business. With that, I will hand it back over to Ruth.",1910

Sundar, on YouTube, you now have a number of brands in the marketplace between YouTube Premium, TV, YouTube Music. How are you thinking about positioning those brands against the global opportunity, especially in mobile, to consume media on a global scale? And how are you positioning those brands for the opportunity? And then, Ruth, I wanted to come back to a comment on revenue versus expense with respect to YouTube. It sounds like you called out YouTube as strong in the quarter on the revenue side, but is depressed on the expense side. Was that because of licensed content for things like Music and YouTube TV? Or what is ad splits? How should we think about what the drivers were there and how they're permanent versus seasonal in Q4?",133

On the YouTube question, of course, our core effort is around the main YouTube product, and that is what works at scale globally across the world, and we are seeing continued engagement and it's doing very well. We are committed to making sure there is a premium experience on YouTube delivering the content people would want, and YouTube Music is an important part of that as well. So we are investing in both. As you know, YouTube TV is U.S. only, and we are definitely -- it's an exciting product, it's differentiated and has longer value for us because it brings our advertising products together, including being able to serve it across TV. So we're clearly investing in areas where we see opportunity. We are pretty thorough about making sure our investments deliver growth on the other side. And so we monitor it with metrics and -- be it engagement and revenue growth, and we see a lot of opportunity here.",163

Brand advertising does remain the largest part of the business. It's grown at a strong pace. And as I've said in opening comments, we're particularly excited about the significant growth in direct response, both TrueView for action and app promo formats are delivering great value for users and advertisers, and that's driving growth across regions and channels. In terms of the expenses, I think what you're referring to is within other cost of revenues, the primary driver in the fourth quarter was the increase in content acquisition costs due to YouTube growth, and that's both for ad-supported content in what is typically a seasonally strong quarter and also for our newer subscription businesses, which do have higher CAC as a percentage of revenue. We're excited about the growth we're seeing here.",170

Ruth, if I look at the segment operating losses for Other Bets, they were higher, both in the fourth quarter and for the year, '18 over '17. Is it safe to assume that's investments at Waymo? Or can you just flesh out a little bit more for us, if possible, were there other, Other Bets besides Waymo, which were worthy of call-out in terms of greater or decreasing investment, that would be great. And then, for Sundar, I'm just wondering if you could provide us any commentary about how growth at Cloud is going. Any milestones? Talked about the investment there. Ruth did, I think, in terms of headcount growth in technical and sales roles. And for the new leadership that you mentioned, what are the things that the new -- that Thomas Kurian can kind of do at Cloud to accelerate the next phase of growth in that business?",159

In terms of the increase this quarter, as I indicated in the opening comments, we accrued some comp expenses for a number of bets, and that was really to reflect increases in the valuation of equity in certain Other Bets.",102

And so that's definitely something we want to focus on. I think, Diane and Thomas have been working on closely on a transition with a lot of continuity. And you'll continue to see us -- it's very clear to us that our product offerings are ready and differentiated. And so we want to invest and scale our go-to-market, both in terms of direct sales and our channel partnerships. And maybe you will see us focus more on areas where we are clearly seeing returns, be it the geographic regions. We care about the 6 main verticals, where most of the momentum is. And within our product offerings, the 5 major areas, where we have clearly defined product with differentiated features, too. But I'm excited at the traction we are seeing. We're getting large wins, and I look forward to executing here.",170

First, as you think about the strong Google Sites growth, [ 22% ], FX neutral. Can you just help us understand some of the mobile search innovations that you think are really driving things here beyond some of these just underlying secular strength, with the particular focus perhaps on the retail channel and just how you're thinking about the opportunities there? And then, second, Ruth, just wanted to go back to your comment on OpEx. Just wanted to go clarify. Were you saying that headcount growth specifically you think will moderate in '19? Or are you talking about overall CapEx spending?",107

I think, for me, a lot of this has been the clear hard work that's gone into making sure search on mobile works really, really well.

Because maybe that will help think about the pace of growth in your Cloud business.

And GCP does remain one of the fastest-growing businesses across Alphabet. As Sundar said, we've doubled the number of GCP contracts greater than $1 million.

Application platforms. So our ability to help customers deploy cloud-native applications has been a differentiator of customers like Unity, Ubisoft, et cetera. And multi-cloud ability to run cloud services across clouds on-prem turns out to be very important for global multinational companies like HSBC. So we do see a wide variety of stuff.

Just first, I wanted to go back to YouTube. You had a very strong quarter, it sounds like, on branded advertising and now some of these new direct response ads. I was curious, Sundar, as you think about with an innovation focus, what do you see as being 1 or 2 of the biggest opportunities to further improve the quality or the efficacy of the ad product you provide for advertisers on YouTube from here? And then on Waymo had a couple of milestones throughout the last 3 to 6 months.

And TrueView for action is still early. We see great traction, but I think there's a lot more to do. And I think we had a set of features, which we launched last year to make sure it works better. But I think there's a lot more to do. In the long run, I think, for me, YouTube is a place where we see users not only come for entertainment. They come to find information. They're coming to learn about things. They're coming to discover, do research. And so being able to match that intent over time in a way that we can bring the right value for our users and advertisers, I think, is a long-run opportunity.

First, Ruth, could you just provide a little more color on the R&D expense buildup? Anything unusual on there? Just comment on the cadence of that. And then, Sundar, on hardware, that's -- it's been a multiyear effort. It seems like it's accelerated. There's a series of these new products we tried to do a report on to make sure we understood them. Could you talk about how the strategic and maybe the synergistic impacts that you're seeing of hardware on the rest of Google's business, on the rest of Alphabet's business?

The main driver is our ongoing investment in engineers, in particular, in Google, and then, as I said, the sizable increase in accrued comp for Other Bets. And just to build that out a bit more, give you a bit more color, in certain Other Bets, employees are compensated through equity-based programs, and that's because we believe that this alignment of interest is valuable. We do assess valuation on an ongoing basis. And at a minimum, we do a formal valuation assessment once every 12 months or when there's a significant event. And what you're seeing in the fourth quarter is the impact of higher valuation in certain Other Bets. And as we've talked about previously, a goal with the Alphabet structure is to enable us to build new businesses that would make a positive impact and create long-term value. And it's still early days. We're very excited about the opportunities we see. And so what you're seeing is the impact here of valuation.

The main way we do that today for our core products is by using hardware to drive where the rest of the computing ecosystem is. And so we get a very leveraged effect there. But over time, as we scale up our hardware efforts and do it thoughtfully so, it definitely -- when I look at the kind of experience we can deliver, for example, if you look at something like the Google Home Hub and how it delivers a nice experience across Search, Assistant and YouTube and photos when you want it, you can definitely see the glimpse of the future. And so we're investing to realize that.",154

Our conversations with advertisers suggest that products like smart bidding are becoming a pretty increasingly popular tool to add to their bidding strategies. But how has the pickup been among the SMBs, especially among the local advertisers? Do you think you can target that market without a sales force? And secondarily, as we talk to companies transitioning to the Cloud, there's increased talk of collecting data, dealing data lakes as well as analyzing all that data to help their decision-making process, so from your standpoint running Google, do you feel like the current technology you have at your disposal is sophisticated enough to keep up with all of the needs for you to run the company as you collect all the data from across the Internet?",146

First question around using machine learning to help serve advertisers better and be able to reach newer advertisers, SMBs and local advertisers. I definitely think you highlight an exciting opportunity. Whenever we have done work like be it last year or the last couple of years through universal app campaigns or smart shopping campaigns last year, responsive search ads, those are all great examples of where we brought ML. And with that, we made process much easier for advertisers of all sizes and we see an impact. So I think it's a natural extension for us to continue working in that direction, and that will help us reach SMBs and local advertisers better over time. So I do think that's a good opportunity. And on the second part of your question, I want to make sure I understand it. If you're asking about how we invest in our security as a company, I think it's a foundation of how we do everything for the past 20 years. And we always -- we realize a deep responsibility that comes with being stewards of users' data. So everything we design is designed with privacy and security in mind. It's where some of our core investments go, be it securing our data centers, literally the practices we have across the company, the quality and talent in our security teams, and over time, using AI itself to do all this well. So it's a core part of what we do, and we take it very, very seriously.",259

And there were reports there that Walmart decided to leave the program recently. And I think there have been some public comments on social media from Googlers confirming that. So I'd just love to hear a little bit more about that. But maybe more broadly, the traction of shopping actions, and in particular, the price per sale metric that you rolled out with it during the holiday season? And then, Ruth, just a quick one for you. If we could return to your prepared remarks, there were a couple of sort of things to keep in mind that you are highlighting. One was FX going from a tailwind to a headwind. But just before that, you were talking about how new experiences can roll out over time to users. And I just wanted to clarify, were you referencing an experience that's rolling out currently or just generally that, that is a best practice in general for Google?",178

And we have definitely seen a strong traction there. I think we have seen roughly a sevenfold increase in merchants in the program since we launched it. And just in Q4, we announced new partnerships with Best Buy, Nike, Sephora, as an example. And in terms of Walmart, we have -- Walmart is one of our deepest partners and they remain a strategic partner across multiple businesses for us, including Google Ads. And we have efforts underway to work closer together with shopping. But they are definitely a large partner who continue experimenting, and we'll support them in many ways. But I think, overall, I'm excited about the efforts we are doing in shopping, and you will see us focus more there on 2019. We see users come to Google a lot around key shopping moments, and we want to make sure we invest in that experience to get closer to what they want.",170

We've often talked about the fact that we have been and remain committed to long-term revenue growth through innovation. And the point I was trying to underscore is the timing and scale of the impact that's inherently difficult to predict. And so can be inconsistent from quarter-to-quarter. The main point is we remain very excited about the opportunities for users and advertisers in particular, building off of Sundar's comment, as we apply machine learning to solutions.",89

First on Project Stream and YouTube TV. Just wondering how important it will be to invest in original content as well as how you might view the rollout of 5G as catalyzing consumer adoption of these services? And then, on the Discover feed, I know that's still pretty new, but curious if you have any color on usage and engagement to date, and if there's any way you expect to monetize that feed in the near future?",82

We think it'll help us drive the newer computing platforms we are working on. And I do think services like that will be a point of inflection as 5G rolls out as well. So I think it is a virtuous cycle. So we are excited. Early feedback on our Project Stream experience has been super positive, and so we are looking to build upon that. And you will see us do more there in 2019. On Discover, I think, traction has been, for us, we measure user engagement and satisfaction and happiness on anything new we do, and the metrics have been really strong. And we obviously -- we offer the best experience today on our products like Pixel Made by Google products. And we are looking to scale that up to reach more users. But we think we have a strong product there, and I think it's very synergistic to the search experience. And so we are looking to bring the best of both to our users, and you'll see us reach more users in 2019.",204

First, looks like Google core margins were down about 3 points and what was an easier comp. So just wondering if you can give us any thoughts on how the core advertising business is doing in there. We know there's a lot of investment in Cloud and hardware and YouTube TV. But just would like to get an update on the health of the advertising business margins and any thoughts on if you'll ever do segment disclosure? And then, the second question is just on the Cloud strategy, there's been a pretty big leadership change. Just wondering if there's any new strategies or new things you'll be doing this year with the Cloud related to the management change? And I look forward to the Cloud conference in April.",132

So in terms of overall Google margins, I think the main point you're seeing in the margins is we continue to see tremendous opportunity across Google, and so we're investing to support long-term revenue and earnings growth. We've talked a lot in this call already about the importance of machine learning, and it is a key component of incremental investment, particularly in CapEx for our technical infrastructure to support the existing businesses, but also the newer ones, and that's kind of flowing through here. We've talked on prior calls that we're very mindful of the fact that CapEx turns into depreciation, which is why I'd single this out. We're continuing to see tremendous opportunity in the ads business, search and ads businesses. And beyond machine learning, we're further investing to continue to enhance the experience for users and advertisers, and that's across mobile desktop and YouTube. So for example, a big priority in 2018 was expanding the availability of content for what we call the next billion user markets, which are, for us, a really important area. We're excited about the growth and the opportunity to deliver experiences across markets. We're also investing to enable more visual ways of finding information, such as photos and videos. And then, we're investing aggressively in our newer businesses within Google, particularly Cloud and hardware, as Sundar has already said. So what you're seeing reflected through in the margins on the cost of revenue side is the impact of the product mix that we've talked about, a big part of that is the ongoing growth in YouTube. And then, on the OpEx side, investing in engineers, in particular for Google and as well as on the sales and marketing side, the increased headcount to support not just ads, but in particular, Cloud.",299

I answered it around Anthony and Heather's question. But to add a little bit more color why, it's the change in leadership, but it was a well-planned transition. And so Diane and Thomas together planned 2019. And the big things you're going to see are continued focus on Global 5000 companies. We are definitely seeing traction with large multiyear contracts, multi-million dollar contracts there. So you'll see us focus there. We'll continue to invest in and expand our sales and distribution channels to meet customer demand. So that's going to be an important area for 2019. But mostly, being highly focused on the 15 countries, 6 industries and the 5 major solution areas that we think will have the most impact and directing most of our resources to towards those efforts is probably something you will see continued emphasis in 2019.",148

First, there's a lot of discussion right now about alternatives to Google Play and Apple's App Store for distribution, and some of the large developers are starting to come up with these workarounds around the App Store fees. So I guess, just philosophically, how do you think about the 30%? Do you think that's the right long-term rate for Google Play? And then, Ruth, coming back to the headcount and CapEx growth moderating comments. So you had expenses growing well in excess of revenue for some time in the core Google segment, and 2018 was the lowest operating income growth since you started disclosing the segments. So are you just flagging this as a change of direction? Is this a material change? Or is this just a small amount of moderation in 2019?",136

And we invest a lot in our infrastructure to continuously make sure their overall experience is safe and results in high engagement and for the developers back. So I think there's a value exchange there and it's been the industry standard. And so I think we'll continue down that path, and -- but obviously, always adapt to where the market is.",89

I've already laid out the focus areas and our commitment to continue to invest to support long-term revenue and earnings growth. And just wanted to put a fine point on both CapEx and headcount. So on CapEx, as I indicated in the opening remarks, we do expect the rate of year-on-year CapEx growth will slow meaningfully. So with the scale of our business and with our focus on user experience, it does require CapEx. We are committed to continue to invest in CapEx to deliver on that. In terms of the mix, we expect to see more of an uptick in 2019 in data center investments relative to servers. But the point which you asked in your question, the year-on-year growth rate will moderate meaningfully. And then in terms of headcount, we're -- I was just trying to make clear that the growth in headcount will moderate somewhat here just so that there's no interpolation.",164

Yet in the last 4 years, M&A has been right around $3 billion, which is well below your peers.

We have a very high bar. And so to me, it's been more about us finding the right fit rather than being constrained by anything in particular. But I do think it's always an important part of our strategy and we have done great acquisitions in the past, things like YouTube and Android were big acquisitions for us.

Just the magnitude of spend, I think, goes back to what probably investors were most surprised by. And it sounds like, from your perspective, you don't really look at the margin structure as having any floor, you're just looking at this, as you said, there's tremendous long-term opportunity that you need to make these investments now.

We're very mindful of the CapEx impacts on free cash flow and earnings growth. And so we're trying to get it right. Overinvesting, underinvesting, neither of those works for long-term value creation, but we are very mindful of the pace here and trying to lay out with more specificity how we're looking at the opportunity set where -- and making trade-offs where we can.",103
