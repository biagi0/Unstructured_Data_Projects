Thank you, Jennifer. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to today's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. With us are Larry Page, Chief Executive Officer; Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Nikesh Arora, Senior Vice President and Chief Business Officer.

You can also visit our Google+ Investor Relations page for the latest company news and updates. Please check it out. This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website later today.
So let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding Google's future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinion only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results.
Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this call, such as operating income and operating margin, are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation. We have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Larry.",339

Thank you for joining us this afternoon. We ended 2012 with a strong quarter. Revenue was up 36% year-on-year and 8% quarter-on-quarter. And we hit $50 billion in revenue for the first time last year -- not a bad achievement in just a decade and a half. We have talked a lot about excellence and velocity over the last year. While many claim it's my nature never to be satisfied, we've actually made real progress creating more beautiful and more intuitive products. Take Search, Search engine would understand exactly what you mean and give you exactly what you want. Our Knowledge Graph brings that much closer. Search for Nikola Tesla, and you'll get information about this great inventor that is beautifully displayed right from the results page. His basic bio, books he wrote, his photo, with no extra work needed. And we even recommend information about other inventors, such as Edison and Marconi, that you can easily browse through, again, right from the results page. And last quarter, we launched the Knowledge Graph in 7 new languages including Spanish, Japanese and Russian. This is hard work. It's about way more than translating the words on the page. Google has to understand millions of different engine keys as well as their meaning and context.
I'm also excited about the progress we've made with voice search. You're in your car -- sadly, it's still a car you have to drive and it's not electric -- and you're running out of gas. Just pick up your phone and ask Google for directions to the nearest gas station.
[Audio Gap]
While we can take the hassle right out of your life. Our long-term investments in Google Maps have really paid off. The team has worked tremendously hard to create the most accurate and comprehensive maps in the world. Driving country by country may have seemed crazy a few years back. Today, it's totally obvious because the location is core to your Search experience. And with Google Maps for iOS, we have reinvigorated our product. It's more intuitive and beautiful and users love it. Google Maps for iOS was downloaded over 10 million times in the first 48 hours.
[Audio Gap]
Or at an Apple's App Store best free apps of 2012, including YouTube, Chrome, Google Search and Gmail. I've always believed that computers should do the hard work so you can get on with the things that matter in life: living, learning and loving. So it's exciting to see our progress with Google Now, launched earlier in the year, gives you information before you even have to ask. It will now proactively provide your flight times or your boarding pass or directions to your next appointment. It will even suggest interesting places to visit nearby. As we discussed in the last earnings call, we now live in a multiscreen world. People carry a supercomputer in their pocket all the time. In fact, we feel naked without our smartphone and many users have more than one device: a laptop, a phone and a tablet. We are living in uncharted territory. It's a new kind of computing environment. Everyone is really excited about our technology and spending a lot of money on devices, driving faster adoption than we have ever seen before.
It's been a long time in computing since we had this rate of change. It probably hasn't happened since the birth of personal computing. It's why we put so much focus on devices. They've been one of our biggest bets in the last few years, along with the software to go with these devices, Chrome and Android. Our goal here is to push the user experience forward, so you get the best of Google in one easy-to-use package.
The Samsung Chromebook, which we launched in October for the amazing price of $249, was a holiday highlight. I loved mine. It's super easy to use and it almost maintains itself. Open a Chrome tab on the phone -- on your phone and everything syncs on your laptop with no extra effort required.
We also launched 2 new Nexus devices to rave reviews, the Nexus 4 and Nexus 10. And 6 months after we first unveiled it, the Nexus 7 continues to define the 7-inch tablet category, making many best of 2012 and the holiday gift lists. Clearly, there's work to be done managing our supply better, as well as building a great customer experience, and that is priority for the teams. But considering all the excitement over the holidays for our devices, it is clear, there is a tremendous opportunity delivering great value with amazing and simple user experience.
Google Play, another big bet that's on fire. The growth is tremendous. This quarter, we signed deals with Time, as well as Warner Music Group, so we now provide content from all the top Hollywood film studios, music labels and magazine publishers. We have not even reached Google Play's first anniversary.
Many of you have questions about Motorola, and Patrick will go into the details of how we're accounting for the business so that you can get your models right. I am excited about the business. In today's multiscreen world, the opportunities are endless. Think about your device. Battery life is a huge issue. You shouldn't have to worry about constantly recharging your phone. When you drop your phone, it shouldn't go splat. Everything should be done even faster and easier. There's real potential to invent new and better experiences. Our CEO of Motorola, Dennis, has built a world-class team, and they're working on these opportunities. It's still early days, but I am excited about the innovative way they're approaching product development and the speed of their execution. And they recently signed an agreement to sell Motorola's Home division for $2.35 billion.
2012 was an amazing year for Google, and we're all set for a great 2013. I am incredibly optimistic about the opportunities we have as a technology company focused on user benefit. Every day, I come to work excited about more and bigger opportunities. And every day, we work to have more and better organized Googlers, those are our employees, improving the execution and overall capability to build world-changing products.
I know it sounds funny, but with the ambitious plans we have, we are only just getting started. Our biggest challenge in this area is focus. We've faced so many opportunities. It's always important to thoughtfully invest in the right areas where we can have the greatest impact. We don't want to spread ourselves too thin, but I'm quite optimistic that as we get better and better in managing our product areas, we will be able to continue to grow our ambitions. That's why I'm here, and that's one reason why Googlers love working at Google.
Googlers remain our greatest asset, and we're working hard to recruit and retain the best employees. We've had a great start to the year by being named Fortune Magazine's the Best Company to Work For in the U.S. for the fourth time. We've worked hard to create a company where everyone is part of the family, and where the work is challenging and rewarding, so we're really happy to get that recognition. I want to finish by thanking all the Googlers who have made this possible, and now, I'll turn it over to Patrick. Thank you.",1238

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. So let's dive in by reviewing the detail of our overall business financial performance. As we noted in a blog post last week, the Motorola Home business has been presented separately as discontinued operations in our financial tables. This makes typical quarter-on-quarter or year-on-year comparisons a little more challenging this quarter, but I will provide some color throughout my comments. So without further ado, here we go. Our gross total consolidated revenue grew 36% year-over-year to $14.4 billion and 8% quarter-over-quarter. As I mentioned, this figure excludes the Motorola Home revenue. Had we included Motorola Home, gross total consolidated revenue would have been $15.2 billion, a growth rate of 44% year-over-year and 8% quarter-over-quarter.
Google's stand-alone gross revenue grew 22% year-over-year to $12.9 billion and 12% quarter-over-quarter. Our Google website revenue was up 18% year-over-year to $8.6 billion, and up 12% quarter-over-quarter, with strengths across most geographies and industries. Our Google Network revenue grew 19% year-over-year to $3.4 billion and 10% quarter-over-quarter. Finally, other revenue grew 102% year-over-year to $829 million and 24% quarter-over-quarter, driven by Play hardware and content sales. And were it not for fluctuations in currencies, Google's stand-alone revenue would have, in fact, grown 24% year-over-year.
Turning to Motorola Mobility, its gross revenue was $1.5 billion for the quarter. And once again, had we included the Home business, the total gross revenue for the combined Motorola entities would have been $2.3 billion. As Larry mentioned, we're really pleased with the velocity of change at Motorola, but it's still at the very beginning of the Motorola Google story. No one should be surprised if results from this segment are variable for quite a while as we restructure the business. And remember, we inherited a 12- to 18-month product pipeline that we're still working through.
At Google now, our global aggregate paid click growth was strong, up 24% year-over-year and up 9% quarter-over-quarter. As we said many times, there are several factors that impact the CPC click dynamics, including FX, geo mix, product changes, et cetera. But this quarter specifically, it's worth mentioning that we implemented some policy changes that lowered our paid click growth, improved our CPC growth and lowered Network revenue for the quarter. Nikesh will speak more about this in a few minutes, but the bottom line is that these policies are part of many constant changes that are focused on what's good for the user and advertisers, so we believe they're good for Google's business in the long term, too.
Our aggregate cost-per-click was down 6% year-over-year and up 2% quarter-over-quarter. Once again, remember, that currency headwinds also had a moderate year-on-year negative impact on CPC in Q4. In fixed FX terms, in fact, aggregate CPC would have been down only 4% year-over-year and up 1% quarter-over-quarter.
Turning to geographic performance of Google stand-alone business, we continue to see strong performance in the U.S. and the U.K., while the economic situation of Southern Europe continues to impact our Rest of World growth somewhat. In our earnings slides, which you can find on our Investor Relations website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and Rest of World to show the impact of FX and the benefits from our hedging programs, so please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.
Revenue from the U.S. was up 20% year-over-year to $6 billion. The U.K. was up 23% year-over-year to $1.3 billion, which includes an immaterial real benefit from our hedging program. In fact, in fixed FX terms, the U.K. grew 22%. Non-U.S. revenue excluding the U.K. accounted for 44% of our total revenue or $5.6 billion, up 24% year-over-year and includes a $36 million benefit from our hedging program. And in fixed FX terms, Rest of World grew 28%.
So now if I come back to an aggregate level for the total consolidated business, our other cost of revenue was $3 billion in Q4, excluding SBC and Motorola restructuring. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $4.1 billion, which also exclude SBC and Motorola restructuring, and our non-GAAP operating profit was $4.3 billion in Q4, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 30%.
For stand-alone Google, traffic acquisition costs were $3.1 billion or 25% of total advertising revenue. Our other cost of revenue was $1.8 billion, excluding $101 million of stock-based compensation. The increase year-over-year was driven by equipment costs, including the costs associated with hardware sales on Play, but also content-acquisition costs and our data center costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $3.6 billion, excluding stock-based compensation of $576 million. And finally, non-GAAP operating profit was $4.4 billion in Q4, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 34%.
One last note, depreciation and amortization expense on property, plant and equipment for stand-alone Google was $493 million for this quarter.
At Motorola Mobility, total non-GAAP operating expenses, including cost of revenue were $1.7 billion. And keep in mind that intangible amortization expense attributed to the stand-alone Google and Motorola Mobility, they are included in these non-GAAP measures. And of the $289 million in intangible amortization expense this quarter, $153 million was the result of the acquisition of Motorola, and of which, $116 million is allocated to Google and $37 million allocated to Motorola Mobility. And as a result, the non-GAAP operating loss for Motorola Mobility was $152 million in Q4, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of negative 10% for that segment.
Let me turn to headcount. Headcount for the consolidated business increased by roughly 300 people in Q4. Keep in mind that consolidated headcount includes Motorola Home until it is divested, and Home comprises roughly 1/3 of the total Motorola headcount. Stand-alone Google added about 1,400 people. And in total, the consolidated company ended the quarter at around 53,900 full-time employees.
Our effective tax rate this quarter was 18%. The change from last quarter reflects the mix and shifts of earnings between domestic and international subsidiary and hedges.
Now let me turn quickly to cash management. Other income and expense was $152 million for the quarter, which reflects realized gains on investments and interest income, offset by the continued impact of our FAS 133 expense from our hedging program, and for more details on OI&E, please again refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website.
Our operating cash flow was very strong, $4.7 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $1 billion versus last quarter of $872 million. The majority of CapEx spent was related to production equipment, dater center construction and facilities-related purchases. We're very pleased with our free cash flow, which was at $3.7 billion, and please note that cash flow and CapEx both include the Home business for now.
So finally, the success of our products and our continued strong performance as portrayed by Larry's comments continues to give us the confidence to fund our strategic growth in areas such as Search, YouTube, Android, Chrome, as well as in our overall infrastructure with a view to the long term.
And I'll hand it off now to Nikesh, who will cover more details of our business performance in the quarter. And after these remarks, we'll open it up for the phone lines and questions. Nikesh?",1207
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2013",2013-01-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,4133.0,404094.0,19064326.0,Presenter Speech,Nikesh Arora,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Patrick. As Larry and Patrick have mentioned, our business had a strong quarter, with a $12.9 billion revenue in Google stand-alone alone. We're very pleased with our year-on-year growth of 22%. I think our advertising business is firing on all cylinders. Companies of all sizes continue to embrace online advertising, and the major players are increasing their investments. In fact, here's an interesting tidbit. Across Search, Display, YouTube and more, our top 25 advertisers are now spending an average of over $150 million per year. Delighted with that number.
Our core business continues to be strong. Our investments in mobile and shopping have passed the holiday season test with flying colors. As Larry mentioned, our vision is for Search to understand exactly what you mean and give you exactly what you want on all devices that you live with throughout your day.
Talking about all devices, our queries from a wide range of new devices are continuing to power our overall growth in Search volumes. Distinctions between devices, form factors are becoming less meaningful, particularly between desktop, laptops and tablets.
Search performed very well last quarter, during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. We saw a greater proportion of queries with commercial intent and higher RPMs in areas like retail, computers and electronics. We'll also set up features to make shopping more stress-free and more fun. I don't know if you've had a chance to look at it, but there's some interesting things like 360-degree toy imagery and integrating retailer's promotions and discounts into our shopping product.
Our investments in Search, particularly in mobile and shopping, are really helping clients. Now let me give you an example. Front End Audio, this is a company that offers recording and light, sound equipment sales. Sometime in mid-September, they deployed Product Listing Ads. Within weeks, these ads were accounting for about 15% of their total sales. They also tripled their clickthrough rates and also reduced their cost per conversion by 75% to 80%. This is great for us because it's a product we believe is in the interest of the end user. It is a great product for Front End Audio. It improves their economics and improves our economics.
Major retailers like RadioShack and Home Depot, they use our mobile ads to reach shoppers across devices, including Click-to-Call, Click-to-Map. For Home Depot, mobile commerce sales quadrupled in the year.
Patrick mentioned some changes in policy and enforcement. These enforcements have the effect of reducing ad clicks on the sites of certain AdSense for search partners. These policy updates are part of our ongoing work to improve user experiences on Google and on sites and services using Google Search. Since these policies improve the experience of both users and advertisers, we firmly believe they're good for our business in the long term.
Switching gears to YouTube and Display, we continue to make strong progress here. Video is a key language that brands speak, so it continues to be a key area of focus for us. Videos are baked into the core of all of our products, whether it's Search, Display, mobile, and of course, YouTube itself. YouTube is well positioned for the changing viewing habits of today's multiscreen world. The site's new redesign is focused on channels, and that has led to a major increase in engagement. In 2012, viewers watched over 4 billion hours of video on YouTube a month, and it's now available across over 400 million mobile devices, gaming consoles and Connected TVs in addition to your desktop.
YouTube creators continue to wow and attract audiences. Outside estimates say that, that video which I'm sure all of you have seen of Psy, his hit song, Gangnam Style, now the most-watched YouTube video of all time, it generated over $8 million in all-in advertising deals. YouTube partner revenue has doubled for the fourth consecutive year and thousands of channels are now making 6 figures annually.
YouTube is not only home for creators, but it's also a home for major brand advertisers. On YouTube, our top 100 global advertisers spent over 50% more in 2012 than then they did in 2011. Clearly, this is a strong signal of the power of YouTube to reach audiences. What's interesting is a significant factor in the growth of YouTube has been our TrueView skippable ad format. Agencies and marketers are seeing real benefits. You only pay for the ad if viewers watch them. In fact, 70% of our in-stream ads are now TrueView formats. And this quarter, TrueView came to Xbox, the iPad and the Wii. Putting all our advertiser solutions together is really helping us deliver great returns and develop close relationships with major clients worldwide, like McDonald's, who this quarter launched always-on Search and YouTube campaign to increase customer awareness and favorability towards their brand across all channels.
In Q4, we signed a new global deal with L'Oreal, under which we work to promote their brands using Google's digital offerings across the world in Display, Search, YouTube and more. While our complete solution for marketers not only applies to businesses, but we saw this in this quarter's 2012 election, from the presidency to the local races, Google's mobile search, video and measurement products were at the center of a huge number of Democratic, Republican initiatives campaigns. Our election advertising revenues increased by 5x over the 2008 elections. Here's an interesting statistic for you. In 9 of the top 11 senate races for the U.S., the candidate who spent more with Google was elected.
Well, 2012 was not -- whether channel to timing, bringing the DoubleClick Google ad technology stack together is really helping our clients increase their direct, indirect and programmatic CPMs. Our --

continues to grow at an impressive pace. It's been gaining traction across some of the largest companies in the world. New customers this quarter include Nintendo, the Canadian Broadcasting Company, Shaw Industries both

Of these -- in the context where YouTube is growing really fast based on your comments. So what have been the major drivers of these continued decelerations of Google websites? And how should -- should I expect similar growth rate declines going forward? And secondly, on TAC, it seems that TAC for distribution as a percentage of Google website's revenues grew less than what we had seen earlier in this last several quarters in 2012. What has driven the stabilization of this TAC, our distribution TAC and how should we think about distribution TAC in the future?",140

But overall, I think that we're very pleased with the growth around 20%. You're right that in the last quarter there was a bit more headwinds than this quarter, but overall, the core Search business is doing well and driven really by the strength in mobile and we're obviously additionally pleased with the YouTube business, particularly the watch page. So despite the fact that there's quite a bit of FX noise in there and that carries over, that FX noise does carry over 
[Audio Gap]
overall, I think that we're very pleased with the overall growth. In terms of TAC, I think that that's the case where, obviously, our mobile revenue is growing, and it is having impact on our mix shift, and that's really the fundamental trend that you see in TAC rather than a change in the TAC rate of any particular partner. So that's really what's going on there. But I think, as we said in the previous calls, we think of TAC in a way -- there's a really positive story in TAC which is, it is distribution, and it's worth paying for. This is the positive side of our business having much more distribution of our apps across, and that's true also for mobile. So we're really thrilled that all of the mobile is thriving to the extent it is. And remember that, finally, TAC is not a new phenomenon for us. I mean, we've always dealt with distribution partners and will continue to experience and manage it to make sure that it drives revenue and profit for both parties in a balanced way. So nothing new here, but really excited by the trends.",306

The first on Knowledge Graph, can you just give us a high-level view on where we are in terms of its implementation and how widely it's rolled out? And specifically, how, if at all, it impacts the economics of Google's businesses? And then second on Google Shopping, the PLAs and interface changes I think significant improve the user experience, but a consumer still needs to leave the site to transact.

I think that we're still -- we rolled out Knowledge Graph fairly recently, and I think we're still in the early stages of that. I think that I mentioned some of the internationalization work that we did which is hard work, and I think we'll continue to do that. I mean, I guess we're -- there's still a 1% or something of where we should be, so I'm really excited about what we can do in the future. I think the economics point, I think that the way we look at it is, we provide much better answers for people, really grow the business. So we increased the number of times that you might want information because you know you're going to get great answers or increase the different modalities you can get answers like voice or mobile or so on. So I'm super excited about that and then generally we monetize those things. So I won't comment on the specifics of that, but I think we're quite excited about that. The Knowledge Graph is run on the right-hand side where the ads also run. There could be some short-term impacts on that, but I think the primary thing is getting people better answers is really good for our business. Google Shopping, I guess you're asking about Product Listing Ads. I think that -- we're also in the very early stages of that. We just rolled out Google Shopping.

And now that you own ITA and Frommer's and Zagat and you've built out travel explorer or Flight Explorer and Hotel Finder, can you talk a bit more about the strategy with travel in terms of the problem you're trying solve there relative to the historic experience of Google sending you offsite for depth of experience? And then secondly, Patrick, I think last quarter, you gave the FX-neutral CPC down 8%, I'm wondering if you can give that same number for this quarter, for the fourth quarter?",120

I'll take the first part. And I think that we've always -- we've always done a very good job of sending people to the right places, and I don't think that being able to answer very complex information needs means necessarily that we wouldn't send people off to other sites. So I think demanding for us is to be able to understand a complex problem. Like I think I gave some example like, finding a hotel that's near, if you're creating a lot of logistics for the flights, for a vacation you might take, and the hotel and the activities you wanted to do, kind of solving that all at once in the way a human assistant might be able to do. And you still might use other parties to do that transaction, so I don't necessarily believe the assumption of your question, but we are looking at those things. That was more of an example. I think Google's aspiration is to be able to do that for any area, not just travel, but -- and we've been working with as many companies as we can in trying to organize the world's information. And where we needed to acquire companies, we've done some of that or work with other companies or make deals or whatever we need to do, so we're trying to be practical about it, and I think we do have some amazing assets in travel and mapping and so on and I think those things will pay off for us in the future, providing great experience. So Patrick?",267

Could you talk broadly, Larry or Nikesh, about Google Maps and where you think the monetization of that is today where -- versus where you think it potentially could be? And then, Larry, I think you were quoted recently with some comments on competitive products out in the market. Any comments in particular on graphical search as it's been announced, and to what extent you think that's complementary or competitive with Google's core search?",76
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2013",2013-01-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,4133.0,404094.0,19064341.0,Answer,Larry Page,,Executives,19,"Well, I can say a little bit about Maps. This is Larry. I think that people are just focused on monetization of Maps, but it's important to think about, for me, to tell you the history of Maps. We started working on Maps a long, long time ago, and because we thought it was critical to your search experience, to actually finding what you're looking for. And if we look at our components of queries that are geographically related, it's a huge number and always has been. And so again, to understand those queries, we have to understand where things are in the real world. And so that's been always a core part of our main web search and we already make quite a bit of money on web search. And I already told you that was a significant amount of queries, so actually we already made quite a bit of money on Maps in that way as a part of our core business, and a significant part which really allowed us to make those investments. We're in the early stages of monetization on the Maps themselves. And I think we're doing some interesting things there. I think we'll continue to do that. I think it's likely to be a great source of revenue, but still in the early stages on the Maps, but on the Search side, we have significant revenue already. I think you're asking about Graph Search, which was recently announced. I think that when we think about Search, our mission has been to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. And we've been at that for quite a while and made investments in all sorts of areas like Maps that I just mentioned, which turned out to be really important, and that's the way we think about it. There's Knowledge Search, there's all sorts of investments we made, gathering different kinds of data, making sure we have everyone's data, and we'll continue to do that. And that business has changed a lot. I mean, only 10 years ago, where you thought Google should do, it's almost unrecognizable compared to what it does now, and the number of things that it understands. So we see just tremendous opportunity to make better products for users that really understand their needs and really grow opportunity. And you look at [indiscernible], for example, which we've also made huge investments in, the importance of that to mobile for finding things, I mentioned you can ask Google where the nearest gas station is with your phone while you're driving on your fumes and it'll just work perfectly. And so I think we see that as just all sorts of aspects to those problems, and we've been very focused on that. Now it's another great example. There's tremendous innovation, no question. And that's pretty incredible. I'm super excited about that, so I feel very confident of our core business of organizing things, finding things, getting people information. I couldn't be more excited about that.",505

I mean, I know this isn't something that Google typically does, but just -- I think it would be helpful for investors if there's any way to kind of put a band or a threshold around what the potential operating losses could be at Motorola. And then second question for Larry. Larry, around the commercialization of driverless cars, I'm just wondering if you could give us an update on that and your test that you're doing in Nevada. And then I'm wondering if you could sort of talk about Android as part of that. It sounds like the automotive electronic suppliers are recognizing the importance of Android for the infotainment systems in those cars, and so maybe you can talk a little bit about that opportunity for Android as well.",169

I think that, while I would say I saw Motorola another way, Patrick, so and I mean I think we're still excited about them in this. I think that we're really in the early days of Motorola, with respect to Google's acquisition of it and I'll let Tim give you some details. I think that driverless cars, I think, obviously, it's still early to answer, although I'm really excited about what the team has got done and what that can mean for ordinary people, and really substantially improving mobility and potentially really reducing the land area that we have to devote for cars, which is incredible amounts in cities. It can really reduce parking. We're looking at that even for Google, just as a major cost to reduce our parking costs and our facilities by having the automated cars park more densely and serve more people. And I think those things will be amazing deals. Android, now I think that we're still -- that's a little bit different than the automated cars, I think, that Android won't be used in cars, probably before we get automated cars into the mainstream. And I think people are really excited about that due to the incredible success of Android. And we're obviously working with those manufacturers to help make that happen well. So Patrick?",234
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2013",2013-01-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,4133.0,404094.0,19064345.0,Answer,Patrick Pichette,,Executives,23,"Yes, just a bit of color on Motorola, right. First, just to remind everybody, we do care about profitability, and that is our goal, with every one of the areas where we invest. And we've said that before, and we're not in the business of losing money with Motorola or even cross-subsiding it. But we are really 180 days into this journey, and we've made a ton of progress, including the sale of the Home business and, as I mentioned earlier also, we're kind of outsourcing our manufacturing and so much more that has been done and the restructurings that you've heard earlier in the late summer and early fall. So and I just want to remind everybody that we inherited kind of 12 to 18 months of product pipeline that we have to work through, and that's the reality of the business. That's the kind of overhaul and then kind of rebuild the new product pipeline where Dennis' team has kind of been really focused on, in addition to the restructuring. It does take time before it shows up. Having said that, finally, on the financials themselves, Anthony, it's really worth noting that Motorola is also hindered by a portion of the amortization of intangibles due to the acquisition. So the losses that you see are somewhat inflated by this amortization of intangibles, which we've decided to kind of put through the P&L on a non-GAAP basis. So all in all, when we look at the losses, like this quarter, a negative $150 million, you take out the amortization, these are non-consequential losses, relative to either Google, or the kind of turnaround we're seeing and the kind of the positive momentum. So that's why Larry started by saying we're really optimistic, but it does take time, and that's why I'm also saying, be ready for a lot of fluctuations in our P&L over the coming quarters. It's just the nature of the beast when you reinvent the business.",329

And then, as you look at your mobile business as far as the growth of queries or the growth of revenues, and you look at it relative to maybe in-commerce growth, do you think you're gaining share on the market?

I think we have tremendous growth with Android, and I think we're serving our users really well. We're building amazing products that are getting better at a rapid rate, the rate of improvements is also very high. So I feel pretty comfortable about my focus, mostly on our products and assume the usage will follow the great products. I think that, in some sense also, we consider mobile an extension of our desktop usage, too. I mean, we have built a lot of great products that people use. Their desktop, like Maps, right, which have transferred very well. And I think that, one thing I've been amazed by, Chrome on my Android phone, Chrome is just an amazing experience, like I don't feel like using my Nexus 4 or other modern smartphones from the latest generation. And I think that those phones are like, almost like using a desktop last year, or something like that. And so I think the experiences are improving a lot and very, very quickly. So [indiscernible] some uncharted territory because of the rapid rate of change in these things, but I'm very, very optimistic about it. And I think the CPCs will improve as these devices are improving as well. And obviously, I mentioned that we are working to simplify our ad systems for advertisers, in the light of all these changes and we're -- I'm excited about our plans there. We don't have anything to announce today, but I am very excited about our prints [ph] there and I think that's -- we will make rapid progress in that area.

So I think it's a little bit hard to predict those things. I think you should ask us to call whatever is necessary to make the best business outcome. Having said that, I think we have said in the past, we have a lot of people, we're growing at the edge of what's reasonable, just in terms of scaling. I think that's still the case. I would say it has moderated, but I'd also say that we've also slowed our international growth and product involvement a bit, which is probably having some impact on that.

We've gone from really highs where we were above $1 billion and then it's gone all the way down to a few hundred million dollars. Now it's kind of moved back up. So it's a real testimony that it is lumpy, because as you add, just to use the example of a data center, as you'll see CapEx because we fill with equipment a data center, but once a data center is full, and then we have to put an extension to the data center, then you're into concrete again and power, so it's just the nature of our business, certainly on the core businesses, are quite lumpy. So without giving any guidance forward, we have been, as you've seen in this quarter, $1 billion of CapEx, really very much aligned with the excitement we have around our products, whether they be social, whether they be pictures, whether they be -- all of the areas that you've heard Larry talk about. And so that's why we're fueled, as I said, in my comments, we're fueled by the positive momentum we have in many areas of the company, and we believe now is the time to invest and that's why we're doing it with confidence; discipline but confidence.",239

So we have worked harder to manage that smoothness so that we're not -- we have recruiters in place, and hiring staff in place for the long term and make sure we're providing a good, consistent business code there, just makes us operationally run better and we've probably been managing that a bit more tightly.",84

And then Patrick, the follow-up on TAC, the year-over-year growth rate for Google website's TAC decelerated from 45% to 43%, subtle, but there's probably some organic items in there that are helping it. Is that a function of smartphone installation growth rolling over, or any partnership agreements or something else? Can you just give us a little color on that deceleration?",108

I think Larry said just a few quarters ago that we have -- slowly have been working, over time, to try and make it feel like a common experience across multiple screens for advertisers, because advertisers are more interested in the business benefit of advertising with us, as opposed to specifically which form factor or which device they invest with us on. So our teams have been working really hard in the last few quarters to try and get us to a point where we can make it simple for the advertiser, where they come to us with a business problem, and we're able to solve it for them, irrespective of device, irrespective of form factor or property that they're going to have to advertise on. So from that perspective, I think things are going in the right direction. As far as specifically how many advertisers have mobile landing pages that they can send their users to, that number is not as much as we'd like it. Obviously, we've had programs we've talked about in the past earning calls, like GoMo, where we'd help businesses go mobile, so those efforts are bearing fruit, but broadly speaking, I think we're happy with the progress we've made, both on getting advertisers to be more on mobile sites and also what we're doing from a campaign management perspective to get more and more campaigns that can run across all devices and form factors.",267

Sometimes those are too simple, and I find I get kind of frustrated on my phone, sometimes when I hit these mobile-specific sites, because I'm using a modern Nexus 4 that can actually deal with a full site, and I just find it confusing. So I think, as an industry, we need to improve these experiences. Now I think a better time, but I'm, I'd almost say that we should be designing for mobile. The kind of mobile phones that we have now are the state of the art or a little bit beyond and that those experiences should work on all devices pretty well.

Do you see any prospect for being able to enter some of those markets in the medium term, or do you think that the business is still going to be geographically constrained?

I mean, I don't think this is a long time in coming. And I think, as I've said before, there's a lot of advantages to mobile, they know location accurately, you can call somebody easily. You have a camera, you can kind of hang out, talk the business. You can be notified instantly. There's just a lot of things about mobile that are amazing opportunities for advertisers and for businesses. So I expect that to revolutionize how people do marketing, and we're working hard on that.

I think what's important to understand is the reason we decided to not operate in China was because we believe that we wanted to make sure that users are able to have unfettered access to our products. And the products where we believe they have ability to access in an unfettered fashion, we do operate in the market, it's only the ones where they aren't able to access it the way we'd like to.

And we began to notice that there were sites and pages where we had too many ads in a page, so it became more restrictive, and updated our policies for better enforcement. And that has resulted in higher quality results for end-users. It has reduced, in some cases, the monetization that some of our partners are seeing as a result of this enforcement, and hence you're seeing the impact on the numbers. We just announced this policy sometime early this quarter, in the past quarter that we just went through. So you are going to see the impact over the next few quarters. We've also implemented more stringent policies around downloadable apps and that's why, I think, both those effects are going to stay with us for the year, but I say, we think in the long term, it's the right answer for us, it's the right answer for users and it's the right answer for advertisers. So we think it's a good thing to do.",220

We've been doing things like that for a while, just making sure we're focused on user experience in our advertising products, and we found that, that's been a very good long-term focus for our business, that have really benefited us. So I think that's kind of the ordinary course of it there. I think that you mentioned bridging online ads with offline transactions. As I said, like, mobile will increase the value of these kind of businesses. That's an example of it, like you can actually measure if somebody gets an offer that they redeemed it in a real store, or they went to the store, whatever it is. And so we're very excited about that. But we're still in the early stages of really making those solutions work for consumers, advertisers and so on.

We're still in the very early stages of it.

It's got a lot of press because we've started to roll out, we started the implementation and the installs. We're growing up in terms of installs weeks after week, and people just love the product. So you're absolutely right, Heather, that we are really excited about this product. And it's been a great success overall. So while we're going to continue -- and as we've said all along, and here's another great example of when we're -- it's not a hobby, we really think that we should be making business, good business with this opportunity, and we're going to continue to look at the possibility expanding. But right now, we just got to nail, because we're in the early days, we just got to nail Kansas City. It's a perfect place for us to kind of debug all the elements of the product and the experience for the users.

I mean it's, I guess the best way to predict the future is to make it, so that's what we're trying to do. I don't have anything specific to announce this time, but I couldn't be more excited about some of the things I mentioned, like Google Now, not really understanding what your question is before you have it. I mean, wouldn't that be great at the earnings call if we just answered all of your questions without you asking them? That would be a lot less work for you all. So I think some of those things could really be reality. And I think, if you look at knowledge panels, I recently asked like, a really obscure question, I was looking at the height of a bridge and I was like, what's the height of the bridge? So I typed it into Google and it just spit out the answer. And I was dumbfounded that I didn't have to go and research that. So I think some of those things have seemed kind of like science fiction, or we're really getting to Google apps -- Sergey has really taken on and he has a thing out of science fiction and he's running around with it, wearing it. He has our minds sometimes as well.

Thank you for joining us. It's great to be on the call this afternoon. If you're listening online, I hope you liked our warm-up video. I hear they had a great time making it. Okay. We had a really strong start to 2013, with Q1 revenue up 31% year-on-year to $14 billion. I want to give a big shout out to the sales teams that made this all possible. We tend to focus on product and engineering, but our business organization is tremendously strong. They are Google's unsung heroes.
Over the last 2 years, we worked hard to increase our velocity, improve our execution and focus on the big bets that will make a difference in the world. Take Google Now. Our goal is to getting you the right information at just the right time. Launched 9 months ago, it now provides boarding passes, delivery updates and traffic conditions without you having to ask first. In this quarter, we added movie tickets nicely packaged with directions to the theater.
I am also excited about our Voice Search momentum. Looking for the nearest pharmacy? Just ask Google for directions, and we'll deliver them instantly, no typing needed. And you can now ask conversational questions like, ""Do I need a jacket this weekend?"" Voice commands are going to be increasingly important. It's just much less hassle to talk than type. So in this quarter, we launched Chrome support for Web Speech APIs. Developers can now easily add voice-recognition into their web apps. We expect to see a lot of innovation there.
The velocity around Google Play is tremendous. It's a big bet, and one that's fundamental to the success of the Android ecosystem. In our first year, we have signed partnerships with all the major movie studios, music labels and publishers. And our digital content is available in over 20 countries globally, 7 of which we launched in Q1, including India and Mexico. And last week, we released a beautiful new UI, with better recommendations, bigger images and a simpler way to buy things. Play is already a great product, and we are improving it at a rapid rate.
As devices multiply, it's really important that our products work seamlessly whatever device you are using at the moment. It's why I love Google Play. The ability to buy books, apps, movies or songs and have them instantly available on your Android devices, even when you buy it on the web. When you switch devices while reading, your book opens exactly where you left off.
In the same way, we need to make advertising across devices really simple for our customers. Online advertising has developed in very device-specific ways, with separate campaigns for desktop and mobile. This makes arduous work for advertisers and agencies. It means modulus opportunities often get missed.
So in February, we launched Enhanced Campaigns, a significant upgrade to AdWords. Nikesh will talk more about that in a moment. But our goal is simple, to enable advertisers to focus on their audience and their message, while we dynamically adapt their campaigns across multiple devices. I've been very pleased with the rate of progress so far. We are smoothly moving a huge advertising system and ecosystem on a dime.
In today's multiscreen world, the opportunities are endless. Think about your device. Battery life is a challenge for most people. You shouldn't need to carry around a charger with you to make it through the day. If your kid spills their drink on their tablet, the screen shouldn't die. And when you drop your phone, it shouldn't shatter. There's a real potential to invent new and better experiences; ones that are much faster and more intuitive. So having just seen Motorola's upcoming products myself, I'm really excited about the potential there. In just under a year, they have accomplished a lot and have impressive velocity and execution.
I want to finish off by talking a little bit about the future. We invest the vast majority of our resources and time in our core products, as well as our big bets like Chrome, YouTube and Android. But as CEO, it's also super important to keep focused on the future. Companies tend to get comfortable doing what they have always done with a few minor tweaks. It's only natural to want to work on the things you know. But incremental improvement is guaranteed to be obsolete over time. Especially in technology, where history has shown that there's a lot of revolutionary change. So a big part of my job is to get people focused on things that are not just incremental.
Take Gmail. When we released that, we were a search company. It was a leap for us to put out an e-mail product, let alone one that gave users 100x as much more storage as anyone else. It was the same with Android. And that's why we're investing in what appeared to be speculative projects to you [ph] today, such as self-driving cars. We've found that with ambitious goals and a committed team, you can make progress pretty quickly. The best people often want to work on the biggest bets, and there's not much competition because no one else is crazy enough to try.
We started Google Fiber because Sergey thought it would be great to show how high-speed Internet access can improve people's lives. Three years later, our first homes are live in Kansas City and over the last 2 weeks, we have announced plans to roll out the service in Austin and Provo. And just this week, after 3 years of development, we started handing over Glass devices to developers.
I get chills when I use a product that is the future, and that happens when I use Glass. Someday, we will all be amazed that computing involved fishing around in pockets and purses. There are so many opportunities in the world to create technology that makes people's lives better. We are still only at 1% of what's possible. We are really just getting started. And that is why I'm so excited to be here working hard with Googlers to take our company to the next level.
Thank you, and now I'll turn the call over to Patrick for some detail.",1042
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2013",2013-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3571.0,444542.0,20795869.0,Presenter Speech,Patrick Pichette,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Larry, and good afternoon everybody, and thank you for joining us. So let me dive in by reviewing the details of our overall business financial performance. So here we go. Our total gross consolidated revenue grew 31% year-over-year to $14 billion in Q1. The overall business was down 3% quarter-over-quarter, driven by the softness in Motorola Mobility segment, specifically. Were it not for currency fluctuations, our consolidated revenue would have grown 33% year-over-year or an additional $96 million, but the quarter-over-quarter impact was really immaterial.
Google stand-alone gross revenue grew 22% year-over-year to $13 billion and was flat quarter-over-quarter. Google website revenue was up 18% year-over-year to $8.6 billion, flat quarter-over-quarter, with strength across most major geographies and industries. Google Network revenue grew 12% year-over-year to $3.3 billion and down 5% quarter-over-quarter. The quarter-over-quarter impact was largely due to the effect of advertising policy decisions implemented during Q4 and in Q1 as well.
Other revenue grew 150% year-over-year to $1 billion and 27% quarter-over-quarter, driven by Play Store sales, which also includes both hardware and digital commerce sales. It's worth noting that a significant part of the sequential other revenue growth is due to the implementation of an accounting change in our Play app revenue recognition policy. Currency fluctuations had an immaterial impact to Google stand-alone revenue, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter.
Turning now to Motorola Mobility. Gross revenue was $1 billion. We continue to be very pleased with the velocity of change at Motorola, as Larry mentioned. For example, this week, we closed our sale of the Home business, as well as the Flextronics outsourcing agreement. We're seeing a lot of progress across the board in the transformation of Motorola Mobility. We're excited about the future, but I wish to remind everyone that results from that segment will continue to be variable.
At Google, global aggregate paid click growth was strong. It was up 20% year-over-year, and in fact, up 3% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate cost-per-click was down 4% year-over-year, as well as down 4% quarter-over-quarter. Currency fluctuations had a minimal impact on Q1 CPC growth. And similar to last quarter, as I mentioned, the advertising policy change affecting network revenue continued to lower the aggregate paid click growth and improved CPC growth on a year-over-year basis. In addition, our monetization metrics continue to be impacted by the usual factors that I've covered many times, including geo mix, channel mix, property mix and product changes.
Turning now to geography and our geographic performance of Google stand-alone business. We continue to see steady performance across the U.S, the U.K. and the rest of the world. In our earnings slides, which you'll find in our Investor Relations website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits of our hedging programs. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.
Revenue was up -- from the U.S. was up 20% year-over-year to $5.8 billion. The U.K. was up 21% year-over-year to $1.4 billion, which include $20 million of benefits from our hedging program, and in fixed FX terms, the U.K. actually grew 20%. Non-U.S. revenue, excluding U.K., accounted for 44% of our total revenue or $5.7 billion, up 24% year-over-year, which includes a $15 million benefit from our hedging program. And in fixed FX terms, the rest of world, in fact, grew 27%.
So coming back at an aggregate level for total consolidated business. Other cost of revenue was $2.9 billion in Q1, excluding stock-based compensation and Motorola restructuring. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $3.9 billion, which also exclude our stock-based compensation and Motorola restructuring. And our non-GAAP operating profit was $4.2 billion in Q1, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 30%.
For stand-alone Google, traffic acquisition costs were $3 billion or 25% of total advertising revenue. Other cost of revenue was $2.1 billion, excluding $99 million of stock-based compensation. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by equipment cost, including costs associated with the hardwares sales on Play, carrier OEM revenue share, driven by the implementation of our accounting change in our Play app revenue recognition policy that I mentioned a minute ago and content acquisition costs.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $3.5 billion, excluding stock-based compensation of $556 million in this case and non-GAAP operating profit was strong at $4.4 billion in Q1, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin for the Google segment of 34% for stand alone.
Lastly, depreciation and amortization expense on property, plant and equipment for stand-alone Google was $520 million for this quarter.
At Motorola Mobility, our total non-GAAP operating expenses, including cost of revenues were $1.2 billion. And keep in mind that intangible amortization of expenses attributed to the stand-alone Google and Motorola Mobility are, in fact, included in these non-GAAP measures. Of the $315 million in intangible amortization expense in the quarter, $153 million was the result of the acquisition of Motorola, of which, $116 million was allocated to Google and $37 million was allocated to Motorola Mobility. And as a result, the non-GAAP operating loss for Motorola Mobility was $179 million in Q1, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of negative 18% for that segment.
Let me turn to headcount for the consolidated business. In fact, it was roughly flat for Q1. Keep in mind, the consolidated headcount includes the Motorola Home and Home comprised roughly 1/3 of the total Motorola headcount. Stand-alone Google added about 1,200 people and in total the consolidated company ended the quarter around 53,900 full-time employees.
Many of you may have noticed our effective tax rate that was very low at 8% in Q1. Please note that this quarter, the rate reflects a recognition for the full year benefit of our 2012 federal R&D tax credit, which Congress extended, but only retroactively in January of this year, so there was a catch-up for the full of 2012 in Q1. Additionally, there's been the usual mix shift of earnings between domestic and international subsidiaries that continue to impact our tax rate.
Let me now turn to cash management. Other income and expense was $134 million, which reflects interest income and realized gains on investments, offset by the continued impact of our FAS 133 expense from our hedging program. For more details on those OI&E, again, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website.
We continue to be happy with our strong operating cash flow at $3.6 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $1.2 billion versus last quarter at $1 billion, and the majority of CapEx spend was related to production equipment, data center construction and facilities-related purchases. Our free cash flow was also strong at $2.4 billion, and please note that cash flow and CapEx both include the Home business for now.
And before I hand it off now to Nikesh, I want to say a few words about investing in our future and preparing for the growth of our businesses. The success of our products and our continued strong performance as portrayed by Larry's comments continues to support our optimism and our confidence to continue to funding these strategic growth areas. These include not only products like Search or YouTube and Android or Chrome, but also our infrastructure as well.
With that, I'll hand it off to Nikesh who will cover in more details our business performance in the quarter. And after his remarks, we'll open up the phones for questions. Nikesh, all yours.",1247

Our business is continuing to perform well. We had over $13 billion in Google stand-alone gross revenue. Our core business is strong across Search and Display, including the continued rise of Mobile. I'm particularly pleased by the positive growth we have continued to achieve in Display. Let's review a few key highlights of the quarter before we talk in more depth about multi-screens, which Larry alluded, and brand advertising momentum.
From a regional perspective, growth was fairly stable across the board this quarter. Asia continues to be our fastest growing region. Southern Europe remained stable despite the continued economic woes in the region. Auto has been a strong sector for us globally, and the cold spring in the U.K. has led to stronger growth in the retail sector there. Our shopping business continues to expand with over 1 billion products listed. This quarter, we rolled out Product Listing Ads in Europe and also brought them to mobile devices.
I want to mention our policy efforts that ensure that we're working with only the highest quality partners, which Patrick has already alluded to. We want to make sure we protect users from having bad experiences with websites and online services. So we've tightened our policies and enforcement in a few areas like downloadable software applications. While these steps may impact network revenue in the short term, they are essential in the long term for a better, safer web experience to users, and to encourage brands to invest more in online marketing into our network. We strongly believe what we've done benefits us in the long term.
Shifting gears to our Enterprise business. The Enterprise business continues to experience strong growth across pretty much all products, regions and industry. While our SMB segment is growing steadily, we're seeing significant increase from large global organizations. In fact, 58% of the Fortune 500 are now actively using a paid Enterprise cloud product from Google. Recent wins include: ANA from Japan, the largest airline; Woolworths with over 200,000 users, Australia's largest retailer; BMW, which will use Google Places and Street View in their ultimate driving machines; and the country of Malaysia; they're adopting Google Apps for 10 million students, teachers and parents. They're going to deploy Chromebooks to primary and secondary schools nationwide.
Moving on to our marketing efforts. Our marketing team continues to execute flawlessly. They've helped Chromebooks increase their footprint in the U.S., expanding to more than 1,000 Best Buy stores nationwide, which pretty much doubles the previous number of stores we had. The Samsung Chromebook has been the top-selling laptop on Amazon since it launched. We have rolled out Nexus 4 in Russia, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico and expanded in the U.S. to 3,000 T-Mobile stores.
I want to focus the rest of my remarks on 2 continuing trends that present great opportunities for us: First, the shift of consumers to a multiscreen lifestyle; and second, the ongoing movement of brand dollars online. As Larry has said, consumers are accessing content interchangeably on many screens throughout the day. Our clients are hungry to advertise where consumers are. In fact, 95% of our clients have campaigns that run across multiple screens.
In February, working with Susan and Sundar's team, we rolled out Enhanced Campaigns to make it easier for clients to manage and measure campaigns that reach people across devices. Marketeers will be able to deliver ads that are more relevant to the user's context, using features like offers and proximity bidding. And they'll be able to do a better job of measuring mobile conversions.
Enhanced Campaigns is an important long-term bet that will help marketeers. We know this is a big change for many of our advertisers, and we've invested tremendous amounts of time and effort into making the transition as smooth as possible. In the first 2 months since launch, more than 1.5 million campaigns have already been upgraded to Enhanced Campaigns and these clients are beginning to see great results. We expect to migrate all campaigns that we manage by the end of the current quarter. While this is a complicated task, it's a great example of our focus on flawless execution on behalf of our customers.
Now on to brands. We see great remarketing success stories every day. Nissan Mexico's biggest launch of the year, the Pathfinder, featured 13 video ads and a new approach to remarketing AdWords of video. Nissan connected their stories and making sure that users who watched their videos were shown a new one each time. New brand-friendly formats like our expandable Lifebox ads, our reserve inventory solution, are helping clients create beautiful experiences with sight, sound and motion.
Over the past year, the number of advertisers using our Google Display Network reserve option has increased fourfold. Now we have 2/3 of the Top 100 Ad Age brands using those products. This is really helpful in developing deep partnership with our clients, especially in the branding arena. For example, we're now working directly with Adidas in Germany on the new global branding budget.
Brands are also continuing to see the power of YouTube to help them reach consumers across screens. Today, more than 1 billion people are finding the channels they love on YouTube every month. Users are now watching over 50 million more hours a day compared to a year ago, a 50% increase. We had a record year for our Super Bowl Ad Blitz program. Views, votes, watch time and advertiser participation were all up from last year. We saw increased engagement across all screens. We had 1.3 million total hours of watch time of commercials on Ad Blitz. That's the equivalent of the length of 325,000 Super Bowls.
More brands are also using YouTube as a strategic part of their campaign to reach a younger generation. For example, Chevrolet built awareness for the Chevy Sonic was made for digital videos supported by YouTube and Google Ads, all contributing to the successful launch of this all-new sub-compact car.
Our work with brands also helps our publisher partners. Our Ad Exchange supports all formats, all screens and hundreds of publishers and continuing to grow well. We are offering new solutions to publishers like Google Consumer Surveys and Google Play to help them make money from their content.
In conclusion, I want thank all Googlers who helped deliver a great quarter into our business. This industry is moving very fast and the opportunities are numerous. We're lucky to have such skilled and hardworking employees to help drive Google and our partners in the future.
With that, thank you, Patrick.",1096

First, Patrick, you mentioned this accounting change, but could you just give us a little bit more detail on what that accounting change was versus Play? And then could you talk about the TAC trends? I know it's just one part of your business, but they seem to be moving in different directions on your own sites, continuing to rise pretty dramatically, but on your network partner sites, falling off pretty significantly. Can you just help us think about what that should look like going forward for both of those segments?",95
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2013",2013-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3571.0,444542.0,20795874.0,Answer,Patrick Pichette,,Executives,8,"Yes, thank you for your question, Mark. Let's take them in row. First, on the apps revenue recognition policy, let me explain what happened there. And I'll use it with an example, if you don't mind. If you -- and the way we did it is, we changed the revenue recognition. So if you say you buy an app for $1 on the Play Store, $0.70 of that $1 will be paid to the developer and does not impact on our P&L. It didn't before and it still doesn't today, so that hasn't changed. In the past though, we would have booked the remaining $0.30 on a net of payments to carriers and OEM and then book that as gross revenue. Beginning in Q1 however, the entire $0.30 is now booked as gross and the payments to the carriers and the OEMs are now booked on other cost of revenue. So that's the big change that has happened and basically, the reason why we did this is, as part -- as we were looking through the second half of 2012, we were seeing -- these used to be kind of immaterial numbers for us. And then when we saw through the second half of 2012, we decided to kind of tune our accounting policies and made that change in Q1. So that's the issue of what's going on, on the revenue recognition. So you'll see the impact, both on gross and then, as I said, on other cost of revenue and then you get the net. So on a net basis, it doesn't change. On the TAC issue that you have raised, Mark, then the answer is pretty simple, right? TAC has dropped overall because of the change in our ads policies that we've done through Q4 and Q1. So in pushing hard on implementation of our ad policies to the benefit of the user, the impact of that is actually that it lowered our network revenue, but it also lowered our TAC, which is tied to AdSense partners in that role. On our own Google sites, you'll have notice that it continues to grow. And it grows because of Mobile growth. So the volume of Mobile in our mix is driving TAC to go up. So overall, TAC is down for the quarter in an aggregate basis. The ad policy changes have driven them down and then our Mobile for our own sites continue to drive them up. But that's a good story because it means Mobile is really continuing to be on fire. So that's the pieces of the puzzle. Thanks for your questions because it wasn't that easy to understand at first, but I hope that clarifies the point.",452

And then just quickly, separately Knowledge Graph, just in general, if you can you give us an update on the progress and sort of how you measure that progress internally?",90

Thanks, Ben, for your questions. I feel like every time I say anything, I get this question. I think honestly, my job as CEO is to get people to do those things. If you look at most companies, they'll never do anything different and eventually they run into problems for that reason. So I think that's a common failure mode. I think that the reality is it's pretty hard to invest significant amounts of new things. It's actually difficult to get people to do those things. Because we have nothing to say differently about our general philosophy of 80% on our core things. I said that in my remarks, basically, that we're still focused on our core products and our big bets. And that's clearly the vast majority of our resources. We'll add resources to the new things as we're able to and as they show success. As an investor, I am a big shareholder of Google. I'm certainly not worried about the expense of that because I don't think -- like I said, it's not easy to just spend that much money on the new things. I'd be more worried that we don't do those things fast enough and build on the revolutionary change that happens in the technology industry. On the Knowledge Graph, I think there's been tremendous progress. We've done internationalization. There's quality improvements and we're improving the kind of questions we can answer as I mentioned about weather and other things. And that happens from improvements to our Knowledge Graph. And I'm very excited about that. And I think we saw big investments there, and we'll still -- for a long time, we'll continue to see improved products there.",284

As Larry just said that we've -- it was very complicated. We had to train our sales force around the world and to launch it simultaneously and work with our product team. But so far, the feedback we have gotten from advertisers is, it is positive because it basically takes away a lot of work from them. And we've been able to migrate 1.5 million campaigns to Enhanced Campaigns. We also have some great suggestions from our advertisers about what we should do to make it better, and we're beginning to implement those. So we're hoping that towards the end of this quarter, we should have migrated all of the campaigns, which are done separately as mobile and separately at the desktop as combined and really offer them the benefits of location context screens all with one campaign. So effectively I think in the long term that should be better ROI.",154

It looks like your top line revenues have somewhat stabilized, but how is the transition to Mobile impacting your kind of high-level revenue growth over a period of quarters and also your margins? Maybe you could give us a little help on that. And then maybe Larry could you address the concern that constantly comes up people using apps versus Google Search. Obviously, the disclosures you've given suggest revenue on Mobile is going at or above industry, but are you seeing any pressure from app usage versus search usage on Mobile?",101

I think maybe I'll take the first one, the second one first. We always get this question about other apps versus Google Search. I think I'm not so super concerned about that issue. I think that people use lots of apps on the web, other many strong sites and so on. So we've been dealing with that issue for a long time. I think fundamentally, search is an amazing thing for publishers and software developers and everybody else, and we deliver a lot of traffic and a lot of users to things. And so I think in general, the information wants to be found. And we are working hard to make sure that, that user experience is great, and that we're delivering people into the right places. So I think I feel pretty confident on that in the future that we'll get through that just fine. So the second half of your question?",156

Let me just jump in on this one quickly. And it's really about the new reality where we have all the [ph] multi-screens. And I mean Larry talked about this at length at the last earnings call where the reality now is, it's not about mobile or tablets or desktop. It's about this unified life that you have, where you're always connected and the question is, are you giving the best answer all the time following me throughout my day. And that's why, in fact, Enhanced Campaigns is a great signal of that. Where you're saying hey, let's find the right ad at the right time and the right answer at the right time for you throughout your day. So I think that rather than to ask, which small piece part is going to kind of contribute plus or minus, the real question is, are we growing the pie of your day with Google? And in the long term, are we really kind of contributing to create the best answers both for the advertisers and for users? And that's really what we're actually pushing for. So I think that this trend really presents to us enormous opportunities. And when people ask about what's going on with TAC, Patrick? Or what do you think the impact of CPC on a very specific basis, I think that, that's the wrong way to ask the question. The real right way is the excitement we have about kind of helping you throughout your day on all your devices, right? And the pie grows for everybody, and that's the right way to ask the question. So thanks for your question on that, Justin.",297

First on Google Fiber, setting aside the user experience for those who get it, how do you expect Fiber to have major impact given that you to take many billions and several years to pass something like 20 million U.S. homes. And after all of that time and money, you would be, at best, a midsize provider in a market that accounts for less than half of your current business? Secondly, on the future of search, Larry, you mentioned voice commands in your opening remarks. We already get voice output with Jelly Bean. Put this together with Google Now and Knowledge Graph and we see a future where you get the answer to your question sometimes before you ask it. How do ads come into this view? How do you generate revenues in a world like this where you guys seem to be going to?",148

Look, on Fiber, I think it's really simple. It's very early days, and we're totally excited about delivering a great user experience with faster Internet speed. And gigabit, as Larry said, with Sergey's kind of quest a few years ago, gigabit speed over 100x faster than the average American, I mean, that is a great user experience, and it's really about pushing for speed and writing the new chapter, the next chapter of the Internet. So for us, I think we really are excited about this, and that's really where we're focused on. On the second question, I'll let Larry give his comments.",120

I guess the fiber industry is not big enough for you, so I applaud that. I think we love to find businesses much bigger than our entire current business to invest in, but I think there's only a very small number of such companies that even exist. So I think we look at places where we can provide a lot of -- on Fiber, we look at places where we can provide products that can make a really big difference in peoples' lives, and we can make a lot of money and resources doing it. And I think certainly meets that criteria. Although as Patrick said, it's very early days. On the voice stuff and knowing what people want before they ask for it and how do we make ads in that. How do we make revenue and ads in that work. I'm not worried about that at all. We've been doing this for a long time and, in fact, we really view -- the reason we've been successful at doing advertising is we view that as another source of information. So the Search Ads that we show has to be very relevant and make sense to you at that moment. And the more -- the better job we can do in providing you information, even without you asking for it, the better we can also provide commercial information to you that people are excited about promoting, too. And I think that's actually a huge, huge opportunity for us. We're all about making things more efficient by getting the right information to the right people at the right time. And that's all going to improve in the kind of world that you were talking about.",293

Scott, thanks for your question. I think what I was referring to was the fact that I believe in the next few years, we will see connected TVs everywhere, and we'll be able to address a TV using IP. When that begins to happen I think the products we have in place where we can dynamically serve ads, which are more personalized which look more like information on display platforms or video platforms is going to be very relevant. So I think over time, the television industry shifts to a more addressable, more personalized, more IP-addressable type of platform, and I think we're well positioned in that space given our large focus and emphasis on brand, given our huge technology effort that Susan's team does around display and video and really getting our sales force working really well with various brand advertisers around the world.

Larry, we had a chance to try out Glass a few weeks ago, and we think you guys really nailed it, so congrats to the team, but can you talk about the overall strategy with Glass? How do you plan to build out the ecosystem for third-party developers? What do you see is the biggest function that Glass could address for users? And then do you expect the $1,500 price tag to come down to a level that's more mainstream? Or is this likely to remain a higher-end luxury device?",100

I'm glad you're excited about Glass. I am, too. So I would say, it is early days on the product. We're just handing over small numbers so far. I think that we're probably pretty good at third-party ecosystems. Our experience on Android and a bunch of other areas, so I'm not too worried about that. There's been a lot of speculation on that. I would just say it's all early. And I think the price tag was set for developers for our early test. We don't have any news to announce there, but it was clearly -- I'm not sure I'd call it a luxury price, but certainly a pretty high price. So I think that, what do I like doing with my Glass? I think what do people with Glass. I really -- I find the photo taking, the video, phone calling, quick messaging, directions, all to be pretty amazing experience. And that's some of the core functionality we've built into the device. We're excited to really get it out to some developers and have other people create some amazing experiences with it, which we haven't thought of yet. Like I said, it's still early days, but I think it's very exciting.",205

So I guess on PLA. So far we're very excited. We have over 1 billion items in the Product Listing Ads, and we just launched it in Europe.

Nikesh, you talked about Southern Europe being stable in terms of macro. I'm just curious if over the last 3 months if you have seen any changes at all in macro across the U.S. or Europe?

Q1 was pretty dismal, from a weather perspective. Douglas, thanks for the question. I think as I said Southern Europe has been stable. I think there has been concern at the macro level in Southern Europe, but our business has been stable. I think the macro conditions have been going on for a while. As far as the U.S. and Europe, I don't think there was anything out of the ordinary that we saw as it relates to our business results. And our teams continue to execute, and we continue to engage with advertisers across the board, large and small. And we haven't seen any shift in those trends.",117

Look, it's very clear. We care about revenue growth. We care about profitability. And as we said before, right, we're not in the business of money-losing businesses. So regarding margin, for us, what really matters is every incremental profit dollar creates shareholder value, and we're focused on growing these profit dollars rather than the specific of the average aggregate margin. So if you have a business for us that can be a $20 billion business that has a much lower margin than ours but kind of contributes a couple of billion to the bottom line of the company, what's not to like, right? Especially if it's like rather capital-light and these are the areas that we're -- in addition to our core business, right, exploring and by way, they have a great symbiotic relationship, right? When you have devices that are kind of magical and that kind of feed within our core software businesses, there's this kind of magical relationship as well that kind of continues to enhance our offering. So the real trick there is to keep focused on dollar margin pools, dollar margin and revenue and then not worry too much about where the aggregate shows up because it's all good for the shareholders.",217

I just had a couple of questions. One, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you guys can do to help prevent Android fragmentation, if you can kind of give us your views there? And then on Fiber, I had a follow-up, if maybe you could go beyond the obvious, which is the obvious benefits that people are getting in the cities that you've already rolled out to. If you could maybe help us think about the types of services or offerings that you guys see as being possible as this becomes more broadly deployed. And then lastly, especially given your prior comments on capital-light, I was just wondering how should we think about your appetite for CapEx for Fiber?",127

I guess I can talk a little bit about Android. This is Larry. And I think that I've actually had the pleasure recently of using a bunch of different Android phones from different manufacturers, and the experiences are a bit different. Maybe the return menu back button is on different sides or things like that. There's differences like that, which was somewhat fragmented. But I find I have a pretty great overall experience, and there's a lot of innovation, and that the platform is moving really quickly. And that's how we designed it. So I think that's -- in a negative sense, that's fragmentation; in a positive sense, it's innovation and flexibility for the different users of the Android ecosystem. So I think actually it's working pretty well. And we, obviously evolved the ecosystem to make sure -- making sure that users get a really great experience and making sure we're paying attention to all of that and making sure that works well. And I think we're actually doing a pretty good job. I think on Fiber, you had some questions on Fiber. I think Patrick can address that.",192

Speed matters today, right? When you wait for 3 seconds to get your YouTube video today with your current provider, right, that is a terrible answer. And we think that Fiber and the services we offer in Kansas City today actually can go -- goes a long way to solving a lot of today's frustrations, independent of tomorrow's. In addition to that, our Kansas City offer that we have, right, is already quite differentiated in offering kind of an amazing service. For example, with storage, with 2 terabytes of storage available and another in the cloud that really kind of, not only is about speed, but it's about a package that says, you should have abundance. And with abundance, then the third piece of it, which is, kind of, where I think where you were going is the excitement of what the developer community can actually create for a world that is, in fact, at blazing speed and with an abundance of storage. So I think it's already, today, answering a big need. It's already, today, quite differentiated, and it is just laying the path for what should be the next change of the Internet. And I think that you see it in Kansas City with so many developers moving to Kansas City to actually kind of create this coming world just gives you a glimpse of all the opportunities that are out there, and that's why we're very excited about it.

I think that, obviously, we know what's going on with that business, and like I said, it's early days. We're excited about it. And we'll continue to evolve that. But as I said earlier, too, I mean, it's difficult if you -- even if you want to spend money a lot of money on these kind of things, I think it's tough and difficult to do that.

And how transportable is Android across these new form factors in terms of getting OEMs and other operators beyond just the smartphones and tablets to adopt it? And Nikesh, thanks for the number of campaigns on the Enhanced Campaigns platform. I'm wondering like what percent of your advertisers do you think have optimized their sites for content delivery across multiple devices? And when do you think we'll get greater ability for attribution across mobile and desktop?",118
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2013",2013-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3571.0,444542.0,20795915.0,Answer,Larry Page,,Executives,49,"Thank you, Stephen. That's a lot of questions. I think we got them all straight. Let's see, so incremental engagement from Google's products from Glass and so on and watches and things. I think that computers are now a pretty big part of people's lives, so I think that's increasing as it gets more and more useful. And so the amount of time you -- you only have 24 hours in a day, so there's some limit to that. But I think more importantly, the usefulness of your engagement is going to increase. So right now while you're just kind of using your computer, your phone or your tablet or whatever and you're kind of bored, maybe you'll be less bored and more productive or enjoy what you're doing more and see more meaningful engagement. And I think that can result in much better business results and happier people and all that. I think, obviously, Glass runs on Android, so it's been pretty transportable across devices, and I think that will continue. I think Nikesh, you want to address the Enhanced Campaigns element?",183

So thank you, Stephen, for your question. I think what's important to note is before we launched our Enhanced Campaigns journey in February, we have been very actively working for the last year plus on our GoMo campaign, which is Go Mobile. Because clearly the first part of anybody leveraging their mobile websites is to have one. So we spend a lot of time working with our advertisers in quarters out there both to get them online and also to get them mobile. I think the Enhanced Campaigns, then, was a logical step beyond that. Because once they have mobile capability, once they have mobile sites and desktops, we want to make sure that you can get best ROI across those things. I think we're still working on this. We're still down the journey. We have a significant number of our early adopters on to Enhanced Campaigns. And as I said, we intend to get them all migrated in the next few months, the next 10 weeks actually. So that should be pretty good. In terms of future, I think we also alluded to the fact that some of the things we are offering them are things like proximity bidding and offers. So it's more about first getting them to leverage their current capabilities, but then also giving more context and more location, which hopefully generates more ROI in the future.",232

I guess what's the important part is we have been working, and we have hundreds of studies now working with our advertisers to actually look at both the offline and online impacts. And one of the recent things we did is online to store. Is we've helped people understand how their online campaigns are driving more and more people into store, which is most of an offline activity. We also look at the entire customer journey. We look at cross media effectiveness to show how you can run a campaign in the offline world, how you can add online to it and what kind of attribution that gets you in offline media as well as online media. So we do a bunch of stuff like that. So our research team's working with external research organizations. So I think we have a reasonably robust practice there working with our advertisers. In terms of the update, in terms of the ads policy changes, we have implemented all of our ads policies. We, obviously, have worked with almost all of our network partners. They understand our policies. Many of them have made changes. I think we should be done with most of the transition, but of course, the effect of this policy change will continue to happen throughout the rest of the year.",229

Google had a great quarter with over $14 billion in revenue, up 19% year-on-year. Amazing performance for a company that is yet to celebrate its 15th birthday.
We live in a world of abundant computing with multiple operating systems and increasing numbers of devices. And is a very different environment from when Google started. There are essentially one OS and one device category, the PC. These kind of changes don't happen that often. Once a decade, maybe even less frequently. But the shifts from laptop to mobiles, from one screen to multiple screens creates tremendous opportunity for Google. With more devices, more information and more activity online than ever the potential to improve peoples’ lives is immense. Getting you the right information, just when you need it, creating the tools to make everyone more effective at home and at work and helping you share and remember the moments that matter in life. That's why I'm so excited about the velocity and execution of our platforms, apps and devices. 
First, platforms. With hindsight, Android and Chrome were no brainers. At the time, they were big bets. The momentum across these platforms is tremendous. As you saw at our annual I/O developer conference in May, I was astounded we had over 1 million people tuning in live just to watch our developer keynote. We've now activated more than 900 million Android devices worldwide. And we're lighting up over 1.5 million devices every day. That's pretty amazing, given that the first Android phone launched less than 5 years ago. 
And apps usage is increasing fast. Over 50 billion apps have been now downloaded from the Google Play store. In fact, we've already paid out more money to Android developers this year than in the whole of 2012. I love the ability to access your stuff on Play anywhere. Take our new music subscription service launched in May. It is an easy and fun way to discover new music. With all the songs there, ready to go. You never have to think about the device you're using. 
Chrome, even though only 4-year-old, has over 750 million users worldwide and growing.
The next, Apps. Our goal is to design everything, so it's beautifully simple and hassle-free. Users shouldn't have to need to think about our technology. It should just work. This quarter we completely revamped our Maps UI. The map is a screen, no clutter around the edges. There's more information about your surroundings, so it's easier to explore. And we've launched the new, improved navigation feature with notification about incidents, before you leave and updates to save time, if traffic conditions change. Best of all, this new maps experience is now available on almost all devices you'll be likely to use.
It's the same with Google+. We've done a complete redesign to make use on the entire screen, and everything looks consistent to whatever the device or the platform. In addition, the team massively upgraded the photos experience, making software design for professionals automatically available to everyone for free. There's no need for wrinkles anymore. 
Take a look on Plus. Many of your photos will now be marked, enhanced and improved automatically. 
Finally, we launched the new communication app called the Hangouts. You can talk to the people you care about across all the major platforms. Video calls from your phone are very cool. Give them a try.
And I'm excited about the progress we've continue to make with Search. Our Knowledge Graph is now available in 29 languages, and we have expanded the range of information available. For example, we just added nutrition data. Ask Google how many calories there are in a glass of white wine, and you'll find out it's 123; or an avocado, 234 calories. It's good to have the facts, if you want to keep healthy. And we launched Google Now on iOS in April.
In the same way, we want to make everything -- we want to make advertising super simple for customers. Online advertising have developed a very specific, device-specific ways with separate campaigns for desktop and mobile. This made arduous work for advertisers and agencies and meant mobile opportunities often got missed. 
Finally, we launched Enhanced Campaigns. Advertisers have all created 6 million campaigns; that's almost 75% of all their active campaigns. And Nikesh will talk in a little more detail about the positive reaction from clients. This is the biggest ever change to AdWords and the velocity and execution has been great thanks to the hard work of all the teams.
Finally, devices. There is so much excitement around new devices today and the potential for innovation is tremendous. You can now buy the HTC One and the Samsung Galaxy S4 Google Play additions and enjoy the best of Google. There's a ton of momentum around Chromebooks, which are growing fast and defying the more general decline in PC sales.
Finally, I know you are all eagerly anticipating what Motorola is launching soon. Having been a tester for a while, I'm really excited. 
We're very optimistic about the opportunities in front of Google today. The potential for technology to make people's lives better is tremendous. But to achieve that potential, we need to stay focused. That's why we continue to invest the vast majority of our resources and time in our core products. 
So my job as CEO is also to think about the future and ensure we continue to bet on new technology that can solve big problems in the world. 
Project Loon, which we launched in June, is a great example, bringing affordable, balloon-powered Internet access to remote areas is an idea that Sergey and I had been thinking about for over a decade. And it's great to see that project literally get off the ground, and give people a bit more help for an improving world.
None of this would happen without great people, and we are so lucky that we have them. I'd like to thank all the Googlers and Motorolans who make everything possible. Keep up that velocity and execution. 
Now I'll hand the call over to Patrick.",1028
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2013",2013-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3561.0,485353.0,22409700.0,Presenter Speech,Patrick Pichette,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. So why don't we go dive in by reviewing the details of our overall business financial performance, so here we go. Our gross total consolidated revenue grew 19% year-over-year to $14.1 billion. The overall business was up 1% quarter-over-quarter. Google standalone gross revenue grew 20% year-over-year to $13.1 billion and was up 1% quarter-over-quarter. Our Google website revenues was up 18% year-over-year to $8.9 billion was, in fact, up 3% quarter-over-quarter. Our Google Network revenue grew 7% year-over-year to $3.2 billion and was down 2% quarter-over-quarter. You'll remember the advertising policy decisions we implemented during Q4 and Q1 to ensure that useful and safe user experience continue to have its negative impact on network revenue.
Other revenue grew 138% year-over-year to $1 billion, roughly flat quarter-over-quarter. Play store digital sales of apps and content drove the year-on-year and quarter-over-quarter growth. And it's worth noting that in Q1, we included some seasonal hardware sales due to overflow from Q4, which skewed the Q2 comps somewhat.
Finally, please note that without currency fluctuations, Google's standalone revenue growth would, in fact, have been 22% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter. 
Turning to Motorola Mobility. Gross revenue there was $998 million, just shy of $1 billion. And it's clear that we've made a lot of progress at Motorola in the past year and we are especially excited about the future of our upcoming product lineup. So stay tuned.
At Google, our global aggregate paid click growth was strong at 22% year-over-year, in fact, up 4% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate cost-per-click was down 6% year-over-year and down 2% quarter-over-quarter and currency fluctuations in this case had a minimal effect in Q2 CPC growth. And yet, our monetization metrics continue to be impacted by the usual factors that we've discussed many times, including geographic mix, channel mix, property mix, our product and policy changes, as well as FX. 
Turning to the geographic performance of Google standalone business. We continue to see a steady performance in the U.S. and the rest of world. While the U.K. was negatively impacted by a warm spring, some FX in their case and a tough year-over-year comp. In our earnings slide, which you can find in our Investor Relations website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits of our hedging program, so please refer to those slides for the exact calculations. 
U.S. revenue was up 18% year-over-year to $5.9 billion. The U.K. was up 12% year-over-year to $1.3 billion, which included $24 million of benefit from our hedging program. It is, in fact, worth noting that in fixed FX terms, the U.K. grew 15% year-over-year. 
Non-U.S. revenue, excluding U.K., accounted for 45% of the total revenue or $5.9 billion, and it was up 23% year-over-year, which includes $11 million benefits from our hedging program. In fixed FX terms, rest of world grew a solid 28%.
Coming back to an aggregate level for the total consolidated business, our other cost of revenue was $2.9 billion in Q2, excluding stock-based compensation and Motorola restructuring. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $4.2 billion also, excluding stock-based compensation and Motorola restructuring. And our non-GAAP operating profit was $4 billion in Q2, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin for the consolidated business of 28%.
For standalone Google, our traffic acquisition costs were $3 billion or 25% of total advertising revenue. Other cost of revenue was $2.1 billion, again, excluding $110 million of stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $3.8 billion, excluding stock-based compensation of $633 million. 
And non-GAAP operating profit was $4.2 billion in Q2, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 32% for the standalone Google segment. 
Please note that a reevaluation of our depreciation policy as it relates to our real estate portfolio resulted in an additional $121 million in Google segment depreciation expenses, about half of which represented a onetime charge for assets that are now fully depreciated.
With this change in place, depreciation, amortization expense on property, plant and equipment for standalone Google was $667 million for this quarter. 
At Motorola Mobility, total non-GAAP operating expenses, including cost of revenue, were $1.2 billion. Keep in mind, intangible amortization expenses attributed to the standalone Google and Motorola Mobility are, in fact, included in these non-GAAP measures. Of the $283 million in intangible amortization expense in the quarter, $153 million was the result of the acquisition of Motorola, of which $116 million was allocated to Google and $37 million was allocated to Motorola Mobility. And as a result, the non-GAAP operating loss for Motorola Mobility was $218 million in Q2 and a non-GAAP operating margin for that segment of minus 22%.
Headcount for the consolidated business was down roughly 9,000 people in Q2. Please keep in mind that consolidated headcount now excludes Motorola Home business. It also reflects the impact of the ongoing Mobility restructuring. Standalone Google added about 1,400 people during the quarter and in total, the consolidated company ended the quarter with around 44,800 full-time employees. 
Our effective tax rate was 24% in Q2. Like in Q1, several onetime items, as well as the continued shift of earnings between domestic and international subsidiaries, impacted our tax rate this quarter. And also, please remember that in Q1, we also had a significant lower rate in that case due to the 2012 R&D credit, which was, obviously, not applied to our Q2 rate. 
Let me now turn to cash management. Other income and expense was $247 million for the quarter, which reflects realized gains on investments and interest income, offset by the discontinued -- the continued impact of our FAS 133 expense on our hedging program. For more detail on OI&E, again, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website. 
We continue to be very pleased with our operating cash flow, which is strong this quarter at $4.7 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $1.6 billion, and this is versus last quarter at $1.2 billion. I want to remind everybody that the majority of our CapEx spent is related to data center construction, facilities-related purchases and production equipment. 
CapEx is just inherently lumpy. And as I mentioned last quarter during my remarks, our infrastructure will continue to be a strategic area of investment. It's one of the foundations of our future growth.
Our free cash flow, again, very strong, $3.1 billion for the quarter. Larry's comments make it clear that there are just enormous growth opportunities ahead of us as a company. It's in this spirit of optimism that we continue to fully fund strategic growth opportunities with the same confidence and discipline we demonstrated, while growing our Mobile business, Android, YouTube, Chrome, just to name a few. 
And with this, I'll hand it off to Nikesh, who will cover more details of our business performance in the quarter and after his remarks, we'll open up the lines for questions. Nikesh?",1166
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2013",2013-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3561.0,485353.0,22409701.0,Presenter Speech,Nikesh Arora,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Patrick. As Patrick mentioned, our businesses has had a strong quarter. We had over $13.1 billion in Google standalone gross revenue. Overall, performance was particularly strong in the auto sector, in Brazil and, as Patrick mentioned, growth in the U.K. was hampered because of a particularly warm spring. 
 
Before I talk about trends we're seeing in investments we're making in our business, let me call out the effort of our marketing team that continues to create great Google moments. In May, they put on our second annual YouTube Brandcast event in New York for 1,800 advertisers. The event was a great way to show YouTube's unique ability to help marketeers connect with highly coveted consumers and ultimately build their brands. 
At Brandcast, Jeffrey Katzenberg of DreamWorks said, ""YouTube is a whole new entertainment paradigm."" And we think he is right. Also, Larry mentioned, the team put on another successful Google I/O development conference, showcasing our incredible momentum across our platforms to over 6,000 developers in San Francisco with over 1 million people tuning in from around the world. We continue to be pleased with how our business is evolving, growing and diversifying. 
There are 3 key areas where we continue to make investments. First, our transformation into a marketing platform that works across the connected world that Larry described; second, our systematic move up the marketing funnel help clients more and more with brand building campaign; third, our investment in our non-ads business such as Enterprise services, hardware and digital content to Google Play; fourth, our investments for our constantly connected users. The rapid adoption of new devices means that more people are spending more time online and connected. In fact, new devices, new connectivity means we're moving to a world where people are constantly connected with devices with them all the time. As an example, Emarketeers say for the time spent online on mobile devices by U.S. adults grew 273% from 2009 to 2012. From 2011 to 2012 alone, the time spent connected in mobile devices increased by nearly 0.5 hour a day. This means not only are a lot of new services and apps available for users, but also huge opportunities exist for businesses looking to reach mobile users at the right time and location.
That brings an Enhanced Campaigns. And as Larry talked about this, Enhanced Campaigns is a big long-term bet that is designed to help advertisers more easily reach customers across devices with the right message, all within one campaign. We already migrated 6 million of active campaigns to Enhanced Campaigns over the last many months. Our goal is to migrate all of our advertisers and campaigns by the end of this month. This effort has been executed at breakneck speed and client reaction has been generally positive. 
We're getting back evidence from clients seeing improved performance using Enhanced Campaigns. For example, Pizza Hut saw their mobile ROI increased by 20%. They found that their mobile click-through rate has increased by more than 60%, while their cost-per-order on smartphones has dropped by 17%. We believe Enhanced Campaign does set up our clients and our business really well for the long-term. And the move towards the constantly connected world goes far beyond just direct response and transactional marketing. People are spending time watching videos, playing games, consuming news, all this creates great new opportunities for brand marketeers to engage users. In fact, powered by a TrueView format, YouTube's mobile revenue in June of this year was 3x what it was at the beginning of the year. 
And to help advertisers reach viewers across more screens, we've opened up our TrueView formats, all of our AdMob network across thousands of apps. 
Turning our attention to brand marketeers, this is a very, very important area for us where we continue to invest broadly. It's important because the largest global marketeers from CPG companies to film studios all conduct large major brand advertising campaigns. Of course, that represents significant budgets that have historically been spent on TV.
A good example of this was seen in the Cannes Lions Festival, the Dove Real Beauty Sketches campaign that appeared on YouTube won the Titanium Grand Prix award, which is considered the Festival's highest honor. We worked with Burberry to launch Burberry Kisses, which allow users to send messages to loved ones sealed with a digital imprint of their real kiss. This campaign runs on YouTube and our Display Network across desktop, tablets and mobile. 
And last month, we began to integrate our recent acquisition, Wildfire, into the DoubleClick platform, so that brands can now manage the broader customer journey across Search, Display, Mobile, social, rich media and video, again, all within one platform. 
Finally, I want to talk a little bit about our investment in emerging non-ad businesses. We've made a bunch of bets that are now beginning to show promise. We're seeing acceleration in new businesses such as hardware, digital content and enterprise. 
First, hardware. We continue to see great momentum across Chromebooks and Mobile devices, such as our Nexus program. Around the world, Chromebooks are now in more than 6,600 brick-and-mortar stores, including Walmart and Staples. That's about a 3x increased this quarter. As Larry said, we've also added 2 new devices to the Google Play store from Samsung and HTC. 
On the digital apps and content front, through Google Play, we continue to see tremendous amount of growth in this area. People from over 190 countries now download apps from Google Play every day. More than 50 billion apps have been downloaded so far. In the last year, the Google Play digital content like music and movies have launched in 21 new countries, including India, Mexico, Russia with 8 more European countries launching Google Play books this week. 
Publishers like Penguin, Random House, Time Inc., movie studios like Disney and NBC Universal and app developers like King and Square Enix are creating terrific experience for our users. We've also collaborated with all the major record labels to launch a new music subscription service that users seem to be enjoying really -- enjoying a lot.
Lastly, on the Enterprise front, that's another great revenue stream for Google. It comprises productivity apps like Docs and Gmail, as well as our cloud infrastructure. Now more than half of the Fortune 500 companies use a paid Enterprise product from Google, and over 5 million businesses use our productivity apps. This means we have close long-term relationships with our Enterprise customers. 
New customers this quarter include some of our world's leading businesses like Federal Express, which built their store locator in Google Maps; SnapChat, which runs an application on Google's cloud infrastructure and LinkedIn is using Google Search Appliance. New Google apps customers include Pearson, Keller Williams Realty and the city of Boston. 
And HP is now Google Apps reseller, combining Google software with HP's hardware for initiative to help small businesses called SMB IT in a Box. 
To conclude, across our entire business, we're investing with enthusiasm and have tremendous opportunities. We strongly believe that we're making the right moves for our users and clients and we're extremely optimistic about the future. 
With that, let me hand back to Patrick.",1200

So can you just give us a little bit more color about the ROIs that most of your customers are seeing, you mentioned a few comments, but are they going up? And do you see a significant opportunity in providing conversion tracking across different screens? What do you think will happen with Search budgets, if and when you can solve that problem?",78

I think it's fair to say that over the last 9 months, we've had to do a super Herculean task to take millions and millions of campaigns, as Larry mentioned, 6 million campaigns, that we have to work with our advertising partners to go ahead and convert them towards Enhanced Campaigns. And we've had some amazing insights, both working with the advertisers and as well as our teams as many advertisers have discovered that they were not addressing the mobile opportunity appropriately, they discovered new inventory, they discovered better ROI and better conversion. Of course, we anticipate the conversion analytics will work across every scheme and be able to be made available to all of our advertisers. So we believe that as we get more and more -- as we get better in terms of being able to provide more targeting and more comprehensive ad solutions from Mobility and across all screens, that the ROI should continue to improve. So I'm very optimistic in the longer-term because we believe Mobility provides more context to advertisers in terms of where the users are or where they've been, which would allow for more accurate advertising and advertising which is almost like as good as information for them. So if that begins to happen, we think the advertising ROI continues to increase and hopefully that means good things for Search budgets.",234

Larry when you think about hardware, are there other hardware categories beyond just phones and tablets where you believe Google can potentially build meaningful businesses? And then Patrick, in Q1, we didn't really see the usual uptick in expenses that you kind of see annually. But then now, we do see it in Q2. It sounds like some of that will be accounting issue around depreciation, but can you help us understand what happened there more?",84

Thanks, Ben, for the question. I think we've been an early innovator in the smartphones and we've been really excited about starting Android when no one really thought it was going to be interesting. And I think it's always a mistake to assume that technology will be static. So I think, certainly, over the long term, we're going to have new kind of devices and always interacting with computing and the Internet. We're obviously excited about Google Glass and new ways of interacting with hardware and new types of hardware. With any technological change, you probably overestimate the short-term and underestimate the long-term. So I think we're really excited about making those investments and making sure we're positioned to live in the future. That's why I love using Glass because I feel like every time I'm using Glass, I'm living in that future. And that's really, really exciting to me.",151

So on the issue of expenses. Look, our expenses in Q2 were completely in line with the objectives we've set for ourselves. In general, we continue to exercise financial discipline and monitor our product profitability. But it's on that basis that we recognize significant opportunities are ahead of us. And with the view to the long-term, we continue to invest significantly and intelligently to fuel these opportunities. The fundamental issue is, as I've said a number of times on previous calls, if you want to hire x amount of people, you have a target for the quarter or for the year. And they come in sometimes a bit over, sometimes a bit under, but the real question is are you still on the right trajectory for the long-term you're shooting for. So that's really the issue between Q1 and Q2, Ben.",150

First on CPC, Patrick, you mentioned a couple of factors behind the kind of deflation there. I don't think you ticked off Mobile, I don't know if there's any particular reason why you didn't or maybe I missed it? And then in terms of the employee adds, maybe a question for Larry. As you think about where you've been able to get employees, the ease or the difficulty with which you've been able to hire the employees that you've wanted to hire, could you comment on how that has changed, if at all, over the last year or 2?",102

Clearly, Mobile has some effect of it and we've talked about that in the past. So it's just one of the many factors that are at work. I just gave the list and the property mix, obviously, and the channel mix includes a bunch of Mobile shifts as well in there. And that's part of the equation, clearly, for sure, that drives both sides of the equation. And I just want to remind everybody that it's always kind of dangerous to just look at CPCs by themselves or just look at paid clicks by themselves. But, in fact, it's the combination of the 2 that gives you the health of the business and these mixes move all over the place, so depending on the number of changes going on in any quarter.

Larry, I think, you sometimes say that technology has done only 1% of what you can do, suggesting that there's a lot of opportunity for Google. If that's the case, why isn't your R&D budget 10%, 20% or materially higher than today? Or in other words, what limits your ability to spend more to capture these opportunities? Secondly, Patrick, can you tell us, in general, what specific financial or operating metrics you use to evaluate the success of Google Fiber as a business?",85

I think that's our main job is to figure out how to, obviously, invest more to achieve greater outcomes for the world, for the company and so on. And I think those opportunities are clearly there. Have we seen in the past some things like Chrome and Android and I've talked about that a lot. I think that execution of velocity I talked about a lot, too. It's pretty easy to come up with ideas. It's pretty hard to make them real and get them to billions of people. And that's what's, for me, so exciting about being in a company like Google is that we get to do technological innovation at scale and get it out to on the scale of the whole world to billions of people. But I wish we can just snap our fingers and accomplish that, but it's actually a lot of hard work, it takes a lot of great people working really hard to make that happen. And working every day to improve our processes, improve our leadership, improve how we're organized and to make that all go faster. And that's why I come into work excited every day. And I think why everyone else does [ph] but I wish we could snap our fingers and do -- just do a tremendous amount more instantly, but the reality is hard work to scale, and that's what we do.",241

Just as a context for everybody, we have been on the public record to say that we're running Google Fiber and excited about it. And we always had profitability as one of the key criteria for this opportunity. And in terms of kind of metrics, they should be just aligned with any sound business that's in that domain of access, which is a combination, at first, actually, was interesting because the question was, how successful was going to be the product? And then, so meaning, how many people will kind of want to take it? And then the second kind of -- so we've been, obviously, very pleased by our results in Kansas City and now the announcements of the other 2 cities we've made since then. And then there's all the regular metrics you can imagine, which have to do with cost of infrastructures, cost to serve and how they flow into our profitability model. So there's no real rocket science in the financials of it. The real kind of magic occurs with the definition of the product. The innovation on the technology that the teams are pushing and what makes Google Fiber a 100x faster than the next best thing. That's really what we're very focused on.

Clearly, the network deceleration, I mean that's why we've kind of made the comment last quarter about the DLA [ph] and the policies. And it's clearly having an impact. Now we've had a number of partners that until Q1 and Q2 have all been notified and have made the changes to their behavior. So these policies are now coming into compliance. And as a result of it, right, you see the impact. But we really believe that this is a really good thing for our users. And in the long-term, will really benefit both the users and Google. So that's the core elements of what's going on there. And then for the second question, I'll let Nikesh jump in.",148

I think it's important to understand, as I said, that improving conversion rates for us requires us to do a lot of things. One is we have to understand the cross device behavior better, you have understand the cross device conversion being built; people can start a search in one device and conclude it in other device. These opportunities did not exist in the past when we're all focused on one screen. In addition to that, as you -- as we talk about mobility, we start to understand the context of the user is a lot better as I said. Where are they? Where have they been? What could their search possibly mean when they're searching for -- in a car parking lot, searching for other car dealership? That gives us a very different signal than, if you're sitting at your desk and searching for a car. So all those attributes, all those factors need to go in and to creating better targeting, better advertising for our end-users so that actually helps increase ROI for advertisers and hopefully ROI for us in the longer term.",189

First, Larry mentioned some of the new features in the Maps, I think also, the Gmail tab update seems like it's being pushed to users now. It would be great to know if you could share the timelines just for the full rollout in the U.S. and internationally? And any implications you foresee the update may have on those that are relying on marketing as a distributor channel? And then secondly, Larry, also spoke about balloon-deployed Internet access. I was wondering if you could talk about another initiative that seems like it has significant opportunity long-term, the automated vehicle opportunity and only [ph] think of that as a commercial opportunity at scale?",116

I think I'm not sure the detail of the Gmail rollout. I think I've been excited to use it and I think it's a really great experience. I think we're doing a lot to improve people's experience on Gmail and that's around a huge number of users on Gmail that's growing quickly. We're really, really excited about it. And as I said, there are some things around the email experience that can be improved and we're doing a lot to organize your commercial offers and things like that, make sure that there are -- you're not getting overwhelmed by spam and so on. And I think those have been great, very user-positive features that are rolling out. I think in terms of automated cars, I mean, I think, again, that's a very early-stage thing. I think we're very excited about it. I think it has potential, again, to have tremendous impact on people's lives, mobility and so on. And I think there's -- nothing have changed about how we're super excited about it and working hard. It's very early-stage project, obviously. And then there's -- last part of your question, I mean, I think, it's hard to predict exactly when these things will be commercial. My question now is, ask us why aren't you doing it today? So I know, we try to reduce whatever roadblocks that we can and figure things out as quickly as possible. And I think -- now, I think, there's great opportunity there.",254

Patrick, just want to ask about CapEx. I think you mentioned in your comments that data centers and other network infrastructure was lumpy and responsible for the doubling of CapEx. I'm just wondering, I'm not sure, from an accounting perspective, what the useful life is on some of those investments and whether or not the amortization of those assets is part of what's causing a little bit of the uplift in operating expenses, so would love to hear a little more about CapEx. And then, Larry, as Google continues to invest for future growth, I just wanted to ask how do you, as a leader of the company, ensure that the people at Google and your employees keep the kind of small entrepreneurial culture that Google had and was known for in its earlier days?",142

We don't give the details of the different categories of depreciation for our assets. But you can imagine that as we build these -- the data centers and the computers, clearly, data centers have a long lifetime because if you think of them as land, electricity, power, building shelves, cooling towers, all that technology has much longer useful life. And then the computers themselves, the machines, the servers have a much shorter lifetime and we track all these by categories, obviously. And clearly there's a relationship between that and our depreciation rates that have been -- between that and -- that having climbing over the last few quarters. But there's nothing magical about it as well. I mean, it's just, basically, what you'd expect by category. On the second question, I'll let Larry answer.",152

I think, I'm very, very excited to see -- I mentioned Project Loon or the automated cars. I think a lot of that is making sure that our employees in Google as a company has permission to do important things. And those things always start with a small group of people. They start with 1 or 2 people and then 10 people and so on. And those people can get a lot of things done. So I think -- probably, I'll measure the health of the company in that way. Are we able to start up new and important things and make traction on them? And that's the only way we end up with things like Android and Chrome. Those were once those kind of projects. So I look at it as kind of a portfolio [ph] thing. For some number of people that like to work on really crazy things that are going to really change the world and want to deal with 10 other friends and work hard on them and we're kind of make sure we're creating those opportunities and growing them into things that become Gmail or Android or Chrome or things like that.

I wonder if you could help walk us through why that wasn't the case, necessarily, in this quarter?

Let me also say maybe one sentence and turn it over to other guys. Yes, I think, it's important to keep in mind like Enhanced Campaigns is the largest change we've made in AdWords ever. It was done pretty quickly. And so I think we're still very, very early stages with that. So we changed tremendous amounts for how our teams operate, how our advertisers operate, how everyone buys those ads, what the users see. And we've done it pretty well. It's been pretty smooth, which I'm really excited about. But like I said, that's the early stages of the very, very major change. I think we're very pleased with how that's going, so...",119

And so on the second part of your question, Mark, I think that the quality -- the force for quality around our policies, I mean, they will take a year to flow through. I mean once you've kind of reset the bar, then it actually, by the time people kind of adhere to these changes, but then you have to, actually, navigate through the entire year-over-year effects, which will probably take a couple more quarters. And that's just a timing issue. Having said that, I just want to remind everybody again that the fundamental issue that we see is it's really important for us to actually have a great user experience. And Susan and her team kind of pound at this by making changes on a constant basis to make sure that at the end of the day, there is that smart about the quality of the user experience and the quality of the ads, because in the end, that's what really drives the benefit in the long term. So when we have to hit -- take some hits in the short term in order to actually get the right answer and the long term for our users and our advertisers, we're always ready to do them, and that's a great example of it. So we're actually not too worried about. We have so many other areas that we've just talked about Enhanced Campaigns, there's PLAs, there are so many other areas that offer us kind of opportunities that we just got to keep this in balance.",261

I guess, one of the questions people are trying to get at is, was there any impact from Enhanced Campaigns on paid clicks and CPCs in the quarter that you could try and help us calibrate?

I think -- and let me step back and say, first of all, it is -- as Larry mentioned and Patrick mentioned, it is an existential requirement for us to take our advertisers and move them to a campaign strategy, which allows us to move them across multiple screens. So this wasn't something that is just a revenue imperative. It's an imperative from a simplicity perspective, from an advertiser return perspective and also from the way our teams operate. So we have spent the last 6 months migrating over 6 million campaigns, as I mentioned, and we've probably been done by the end of this month, which is not too far way. And as you can imagine that we've been focusing in moving these things across-the-board. So we're still looking at the full impact, since the impact has sort of graduated over the last few months. Now in terms of what the impacts of this should be in the longer term, as I mentioned earlier, the impact in the longer term should be that we should be able to provide simpler, faster, better ads to our advertisers across multiple screens. In terms of when you should be able to see effects of these things. Obviously, there are effects that we see and we monitor and we take a look at, but -- for us to go out and start detailing what the impact of these things are. But, of course, in the long term it should have a positive impact on conversions and, as a result, all resulting metrics that affect conversion.",270

As I said in my comments, there's actually a marginal effect. I mean FX was not a big factor this quarter.

Again, a topic that's for a financial analysts have been always kind of top of mind, I just want to kind of reiterate kind of some of the basic messages that have not changed in how we think about this. So first of all, we care about revenue growth. We care about profitability. We care about both. And as I said before, right, we're not in the business to lose money, cross-subsidize or any of these things. So regarding margins, we really look at every incremental profit dollar that create shareholder value and really focus on these profit dollars rather than the percentage margins. Many of the new opportunities that we may be exploring, whether it be hardware, whether it be Play, whether it -- many of these will have different margins in our core business. But they actually offer great kind of huge revenue pools, huge margin pools in absolute dollars. And then create much shareholder value and in many cases with Larry and the product area leads, creates synergistic value between the products to create this great experiences. So that's basically the mindset that we apply at it and we track them, independently, and together, and make sure that we actually deliver continued revenue growth and profit growth. So that's the mindset of which we apply. And don't read in my comments that we're not focused on our core business. It remains our core business. The core is the core is the core. And it continues to give you -- us both revenue and oxygen profits to kind of fuel our growth as well. So that's the balanced answer to your question.",277

And at the beginning of its investment curve, you know that you're actually investing in it for the timing of future profits. We do that, too. I mean you can imagine our very first customer in Kansas City, right? The P&L for that day was negative. But that's not why we did Kansas City, right? We did Kansas city because we knew as a city it was going to be very profitable. So there's clearly products that have, because of the timing, investment moments that actually show -- will show negative. But not because we want them to be negative just because of where they are during investment phase. So that's how we think about it.",146

Let me take the second question first. I think to the extent, obviously, we can streamline your processes of doing transactions or fulfilling any task, that's a good thing. I think in the trial, we're doing in the Bay Area with same-day delivery. You can buy things very easily and get some them delivered in a couple of hours, which is a very great experience.

And as we've talked in the past, things are moving from [indiscernible] to entity level search where people are searching for specific entities and they expect response as a specific entity when they do that search. Do you think about PLA in the broader context? Whenever people search for something, they like to get their answer. And if it's a product they're searching for, of course, PLA satisfy that requirement. So we are signing up tens of thousands of merchants who want to share that data with us, who wants to make that data visible as part of Google Search. So we think this is a good thing. And again, as we provide more and more PLA information, obviously, it has an impact on people's clicking on those links, so in the long term that should have a positive impact on fixes [ph] on various ad formats.

I think the Motorola question has to be put into context of 2 things. One is what we originally paid for Motorola and all the assets we acquired and the benefits we got out of that acquisition because there wasn't only a short-term financial play, there was a number of strategic issues. We're very pleased with the divestiture of the Home business, which kind of generated quite a bit of cash over the last -- in Q2. So I think that you have to put this conversation in the context of the entire acquisition for which we're really pleased. And we also are incredibly proud of what the team has accomplished in the last year. And having now kind of created this great entity under Dennis, who has now kind of lean and mean with 5,000 employees focused on the future and really pounding away yet next-generation products. So I'll leave it to the coming quarters to kind of really demonstrate the kind of new Motorola that's showing up. And you'll see that in the coming weeks actually.

Thanks for joining us today. Google had another strong quarter with $14.9 billion in revenue and great product progress. We are closing in our goal on a beautiful, simple and intuitive experience regardless of your device. 
Research have shown that people tend to overestimate the impact of technology in the short term, yet underestimate the scale of change, longer term. For years, everyone talked about a multiscreen world. Now it's arrived, but at a scale few imagined. People increasingly have more than 1 device, and screens are proliferating in the home, as well as wearable screens like watches and Google Glass. When Android was still a skunkworks project, I used to feel kind of guilty visiting the team. We were a search company, and building a new operating system wasn't an obvious move to most people. It turns out that was a lot of misplaced guilt. Over 1 billion Android devices have now been activated worldwide, and 1.5 million devices are lit up every day. 
I'm also tremendously excited about Chromebooks, which are growing fast and defying a more general decline in laptops. Just like the Chrome browser, updates are seamless and frequent, improving security and usability. This is a great example of technology doing the hard work, so you can get on with stuff that matters. 
Two weeks ago, we launched a new HP Chromebook 11. It's beautifully designed and lightweight and just over 2 pounds and, at $279, highly affordable. Best of all, it has a high-powered micro USB charger that can also charge your Android phone. Recharging is still too way -- too much of a sweat, and there's tremendous potential to innovate, so it's great to see progress here. 
This quarter, we also launched the Moto X, the first phone Motorola has developed and produced since Google acquired the company. Super-fast and clean, and the voice features are great. But while it's still early days, Dennis and the team have already transformed Motorola's product quality. Now they're working to build out marketing and distribution. 
As screens multiply, the ability to navigate across them seamlessly becomes more and more important. That's why I love Chromecast, which we launched in July and it immediately became a bestseller. Pull out your phone, tablet or laptop and start playing some music from YouTube or a show from Google Play or Netflix. For 1 click, the content is there in the biggest screen in your home, your TV, all for just $35. And unlike some other streaming devices, you can continue to email, search and share as the Chromecast handles the hard work without draining your device battery, genuine multitasking in a multiscreen world. 
We've also been making great progress across devices with YouTube. Almost 40% of YouTube's traffic now comes from mobile, up from 6% 2 years ago. And in August, we updated our YouTube apps for Android and iOS. You can now leave a video playing at the bottom of your screen, while you explore other content. 
Our execution and velocity in Search and Maps is getting better and better and from a very high base. A new maps app for iOS and Android shipped in July that's specifically built for tablets to make most of these larger screens. And in September, we've rebuilt our entire mobile search experience with a simple card interface that is easy to read and a design that is optimized for touch. 
Our momentum on Voice Search is tremendous. We added 4 new languages this quarter, making it available in over 79 languages and accents. We've also expanded the quick answers we can provide just for you. So ask Google for your flight details, and they'll appear instantly in your search results. No digging around in your email required. And the search across Google+ Photos is extraordinary. Search for sunsets, and all the pictures you've ever taken in sunsets appear instantly. If you haven't tried it, prepare to be amazed. 
About 2 years ago, when I became CEO again, my goal was to ensure that Google maintains the passion and soul of a startup as we grow. That's why I've worked so hard to increase the velocity and execution. And so, we created great products people love to use and integrate fast to ensure they get better and better because great is just never good enough. 
When you look across the company, it's amazing how the teams are scaling. For example, we rolled out Enhanced Campaigns in AdWords across all devices for all our advertisers in less than a year. Of course, none of this would happen without great people, and we are so lucky that we have them. I'd like to thank all the Googlers and Motorolans who make everything possible. Keep up that velocity and execution. 
Before I hand it over to Patrick, I want to lay in, on the going forward, I won't be joining every earnings call. Patrick and Nikesh do a great job covering our business each quarter, and they will continue to do that great work. I know you all love to have me on, but you're also depending on me to rigorously prioritize my time for the benefit of the business. I am very confident you're in good hands with Patrick and Nikesh. 
So now, over to Patrick.",885
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q3 2013 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2013",2013-10-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3578.0,529341.0,24228696.0,Presenter Speech,Patrick Pichette,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Larry. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us again. Without further ado, why don't we just dive into the details of Google's financial performance in Q3. So here we go. 
Our gross consolidated revenue was just shy of $15 billion at $14.9 billion. The overall business was up 6% quarter-over-quarter and 12% year-over-year. Our Google segment gross revenue grew a healthy 19% year-over-year to $13.8 billion and was up 5% quarter-over-quarter. Without currency fluctuations, Google segment revenue would have actually grown 21% year-over-year, and the currency impact on sequential growth was actually immaterial in our case this quarter. 
Google sites revenue was up 22% year-over-year to $9.4 billion and was up 6% quarter-over-quarter, driven by the strength in our core search advertising business. The advertising policy decisions that we implemented earlier this year to ensure good user experience continue to negatively impact Google's network revenue in the short term. And therefore, our network revenue was, in fact, flat year-over-year to $3.1 billion and was down 1% quarter-over-quarter. Despite the short-term pressures, we continue to believe that this is clearly the right answer for our users and shareholders in the long term. 
And finally, to finish Google segment on a positive note, Google's other revenue grew 85% year-over-year to $1.2 billion and was up 18% quarter-over-quarter. Digital sales of apps and content in our Play store drove year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth in this line. 
Turning to Motorola segment. Our gross revenue there was $1.2 billion. As Larry mentioned, while it's still the early days, Dennis and the team have already transformed Motorola's product quality, and they're working now at building marketing and distribution. By the way, some of you may have noticed that our total consolidated revenue does not exactly equal the sum of our segment revenue this quarter. This is driven by new transactions in our Motorola segment, resulting in intersegment and certain deferred revenues that are eliminated in our consolidated results. 
Coming back to our Google segment. Our global aggregate paid click growth was strong this quarter, up 26% year-over-year, 8% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate cost-per-click was down 8% year-over-year and down 4% quarter-over-quarter. And we should note that the currency fluctuations had a real minimal impact on Q3 cost-per-click. Once again, I wish to remind everyone that our monetization metrics continue to be impacted by a whole set of factors discussed on previous calls. They include geographic mix, channel mix, property mix, as well as product and policy changes. 
Turning to geographic performance of our Google segment. We continue to see steady performance in the U.S. and the U.K. and strong performance in the rest of the world. In our earnings slides, which you can find on our Investor Relations website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and the rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits from our hedging program. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculation. 
The U.S. revenue was up 13% year-over-year to $6.1 billion. And it's worth noting that network revenue that I mentioned a bit earlier, which continues to be impacted by ongoing policy decisions, skews toward the U.S. The U.K. was up 14% year-over-year to $1.4 billion, which includes a small $17 million benefit from our hedging program. In fixed FX, the U.K. grew 15% year-over-year. And our non-U.S. revenue, excluding the U.K., accounted for 46% of total revenue or $6.3 billion. This was up 28% year-over-year, which includes a $5 million benefit from our hedgings program, and in fixed FX terms, our rest of world actually grew 32% year-over-year. 
Coming back to an aggregate level for the total consolidated business. Our non-GAAP other cost of revenue was $3.3 billion in Q3, excluding SBC and Motorola restructuring. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $4.3 billion, again, excluding SBC and Motorola restructuring. For a non-GAAP operating profit was $4.3 billion in Q3, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin for the consolidated business of 29%. 
For Google segment, our traffic acquisition costs were $3 billion or 24% of total advertising revenue. Our other cost of revenue was $2.3 billion, excluding $133 million of SBC. Google segment operating expenses were $3.9 billion, also excluding SBC of $723 million. 
Depreciation, amortization expense on our property, plant and equipment for the Google segment was $630 million this quarter. And our Google segment operating profit, as a result, was a strong $4.6 billion in Q3, resulting in Google segment operating margin of 34%. 
At Motorola, our total segment operating expenses, including cost of revenue, were $1.4 billion. That excludes $30 million of stock-based compensation and $12 million of Motorola restructuring charges. Please keep in mind that intangible amortization expense attributed to Google segment and Motorola are, in fact, included in these segment measures. Of the $281 million in consolidated intangible amortization expense in the quarter, $153 million was the result of the acquisition of Motorola, of which $116 million was allocated to Google segment and $37 million allocated to the Motorola segment. And as a result, the operating loss at Motorola segment was $248 million in Q3 and operating margins for that segment were negative 21%. 
Headcount for the consolidated business was roughly 1,600 people, up in Q3. The Google segment added just about 2,000 people during the quarter. And in total, the consolidated company ended the quarter with approximately 46,000 full-time employees. 
Our effective tax rate was 15% in Q3. Our tax rate this quarter was impacted by the continued mix shift of earnings between our domestic and international subsidiaries. 
Let me now turn to cash management. Our other income and expense was $24 million for this quarter. The impact of FAS 133 expense from our hedging program and realized losses mostly offset interest income in this quarter. And as you know, we often get questioned on quarter-to-quarter volatility of our hedging costs. So to help everyone understand this better, we put together a video tutorial on the topic. You can find the new video on our Investor Relations website. I hope you find it helpful, and let us know what you think. 
For more detail on OI&E, please, again, refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website. We continue to be happy with our strong operating cash flow at $5.1 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $2.3 billion. This quarter, the majority of our CapEx was spent on production equipment, data center construction and real estate purchases. As I mentioned last quarter during my remarks, we continue to invest for the long term and our infrastructure continues to be a key strategic area of investment for us. 
Consequently, our free cash flow was $2.8 billion, very strong again. So there you have it, strong results and an optimism that provides us the confidence to fund strategic growth fully in the opportunities -- areas including mobile business, Android, Chrome, YouTube, enterprise, just to name a few. 
With that, I'll hand it off to Nikesh, who'll cover more details of our business performance in the quarter. And after these remarks, we'll open up the phone lines for questions. Here you go, Nikesh.",1191
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q3 2013 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2013",2013-10-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3578.0,529341.0,24228697.0,Presenter Speech,Nikesh Arora,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Patrick. As Patrick mentioned, our business had a strong quarter with $13.8 billion Google segment gross revenue. Overall, performance was strong in the retail sector. We have good growth in Japan, South Korea and Australia. There are 3 key areas I want to talk about today that are big growth drivers for us and our partners. First, our continued efforts to make advertising seamless, effective and measurable across multiple streams. Second, our progress in bringing brand advertisers online with special emphasis on our efforts around YouTube. And third, our early investments in commerce and shopping to help users, retailers and merchants. And lastly, a few words about new areas like digital content, hardware and enterprise. 
On seamless advertising, it's been a few months since our advertisers moved over to Enhanced Campaigns and AdWords. Clients are telling us they like the new system. Many are still adjusting their campaigns in keywords and developing their multiscreen bidding strategies. For example, we're seeing advertisers bidding more frequently on mobile keywords because Enhanced Campaigns makes it so much easier to do so. They're discovering how they can use the native capabilities of mobile in their ads like location and click-to-call. Example is Discover, who has just increased their mobile spend and used it to promote their It Card. 
Talking about mobile. We've also launched cross-device measurement tools in analytics. There's 3 observations here. First, mobile is driving higher online conversions. American Apparel found that mobile ads were actually driving 16% more conversions than they initially thought. And as a result, they're now investing more to drive more sales. Second, mobile drives more phone calls. On average, there more than 40 million calls driven by Google Ads every month, which is twice as much as it was a year ago. Third, mobile drives in-store traffic. 
Moving over to brand and YouTube. We've seen that our CPG entertainment clients have moved online at greater speed with an emphasis on brand. Spend by our CPG clients on just playing [ph] YouTube has grown over 75% over the past 2 years. For example, the global YouTube campaign for Dove's Camera Shy ran in more than 20 countries and delivered over 62 million views for Unilever. We're also partnering very closely with agencies, but we really like integrating our technology, insights and media with our creatively-inclined relationships. For agencies, marketers and Googlers, it's a huge win-win-win. All of the top 10 global agencies now use our DoubleClick product. 
On the other side, YouTube continues to do well. Video ads, which include TrueView, now form a significant part of our YouTube and brand advertising, and they're growing north of 75% year-over-year. We found that YouTube is our brand torchbearer. It offers the brands valuable, engaged audiences, perfect reach and compelling content. Smart brands are really loving their engagement with YouTube. 
Moving onto commerce and shopping. As Google Search moves to provide people with answers and entities, not just links, we're making good progress helping people take commercial actions, too, like buying products. We're seeing great traction on product listing ads, both in desktop and mobile. As part of this move to a seamless virtual experience, we're also helping retailers offer better payment solutions to their customers particularly on mobile, where it's traditionally been difficult. Google Wallet Instant Buy helps merchants here. After implementing Instant Buy, OOHLALA saw that, from May to August, uses of Google Wallet on their Android app had a purchase conversion rate that was 4x higher than other shoppers. 
Finally, I want to talk about an area, which we are being -- putting more emphasis on, which is our investment in emerging non-ads businesses. As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to see acceleration in the new businesses, such as hardware, digital content and enterprise. 
As Larry mentioned, Chromecast and Chromebooks are enjoying great success. Chromebooks are now available in over 8,000 locations around the world and are being used in more than 20% of school districts in the United States. We're also rolling out unified Google Experience in more than 750 Best Buy stores to showcase Chromebooks, Chromecast and the newest mix of devices under our One Google branded design. 
On digital apps and content, we continue to work hard to roll out Google Play in more markets around the world and add content to it. For instance, this quarter, to help students go back to school, we added a comprehensive catalog of textbooks to playbooks for them to purchase. We brought on content partners like HBO and DC Entertainment. This quarter, we brought Play Music to 8 more countries and playbooks to 18 new countries. So for example, now, users in Russia can enjoy the music, and users in Indonesia can enjoy books. There's tremendous momentum here, and we look forward to making progress in this area. 
Another strong area of recurring and growing revenue is our enterprise software business, making available the best of Google for work. Some great new clients this quarter include Whirlpool, which is now using Google Apps to help 30,000 employees collaborate and innovate more quickly. In education, apps for education is being used by 30 million students, faculty and staff worldwide. 
Beyond apps, Amtrak uses Google Maps to let people see all the trains in the U.S. in realtime. And we're continuing to invest in the Google cloud platform, which has over 300,000 customers including Sanmina, a Fortune 500 company using cloud platforms, to build internal applications that improve their efficiency across their offices globally. 
Lastly, let me call out the efforts of our marketing team that continues to roll out the Google welcome mat to the world. They put on our third annual Google Science Fair, honoring 15 global finalists from the ages of 13 to 18 from around the world, maybe [ph] hosted 400 partners and customers who aren't at our analyst site events most -- more interestingly, to introduce the newest version of Android, called KitKat, we built a partnership with Nestlé to get more than 50 million special Android KitKat chocolate bars on store shelves around the world. And I have to give a shout out to the wonderful ad for our Nexus devices featuring the great sport of cricket that our marketing team is running in Australia. That's a bit of a personal favorite sport.
With that, let me hand it over to Patrick. Thank you, again, to all the Googlers for all their hard work in getting us here.",1078

Could you talk about how long you think it will take for advertisers to move over to fully embrace the multiscreen advertising world, which Enhanced Campaigns should enable or facilitate? And then, secondly, a skunkworks question, voice recognition technology at the company, I think it's something you've been working on for years. I think it's what enables wearable devices in the future. Can you talk about how far along you are in developing a technology to be where you want it to be?",86

So I think I'll -- the first part of your question, I'll send to Nikesh in a minute and I'll take the voice recognition question. I think we've made tremendous progress on voice recognition. Even in a period of months, probably the last couple of months or 6 months, the accuracy has caught up quite a bit. If you haven't tried it, I really recommend that you try it out. It's superfast. On the Moto X, you can say, ""Okay, Google now."" Even if your phone is turned off, it will turn on and answer your question. So I think we're super excited about that, and I think we made tremendous strides and we'll continue to improve accuracy in that to make our products better. But I think they're already super useful, and we have a lot of usage coming from voice. So, Nikesh, on the Enhanced campaigns?",153

And effectively, what our team working with Susan and Sridhar's team have been able to do is to provide 1 single interface and 1 single mechanism to be able to manage our campaigns across multiple devices. Now that's a good thing because it improves process, it lets them see the ROI across various devices with the analytics tools that we come up with. But also, there's a lot of work that needs to happen on the advertiser side because they have to develop beautiful experiences for their customers on mobile devices, as well as larger screens. So I think it's a -- this is a process where we're all going through this together. Advertisers love this new mechanism. They're adjusting their keywords and their bidding models based on all these new efforts, and we're seeing great progress in terms of people who're already advertising with us. But not only that, we're also working with all of our advertisers to make sure they have great experiences on their other screens and other devices so that they can truly leverage this. So I think this is definitely the sort of the first set of steps we've taken towards the future of multiscreen devices and multiscreen advertising, but we think this is the way the things are going to keep evolving.",275

And then Nikesh, you touched briefly on the brand efforts. And I was looking at some data briefly that shows that over the past 15 years, virtually all of the gains for online advertising has come at the expense of print and radio, and none of it's come from television budgets. What specifically is happening now that makes you think it's more likely for those television dollars to finally begin to come online and to Google in particular? And then, just a quick housekeeping one for Patrick. Can you just give us a bit more detail on how the accounting works for the intersegment transactions and how it impacts the consolidated model?",139

All right. We'll work hard on that. So I think on the e-commerce side, I think Google has been using e-commerce for forever, and we're really excited about doing a better job and that I think we want to remove friction when people are buying online or in the real world. We know how people often click on an ad on a mobile device and then may make their purchase on their laptop or they might, in fact, buy it in the store, and we need to really get the conversion data there to the advertiser. So I think we've done work across all those things, across multi-screens, multi devices, from online to offline. We recently launched cross-device measurement in AdWords.

If you look at the last 15 year of history like you talked about, a lot of the gains of online advertising have actually come at the expense of what we would call performance advertising. Anytime you wanted to interact with users, get people to come in to your store, get people to buy your product, get people to click on your website, all of those gains have happened in performance, which has been great. But what's beginning to happen is, as the watch time on various online video sites continues to grow, as more and more online video begins to be available in a non-linear fashion in television screens or recent, as Larry talked about Chromecast, that stuff, a bunch of the gaming devices, a bunch of other TV solutions, they're beginning to see a lot more watch time being expended either on your desktop or in your multiscreen devices or even in television. As that begins to happen, that advertising is more addressable, more directly attributable and provides more measurement capabilities. So we believe that, that's definitely a more superior opportunity for advertisers to be able to interact with their brand customers and actually know who's at the other end. So I think that trend is definitely in the right direction. And now, we're gearing up for it.",223

Actually, this is pretty straightforward change, Ben. So in Q3, our Motorola and Google segments purchased and sold services to each other, and these transactions are reflected in our Google and Motorola segment revenues. The main thing analysts need to realize as they update their models this time is it that the total consolidated revenue will no longer necessarily, like in the quarters where there is transaction, to equal the some of the Google and Motorola segment revenues. So analysts who currently sum up our segment revenues and profits to derive consolidated estimates just need to model an elimination line for the intersegment revenue and profits in order to get their consolidated estimates. So that's simple as that. Thanks for the questions.",136

Anyway, the perception by people outside the companies that Google spends a material amount of long-term R&D that will not generate revenue in the next 2 years or so. Larry, can you help us understand how you think about funding these projects and how much do they correspond versus your total R&D budget? And secondly, Patrick, you said in the past that CapEx is lumpy and we should expect fluctuations. But now, we have had 3 quarters of what looks like high CapEx versus recent past. Are the last 3 quarters the new normal?",111

I think we definitely are working on the accents, so I appreciate that. I think that -- on the long-term R&D question, I think we don't [indiscernible] detail. But I would say that in my struggle in general to get people to spend money on long-term R&D. In most companies, I think, even companies have significant R&D budgets, if you look at that, maybe 99% of it ends up being really incremental, which is relatively small improvements to, kind of, your existing businesses. And maybe 1% of that ends up being kind of doing long-term things like Android was when they got started. And so, I think -- I mean, I kind of view my job as the opposite thing is to get people to spend on the long-term R&D. I do think people have a perception that, that's material. I don't think that -- that's not been my experience since it's very hard to actually spend money on long-term things in any kind of meaningful way. And even the investments we have announced, on things like Calico while they're in absolute dollar numbers, probably significant amounts, they're not significant for Google. And I think you should actually be asking me to make more significant investments. I wish I knew how to do that, but I think it's actually very difficult to spend kind of meaningful amounts of money relative to global scale on things that are speculative.",240

Carlo (sic) [Carlos] , on the issue of CapEx, just to reiterate the fact that the majority of the CapEx this quarter was spent on production equipment, so I think machines; data center construction, looking ahead; and building the capacity ahead of our needs to get the flexibility and real estate purchases. So we had a number of, kind of, really good opportunistic purchases in the portfolio we were targeting, and they kind of came online this quarter, so pretty pleased with that. I think that, overall, investors should see this as a very positive sign and as a positive signal. As I mentioned last quarter during my remarks, we continue to invest really for the long term. It's just the conversation we're having with Larry on the topic of R&D. And our infrastructure continues to be a key strategic area for investment for us. It's really important that when we see signals of -- or opportunities that where we need capacity, the worst thing for us would be to actually not have it in terms of machines and data center capacity. So the strategic value of having it for flexibility for our long-term positions are really important. That's what you see reflected in our investments right now.

Since you've come back into the CEO's role, one of the things we've noticed with Google is that your own advertising spending has moved up. And once upon a time, Google was a company that didn't need to advertise. And obviously, you're in a lot more businesses these days from where you started. But maybe, just philosophically, how do you view that for Google long term as you do launch into more secondary products other than Search?

Dan, to follow up on the marketing question, I think we still encourage our product teams to go out there and get their products to be used by users [indiscernible] products because we believe that's the best form of marketing that they can have. But as our products get more and more popular, there are many parts of the world. We want to make sure there's awareness for those products and people to understand what the capabilities and features are. That's the only time we bring in marketing to kick in. And the other area we do a lot of marketing in is in trying to make sure that our advertisers understand the advertising opportunities, so they can actually spend money with us. So that's roughly how we think about marketing. But the primary focus is definitely on making sure we create great products that users use and a better [ph] products stand and get profit in doing this.",160

Thank you. So I think -- I guess, on self-driving cars specifically, I think that for any big innovation I'm saying you overestimate short term and underestimate long term. That's probably a good summary for self-driving cars. I think we mentioned about this progress. We've driven large amounts of miles. We've changed the business from being something that wasn't going to happen at all to something that now is somewhat inevitable and people's feelings about it, which I think is tremendous progress. That said, it's still pretty early days in the product. I don't know exactly what I've been saying, but it's still ways from being a commercial product. You'll probably overestimate that in the short term, like I said, and underestimate that in the long term. Now for the second part of the question?",140

Listen, we don't -- because you asked the question about what do we expect quarter -- or over the coming quarters? We don't really manage for quarterly CPC trends. We actually focus on the user and the advertiser ROI. So in general, right, we attribute CPC trends to a combination of those 5 factors that I talked about: FX; the 3 mix effects of mobile versus desktop; emerging markets versus developed markets; the channel mix between our sites and our network; then a number of product and policy changes. That's really the big driver. I think that we're really pleased. As Nikesh mentioned, Enhanced Campaigns is a great platform that enables us for the future. And as long as we actually have the format that delivers a great ROI, then Enhanced Campaigns will just accelerate this in the future, and that's what we're working on. So it's really the complex bustle, and it's important that not only we think about CPCs in the context of all the factors I talked about, but what's even more important is the dynamic of those CPCs and paid clicks other. That's really the magic that actually talks about our growth.",207

But there has been a debate for some time about the Internet becoming more vertical and accelerated by the transition to mobile and that, that could serve as a headwind for Google's business, yet your core revenue growth has been remarkably stable for several quarters now, above 20%. Larry, you've talked about this broad topic in prior calls. But I was just wondering if you could give an updated view of the landscape as it relates to your efforts to go deeper into the transaction funnel to offset verticalization, as well as if you could share your perception of Google's competitive position in the multi-device world versus the legacy desktop, laptop world? And then, secondly, any timeline or thoughts that you could give on Project Loon in terms of it becoming a commercial offering?",152

Thanks, Scott, for the questions. I think -- so the first topic is a pretty complex topic. I think we're very well positioned in mobile. I've said this a far [ph] ago, we have the Android. I think we have tremendous services on Android, and we have obviously search and things that work across many different things. I'm tremendously excited about this. I think we have the potential to really improve people's experience as they move more into mobile and spend more time there and to make those experiences much more efficient and pleasurable and beautiful for those users, also as they do things with third parties. And one thing to keep in mind is we've done a lot of efforts around the APIs on Android, around working with top developers and around Google Play. There's a marketplace for those developers. And most things are evolving all the time, and we [indiscernible] users and help those developers. And so, we have a lot of ideas there and a lot of work going on. As I mentioned, I'm very, very excited about that. I think we're tremendously well positioned to tap [ph] in the world, move along and make users' experiences better and to improve our business and our developers' businesses. I think the -- I find I'm spending most of my time now on mobile, and not so much on the whole desktop world, which [ph] I think that's what people are going to generally do over time. I think, on Project Loon, again, it's really early for that. We announced it because we have to because people were seeing Loon and they're flying around and so on. But it's a small team that's very exciting. We've been thoroughly amazed by the positive reaction we've gotten across the world and from high-speed [ph] telcos and other people wanting to work with us, which is tremendous. We want to work with all of them. And I think I found something important than trying to improve overall Internet access, which is something that -- if you're one of the significant number of people in the rural area or a place that doesn't have great Internet access now, that's something that really matters to your quality of life. So we're excited about that.",382

Do you see that pace accelerating over the next 2 years? And also, how will Google continue to differentiate itself here?",63

I'll just say we've always seen a lot of choices in advertising. We've always competed well in that market. I think people are definitely getting more and more excited about moving dollars online. For us, I think, the measurability of it, strength from the tools that are available and technologies to do that, we're just seeing some amazing opportunity and I think people are more and more realizing them. Nikesh?",78

To build on what Larry said, I think it's right that we are expecting more and more dollars to move towards this platform for a variety of reasons. One, there are more options for more players in the market, which are -- that means they're all working hard towards the same goal of convincing advertisers that this is the place where the users are and this is where advertisers need to be. Also, if you think about what's going on, as I said earlier in the context of YouTube, we are going to see more and more video coming onto the web and online mechanisms, which is more targetable and more addressable. In terms of our differentiation, if you look at what we've done over the last many years is we've [ph] actually worked in terms of trying to provide a comprehensive solution across all digital capability whether it's on Google, whether it's off Google, whether it's in our network, whether it's with us, whether it's with partners around the web, whether it's on mobile devices, whether it's on desktop devices, where there's some display ad, search ads or video ads, if you look at it, what we are trying to do is we're trying to make sure that when an advertiser wants to reach users, we can provide them with a kind of comprehensive solution that they can go ahead and advertise. And if you couple that with measurement, which is what sort of makes online so much more compelling that people who don't [ph] look at measurement, look at the analytics around it, so advertisers get a lot more information, they have a lot more options. And of course, in the end, we want to make sure that we focus on very high quality ads. So if you combine all of those things, we think we continue to be working towards providing the comprehensive solution. And we work really hard with all the players in the ecosystem whether it's publishers, agencies or other media property owners, so we feel good about this.",345

First, on the rest of world acceleration, could you let us know if there's any platforms like mobile or products like -- maybe YouTube that really kind of kicked in, in the quarter that really help drive that, maybe it was Google Play? And then, on Motorola, it's now getting close to a $1 billion run rate on annual losses, could you remind us of the synergies that you're seeing with that and why you're encouraged by that and maybe when that could start to turn the other way?",92

So these 2 are the big contributors for that one. As we stand on Motorola, I mean, Larry mentioned it very well at the beginning of the call, right, it is still early days for us. I think that we have -- Dennis and the team have already made a huge transformation at Motorola. We have now great product quality, the Moto X, the first of the products that have come out, and it's actually been very well received great products. So the team is now really working on building out marketing and distribution, which is the kind of next phase of it. So that's the mindset that we put at Motorola. This is not a this quarter or next quarter but much more a more fundamental kind of optimistic and reset view of the company. So that's how we think of these issues. Thanks, Justin.",182

First, just on Enhanced Campaigns, can you give us some sense of what it meant for overall spending in the quarter? And then, also, how do you get advertisers to use the location and time of day modifiers going forward? And then, just on the U.S. business, there was a decel there of about 500 basis points from last quarter. Patrick, you mentioned the networks shift there obviously. But was there anything else going on there?",84

They basically affect dramatically more our network and because of our network, think of AFS, is really very heavy weighted to U.S. That's really was the main driver for that change. I'll let Nikesh take the front end of the question.",62

29096.0,"Google Inc., Q3 2013 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2013",2013-10-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3578.0,529341.0,24228760.0,Answer,Nikesh Arora,,Executives,67,"Yes. We don't -- to be fair, on the Enhanced Campaigns, we're not actually trying to quantify the effect because we believe it's part of the overall experience and it's stepping in the right direction in terms of what we want to achieve. In terms of your question as it relates to location and time of day modifiers, I mean, these are requests from advertisers. But to give you an example, usually, when a car rental company advertises when somebody is in an airport, they are likely to get a higher click through it and higher conversion than if somebody is searching for car rentals when they're sitting at the desktop. So the location can be used as a great modifier in terms of advertising, in terms of getting better conversion. That's just one example. We have millions of examples like that where you can actually use location very effectively or time of day very effectively. The traditional example is when I'm hungry and you show me an ad, I'm more likely to click an ad which offers me restaurant choices or food choices than if I'm not hungry [indiscernible]. So there are different modifiers that allow us to create different advertising. People show up more at lunchtime, so there's a whole bunch of stuff that comes in when you start providing location and time of day modifiers. So that's how things get.",233

I mean, all of you that have worked with us with the investor community group, you know that Willa Chalmers, who is part of our IR team, has been kind of missing in action for the last few weeks. I'm just incredibly proud to announce that Jacob Alan [ph] Chalmers is now in the world and has arrived a couple of days ago. The mom is doing incredibly well. So Willa is doing great, too. So just to let you know that she has not disappeared. She's doing great. The whole family is -- we're all ecstatic about it, and it's another great kind of Googler addition to the family.
