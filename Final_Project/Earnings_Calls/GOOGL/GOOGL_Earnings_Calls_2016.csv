29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2016",2016-02-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3581.0,924324.0,39398148.0,Presenter Speech,Ruth Porat,,Executives,2,"Thanks. Revenue momentum in Q4 underscored the strength of our businesses globally with consolidated revenue growth accelerating meaningfully versus last year. The primary driver was the increased use of mobile search by consumers, benefiting from our ongoing efforts to enhance the efficacy of mobile search as well as from the holiday season. In addition, results reflect ongoing momentum in YouTube and programmatic advertising. 
There were a number of unusual items in the quarter that I will address during the discussion of results. With the move to our new Alphabet structure, we conducted a detailed review of business opportunities and investment levels across Google and Other Bets. We made some important decisions to prioritize the allocation of resources and capital to maximize long-term potential within each area. We are pleased to be sharing financial results for each of Google and what we call the Other Bets, and thereby provide more visibility into financial trends in each segment.
In light of our move to segment reporting, I'm going to present to you in this order: First, review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet; second, review the results for each of Google and Other Bets; finally, I will conclude with key themes for the near term. Sundar will then review our business and products highlights for the quarter. After which, we will take your questions. 
Beginning with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance. Total revenue was $21.3 billion, up 18% year-over-year and up 14% sequentially. As a result of the ongoing strength of the U.S. dollar, we realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $1.3 billion or $1 billion after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 24% year-over-year and 15% sequentially.
Alphabet revenues by geography also highlight both the strength of our business around the globe, as well as the impact that currency headwinds continue to have on our non-U.S. business. U.S. revenue was up 24% year-over-year to $10.3 billion and up 18% versus Q3. U.K. revenue was up 16% year-over-year to $1.9 billion and up 7% sequentially. In fixed FX terms, the U.K. grew 20% year-over-year and 9% quarter-over-quarter. Rest of World revenue was up 12% versus last year to $9.1 billion and up 12% versus Q3. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 26% year-over-year and up 14% sequentially.
Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $3.9 billion in Q4, up 24% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, most notably due to costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation, content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, and hardware costs due to the launch of our new Nexus, Chromecast and Pixel devices.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $6.6 billion or 31% of revenue, up 14% year-over-year and up 15% versus Q3, primarily driven by R&D expense, particularly affected by expenses resulting from project milestones in Other Bets established several years ago. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $5.4 billion, up 22% versus last year. The operating margin was 25%. Adjusting for stock-based compensation, our non-GAAP operating income was $6.8 billion, up 22% versus last year. The operating margin was 32%.
With respect to stock-based compensation, it totaled $1.4 billion, up 20% year-over-year and flat sequentially, primarily reflecting headcount, which was up 15% versus last year and 3% versus 3Q '15. The vast majority of new hires continue to be engineers and product managers.
Other income and expense similarly included an unusual item this quarter. Specifically, other income and expense was negative $180 million, due primarily to the write-down of securities received in conjunction with the sale of a business, offsetting interest income from the investment portfolio.
Finally, taxes also reflect the impact of certain one-time items in the quarter affecting the U.S. rate. Specifically, taxes reflect the resolution of a multiyear audit in the U.S., as well as the full year impact in Q4 of the U.S. Congress making the R&D tax credit permanent. Our effective tax rate for the full year including these one-time items was 17%. 
Net income was $4.9 billion on a GAAP basis and $6 billion on a non-GAAP basis. Earnings per diluted share were $7.06 on a GAAP basis and $8.67 on a non-GAAP basis.
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. CapEx for the quarter was $2.1 billion; operating cash flow was $6.4 billion with free cash flow of $4.3 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash and marketable securities balance of approximately $73 billion, of which approximately $43 billion or 59% is held overseas.
Our cash balance reflects the impact of seasonal working capital requirements and our repurchase during the quarter of approximately 2.4 million shares of Alphabet Class C stock for a total repurchase amount of $1.8 billion. Our Board of Directors recently authorized a modest increase in the size of the stock repurchase we announced last quarter. You can find the details in our earnings release of the total remaining authorization.
Let me now turn, for the first time, to our segment financial results. In our earnings release, we are providing key financial metrics for Google, on the one hand, and the combined Other Bets businesses on the other hand. I will review the results for each segment with respect to revenues, operating income and CapEx, which I will discuss.
You can also find in the release details of stock-based compensation, as well as depreciation, amortization and impairments for Google and the combined Other Bets. As I go through the Google segment, I'll be providing the same level of detail we've presented in prior periods, both to best assist in comparability relative to prior periods and given the fact that Google continues to represent the overwhelming majority of our results.
For Other Bets, I'll be discussing revenue, operating income and CapEx for the full year. Detail on a quarterly basis is included in the press release. Keep in mind that Other Bets represents an aggregation of businesses, many of which operate in distinct sectors with different business models. Given their stages of development, these businesses will have idiosyncrasies with respect to the timing of revenue, expenses and CapEx resulting from milestones, partnerships and other factors. You can expect that results for the combined Other Bets may be uneven in the near term, so it's likely to be more instructive to look at them on an annual or rolling 12-month basis to assess their trajectory.
Starting with the Google segment, which includes our search and ads business, as well as related businesses such as Play, hardware and Cloud and Apps as well as our newer efforts within Google, such as machine learning and virtual reality. Google revenue was $21.2 billion, up 18% year-over-year. This reflects the impact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google site's revenue was $14.9 billion in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year and up 14% sequentially, notwithstanding currency headwinds.
Year-on-year growth reflects substantial strength in mobile search due to ongoing improvement in ad formats and delivery. As I mentioned previously, we also saw the benefits of consumer's greater use of mobile for shopping during this holiday season. 
YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView and Google Preferred.
Network revenue was $4.1 billion, up 7% year-on-year and up 12% sequentially, continuing to reflect the strong growth of programmatic, offset by the traditional network businesses.
Other revenue for Google was $2.1 billion, up 24% year-over-year and up 20% sequentially. Given the geographic mix of our Play business, FX also had an impact on other revenue. Year-over-year performance was driven by Play, as well as continued strong growth in Cloud and Apps. 
Finally, on monetization. As a reminder, these metrics, similarly, are affected by currency movements. Aggregate paid clicks grew 31% year-over-year and 17% sequentially. Aggregate CPCs were down 13% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. In terms of the drivers within sites, paid clicks were up 40% year-over-year and up 22% sequentially. Site CPCs were down 16% year-over-year and down 8% sequentially. The movement in Google sites paid clicks and CPCs primarily reflects the continued growth in YouTube TrueView. Network paid clicks were up 2% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. Network CPCs were down 8% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially. Total traffic acquisition costs were $4.1 billion or 21% of total advertising revenue, up 14% sequentially and up 12% year-over-year.
As a reminder, the site's TAC line in our earnings release includes the TAC that we pay to search distribution partners for distributing Google Search as distinct from their own branded search. Operating income, excluding SBC, was $8 billion, up 28% versus last year for an operating margin of 38%. Google's stock-based compensation totaled $1.3 billion for the quarter, up 18% year-over-year. Operating income reflecting the impact of SBC was $6.8 billion, up 30% versus last year, and the operating margin was 32%. CapEx for the quarter was $1.8 billion, reflecting investments in data center construction, production equipment and facilities.
Full year 2015, Google revenues were $74.5 billion; operating income, excluding SBC, was $28 billion; operating, including the impact of SBC was $23.4 billion; and CapEx was $8.8 billion.
Turning to Other Bets' financials. Other Bets includes effort such as all we are doing with Fiber, Verily, Calico, Nest, self-driving cars and our incubation activities in X. As discussed previously with respect to Other Bets, we're focused on optimizing resources across this portfolio in the near term with the objective of maximizing Alphabet's long-term value creation.
For the full year 2015, Other Bets revenue was $448 million, up 37% versus last year. Reported revenue for Other Bets was primarily generated by Nest, Fiber and Verily. As noted previously, the majority of efforts within the Other Bets are pre-revenue.
On a full year basis, operating loss, excluding SBC, was $3.1 billion. As previously noted, these results reflect the impact of project milestones established several years ago. Including the impact of SBC, operating loss was $3.6 billion. Other Bets CapEx was $869 million for the full year, primarily reflecting investment in our Fiber business
Let me conclude with some comments about our continuing transformation of Alphabet. As Larry articulated in the 2013 founders letter, and then again when announcing the creation of Alphabet, incrementalism in technology leads to irrelevance over time because change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. This belief was the impetus for our organizational structure, which enhances focus on opportunities within Google and across Alphabet, while also pushing our leaders to extend the frontier that we are addressing. Consistent with the move to Alphabet, we expanded transparency internally regarding the expenses and CapEx required in each business, which benefited our 2016 budgeting process and capital allocation decision-making.
As part of this process, we established technical and business targets for a number of the businesses to set the appropriate pace of investment. We made necessary choices to align resources with those efforts that maximize the potential for long-term value creation, prioritizing certain efforts while making tough calls in others. 
Given the fact that we are innovating in a number of exciting industries, in some areas, the optimal execution path could encourage accelerated investment. In others, we continue to receive interests in exploring partnerships or alternate approaches to commercializing our efforts. 
Verily is a great example of where we form strategic partnerships with companies like DexCom, J&J, Novartis and Sanofi in order to accelerate our efforts. My main point here is that we remain on a journey and it is still early days. We are working diligently to build additional businesses that create long-term revenues, profits and value.
Looking forward, a few observations, first, regarding revenue. As a reminder, the fourth quarter tends to be seasonally our strongest quarter, reflecting the benefit of the holidays. In addition, our GAAP results will continue to be affected by changes in the relative strength of the dollar.
Second, operating expenses. As I said last quarter, our priority remains revenue growth, but that doesn't give us a pass on a rigorous approach to expense management. We continue to invest in longer-term opportunities within both Google and Other Bets consistent with our emphasis on pushing the frontier to adjacent areas and moonshots. Given the early stage nature of a number of these efforts, there are likely to require additional investment prior to generating meaningful revenues.
Notably, in many ways, some of Alphabet's biggest moonshots are in Google itself, from driving the next wave of computing through machine learning, capitalizing on the shift to the cloud by enterprises, building platforms like virtual-reality and pursuing the opportunities we see with the next billion users in emerging markets, you should expect Google to continue to invest in efforts to improve life for billions of people.
Third, CapEx. As we've indicated previously, the vast majority of CapEx supports Google. We view our computing capacity as a core competence and we'll continue to invest here given our advantages in providing efficient, secure computing to support growth in both our consumer products and services globally as well as our Cloud and Apps businesses.
In Other Bets, the majority of CapEx supports the ongoing deployment of Google Fiber. We are still operating in only a few cities but have announced plans for additional cities, which we expect will be reflected in 2016 CapEx.
Fourth, our balance sheet. In 2016, we intend to align our capital structure with the Alphabet organization so the debt is held at the holding company level. That alignment would allow us to have greater flexibility as we continue to grow, including the ability to utilize debt financing, if appropriate, and consistent with our changing product mix. So my closing comment is that we saw tremendous revenue growth across our businesses and are applying discipline as we move to implement the Alphabet structure.
I will now turn the call over to Sundar.",2307
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2016",2016-02-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3581.0,924324.0,39398149.0,Presenter Speech,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Ruth. It's great to be here to talk with you all again. Overall, our Q4 results showed a great momentum and opportunity we have in mobile search and across Google's range of businesses. What's most exciting is the incredible enthusiasm for our products among consumers and our partners. Two things show this. First, on our call -- I -- last call, I shared that 6 of our consumer products: Search, Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube and Google Play all have over 1 billion monthly active users each. I'm pleased to share that Gmail now joins those strengths, crossing that number last quarter. Of course, all of these products are very popular and continue to grow rapidly on mobile.
Second, there is incredible momentum behind the Android ecosystem, and the model is working at scale. This is a group of companies with whom we have worked really hard to build strong relationships. At the center of this are Android phones, and it's exciting to see the lineup of flagship devices our partners are working on this year, and there are newer areas which are showing a lot of promise.
In addition to an Android Web partnership with New Balance and a new smartwatch from our friends at Casio, over 40 car brands worldwide are bringing Android Auto to their cars. Dozens of partners are integrating Android TV and Google Cast technology into living room products launching this year.
I want to talk about 2 main things today: First, some thoughts on the approach we are taking to drive the next wave of innovation; and then some thoughts on our advertising business and our newer emerging businesses.
First, a few words on our approach. At Google, we've always tried to bring our unique technical strengths to areas where we think we can make a big difference, like indexing the world's information to make it discoverable. We have focused a lot on really improving Search in mobile, and now we are investing in evolving this to actively assist our users throughout the day in smart and helpful ways. This comes, thanks to our years of investments in areas like natural language processing computer vision, Knowledge Graph and other areas. And the next wave will be powered by big advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, an area where we believe we lead the industry.
Just last week, DeepMind published an incredible result, the first ever to master the game of Go with artificial intelligence, an amazing accomplishment, and I'm excited for the world championship in March. And in November, we open-source TensorFlow, our new machine learning system, to help accelerate discovery and development in the field.
Machine learning is making our product smarter and more useful for people every day. It powers Smart Reply in inbox by Gmail, which suggests short responses that are relevant to an incoming e-mail. People absolutely love this feature. In fact, in just a few months, Smart Reply already makes up 10% of all mobile responses in inbox. From image recognition in photos to eliminating e-mail spam to better translation and voice recognition, our machine learning efforts are making a huge difference for people every day.
In sum, we believe we only scratched the surface of truly being there for our users anytime, anywhere across all devices, giving them the assistance they need. We are excited to make even more progress on this vision in 2016.
The second part of our approach is to make sure we are solving big problems for everyone. We believe that someone in Indonesia should get the same quality e-mail service or search results as someone in New York. This quarter, I visited Korea, Vietnam and India to speak with partners, developers and students. It was a very inspiring trip. I even sat down at a local coffee shop with Dong Nguyen, the creator of the popular Flappy Bird game, which has inspired Vietnam's growing community of developers and startups to think hard about how to create worldwide hits. 
From providing Internet access in India's railway stations, to making Chromebooks available throughout the region, it reinforced what a huge opportunity we have to help the next billion users come online and to have great experiences with the whole Internet once they are there.
That's why creating open platforms that anyone can build on is core to Google's DNA, from Chrome to Android to Billow to our latest logical reality efforts. 
It's still incredibly early innings for virtual-reality as a platform, and Cardboard is just a first step, but we are excited by the progress we have seen. Our partners have shipped over 5 million Google Cardboard viewers, and we recently teamed up with The New York Times on a virtual-reality experience in which over a million Times subscribers received Cardboard.
And since launching in September, the Explorations pioneer year program has helped more than 500,000 students travel to places like the bottom of the sea or the surface of Mars. Beyond these early efforts, you'll see a lot more from us and our partners in 2016.
Now turning to the trends and highlights that we are seeing across our advertising business as well as some of the newer areas. It's hard to believe that AdWords just celebrated its 15th birthday. Just like Google Search in the computing devices we all use now, the product is largely unrecognizable from the first version that launched in 2000. But the key value proposition remains unchanged. Google helps advertisers reach the right customer at precisely the right micro-moment -- when they are looking to buy something, go somewhere, know something or do something.
Mobile is really helping us making these connections for marketers. As Ruth mentioned, mobile search was particularly strong in the fourth quarter. This holiday season, we found that shopping moments replaced shopping marathons. Shoppers turn to their mobile devices to purchase gifts online in spare moments throughout the day all season long, and marketers turned to our mobile ad offerings to reach those customers. And people are actively buying products when searching on mobile. 
Our research shows that 30% of all online shopping purchases now happen on mobile phones. In fact, in the U.S., looking just at Product Listing Ads, revenue for mobile phones exceeded desktop on Thanksgiving, Black Friday and through the weekend. Not only were people using mobile ads to shop online, they also use their phones to find the best products and prices in stores around them.
Our local inventory ads helps people see if a product they are looking for is in stock at a retailer nearby. Marketers at Lowe's and Target find them useful because they can measure the foot traffic that their search ads drove. In fact, thanks to local inventory ads, Target reported millions of incremental stores visits in the week leading up to Christmas.
We also continue to see great success in driving app downloads. Our app promotional offerings, like Universal App Campaigns, which help marketers easily run campaigns in Google Play, YouTube, Search and across our Display network, are getting great traction and delivering results for advertisers. We are now seeing a trend of advertisers moving their app installed budgets to Google.
Now moving to video. People watch hundreds of millions of hours on YouTube every day, and it continues to be a must-have for all brand advertisers. Not only does YouTube on mobile reach more 18- to 49-year-olds than any cable network in the U.S, but the time people spent watching YouTube in the living room more than doubled in 2015.  Brands turn to YouTube to inspire and engage potential customers. And with our recently launched shoppable TrueView ads, marketers like Michael Kors can connect the dots between inspiration and purchase. And it is brands of all sizes. In fact, over the last 2 years, the numbers of small- and medium-sized businesses advertising on YouTube has doubled. 
We also continue to expand measurement options for marketers on YouTube to help them better understand the effectiveness of their ad spend. In addition to our own measurement tools, we recently introduced support for third-party viewability vendors on YouTube. 
YouTube is also a powerful platform for creators. Today, any creator can upload a video to YouTube and get discovered by over 1 billion people around the world. That global exposure has allowed YouTube and Google to pay out over $3 billion to the record industry to date.
We are also investing in the future of video. You can now watch VR Videos on YouTube, and content creators can now film in new YouTube Spaces in Paris and Mumbai. Between incredibly strong viewership growth, the move of advertising budgets to a digital video, great new features as well as the successful rollouts of YouTube music on our YouTube breadth subscription offering, I couldn't be more excited about the prospects for YouTube in the years ahead.
In programmatic video and display, we continue to see strong momentum. More marketers and publishers used programmatic, automated ad buy-in and tools through our DoubleClick platform this holiday season than ever before. Programmatic video impressions double compared to the holiday season last year. And in the week leading up to Black Friday, more than 62% of programmatic impressions came from mobile devices. 
Lastly, I'll discuss some of our newer business areas where we continue to see tremendous potential.
Google Play, our hub for digital content, continues to see great momentum. In 2015, spend per buyer in the Play Store grew by more than 30% globally compared to 2014. We had particularly strong growth in this area in countries like Brazil, India, Indonesia and Mexico, thanks to continued investments in payments capabilities.
On hardware. As you know, last quarter, we launched the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P in more than 30 countries. They are truly great examples of the best that Android can offer and have gotten great reviews. And the adoption of Chromebooks continues to gain a ton of momentum, particularly in education.
Before I wrap up, I want to share some thoughts on our Cloud and Apps group. Public cloud services are a natural place for us so we establish the business unit late last year to take full advantage of the opportunity. I'm excited that Diane Greene, a highly respected industry vet, joined to lead it. As you know, Google pioneered the Cloudscape. Our data centers have handled the workload of Google's own products from search to YouTube for 17 years. We are able to take that infrastructure and computing power and optimize it for all customers. 
Our data centers, infrastructure, machine learning and premium data services are leaders in the cloud space, as is our price to performance ratio. And we are now able to bring this to bear just as the movement to cloud has reached a tipping point. 
Businesses now see that the easiest to use, most price-effective and secure infrastructure can best be obtained through the major public cloud providers.
Google Cloud Platform is already used by more than 4 million applications, and we recently introduced a new way to purchase and use virtual machines called Custom Machine Types so that clients can tailor their purchases based on the memory they need to get the best possible cost and performance. 
Our business collaboration and productivity suite, Google Apps, now incorporates the best of Google's new technologies, like machine learning and natural language processing. Our adoption now extends from large health care providers to retailers to government. 
Last quarter, Catholic Health Initiatives, the nation's second-largest non-profit health system with more 100,000 employees, announced its move to Google Apps. This created buzz at Google around this area, and we continue to heavily ramp up investment here. 
I want to say thank you to all of the Googlers around the world for their amazing work, from cloud computing, digital video and the mobile revolution, to machine learning, virtual reality and helping the next billion get online.
Google has a front-row seat on the trends that will define computing in the coming years. There's truly no more exciting place to come to work every day. With that, I'll turn it back over to Ruth.",2023

First, Sundar, do you believe there's a nontrivial [ph] chance of Google, that it might be achieving strong AI in the next 5 years or so?

I'll answer the first and turn it over to Ruth on the second. On AI, we are obviously seeing incredible progress. In this field, we make great strides, and we start taking it for granted and look to the years ahead. It's always tough to predict what happens over a 5-year time frame, but I do see us making significant strides, even a year ago, and I wouldn't have predicted that we would be in a strong position to mount a serious challenge to the world champion in Go this year. So looking at the pace of progress, I think we will have AI in a form in which it benefits a lot of users in the coming years. But I still think it's early days and we -- there's a long-term investment for us.",137

The way we look at it is we've got extraordinary capability and strength in search and then ongoing innovation across the platform. As we talked about last quarter, we did benefit from a change made in Q3 in ad format with respect to mobile search, and we do continue to benefit from that change. Mobile search growth was the biggest driver again this quarter. And then in terms of YouTube, the momentum continues. The story continues to be about strong growth in video advertising, TrueView and Google Preferred, as distinct from display on YouTube.

So starting with Other Bets. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're at the beginning of a journey with the creation of Alphabet, and breaking this out into the segments is a meaningful step. As you look at some of the numbers, the reason I said it's more instructive to look at annual or rolling 12 months is that there can be some lumpy things on a quarterly basis, but we're continuing to invest across the businesses, as we talked about. So that would explain the '14, '15 trend here. It just underscores that we are investing in the business, we've made some tough choices and, as I said, in terms of how we're allocating across the various businesses, but an important area for us and tried to give you the sizing here in the segment information. And then, in terms of overall Google, we're continuing to invest there as well. We're investing quite meaningfully. As I previously said, the 70-20-10 model is an instructive framework that Larry's articulated for a long time. And as I try to stress in my opening comments, we're looking to push the frontier both within Google and Other Bets. So ongoing innovation is key to all that we're doing in Google, and it's benefiting users and the ecosystem broadly. So you're continuing to see us invest there and notwithstanding that you see the results that you have here today.",237

I'm very excited to have Diane here as well. We are already getting significant traction. It's a strongly growing business for us, and we plan to invest significantly in 2016. It'll be one of our major investment areas. In terms of talking to customers. First of all, as I said earlier, the cloud platform is now already used and trusted by over 4 million applications. And a lot of it is about making sure we are very seriously committed to the space, which we are. And in terms of one thing, there's a breadth of feature requirements. And so we've been carefully taking customer feedback and addressing all those needs. And as time goes by, I think we are getting very competitive. We have natural advantages in doing this, but we also need to make sure we address all the feature needs, and that's what we've been focused on. And I think we are at a point now where the product is ready to be used at scale. And so I expect to get significant traction in 2016.",180

There are -- those are 2 of the business that are, as we call them, Other Bets. Look, on self-driving cars, we have an extraordinary tech team. We've been working on it for many years, and the focus is developing a technology with a real emphasis on safety and understanding what it takes to build and operate fully autonomous vehicles. We continue to make great progress. We've now driven 1.3 million miles with important data regarding safety and utility. And that's what we're really focused on. We've got prototypes on streets in 2 cities. So we're just -- we're continuing to execute against that and continuing to build it out. And then on Nest, we have now more than 14,000 developers who've joined the Works with Nest program, enabling them to connect with Nest products through the cloud. The team refreshed the entire product portfolio in '15, and it resulted in very strong year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter revenue growth.

It's been pretty strong 4 quarters in a row. Is that YouTube and Search? Any more detail on that. It would really be helpful if those individual business have accelerated. And then on the Other Bets business, clearly, you've mentioned milestones a couple of times, the losses have really increased over the last 2 quarters. Could you share any of those milestones with us?",81

So starting with the U.S., I mean, I think the main point is that we've had meaningful growth in all geographies, reflecting the product strength and the added tailwind of the holiday season. And looking forward, we would expect typical seasonal pattern to hold. Q4, as you know well, tends to be our strongest quarter. But specifically on the U.S., that, as we talked about last quarter, really reflects the diversity of our products here. Each is doing well. Mobile growth, as both Sundar and I talked about, was the key driver yet again. But YouTube and programmatic continue to deliver strong growth, and that translates into the results that you saw for the U.S. We obviously had a nice lift from retail. No surprise given the holiday season. But I think, simply put, it's the diversity of doing a lot of -- a lot across a lot of different products. And then in terms of the milestones and your question regarding Other Bets. As I mentioned in opening comments, results this quarter were affected by project milestones. That -- those milestones were established several years ago. And that's why I called out that it could be lumpy on a quarterly basis and why we look at kind of over a year, or over rolling 12 months and not going to break it out in more detail than that. As Larry said, when we announced Alphabet, it's an exciting new chapter. It is about getting more ambitious things done. We're doing that in a framework to ensure we are disciplined with our resources. And this was just calling out a milestone established some time ago.",276

So I guess, at this point, you're explicitly monetizing Search, YouTube and Gmail to some degree while some of the other products maybe they're a bit more nascent are still not monetized or under-monetized it seems. So big picture as you look at the next billion users who are to come online and use your products, are you in any hurry to begin monetization at all? And Ruth, I think since you came onboard, CapEx is down basically every quarter. Grant that fourth quarter of '14 had the discretionary real estate purchase in there. But in your budgeting process for '16, is the nature of what's you're going to be spending money on changing much at all for core Google? And in regards to the CapEx for the Other Bets, being primarily for Fiber, it seems like there's 6 upcoming cities and 11 potential cities. What is the greenlighting process for whether a city gets considered or not?",175

So it'll be over 5 billion users. And from our standpoint, core to our mission, we want to be in a position where we are helping users throughout the day, we are assisting users with their core information needs across all our products. And I think if we do that well, a lot of that information is commercial and hence, our monetization works effectively as well as you've seen this year.

You noted the important difference on a year-over-year basis, a couple of sizable real estate items as part of our facilities expansion that we called out last year on top of continued investment in our technical infrastructure. But really, to the heart of your question, looking ahead for 2016, we do expect to see accelerated investment in CapEx, and that's to support both Google and Other Bets. As we've often talk about, we view our technical infrastructure as a key strategic asset for the company. We have terrific scale and efficiency. And the team has done an extraordinary job innovating to achieve efficiencies following a period of heavier investment in 2014. So we're now delivering about 3x the compute power for the same amount of power -- or dollars we did 5 years ago. And that's an important point because it explains some of the slower CapEx in 2015. But given our commitment that have the most potent infrastructure, we do expect to increase CapEx in 2016. And for Google, that is intended to continue to support growth in our consumer products and services globally as well as all that we're doing for our enterprise clients, as Sundar has already talked about. So that CapEx in both area is there. And then, in terms of fiber and what we're doing more broadly in Other Bets, fiber will continue to be, we expect, the biggest consumer. And again, you identified the driver of it. It obviously increases as we execute in a growing number of cities. One of the main things that also affect '15 is the rollout was really measured as we work to enhance the construction process and efficiency, doing things like developing relationships with cities and establishing protocol with construction partners. But we have more cities announced. And obviously, as we execute on those, that takes more CapEx as well.",318

First Sundar, could you could talk a little bit about YouTube. It's been several quarters now where you've talked about the next shift towards TrueView ads, kind of bringing down the average CPC per site. But can you talk about the trend that you're seeing there, more on a like-for-like basis and whether in theory that should tighten up more relative to search ads going forward? And then, secondly, Ruth, on the core Google business, we've seen roughly 300 basis points of margin expansion here over the last year or so. I know you're talking, obviously, about the investments around cloud and machine learning. Do you think there is still potential there for profitability to improve in that segment?",121

There's really no change from my comment last quarter. YouTube had very healthy revenue growth, again, driven by growth in TrueView and other video ads. But the monetization story is still evolving. It's still early innings, and we're focused on the opportunity to get larger off-line budgets moved to YouTube. Given the level of user engagement globally and the compelling nature of demographics, it does remain a very attractive platform. In the near term, given the growth in viewership, YouTube, TrueView CPC pricing is expected to continue to affect our overall sites monetization mix. And then in terms of Google and kind of margin outlook, I think it's really what you're getting at, I'll go back to my prior comment. We -- what we achieved here by pulling out the 2 pieces is providing, obviously, greater visibility into what we're investing within the Other Bets, but want to underscore that we continue to invest in Google. We're in early innings and in many areas and I already referenced back to the framework we use, which is to continue to push the frontier within Google, as well to adjacent areas. You named one. We talked about it on this call. It's very important, Cloud and Apps, and all that we're looking to invest there. But we're doing more than that. It's also the moonshot areas. It's virtual reality and other areas. And these are exciting early-stage efforts we do expect we'll be in a position to discuss in greater detail over time. I'll let you estimate the short-term impact, but we believe the investment is really important as we're enhancing the long-term potential for Google and continuing to really enrich the ecosystem.",290

Just to go back to the YouTube comments you made, the progress in the living rooms and the progress of YouTube Red. Can you just talk a little bit about how you think about potentially going into more original scripted longer-form content or even licensed longer-form content to go after even larger share of off-line ad budgets? And then, secondly, on the Rest of World, can you just talk about what you're seeing in the emerging market CPCs on a constant currency basis?

On YouTube, obviously, the whole world momentum has been great. We have over 1 billion users watching hundreds of millions of hours. To me, interestingly -- sorry, let me answer the YouTube question first. On YouTube, we have great momentum. We have over 1 billion users watching hundreds of millions of hours. And in fact, 80% of YouTube's views are from outside of the U.S. It's been an incredible year where I feel the team is on fire, focusing on launching YouTube Red, YouTube Music. And as you saw at Sundance, a big push on YouTube originals with the focus from our top creators to create exclusive content for YouTube Red users.

One, just going back to CPCs real quickly. If we were to sort of normalize out both TrueView and currency, I'm just wondering any comments on sort of how core Search is doing and how just sort of core mobile search is doing from a pricing standpoint. And then second, just on the CapEx side. I'm just sort of curious how you think about utilization across all of your products. And are we sort of -- you obviously spent a lot in the past. Are we kind of at a good spot? Do we need to spend ahead? Or is there a lot of capacity that isn't being utilized right now?",114
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2016",2016-02-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3581.0,924324.0,39398180.0,Answer,Ruth Porat,,Executives,34,"So in terms of CPCs, there -- other than YouTube, I guess the other comments to add are, in the fourth quarter, we did see an impact from the ad format changes that we talked about in the third quarter. That also increased our overall click base, and we believe this click growth is a positive indicator of ads that are proving to be more relevant to users. In other words, the CPC trend reflects the fact that the denominator's growing faster than the numerator, but we do view that as a long-term upside opportunity for both CPCs and revenue. So mobile continues to be very, very healthy as evidenced as kind of I tried to indicate in my opening comments, and Sundar did as well, and similarly desktop growth remains very healthy. In terms of CapEx, so we -- I guess, the main point is we do expect that we'll be increasing in 2016. I've already addressed that. I think part of it, you got in the way you asked the question, which is we have achieved efficiencies after this heavy spend in 2014. And that's where the team was very focused, is that we ramped up spend, and then we've been focused on what can we -- how do we extract the most efficiency here. And that, as I said, does explain some of the slower CapEx in 2015 and the reason we've been very focused on indicating that it will be increasing to support all that we're doing. It's quite a bit of requirements on both the Google side and what we're doing in Other Bets and Fiber specifically. So part of it was the 2014 spend and the digestion in '15.",285

Most of them have been answered already. But on the U.K., Sundar, it's now growing over 20% despite a tougher comp. And that's the most mature digital advertising economy globally. And we haven't been over 20% at Google for 3-plus years. So is this mostly a function of mobile search hitting its stride? Is there anything else that's driving that growth up? And what do you think that says about the maturity or lack thereof of digital advertising globally as we look at all other regions? And then, you also made the comment during the prepared remarks that ARPU for Play, I believe you're referring to Play, is up 30%. Is that on a like-for-like yield basis? And is that a function of the personalization efforts that Google has been doing within Play? Or is there -- is that more a function of just the overall content flowing through Play evolving and maturing?",160

On the first stuff, when I think about growth, I mean, you're right. And as Ruth mentioned earlier, too, mobile search, YouTube, they're all working well. But I would take into account, overall, a secular shift in mobile, how users are adopting mobile. And on top of that, I think we are working hard to sell our users well on mobile. So it's a combination of all of that. And I think the model is working well. On Play, to be very clear, spend per buyer is up 30%, and that's globally. And it's a function of, as you pointed out, I think we have made good strides in terms of personalizing the experience for each user, and I think that's borne fruit. But a lot of it is also improving our ability to handle payments for users and developers and to do that better through time at a global scale.",152

Just want to make sure I was interpreting your comments correctly earlier. You talked about looking at the trend line on a trailing 12-month basis the Other Bets losses to get a sense of the trend line. I think there's roughly -- the operating losses roughly doubled on a year-on-year basis, on a trailing basis. Is that sort of the trajectory that you're wanting us to think about going forward? And then more of a housekeeping question around Other Bets. Can you just describe what you mean by project milestones and maybe provide an example of that? And then on the Search business, can you talk about what sort of progress that you've seen in the auction in terms of closing the GAAP between the average mobile CPC and desktop?",137

It was not intended to say take the 2014 over '15 and extrapolate, far from it. The budgeting process that we went through was a very rigorous process. As I said in my opening comments, we prioritized some, we made some tough calls, but very much with a view of having a very disciplined envelope around the way we are looking at the opportunities we have across the Other Bets. And so we've looked at them, again, opportunity by opportunity. In terms of the milestones, they can really vary for a number of things, but it would be linked to anything at the company which, in our view, whether it's technically or from a business perspective, advances the development of the company, the value of the company. And we're not going to go into detail on each one of the specific companies. I think your second question was around Search, in terms of the monetization trends in Search. And I think I've already addressed that one as well when I first provided color on desktop and mobile, but the point is really about the health of both of them. And as I've already said here on this call, mobile continues to outperform. Desktop growth remains healthy.

Our very strong revenue of $20.3 billion in Q1 underscored the great momentum of our businesses globally, with consolidated revenue growth again accelerating meaningfully, up 23% in constant currency versus last year. The primary driver was the increased use of mobile search by consumers benefiting from our ongoing efforts to enhance the mobile search experience.
We also benefited from solid growth in desktop and tablet search as well as continued strength in YouTube and programmatic advertising. We continue to rationalize our portfolio of products to ensure we efficiently and effectively focus our resources behind our biggest bets across Alphabet. I will present to you in the following order: First, review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet; second, review the results for each of Google and Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then review our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take your questions.
Beginning with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance. Total revenue was $20.3 billion, up 17% year-over-year and down 5% sequentially. As a result of the ongoing strength of the U.S. dollar, we realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $762 million or $593 million after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 23% year-over-year and declined 4% sequentially, reflecting holiday seasonality.
Once again, Alphabet revenues by geography highlight both the strength of our business around the globe, as well as the impact that currency headwinds continue to have on our non-U.S. business. U.S. revenue was up 21% year-over-year to $9.4 billion and down 9% versus Q4. U.K. revenue was up 15% year-over-year to $1.9 billion and flat sequentially.
In fixed FX terms, the U.K. grew 21% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter. Rest of World revenue was up 14% versus last year to $9 billion and down 2% versus Q4. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 25% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. GAAP other cost of revenues were $3.9 billion. Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $3.6 billion, up 27% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, most notably due to costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation; content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube; and hardware costs, related to sales of new Nexus, Chromecast and Pixel devices launched in the fall. 
GAAP operating expenses were $7.3 billion in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $6 billion or 30% of revenue, up 11% year-over-year and down 9% versus Q4. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by R&D expense, mainly due to compensation expense related to headcount growth.
On a GAAP basis, operating income was $5.3 billion, up 20% versus last year. The operating margin was 26%. Non-GAAP operating income was $6.8 billion, up 21% versus last year. The operating margin was 34%. 
With respect to stock-based compensation, it totaled $1.5 billion, up 24% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially, primarily reflecting increased headcount and the impact of our senior executive equity refresh that occurs every 2 years. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 64,115, up approximately 2,300 from last quarter. The vast majority of new hires continue to be engineers and product managers in areas where we've prioritized investment, such as cloud and apps.
On a numbers basis, we're adding more headcount in Google, while on a percentage basis, we're growing faster in Other Bets. Other income and expense was negative $213 million. As discussed on prior calls, OI&E consists of a number of line items with different drivers, which makes it inherently unpredictable. The key drivers this quarter were the ongoing drag from foreign exchange given the volatility in currency markets as well as losses recorded for marketable and nonmarketable securities. These items offset interest income from our investment portfolio, which remains fairly consistent.
Our effective tax rate was 18%, reflecting the geographic mix of our income and adoption of a new accounting standard that reflects certain SBC tax benefits in GAAP earnings that were previously recognized in equity. We have excluded these benefits in our non-GAAP earnings. 
Net income was $4.2 billion on a GAAP basis and $5.2 billion on a non-GAAP basis. Earnings per diluted share were $6.02 on a GAAP basis and $7.50 on a non-GAAP basis. Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow.
CapEx for the quarter was $2.4 billion, the substantial majority of which supported the Google segment. Operating cash flow was $7.7 billion with free cash flow of $5.2 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $75.3 billion, of which approximately $45 billion or 60% is held overseas. This reflects our strong operating cash flow offset by the impact of our share repurchases during the quarter of approximately $2.1 billion. Let me now turn to our segment financial results.
Starting with the Google segment. Revenue was $20.1 billion, up 17% year-over-year, which includes the impact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenue was $14.3 billion in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. Year-on-year growth reflects substantial strength in mobile search due to the ongoing benefit from the improvement in ad formats and delivery that we launched in the third quarter of last year.
We continue to have solid growth from desktop and tablet search. YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView and Google Preferred with a growing contribution from app promotion. Network revenue was $3.7 billion, up 3% year-on-year and down 11% sequentially, continuing to reflect the strong growth of programmatic offset by the traditional network businesses.
Other revenue for Google was $2.1 billion, up 24% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. Year-over-year performance was driven by Play as well as continued strong growth in cloud and apps and a nice contribution from hardware.
Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release. As a reminder, these metrics similarly are affected by currency movements.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $3.8 billion or 21% of total advertising revenue, up 13% year-over-year and down 7% sequentially. The increase in both sites TAC and network TAC as a percentage of revenue reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile and programmatic, carry higher TAC. 
Operating income, excluding SBC, was $7.6 billion, up 22% versus last year for an operating margin of 38%. Google's stock-based compensation totaled $1.3 billion for the quarter, up 25% year-over-year. Operating income reflecting the impact of SBC was $6.3 billion, up 21% versus last year, and the operating margin was 31%.
CapEx for the quarter was $2 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities and data center construction.
Turning to Other Bets financials. As a reminder, the majority of these efforts are prerevenue. We continue to invest across these opportunities, doing so in a disciplined way. Because Other Bets results aggregate the revenues and expenses from a number of businesses operating in different industries, there is likely to be lumpiness in the reported results from quarter-to-quarter, which is why we think it remains most instructive to look at them over a longer time horizon.
For Q1, Other Bets revenue was $166 million, up 108% versus last year. Reported revenue for Other Bets was primarily generated by Nest, Verily and Fiber. Operating loss, excluding SBC, was $657 million in the first quarter. Including the impact of SBC, operating loss was $802 million.
Other Bets CapEx was $280 million in Q1, primarily reflecting ongoing investment in our fiber business. Looking forward, a few observations. First, regarding revenue. Our culture of innovation drives our strong revenue growth. We've talked previously about the benefits from changes made to ad formats and delivery in the third quarter of 2015, and that continues to be a tailwind. Mobile, as an example, continues to offer sizable opportunity for revenue enhancement, given the increasing ubiquity of mobile use by consumers and the strong location and contextual signals for mobile devices.
Although we remain intensely focused on innovation across Alphabet, the timing and magnitude of ongoing changes obviously are inherently uncertain and are not designed with an eye toward quarterly schedules.
Second, as to expenses. Within Google, we continue to be focused on managing the expenses that we can actually control, as you can see from our results again this quarter. However, the secular trends driving revenue are accompanied by greater required investment in our ecosystem to support that revenue growth, most specifically the continued trend of higher TAC due to an ongoing change in mix within our sites and network businesses.
Third, regarding CapEx. As we've consistently said, technical infrastructure is a key strategic asset for us. We have tremendous scale and continue to add to it. The team continues to deliver innovative solutions that are creating meaningful efficiencies in machine use, allowing us to benefit from earlier investments and meet our growing Google requirements cost effectively.
With regard to CapEx investments for Other Bets, the bulk of that is directed to our fiber business, where CapEx should obviously increase as we execute in a growing number of cities. Fourth, about our balance sheet. As I discussed on our Q4 call, last quarter, we initiated steps to align our capital structure consistent with the move to Alphabet, providing greater flexibility as we continue to grow. Our exchange offer will be completed on April 25, and we have completed the move of our commercial paper and revolving credit facility from Google to Alphabet.
Finally, our strategic prioritization. As I indicated last quarter, there are a number of different execution paths we are pursuing to optimize our investments and opportunities. In some areas, we will be increasing investment if teams meet milestones we set as part of our 2016 budgeting process.
In other areas, we've chosen to work with industry-leading partners who can increase our momentum. Finally, in certain areas, where we have had multiple teams developing different approaches to a similar technology, we've been evaluating how to rationalize these approaches, enabling us to increase investments around a smaller, more focused set of opportunities.
So my closing comment is that in Q1, we continue to see tremendous revenue growth across our businesses and we remain focused on disciplined investing for the long term. I will now turn the call over to Sundar.",1735

It's great to join you all today. Our teams are off to a great start this year, and there is even more excitement in the month ahead as we gear up for big events, like our Annual Developer Conference, Google I/O; our YouTube Event Brandcast and the Google Performance summit for Advertisers.
Google's mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. And after 17 years, we have just scratched the surface of what's possible. We are reinvigorated around this mission. And as you will hear, we are making solid progress across many of our products.
Today, I'll quickly share a few highlights from the quarter as well as some of the areas where we are investing to make our products more useful and intelligent. Then I'll give an update on our advertising business and our growing cloud business.
A few highlights from the quarter. We continue to invest in making search more useful and assistive. In the early days, when you did a search on your desktop, we gave you 10 blue links and then sent you on your way. Users still had to do too much work to find the information they were looking for. We've made a lot of improvements over the years to add more comprehensive and assistive information right within the search results.
For instance, 10 years ago, if you tried to find the score during your favorite soccer team's match, we'd likely point you to some news articles or the team's website. Today, we show the live scores for nearly 200 soccer leagues across 70 countries, so fans around the world can quickly find information like upcoming schedules, team news and conference standings, right in the search results.
We are incredibly well positioned to better assist our users. Thanks to our strengthened areas like search, geographical information, machine learning, image recognition and natural language processing. One of the key ingredients behind this push towards greater assistance is AI. We've long invested in building the best machine learning team and tools, and we are seeing these efforts bear fruit in many ways.
As many of you saw last month, DeepMind's AlphaGo has been making great strides. It was a privilege to play legendary Go player, Lee Sedol, in such an important milestone for artificial intelligence. This is another step towards creating AI that could help us with everything from our daily tasks to potentially even bigger challenges, like climate change and cancer diagnosis.
At Google, machine learning is already helping us improve our product every day in search and many other areas, like photos, maps and more. Last quarter, I talked about how machine learning helps Smart Reply suggest responses in Inbox. This quarter, we launched Goals in Google Calendar, an intelligent feature that helps users make the most of their time. You just add a personal goal, like run 3x a week, and calendar will help you find the time then help you stick to it. There's still a lot more that we can do to make search and other Google services more assistive and helpful to you. You'll see a lot more from us this year.
On the content side, we are seeing great traction on Google Play and YouTube. YouTube still has incredible momentum, and we continue to invest heavily here. What seemed like a moonshot a decade ago has grown into a booming community of engaged users, creators and brands, unlike any other video platform. YouTube on mobile alone now reaches more 18 to 34 and 18 to 49-year-olds in the U.S. than any TV network, broadcast or cable.
This past quarter, we launched YouTube Originals. Original content available on our premium service, YouTube Red, and we are very pleased with how it's been going. And earlier this week, we announced that we are making 360-degree live streaming available globally on YouTube. We are kicking things off by live streaming select performances at Coachella for fans around the world in 360 degrees.
Google Play remains a thriving help for digital content across apps, games, music, movies, TV and books. Game developers of all sizes are building successful businesses in the Play Store, thanks to its global reach of over 1 billion users.
In fact, in 2015, we saw 50% more games reach over 1 million installs compared to the previous year. And we keep adding great content to Google Play. For instance, performances by artists, like Coldplay and Justin Bieber, from the 2016 Brit Awards are available exclusively on Google Play music.
When we talk about great content, the mobile web is equally important. This quarter, our simple, fast and secure browser, Chrome, reached another important milestone, surpassing 1 billion monthly active users on mobile alone. And of course, one of the keys to a great mobile experience is fast content. As you know, we have teamed up with hundreds of publishers and tech companies to improve the mobile web for everyone with Accelerated Mobile Pages. Early data shows that these pages load 4x faster and use 10x less data than traditional pages.
We recently made it easy to find AMP in relevant mobile search and Google news results, giving users a lightning-fast reading experience for top stories. And there are great advertising opportunities for publishers in these new fast pages. Another example is progress of web apps, which combine the best of the web and apps, allowing companies to build mobile sites that load quickly, send push notifications, have home screen icons and much more.
Of course, computing is the foundational layer through which all our products are delivered. In March, we previewed the Android N release to give developers an early look at what's coming in the next version of our software. This release has key features like multi-window support, direct reply notifications and battery efficiencies. We are also building for future platforms. We expanded Android Auto to Brazil, and Android Wear partners like Michael Kors and Fossil also announced that they are working on new devices coming later this year. In our newest platform, VR, we also recently introduced VR view, a quick and easy way for developers to include 360-degree VR images and videos in their apps and websites. Now moving on to some of the key drivers and trends in our advertising business.
As people turn to their mobile phones in moments of high intent, which we call micro-moments, Google has a compelling value proposition. We offer marketers 4 things. The best ways to target commercial intent at the right moment; the best mobile ad formats; the best reach and range of quality inventory; and a leading measurement solutions.
First, thanks to our unique intent signals, we are able to connect marketers with right customer at precisely the right time. A new example of this is Customer Match, which helps brands reach their most valued customers on Google Search, YouTube and Gmail with highly relevant and targeted ads.
After using Customer Match, to reactivate their loyal customers, specialty retailer, Williams-Sonoma, reported a 50% lift in revenue compared to previous campaigns that didn't use Customer Match.
Second, we continue to invest in the best new mobile ad formats, tailored to help users find exactly what they need at the right moment. For example, we rolled out model automotive ads, which helps automakers recreate the showroom experience by featuring images of cars alongside helpful information right in the mobile search results. On average, participating brands see a more than 30% increase in the engagement rate with these new automotive ads compared to standard text ads.
Third, we provide advertisers with the best reach in inventory across many of the web's most coveted platforms. Marketers like HBO NOW are seeing great results from our popular app [ph] promotion offerings, like Universal App Campaigns, which helps advertisers easily run campaigns in Google Play, YouTube, Search and across our Display Network.
In fact, in January, we saw a 200% year-over-year increase in ad-driven installs in Android alone. And in our burgeoning programmatic business, we recently rolled out Programmatic Guaranteed, a new way to conduct direct deals between advertisers and publishers on high-quality inventory.
And fourth, we give marketers powerful measurement tools so they know exactly how effective their ads are. Just this week, we announced the availability of sales lift studies to help consumer package goods -- brands better understand how their online videos are driving off-line sales. This adds to our significant efforts in this area.
I want to specifically highlight the success we are seeing with YouTube advertising. As YouTube continues to grow with great content and engaged users -- marketers can't get enough. For example, Microsoft Xbox hosted a 6-hour live-streamed event on YouTube for their Halo 5 opening week, promoted with TrueView ads, where 8 million people tuned in, helping it break sales records. Excitement is especially high as we head into our annual Brandcast event coming up next month.
Thanks to the success of Google Preferred, this is the third year in a row we'll be making it the cornerstone of our offering to marketers. In fact, number of brands in the U.S. using Google Preferred has doubled year-over-year. 
Now I want to spend time on our exciting enterprise businesses, which have been gaining momentum. Last December, we have unified our cloud businesses under one leader so we can innovate faster and better serve our customers. This decision is already paying off. Enterprises are starting to see the power of combining Google Cloud Platform with a suite of business applications, all of which are infused with our machine learning services.
As companies accelerate their move to cloud, we can help them automate their IT operations, better understand their data and become more cost-effective and secure while also offering them transformative office productivity.
In addition, we are helping customers adopt our powerful Chromebooks and Android phones. Our recent NEXT 2016 conference in San Francisco showed just how serious we are about the enterprise. It was wonderful to hear executives from Spotify and Coca-Cola share their stories about how they are benefiting from Google's cloud technology, including our best-in-class security, reliability and analytics. We also introduced cloud machine learning, which provides modern machine learning services with pretrained models, such as Cloud Vision API and Cloud Speech API.
Our growth was accelerating going into that event. And since then, the quantity and quality of our enterprise conversations has risen to a whole new level. Now we are investing in building our go-to-market activities to ensure we have the right expertise available for each of our business customers. We are enabling service partners to assist customers with everything from migrating to the cloud to using machine learning to understanding their data. We are providing engineering to help them architect solutions, and we are building out our support teams.
We are also helping businesses migrate to our suite of productivity applications, like Gmail, Docs and Drive, and customers love them. And we continue to accelerate our innovation in this area with new enhancements, such as Smart Reply and voice typing. 
It's gratifying to see the immensely positive response from our customers and partners, who recognize that we offer a powerful combination that's unique to Google, unmatched product innovation, combined with world-class security and reliability, technical transparency and customer orientation.
To close, as I said before, Google's mission is, and has always been, to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. As I think about all our businesses and each of the countries we reach, I've never been more excited about how our teams continue to bring this mission to life and make technology available for everyone. I've been so proud to see us expanding our core products to more and more countries around the World, Street View in Sri Lanka, YouTube in Nepal and Pakistan, new Hindi keyboards in India and a new engineering center in Singapore that will help us get closer to the next billion users coming online by developing products that will work well for them.
We are laser-focused on our mission at Google. And I want to say thank you to all of the Googlers around the world who are helping us make it a reality each and every day.
Before we take your questions, Ruth and I wanted to take a moment to pay our respects to Bill Campbell, a very close friend and a mentor to many of us at Google and Alphabet who sadly passed on Monday. Bill spent endless hours with our founders on our leadership over the years, helping to build our Board of Directors and sustain our culture. He had a very big impact on our company, made us all smile and inspired many great leaders of the Valley. We offer our condolences to Bill's family, and we will miss him.
And with that, I'll hand it back over to Ruth.",2151

And that was really strength across products. U.K., we're really pleased with the team. We continue to see great execution there. On a fixed FX basis, as I noted, up 21%. The biggest contributor to growth in the U.K. was mobile search and then Rest of World growing at 25% on a fixed basis, that's about in line with last quarter. We continue to be really pleased with the growth we're seeing there. In addition to the ongoing contribution from mobile, the Rest of World also benefited from Play.

First on margins. Despite the increasing TAC, the percentage of revenues, adjusted operating income margin expanded almost 130 bps -- 140 bps for Google year-on-year. Can you help us understand, even if roughly, how much of this margin expansion is specific to the quarter like -- due to FX versus systemic or secular, so to speak? And the second question, I think maybe for Sundar. Can you talk a bit about the decision you took last year to have an additional ad on mobile search response pages relegating organic results below the fold? How is it good for the user experience to have ad instead of organic? And if it's good, what does it say about the potential for innovation in organic search?",128
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3505.0,1216441.0,49745433.0,Answer,Ruth Porat,,Executives,11,"Thanks, Carlos. So starting on the margin question. You've hit a couple of the components. So I'm going to try and just break it down into the drivers on cost of sales versus OpEx more broadly, as you asked it. So on cost of sales or the gross margin trend, as I tried to make clear, certain costs associated with revenue are going up, given secular trends in the market. So in sites, mobile carries higher TAC than does desktop. And mobile remains a strong growth driver, so we do expect this to continue. And then on the network side, we have strong growth in programmatic, and that carries higher TAC than traditional ad buying. The obvious result is more revenue and gross margin dollars, but at a lower margin. And then on OpEx, more broadly, we remain very committed to long-term revenue growth. And profit, as we've talked about on prior calls, we did set priorities in the 2016 budget, and we made some tough choices because our aim is to be as efficient and effective as possible with investment dollars while properly funding the big opportunities that we have that are reflected in OpEx. So as I've repeatedly said, some of the biggest bets are in Google. Sundar commented quite a bit on cloud. That's an exciting opportunity. We want to continue to add headcount to drive growth. And all of this is consistent with our goals of driving long-term growth in revenue and profits. So it goes to my opening comments that we're focused on controlling the expenses we have and then there are certain trends, as I noted in particular, on the TAC side, that have been increasing with a strong growth we're seeing in mobile and programmatic.",292

And they're squarely focused on optimizing for positive metrics across users and advertisers. So our utmost focus is making sure for users these changes have a positive impact. And mobile is an entirely different paradigm. So lot of things are counterintuitive. So for example, users are very comfortable swiping on mobile.

So the U.S. had greater-than-expected seasonal downtick. It was down 9% quarter-on-quarter. And I know that you picked up Yahoo! and lost AOL from 4Q to 1Q. So is that the primary driver of that? Or as YouTube becomes a bigger percent of your revenue, should we expect greater seasonal uptick in 4Q and seasonal downtick in 1Q? Can you just give us a little bit more color on what's driving that?",87

It seems like there was a little bit of an extra bump up this quarter. Would there have been any one major renewal of a deal that would have caused that? It did seem to spike more than what you would get if, I assume -- if you just rolled out mobile and programmatic. And then any commentary at all on Nest? There seemed to be an unusual amount of press intra-quarter on troubles with that asset. Could you just comment on qualitatively how the asset is doing?",103

So really nothing to add on the sites TAC side. And then on the network side, again, it's really the higher TAC that we are seeing on programmatic. So nothing really to call out. And then with respect to your question on Nest, it's -- what I'll add there is Nest products are our best sellers in the category. It's a leading brand in the connected home. It's obviously early, but a very exciting category. As we've talked about, our Other Bets are all very early stage but continues to be bestseller in the category.",124

Obviously, I talked about it a lot in my prepared remarks. And we already had a lot of momentum in this area. And in many ways, given the scale at which we have done this internally for us, we view it as an area we are very competent at. What Diane has brought to us is a deep understanding of how to think about what enterprises need and adapt to it in a very detailed and nuanced way. And you saw the momentum at the NEXT conference, which she hosted. We are getting a lot more inbound. We are in much deeper conversations than we've ever been before. We do think we are competitive across a range of workflows and areas where we view we will be uniquely capable over time is because of our machine learning capabilities, helping enterprises really understand their data, understand how best they can do, what their core competency is and really the evolution is around that. It's early days, and it's a long-term investment. But bringing our machine learning APIs over time through cloud to our enterprise customers is going to be a huge source of differentiation for us.",197

First, Sundar, I was hoping you could comment more on mobile search pricing, in particular, it gets a little bit lost just with an overall pricing per click, especially with YouTube in there. So I was hoping you could comment on pricing on more of a like-for-like basis and as inventory perhaps stabilizes some, would you expect pricing here to increase over time as conversion improves? And then, secondly, Ruth, if you could just comment a little bit more on other income and just help us understand some of the details there on the negative number in that line?",101
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3505.0,1216441.0,49745446.0,Answer,Ruth Porat,,Executives,24,"So I'll take those. In terms of the first question, there's obviously some data, as I referenced, attached with the press release. And as you know well, all of the monetization data reflects a host of factors, from geographic mix and device mix and property mix as well as it's all on a floating FX basis and clearly FX as a contributor. I think you're trying to get more color on mobile. And what's hopefully, clear from the opening comments is that mobile continues to outperform. Desktop growth did pick up modestly in Q1, but from opening comments it should be clear that mobile search revenue was up significantly. And then in terms of your question on other income. So that's also -- let me point you to the OI&E table that's at the end of our press release. This line can consist of a number of different items that can be affected by different trends, but you can see the breakout in that table, which hopefully is helpful there. Interest income has been fairly consistent. We do continue to manage our portfolio conservatively. FX is consistently an expense here. It was slightly elevated again this quarter, given the ongoing volatility in foreign exchange markets. We haven't changed our approach to hedging, but up with volatility in the markets. And then in the OI&E line also includes changes in value were equity picks up related to marketable and nonmarketable securities and investments. We appreciate with all those different line items, it's tough to forecast, but you can see the detail attached to the press release.",266

At this point, are you able to elaborate on what percent of these users have either a Google ID or are known users for you? Then, Ruth, kind of a housekeeping, I guess, item on the CapEx here. When you talk about CapEx for the Other Bets being primarily for fiber, is this a fairly sort of straightforward passing of homes? Or is your cash used going toward developing new technologies or products like SkyBender?",99

Maybe I can add more color this way. So our user base is scaling most -- we're also seeing tremendous shift towards mobile. So in many of these products we are already over 50% of these users are coming from mobile. And in mobile, typically, the users are -- all users are signed in. And so I think over time, as the shift continues, I think we have a user base, which is signed in. And so that's the way we think about it.",89

The CapEx trends in part is efficiency and part is timing. When you look at year-over-year spend compared to last year, we had some outsized machine spend that filled some recently constructed data centers. And as we've consistently said, our technical infrastructures are really key strategic asset for us. We have tremendous scale. We continue to add to it. And the team has done extraordinary job innovating to deliver some meaningful efficiencies in machine use, and that enables us to benefit from earlier investments. And although you ask about the fiber side, just to build off of what Sundar was saying on cloud, given what a strategic priority that is for us and the requirements for a leading cloud business are clearly at the core of all that we do and at a scale that's unmatched, given our sustained investments and infrastructure. One of the things that was also mentioned at NEXT is that we plan to add 12 new regions. And to be clear, we're going to be using multiple execution pass for those data center requirements. In other words, every cloud region isn't necessarily going to be housed in a Google data center. So we don't need to build data centers in all of these places. They will all incorporate the same Google hardware and software and meet the same performance, reliability and security requirements. And investing in cloud isn't only about CapEx. We also put a lot of headcount behind that again in this quarter. And then more specifically on the fiber side, as you were pointing to, we do expect that to increase throughout the year as we execute on the cities that we've already announced. It's primarily about continuing to execute on those cities. We now are up to 22 announced cities, 2 most recent announcements being -- some buildings we're bringing fibers like buildings in San Francisco, and we're working with the City of Huntsville. That being said, I liked your question because we're also very focused on innovation and technology. And so it's really both, but predominantly continued execution against these cities that we've announced.",365

First for Sundar. Can you talk about the cloud. Why really get more aggressive now? We've been riding on it for many years. I'm just wondering, why now really ramping up the investment? And how would you characterize the margins or the returns on capital in that business? Why is that interesting for you? And then maybe for Ruth. You give us a lot of detail on quick growth. But I'm just wondering if you can help us all on query growth. Just how that's trended since mobile really took off. Is it growing? How is it trending? And do you have more room to monetize given where your ad coverage is now?",117

And that's why we are really ramping it up. The first is we've always been doing cloud. It's just that we were consuming it all internally at Google. So -- and but we have -- as we have grown -- really mature in terms of how we handle our data center investments and how we can do this at scale, we've definitely crossed over to the other side where we can thoughtfully serve external customers. So that's the first point of inflection. The second point of inflection for us is, as we've been investing in machine learning and AI for years, but I think we are at an exceptionally interesting tipping point where these technologies are really taking off. And that is very, very applicable to businesses as well. And so thoughtfully doing that externally, we view as a big differentiator we have over others. And third is definitely Diane Greene coming in, and I think I wanted to scale our efforts here thoughtfully when it is set up with a great leader who understands this space deeply. And so those are the 3 main reasons why we are significantly ramping up what we're doing there.",212

As Sundar said, focused on answers -- there are a lot of new ways to search on mobile, of course, voice, et cetera. So let me try and actually add a little more on your question on cloud. We've consistently said it's early days. You asked about ROIC. We're really excited about the magnitude of the opportunity, as Sunder has talked about. And one thing that's really powerful here is we're benefiting from our heritage, from our differentiated strength, the scale of our infrastructure, those were investments we've made over many years that give us extraordinary efficiency. We have robust security, again, we've invested over many years. We have unparalleled machine learning.

And then, Ruth, you mentioned in your prepared remarks mobile search being driven by improvements in ad formats and delivery starting in the third quarter of last year. Is there any way to frame or think about what sites revenue growth might be on a recurring basis if we were to -- try to exclude the impacts or benefits from the changes in formats that you mentioned, and as we start to think about the year-over-year growth comparisons there for the back half of 2016?",142

Fiber is one of the businesses that is in Other Bets, and like all of our access efforts, we're really focused and our vision here is to create abundant and ubiquitous networks. We think there's a lot of opportunity to improve the experience that users have, and that's where the Fiber team is focused. And we have some other efforts within Other Bets that are really exciting as well that address access -- Loon, within our ex-businesses targeting the 4 billion people still offline and we view that -- in some ways [ph], it's big opportunity and then an important problem to address. And in terms of the early learnings, there have been a lot -- as I talked about on the last quarter call, we've really continued to refine and enhance our go-to-market strategy, the way we're working with cities, the way we're building out those cities and really, the level of technology and innovation that we can use to differentiate the offering and are pleased with the ongoing efforts there. And then in terms of the change in ad format. As we've talked about on a lot of calls, innovation is core to all we do. It obviously happens on its own time line. We have a culture of it. We're continuously focused on it. I'm not going to break out kind of impact for any change. We're constantly looking to innovate and improve the user experience. And so there was a step up, which we've talked about. And we continue to look at other ways, as Sundar talked about, to continue to enhance the user experience. But I think the most important point and somewhat implicit in your question, that shouldn't take away from the very strong underlying revenue and revenue growth that we have in that business.",312

We are seeing traction across categories. It's just that games are at a much larger scale. But for example, when we get into education, we see if you view that as a vertical, we do see traction there and so on.

And mobile is growing at a faster rate and what you're seeing here is a mix shift. So there's a delta between the 2. But I think importantly, we're benefiting from an important secular trend behind mobile. And like the revenue dollars and the gross profit dollars that come as a result of that, and we'll continue to innovate on mobile and are excited about the opportunity, in particular, with all the changes that we continue to see in the way users use the phone and the opportunities.",111

And related to that, one of the strengths of the company is obviously, the strong engineering orientation and the ability to hire some of the best talent and acquire the best technology, and the company's been able to adapt very quickly to change. But I wonder which areas of your business demonstrate where Google or Alphabet are really on the forefront of development, pushing innovation rather than adapting to changes you see in the market?",116

On the first thing, obviously, we are doing many things. But I tend to spend my time on at the core of our core product. I think we have a unique opportunity to evolve search to be very assistive in how we serve our users and be an intelligent assistant that helps users throughout their needs in context, especially in the context of mobile. That's an area definitely I spend a lot of time on. And related to that, we do think we can do a lot of that by, based on our core advancements in machine learning and AI. So that's an area we invest a lot, and I'm thoughtfully involved with that as well. And third, definitely, from a computing standpoint, computing is foundational to everything we do. And so thinking through about how computing evolves, be it emerging technologies, like VR, or how mobile advances over the next few years. So these are all areas where I do spend time on. And overall, I do think, in the long run, I think we will evolve in computing from a mobile first to an AI first world. And I do think we are at the forefront of the development, so we don't view it as adapting to it as much as pushing hard and getting there. And so that's the core of what we do and we'll continue to do that.",235

Our revenue of $21.5 billion in the second quarter underscores the great performance of our businesses globally. For the quarter, our consolidated revenue grew 25% in constant currency versus last year. 
Once again, the primary driver was the increased use of mobile search by consumers benefiting from our ongoing efforts to enhance the mobile search experience. We also benefited from solid growth in desktop and tablet search, as well as continued strength in YouTube and programmatic advertising. 
I'm going to present to you in the following order: first, review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet; second, review the results for each of Google and Other Bets; finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then review our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take your questions.
Beginning with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance. Total revenue was $21.5 billion, up 21% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially. We realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $113 million or $35 million after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 25% year-over-year and increased 5% sequentially. 
Once again, Alphabet revenues by geography highlight both the strength of our business around the globe as well as the impact the currency headwinds continue to have on our non-US business relative to last year.
U.S. revenue was up 25% year-over-year to $10 billion. U.K. revenue was up 14% year-over-year to $1.9 billion. In fixed FX terms, the U.K. grew 20% year-over-year. These results do not reflect the movement in the British pound subsequent to the results of the referendum on June 23. Rest of World revenue was up 19% versus last year to $9.6 billion. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 26% year-over-year.
GAAP, other cost of revenues were $4.2 billion. Non-GAAP, other cost of revenues was $3.9 billion, up 28% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, specifically: costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation; content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube; and hardware costs. 
GAAP operating expenses were $7.4 billion in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $6.2 billion or 29% of revenue, up 15% year-over-year and up 2% versus Q1. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by R&D expense, mainly due to compensation expense related to headcount growth. 
On a GAAP basis, operating income was $6 billion, up 24% versus last year. The operating margin was 28%. Non-GAAP operating income was $7.5 billion, up 25% versus last year. The operating margin was 35%. Stock-based compensation totaled $1.5 billion, up 33% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially, primarily reflecting increased headcount and the impact of our senior executive equity refresh that occurs every 2 years. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 66,575, up 2,460 from last quarter. The vast majority of new hires continue to be engineers and product managers to support growth in priority areas, such as cloud and apps.
On a numbers basis, we are adding more headcount in Google, while on a percentage basis, we are growing faster in Other Bets. Other income and expense was $151 million. As discussed on prior calls, OI&E consists of a number of line items impacted by market factors, which makes it inherently unpredictable. We provide more detail on these line items in our earnings press release.
Our effective tax rate was 20%. Net income was $4.9 billion on a GAAP basis and $5.9 billion on a non-GAAP basis. Earnings per diluted share were $7 on a GAAP basis and $8.42 on a non-GAAP basis. Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow.
CapEx for the quarter was $2.1 billion, the substantial majority of which supported the Google segment. Operating cash flow was $9.1 billion with free cash flow of $7 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $78.5 billion, of which approximately $48 billion or 61% is held overseas. This performance reflects our strong operating cash flow, offset by the impact of our share repurchases during the quarter of approximately $1.6 billion, completing the authorization under our share repurchase program.
Let's me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenue was $21.3 billion, up 21% year-over-year, which includes the impact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenue was $15.4 billion in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially. Year-on-year growth reflects substantial strength in mobile search due to the ongoing benefit from the improvement in ad formats and delivery that we launched in the third quarter of last year. 
We continue to have solid growth from desktop and tablet search. YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView and increasingly, Google Preferred, with a growing contribution from buying on DoubleClick Bid Manager. Network revenue was $3.7 billion, up 3% year-on-year and up 1% sequentially, continuing to reflect the strong growth of programmatic, offset by the traditional network businesses.
Other revenue for Google was $2.2 billion, up 33% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was driven by cloud and apps, as well as Play, followed by hardware. Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release. Let me remind you that these metrics are, of course, affected by currency movements.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $4 billion or 21% of total advertising revenue, up 18% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. Total TAC, as a percentage of total advertising revenues, was down slightly as a result of the mix shift between sites revenue, which carries lower TAC and network revenue. The increase in both sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenue, as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenue, reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. 
Operating income, excluding SBC, was $8.3 billion, up 26% versus last year for an operating margin of 39%. Google stock-based compensation totaled $1.3 billion for the quarter, up 33% year-over-year. Operating income reflecting the impact of SBC was $7 billion, up 25% versus last year, and the operating margin was 33%. CapEx for the quarter was $2.1 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities and data center construction.
Turning to Other Bets financials. Let me again emphasize that the majority of these efforts are pre-revenue. We continue to invest across these opportunities and are doing so in a disciplined way. Meaning it remains most instructive to look at them over a longer time horizon because, as you have seen, quarterly revenues and expenses can be lumpy for 3 primary reasons: First, they are early-stage; second, they represent an aggregation of businesses operating in different industries; and third, they may be impacted by one-time items like partnership deals. 
For the second quarter, Other Bets revenue was $185 million. Reported revenue for Other Bets was primarily generated by Nest, Fiber and Verily. Operating loss, excluding SBC, was $709 million in the second quarter. Including the impact of SBC, operating loss was $859 million. Other Bets CapEx was $280 million in Q2, primarily reflecting ongoing investment in our fiber business. 
I'd like to close with a few observations on our key themes. First, regarding revenue. Our Alphabet structure announced nearly a year ago gives us a framework for developing new sources of revenue growth within both Google and in Other Bets in a disciplined way. You've seen over the past few quarters how our focus on innovation can drive strong revenue growth. We are continually working to enhance the search experience and making changes to our ads formats and tools guided by substantial user testing. We have repeatedly highlighted the 3Q '15 change in format, given the meaningful step up it drove in our revenue growth rate. That benefit is evident again in the second quarter. As we have always said, we have been and remain committed to long-term revenue growth through innovation, but the timing and scale of the impact of innovation is inherently difficult to predict.
Second, as to expenses. I've commented many times that our focus on long-term revenue growth does not give us a pass on managing expenses. We invest a lot of time and effort in assessing how to manage for revenue growth with the utmost respect for the resources deployed and a focus on getting the best return on those resources, recognizing that in some areas, secular trends are creating margin headwinds. 
As I mentioned last quarter, there are a number of factors driving higher TAC in both our sites and network businesses. For sites TAC, there are a number of factors that contribute to fluctuations. In particular, changes in the relative use of mobile, desktop and tablet devices. For each of these devices, sites TAC also reflects an interrelated set of factors, including the mix of paid versus organic distribution points, partners and agreement terms. 
Over the past year, the shift to mobile has been the primary driver of the increase in sites TAC because more mobile searches are subject to TAC. When looking at sites TAC as a percentage of revenue, it's important also to remember that while YouTube advertising revenue is reflected in our sites line, the associated contact -- content acquisition costs are included in other cost of revenues, not TAC. In addition, sites revenue includes hedging gains with no associated effect on TAC.
The growth in network TAC is due to the ongoing adoption of programmatic platforms by advertisers, which are subject to a higher TAC rate. In operating expenses, people are our biggest area of investment. We continue to attract, develop and retain the best people to drive our businesses forward. As you would expect, headcount additions, primarily align with our priority areas, such as cloud and apps and machine learning. Two important points regarding the third quarter: First, you will see the impact in the third quarter of our annual equity refresh for our employees. As you have seen in prior years, the annual refresh results in a sequential step-up in SBC; second, headcount growth tends to be seasonally high in Q3 because that is when we bring on new graduates. In addition, please keep in mind that our marketing costs are typically weighted more heavily toward the back half of the year due to the holiday season; third, regarding CapEx. At Google, the team has been able to drive meaningful efficiencies in planning and operations for our technical infrastructure, which has enabled us to support growing demand at a stable investment level. These efficiencies include improvements in power and server utilization, the use of machine learning and deployment of innovations, like our tensor processing unit. 
With regard to CapEx investments for Other Bets, our fiber investment continues to be the driver; fourth, about our balance sheet. We remain focused on optimizing our capital structure, recognizing the strategic value of our balance sheet. We completed Alphabet's $1.7 billion debt exchange in the second quarter, which gives us flexibility, including the ability to use debt financing, if appropriate. In light of the interest rate environment, we may opportunistically access the market to term out our commercial paper. 
In conclusion, in the second quarter, we delivered very strong revenue growth and improved operating efficiency. These results reflect the tremendous talent and hard work of our teams around the globe. I will now turn the call over to Sundar.",1922
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3516.0,1216447.0,49745700.0,Presenter Speech,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Ruth. As you heard, we had a very strong second quarter. There's an amazing energy right now at Google. The strength of the quarter is about mobile. It's transformed the way that people consume information, and Google's products have become a central and much loved part of their experience. 
Our investment in mobile now underlines everything that we do today, from search and YouTube to Android and advertising. Mobile is the engine that drives our present. And now, through our deep investments in machine learning and AI, we are building the engine that will drive our future. 
Since the last earnings call, we had Google I/O, our biggest event of the year, and I also wrote our annual founders letter. Both of these allowed me to reflect on our past and look to our future. We are at a pivotal and transformational moment. Thanks to advancements in machine learning, we have the unique opportunity to take a big step forward for the next 10 years. 
In the letter, I wrote about how we think of our investments and our mission. Today, I'll walk through the 6 sections of the founder's letter and discuss our progress in each area, and then I will call out 3 key highlights from the quarter that are driving our advertising business, today and into the future.
The first thing I highlighted in the founder's letter was information. At Google's core, we remain focused on making information and knowledge available for everyone. This, of course, starts with search, where we now have trillions of searches every year. We continue to invest in making search smarter and more useful. In the U.S., we recently introduced a voter tool, so when you search for register to vote, you'll get a detailed, state-by-state guide with information on how to register, requirements and deadlines.
Our new keyboard for iOS called GBoard is off to a great start. People love the ability to easily search right from the keyboard, swipe to type and quickly send emojis. And after just 1 year, Google Photos is now helping over 200 million people every month organize and search their photos and memories. 
At I/O, I was excited to share our vision around the Google Assistant. We want to help people get things done in a conversational way across devices and contexts. This is possible, thanks to advances in machine learning, voice and image recognition, and natural language processing, which we have invested in for years. You'll be able to experience the Google Assistant in products like our new messaging app, Allo, and our voice activated device, Google Home, and we can't wait to show you what else we are working on in this area.
Second, machine learning. As I said, machine learning is the engine that will drive our future, and it's already making our products better and helping users every day. In fact, more than 100 teams are currently using machine learning at Google, from Street View to Gmail, to Voice Search and more. 
For example, in search, we use a ranking signal called RankBrain, which relies on deep learning to improve results. It's already enhancing the search experience in 40 languages. And based on user testing, RankBrain can accurately guess which results users will favor with about 80% accuracy. 
Advances like this help us make our search results even more relevant. Machine learning is also creating an impact in other ways. Just last week, we announced a test that applied DeepMind's machine learning to our own Google data centers, resulting in up to a 40% reduction in the energy we use for cooling. This will greatly improve efficiency. And when we publish our research, we hope it will enable others to reduce emissions, too. 
Third, content. A big part of making information available is making great content accessible, such as on Google Play, YouTube and the web. Our efforts to make the mobile better for everyone with Accelerated Mobile Pages or AMP, has seen phenomenal global momentum. We now have over 150 million AMP pages in our index, and with over 4 million new ones published every week from nearly 200 countries. 
Last week, we announced AMP for ads, which helps advertisers build fast, simple and beautiful ads and landing pages. This will help make the mobile web experience much faster for everyone, and help fund it more sustainably. 
Video is a huge component of digital content, and YouTube continues to shine. It's a thriving home for creators, with more than 1,000 creators crossing the 1,000 subscribers mark every single day. Our content ID system has now paid out over $2 billion to partners who use the system. 
A big part of video, of course, is live, which we have invested in since 2011. YouTube is the first major platform that supports live content in 360 degrees, and we recently announced the ability for creators to go live from their phones with the touch of a button. Earlier in the quarter, we teamed up with BT to live stream the Champions League and Europa League finals on YouTube in the U.K. This special event was U.K.'s biggest ever livestream. All these innovations are a big reason why partner revenue has averaged 50% growth over the last 3 years.
Fourth, platforms. A key focus is building great computing platforms like Chrome, Android and our new virtual reality platform, Daydream, so that people can have wonderful experiences regardless of the device or screen they are using. Platforms are what make new computing experiences possible, and also part of breakout hits like Pokemon Go, which I suspect a few of you are playing right now. 
Android is thriving. In the last year alone, we have delivered over 65 billion app installs and are helping developers reach an audience of over 1 billion users every single month. Our partners have also seen incredible success with flagship devices like the Samsung Galaxy S7. It's a hit with consumers and a shining example of how to build a great experience on Android. Our latest version of Android, called Nougat, focuses on performance, productivity and security. And it also has a VR mode built in to help developers create immersive smartphone VR experiences.
Speaking of VR, we are already working with leading Android partners to build out the Daydream ecosystem. So stay tuned for more Daydream-ready phones, controllers and headsets coming this fall.
Fifth, cloud. Many tremendous digital experiences are being built in the cloud today and businesses are working to take advantage of the cloud as part of their digital transformation. They've been integrating our cloud and apps products to create more unified solutions for companies large and small, and these efforts are paying off. We have strong momentum with businesses like Symphony, a secure communication and workflow platform, who recently announced that its cloud computing business is available on the Google cloud platform. 
We provide the high reliability and performance needed by Symphony's customers in the financial services industry. Our data and analytics product BigQuery helps mobile gaming company, Kabam, store and understand player actions within their games, from monetization and fraud to production bugs and level completion statistics. 
As I've said, machine learning has been a major focus and a key differentiator for Google, and that's true for our Google cloud customers as well. This quarter, we introduced Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, which can deliver an order of magnitude better optimized performance per watt for machine learning projects. Google DeepMind's AlphaGo was powered by TPUs, enabling it to process faster and look farther ahead between moves. We are now passing this benefit onto our enterprise customers to supercharge their machine learning applications.
Just last week, we introduced 2 cloud machine learning APIs for speech and natural language to help our enterprise customers convert audio to text and easily understand the structure and sentiment of that text in a variety of languages. We also introduced a new undersea cable system, the highest capacity system ever built, which brings added capacity and performance to support our enterprise customers around the globe. This system has 60 terabytes per second of total capacity, more than any active undersea cable and is 10 million times faster than your cable modem. This is especially exciting as we prepare to launch a new Google Cloud Platform East Asia region in Tokyo later this year. 
In addition to building the best products and infrastructure, we are also hard at work building the best team to serve every aspect of our customer's businesses. We now have key leadership in place and centralized teams supporting customer facing activities, including: sales, marketing, global alliances, industry solutions and professional services. We are building out our support at full scale as more and more Fortune 100 companies choose our cloud.
Sixth, building for everyone. Since the Internet is one of the world's most powerful equalizers, we are committed to building technology and making information available for everyone, wherever they are. This has always been core to Google's DNA. As we have shared before, we are working with Indian railways and RailTel to bring high-speed wireless access to the entire Internet to millions of people who travel throughout India's top railway stations. There are already 2 million people logging in every month, and they are using as much as 15x the data they would otherwise use in a full day on their cellular networks. 
We are also working hard to ensure that our products work well for everyone, regardless of where they live. We have been expanding better carrier billing in Google Play, with more than 100 partners in 40 countries. To give you a sense of the impact, in Indonesia alone, we have seen growth in monthly buyers quadruple in the last 18 months.
Switching gears from these 6 areas, it's our business success that enables us and our partners to grow and invest further. We are extraordinarily well positioned to take advantage of the mobile shift, and we are already seeing strong growth in 3 key areas of our advertising business: mobile search, video and programmatic. All of the momentum you are seeing is because our products are doing well in mobile and our customers are getting great results from them. 
We offer advertisers and agencies the best ways to reach customers at the right moment of intent, the best reach in inventory, the best mobile formats and the leading measurement solutions. And of course, we do all of this while making sure we are creating a great ads experience for users that's helpful and unobtrusive. We know that people are constantly searching for things with commercial intent, and are used to swiping and tapping. Our data shows that people respond really well to the ads we show. They are fresh, fast and useful.
So let me turn to 3 key moments from the quarter for our advertising business: number 1, our Google Performance Summit for direct response marketers. We announced new expanded text ads and bid adjustments by device type, which are rolling out this week as well as new local search ads in Google Maps. Thanks to the rise of mobile phones, the line between online and off-line experiences continues to blur. This creates even greater opportunity for businesses to use Google Maps to help bring customers into their physical store locations. 
Thanks to a strong intent signals, particularly on mobile, Google continues to offer great opportunities for direct response marketers to reach potential customers, whether they are visiting your website, calling your business, walking into your store or downloading your app. For instance, Walgreens partnered closely with Google to promote their app across search, Google Play and our Display networks. In one month, they increased the number of app downloads 87% from the previous month. Number 2, our annual Brandcast event for brand advertisers was a huge success. We announced breakout videos. The ability to advertise against fast rising videos on YouTube, as well as a deal with the NBA to bring their inventory to Google Preferred.
At this point, the volume of Google Preferred bought this year is already more than double what it was at the same time last year. Fastfood chain Wendy's used Google Preferred to extend the reach of their TV ads, and thanks to our Brand Lift measurement solution, they were able to see that one of their campaigns drew an incredible 65% lift in ad recall and 146% lift in Google searches for the Wendy's brand. 
We are hearing a lot of the same feedback from many top brands who continue to invest more and more of their budgets on YouTube. Number 3, our DoubleClick Leadership Summit held just last week for ad technology partners. We launched the ability to buy native ads programmatically across all streams in DoubleClick Bid Manager. Since we are providing fully designed creatives for each publisher, advertisers can simply upload the components of the ad, like headline, image and text, and DoubleClick automatically assembles them to fit the context and format of the site or app where they appear.
Making native advertising simple at this scale will help to make ads faster, better and less intrusive, while driving great curtains for publishers. 
So there's my top 3 moments from our advertising business this quarter. As you can see, it's been extremely busy. More generally, from advertising to cloud, to digital content, to hardware and to so much more, we have tremendous long-term growth opportunities at Google. 
Today's great innovations are being driven by investments in mobile. Tomorrow's will be driven from our investments in machine learning and new computing platforms. But one thing is constant, we'll continue to focus on building the best experiences for billions of people around the world. 
I want to thank all the Googlers around the world who help us create these opportunities every day and help them bring to life for our users and partners. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Ruth.",2327

29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3516.0,1216447.0,49745703.0,Question,Carlos Kirjner,,Analysts,6,"I have 2 questions. First is about search revenues. I mean, search is probably a $50 billion business, and from today's results, it's clearly still growing strongly. Of course, if the business gets large, it becomes harder and harder to sustain growth. As you look at this increasing growth challenge and your product innovations in search, including the recent changes and also those that you're having a roadmap for the next few years, how do you think about your ability to sustain such revenues growth and the trajectory over which they will ultimately decelerate? The second question is on Google Fiber. I think Ruth has been quite clear that we should expect an increase in Other Bets CapEx and the fiber is the main driver, suggesting more investment. Yet, when we see the rate at which you have deployed in markets like Austin and some of the newer markets, they are quite slow. You also have started to talk about wireless technologies, suggesting that you haven't fully figured this out yet, which in turn suggests that it's going to be a slow deployment. So the question is, which one is it? Is it faster, more aggressive deployment, given the CapEx commentary? Or is it going to be continuous, slow multiyear deployment, as your track record and the talk of new technology suggests?",222
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3516.0,1216447.0,49745704.0,Answer,Ruth Porat,,Executives,7,"Well, thank you, Carlos. A lot in those questions. So starting with sites revenue, and where we see the opportunities there. Obviously, sites revenue up 24% year-on-year includes the currency impact. And as Sundar and I both commented on the biggest driver again this quarter, was mobile search. We do continue to have solid growth in desktop, tablet, and we have strength in YouTube, particularly video advertising, both in our TrueView products and increasingly from Google Preferred. As we've talked about every quarter since the third quarter of last year, we have benefited from the change to ad formats on mobile that we made in the third quarter of last year, and that is evident yet again this quarter. Then as per your question, when we go back -- going back to that third quarter of '15, when we made the change in ad formats on mobile, our growth rate meaningfully accelerated. And as we've noted in each subsequent quarter, that change has been the primary driver of the higher year-on-year revenue growth rate. But importantly, as you've seen over the last several quarters, we're benefiting not just from a higher growth rate, but also from the durability of the impact of the change. So that's really underscoring the efficacy of these ads for users. As per Sundar's comments, and it's reflected in revenues running at a higher level. And you can see where the revenue growth rate was prior to the third quarter, introductionally [ph], I'll let you do your own forecasting. But when comparing growth rates, we're, obviously, at a higher revenue base versus last year. And then Sundar talked about some of the recent events that we've had. Innovation is core to everything we're doing. We've launched several changes to ad formats and tools just a few days ago, as the team discussed at the Google performance summit. We believe the changes should result in a better, more useful experience for users and better performance for advertisers. And so, that just continues to be core to the way we're looking at the business with a lot of incremental opportunity. And then, on your fiber and the CapEx question. Look, we continue to see fiber as a huge market opportunity. We're focused on creating abundant connectivity on networks that are always fast and always open, as we've talked about. And we're continuing to work closely with cities, given their excitement. We're also continuing to push the frontier with tech innovation, as you noted in your question, and different execution paths. So as you said in the question, we're exploring both fiber and wireless. And you may have seen our recent acquisition of Webpass. So we want to make sure we're executing against a very large and attractive market in the most effective and efficient manner. We did start adding customers in Charlotte in July. And so we, again, we view it as a big opportunity, we're being thoughtful and deliberate in our execution path.",496

It's 2 areas where we see a lot of innovation from the company right now, both on the product side that consumers are seeing, as well as on the advertising side. How should we think about the roadmap ahead for both increased user engagement with your product in those key verticals, as well as the ability for advertiser conversion to lead to more advertising budgets for the company over the medium to long term? And then, maybe one second question would be -- with the buyback authorization having been completed this quarter, Ruth, would love to get your thoughts on how you're thinking about the balance sheet as an asset and how shareholders should sort of think about the ability for shareholder returns over the medium and long-term.",153

So why don't I start on your second question and I'll pass it to Sundar on the first question. So as you know, we announced the share repurchase program relatively recently, it was just in the third quarter of last year. And we just completed it, as per my opening comments. As we discussed back in the third quarter, we do always review our balance sheet and capital requirements and opportunities with our Board. And I'm not going to speculate about a potential for a future Board decision. So really, nothing more to add at this point. And then, Sundar?",101

And you highlighted a couple of important verticals. To give an example, on travel. Many users start their travel inquiry on Google, and so we focus on doing a better job of getting them deeper information, new destinations and compare costs through new features in hotel search, Google Flights, and the recently launched destinations on Google. In all of this, we work closely with many different partners, including online travel agencies. And so, we focus on product enhancements in partnership with them. And the better job we do at answering user queries, the more qualified leads we can provide to our partners. And we think it's a win-win arrangement. And so, and the same concept applies of these other verticals as well. So we approach it very holistically.",140

But I was wondering if you could share with us some of the changes, if you could highlight some of them that Diane has made since she's come on board. And I'm wondering how some of those changes might be starting to impact conversations with potential customers that you're having. And in particular, just trying to get a sense of are you seeing Google now with GCP getting invited to more RFPs and starting to see your win rates go up as a result of some of her initiatives.",114

I think Diane has initiated a set of changes. And essentially, she has integrated our go-to-market strategy with her engineering and product efforts. She has integrated our engineering efforts around the cloud. So for example, Google Apps, Drive, Docs, Gmail, slide sheets, Hangouts, et cetera. It's on top of the cloud stack. Our enterprise customers and partners, for them, now they have one enterprise space. And internally, from frictionless contracts to touch points across Google, to one person to work with them on our considerable enterprise technologies and products. So the big unifying one being cloud. We now have new leadership in place across sales, professional Services, marketing and partnering, plus new customer facing support in the form of Professional Services. We have an office of the CTO and customer reliability. So it's a big, big set of changes and it's obviously having an impact. Many of our customers are also partners. And so it's increasingly clear how much we can do together. So for me, I see a shift to a world-class enterprise approach and it's definitely having an impact in the type of conversations we are having and the outcome of the RFPs we are engaged in.",202

So you spent a lot of time talking about how this is positively impacting Google as a whole, and how you're building for the future, both tonight and at I/O a few months ago. And you guys have mentioned things like reducing the error rates in search and improving relevancy. But are there tangible examples of either engagement or volume also increasing as you roll out machine learning in search and in YouTube that you could share? And then I think Google recently introduced smart bidding in AdWords using machine learning. So do you see something like this as a potential revenue driver? Any color there would be great.",118
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3516.0,1216447.0,49745714.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,17,"Yes. So we definitely -- a core part of improving the user experience for the next many years will be driven by machine learning. To give a specific example, you asked about YouTube. YouTube watch time is something we focus on. We use machine learning increasingly to give recommendations to users. So when they are watching a video in terms of what they could watch next, and that recommendation system is getting increasingly using machine learning. And that directly drives engagement. So there are several such examples I can give across the company. You mentioned AdWords, too. If you look at AdWords and the thoughtful changes we do, over time, we are dealing with a big combinatorial space in terms of the kinds of changes and interactions that can happen. So deploying machine learning there over time, over many years, I think is a more powerful and deeper way to explore the various possibilities that exist, and I think will lead to long-term impacts, and so, I'm very optimistic on it.",171

First, Sundar, you talked about expanded text ads. And my question is just, as the number of characters here increases, some would say, up to 50% through expanded text ads, you're taking up more space on the page. How do you balance the higher percentage of clicks from these paid ads with the natural search experience? And then, secondly, on YouTube. Do you think you're taking share of TV dollars, currently? And if not, what's needed to do that going forward?",86
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3516.0,1216447.0,49745717.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,20,"On the first one, we obviously, over many, many years, we always put users first. And as we present our search results, we have long-term metrics for user happiness around which we make -- that's the framework for all the changes we make. Obviously, with the shift to mobile, the user experience, users are evolving in terms of how they use our product. And with that as a guidance, we have made changes. We make many, many changes, and I would look at it holistically. And even some of the changes you are talking about affect certain highly commercial queries, where users are actually looking for that commercial information. So the metrics is what drives how we change these things and we are very, very thoughtful about it. But we always step back and make sure the overall load, et cetera, is really working for users. So -- and I'm pretty comfortable with how we are approaching it. On YouTube, I think about it as we are seeing strong growth. I mentioned the momentum behind Google Preferred, and how we are double the rate we were last year. So to me that implies strong growth. It's tough for us to assess whether it's from TV or just advertisers investing more, because there's traction in YouTube. But we just see strong momentum. And as far as we -- today, just look at how users are using mobile, videos, the killer app -- the killer format on mobile. And I think that's what gives us the secular trend, moving forward.",258

It has to do with mobile search, and I want to throw an idea by you which is, we've been going through this mobile transition for 4 or 5 years. Consumers have, I think, dramatically led businesses and advertisers to mobile devices. I'm wondering if what you're now seeing is finally, as e-commerce and travel and another commerce activities have really become critical material on mobile devices, you're finally starting to see ad budgets really shift over, and you're starting to get auction dynamics start to pick up in mobile search. So if you just comment on whether you're finally seeing this kind of back swing for advertisers to engage with mobile search in a way that you really hadn't seen before, it just took that many years for this to happen.",139

I would say, at a higher level, you mean this is a scale business. And you are right, as we have had this shift to mobile that our second-order effects which kick in, too. Which is why, when you look at our ad improvements and our revenue improvements, I would focus more holistically. We do deeper changes across the board, not just visible changes on the page. And all of that contributes to it. So I do definitely think as the shift to mobile accelerates, we are getting some scale benefits, and that's part of it.",104

And in particular, I'd be interested to hear about the option to opt-in to greater personalization of ads from across usership on Google sites, as I believe that's the first time you've allowed, on an opt-in basis, certainly, to have search data be used to target ads elsewhere. And then maybe as a follow-up to that, what you're seeing in terms of early traction of users turning that on, and where your expectations for that may be?",116

And so we wanted to give users a single place to see and control ad settings. And that will be honored as the user moves across devices. It's completely opt-in. Users are absolutely in control. And consumers and advertisers have come to expect ads to work better across devices and this new option could help us better deliver on that. So for people who choose to opt in over time, we could make sure they see more relevant ads and fewer annoying ones. So effectively put them in better control of the experience they get. And I think -- and so, I think that helps the whole ecosystem work better. We are in very, very early days, and -- but we're being thoughtful about how we do this for users.",142

First off, we understand that Google Shopping, in particular, continues to see strong growth. And I was hoping you could add some color on the relative mix or growth rate to PLA contrasting with other ad types, along with the adoption of the transactional capabilities. And then, Sundar, I wanted to follow up on some of the conversational and voice applications and devices that you have in the pipeline. And more generally, how you envision voice really fitting in across of the board, across the Google platform. Will this be sort of a centerpiece as you also utilize machine learning and artificial intelligence. I'd like to hear more about your vision for that.",118
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3516.0,1216447.0,49745726.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,29,"Let me, quickly on the first one, we don't comment on the relative mix, etc. so I'll probably give more color on your second question. Voice is obviously very, very exciting for us. I mentioned this at I/O. If you look at an Android -- the Google app on Android in the U.S., 20% of the queries are voice queries. So today, in terms of evolving to a conversational assistant, we have a big head start. People do this. We get millions of queries every single day. And it's incredibly exciting to see how people interact with voice differently from text. It's more intuitive. It's more personal. And it's a bit more emotional and engaging experience for users. And so, I think to do this well requires deep computer science, just understanding what they are saying, the natural language processing involved. These are areas in which we have now been working for over 15 years. And we believe we are the best-in-class. And so bringing all of that together, I think, is what will help us do this at scale, globally. But it's still very early days in terms of getting the conversational assistant right. You will see us launch this throughout products as we go through the second half of this year. And I'm excited to see how users respond to it.",223

And then, Ruth, in terms of the drivers of YouTube growth, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that one of the drivers was buying on DoubleClick Bid Manager.

We approach these areas if we believe we have insights by which we can create something very differentiated for users, that we are actually approaching it in a new and unique way. The core underlying insight we have is, in the context of mobile and using state-of-the-art machine learning can we re-think some of these areas for our users. So that's the underlying framework with which they have approached this space. I've been really enjoying using these products, and we'll get it out to users soon. For example, I think if you take something like Duo today, I think, especially on Android, high quality messaging is an experience that's still lacking for users.

We realize a lot of computing innovations happen at the intersection of hardware and software. And as we are building ecosystems and broad platforms, we need a way to drive them forward. And so that's the context, in which we do. There are areas where we have done very seriously, like Chromecast is a great example. We now have over 30 million Chromecast devices sold. And that's an example of where we invest deeply. And especially as newer areas emerge, like Google Home, we want [ph] our ability to put best experience possible in front of our users and guide the ecosystem. So that's how we think about it.

And so just a brief update there. We're now testing in 4 cities, Mountain View, Austin, most recently, we expanded to Kirkland, Washington and to Phoenix. We've self-driven over 1.6 million miles. And the focus here for us is, we're solving a really big need, safety access and city efficiency. The thing that's really motivating is -- for us, is when you look at over 30,000 car deaths in the U.S. alone, that's what really inspired the founders to start working on this issue. And our approach is quite different for most others. We're focused on fully autonomous cars, because in early testing, we saw the risk of depending on drivers to remain engaged once you give them the option to switch off. So we've invested a lot there. We're testing extensively, based on this approach. And more specifically to your question, we are pleased to be working with FCA to advance the development of the self-driving cars. With them, we're more than doubling the number of cars that we have. But we do have huge respect for the expertise required. So we do expect we'll work with many partners in this area.",205

First on YouTube. Just thinking about premium content. A lot of activity with streaming deals out there. Obviously, YouTube would be a natural place for streaming content, but even professionally developed content. Do think you're letting an opportunity get by? How do you think about that? And then, Ruth, I know you have a lot of experience dealing with regulatory agencies in your last CFO role. There's been some new filings. Can you talk at all about how Google's thinking about that right now?",88

Look, we continue to work constructively with regulators. We don't have an update on timing on any of the specific issues. But the main points, in our view, are that regulators have found that our businesses do help consumers and the key mantra here is, if we do the right thing for the user, all else will follow. With respect to consumers, we continue to invest in innovative opportunities that create great experiences, improve their lives. And we're empowering small businesses globally by providing greater reach to customers, not just in their towns, but across countries and around the world. And in our discussions, one of the very important points is we operate in a very vibrant, competitive environment. And we're also proud of the fact that we're investing meaningfully in the ecosystem. For example, Android has helped foster a remarkable and sustainable ecosystem of manufactures and app developers and entrepreneurs based on open-source software and open innovation, and that's really the kind of the thrust of it and the emphasis is, we're continuing to work constructively with regulators, no additional update.",190

Our revenue of $22.5 billion in the third quarter underscores the terrific performance of our businesses globally. For the quarter, our consolidated revenue grew 23% in constant currency versus last year, notwithstanding a challenging year-on-year comparison. Once again, the primary driver was mobile search with ongoing strength in YouTube and important contributions from programmatic advertising and Play.
I am going to present to you in the following order: first, review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet; second, review the results for each of Google and Other Bets; Finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then review our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take your questions.
Beginning with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance. Total revenue was $22.5 billion, up 20% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. We realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $196 million or $91 million after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 23% year-over-year and increased 5% sequentially.
Alphabet revenues by geography highlight the strength of our business around the globe. U.S. revenue was up 22% year-over-year to $10.6 billion. U.K. revenue was up 5% year-over-year to $1.9 billion, reflecting the meaningful impact of the decline in the British pound relative to last year. In fixed FX terms, the U.K. grew 18% year-over-year. Rest of world revenue was up 22% versus last year to $9.9 billion. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 25% year-over-year.
GAAP other cost of revenues was $4.5 billion, up 30% year-over-year. Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $4.2 billion, up 29% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, specifically: costs associated with our -- operating our data centers, including depreciation; and content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube.
GAAP operating expenses were $8 billion in the quarter, up 15% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $6.5 billion, up 13% year-over-year. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $5.8 billion, up 22% versus last year. The operating margin was 26%. Non-GAAP operating income was $7.6 billion, up 24% versus last year. The operating margin was 34%.
Stock-based compensation totaled $1.9 billion, up 30% year-over-year and up 24% sequentially, primarily reflecting the step-up from our annual equity refresh for employees at the start of Q3. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 69,953, up 3,378 people from last quarter. Headcount growth is typically seasonally highest in the third quarter as new graduates join. Consistent with prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers to support growth in priority areas such as cloud.
Other income and expense was $278 million. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.
Our effective tax rate was 16%. Net income was $5.1 billion on a GAAP basis and $6.3 billion on a non-GAAP basis. Earnings per diluted share were $7.25 on a GAAP basis and $9.6 on a non-GAAP basis.
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. CapEx for the quarter was $2.6 billion, the substantial majority of which supported the Google segment. Operating cash flow was $9.8 billion with free cash flow of $7.3 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $83.1 billion, of which approximately $50 billion or 60% is held overseas.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenue was $22.3 billion, up 20% year-over-year, which includes the impact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google site's revenue was $16.1 billion in the quarter, up 23% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Year-on-year growth reflects strength in mobile search. We continue to have decent growth from desktop and tablet search. YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView with a growing contribution from buying on DoubleClick Bid Manager.
Network revenue was $3.7 billion, up 1% year-on-year and flat sequentially, reflecting the ongoing strong growth of programmatic and AdMob offset by the traditional network businesses. Other revenue for Google was $2.4 billion, up 39% year-over-year and up 12% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was driven by Play and Cloud.
Finally, we provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release. Let me remind you that these metrics are affected by currency movements.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $4.2 billion or 21% of total advertising revenue, up 17% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. The increase in both sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenue as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenue reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was up slightly sequentially as a result of higher TAC for mobile search, offsetting the benefits of a revenue mix shift from network to sites.
Operating income, excluding SBC, was $8.4 billion, up 19% versus last year for an operating margin of 38%. Google stock-based compensation totaled $1.6 billion for the quarter, up 28% year-over-year. Operating income reflecting the impact of SBC was $6.8 billion, up 17% versus last year, and the operating margin was 30%. CapEx for the quarter was $2.4 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities and data center construction.
Turning to Other Bets. As we've said previously, we think it remains most instructive to look at financials for Other Bets over a longer time horizon because, as you have seen, quarterly revenues and expenses can be lumpy for 3 primary reasons: First, the Other Bets are early stage; Second, they represent an aggregation of businesses operating in different industries; and finally, they may be impacted by onetime items like partnership deals.
For the third quarter, Other Bets revenue was $197 million primarily generated by Nest, Fiber and Verily. Operating loss, excluding SBC, was $665 million in the third quarter. Including the impact of SBC, operating loss was $865 million. Other Bets CapEx was $324 million in Q3, primarily reflecting ongoing investment in our Fiber business.
I'd like to close with a few observations on our progress since the creation of Alphabet just over a year ago as well as a review of our key themes. As we've frequently noted, our move to Alphabet was motivated by our belief that revolutionary ideas drive the next big growth areas. Long-term success requires a commitment to making bets, putting the right talent and resources behind those bets and remaining flexible and dynamic as we pursue them. We believe our structure provides the transparency and oversight needed to make smart choices about our investment opportunities, both within Google and across Other Bets.
As we reach for moonshots that will have a big impact in the longer term, it's inevitable that there will be course corrections along the way and that some efforts will be more successful than others. Over the past year, for example, you've seen us make progress and accelerate our efforts in some areas while repositioning or taking a pause in others. We are taking the steps necessary to lay the foundation for a stronger future.
Looking ahead, first, regarding revenue. Our revenue growth reflects our sustained investment in innovation. Within Google, this relentless focus had led -- has led to innovations across our advertising platforms that have driven continued strong growth on a very large base, while, at the same time, we're building new businesses to serve as sources of future revenue growth.
Most notably, Google Cloud is generating substantial revenue growth, reflecting the ongoing momentum in the business as well as the enormous opportunity in this area. And earlier this month, we launched a new line of hardware devices that, for the first time, brings consumers the best of Google through both hardware and software developed by Google.
As discussed previously, because most of our Other Bets are free revenue, the Other Bet revenue line provides only partial insight regarding our progress, which we aim to supplement with insight regarding product progress. For example, at Nest, product innovations and improvements, including the new outdoor version of the Nest Cam, are leading to increased consumer adoption of its suite of products for the home. Our self-driving car team is making terrific progress in transforming mobility with our fleet of test cars recently passing the 2-million-mile mark of autonomous driving. We are now testing our cars in 4 cities, enabling us to experience varied weather and driving conditions.
Second, as to expenses. As I mentioned last quarter, there are a number of factors driving higher TAC in both our sites and network businesses, and those factors persisted in the third quarter. The shift to mobile in Q3 remained the largest driver of the increase in sites TAC as a percentage of revenue. We expect sites TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of sites revenue. The growth in network TAC in Q3 was due to the ongoing adoption of programmatic platforms by advertisers, which are subject to a higher TAC rate, a trend we expect to continue. Furthermore, with respect to Google's operating expenses, we remain committed to investing in the compelling opportunities we've identified.
Turning to Other Bets. We're building out these businesses systematically and thoughtfully, investing commensurate with requirements given the opportunities we see. Before moving on from expenses, one reminder regarding the fourth quarter.  As discussed in prior years, our marketing costs are typically weighted more heavily toward the back half of the year due to the holiday season. Relative to last year, we have an expanded portfolio of hardware products and therefore expect marketing cost to increase in the fourth quarter to support the line.
Third, regarding CapEx. At Google, the team continues to drive meaningful efficiencies in planning and operations for our technical infrastructure. With regard to CapEx investments for Other Bets, our Fiber investment remains the primary driver.
Fourth, our balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains a powerful tool reflecting the strength of our cash flow and thereby giving us the ability to invest aggressively to support our long-term growth. Our primary focus is just that: investing in the breadth of opportunities across Alphabet.
And as discussed previously, our capital allocation framework begins with our outlook for the businesses, including a sensitivity analysis regarding potential CapEx and M&A as well as a view regarding working capital and a prudent liquidity buffer. This framework further considers complementary uses such as the share repurchase. As announced today, our board has authorized us to commence the repurchase of our Class C capital stock of up to $7,019,340,976.83.
In conclusion, in the third quarter, we again delivered strong revenue growth while broadening our portfolio of products and services. Thanks to all of our colleagues around the globe for their ingenuity and passion for pushing the frontier.
I will now turn the call over to Sundar.",1829
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3426.0,1216618.0,49753725.0,Presenter Speech,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Ruth. I don't think I can remember a busier time in Google's history than the past few months. We introduced the world to the Google Assistant, powered by our state-of-the-art machine learning technology. We unveiled a beautiful lineup of new hardware devices, including Google Home and the Pixel phone, which is getting great reviews. We launched a new messaging app, Allo, and a new video chat app, Duo. It's been an incredible quarter.  Through it all, we are laser focused on the priorities I outlined earlier this year, and in the next few minutes, I'll quickly go through our progress this past quarter.
We feel well positioned as we transition to a new era of computing. This new area is one in which people will experience computing more naturally and seamlessly in the context of their lives, powered by intelligent assistance and the cloud. This transition is as significant as the move over the last decade from desktops to mobile devices.
As we have rolled out products like the Google Assistant, Pixel, Google Home and Allo, we have gotten a glimpse of that future. And with the growing Cloud business, we are helping our enterprise customers take advantage of this new era of computing as well.
Today, I want to walk through our progress across Google's key focus areas and the success of our growing advertising business. First, making knowledge and information accessible to everyone. We have long aimed to help people find the information that they want right when they need it and sometimes, even before they think to ask for it. We reached an important milestone in the journey this quarter with the launch of the Google Assistant, which allows you to type or talk with Google in a natural conversational way, to help you get things done regardless of the device you're using. We first introduced it in our smart messaging app, Allo, which lets you chat with the Assistant. You can even add it to a group conversation to help you and your friends decide where to go for dinner. Early adoption of Allo and Duo has been great and has exceeded our expectations.
And the Assistant is core to the Pixel phone and Google Home. With Google Home, you can ask the Assistant to cast a song to your living room speaker or turn on the lights in your kitchen. And with Pixel, by simply holding the Home button, you can ask the Assistant to send a text to your mom or pull up pictures of your cat in Google Photos. I hope you all get to try them out soon.
The Assistant is simple, easy to use, and it is just the beginning. It's going to get so much better. We are excited to bring new features to you across more of your context soon.
The Assistant is all possible thanks to our years of investments in computer science and machine learning. Our Knowledge Graph now understands over 70 billion facts about people, places and things in the real world. And just last month, we announced our latest research on neural nets, which has given us a huge leap in translation quality. This breakthrough will help us provide even more accurate translations for people around the world.
And before I finish talking about access to information, I want to highlight the important work that our teams are doing to help American voters stay informed about the upcoming election.  We have launched improved search tools to help voters get registered, find key deadlines and learn how to vote early or by mail. We launched these in both English and Spanish. I don't speak Spanish, but I check Google Translate, and I want to remind everyone [Foreign Language] .
Second, moving to our efforts to bring more content to more places. Key to making information accessible is helping people find more great content across platforms like the web, YouTube and Google Play. Just recently, one of our key efforts to make the mobile web faster, the open-source project AMP, celebrated its first birthday. It's being embraced by a very broad range of publishers and sites around the world covering more than 700,000 domains. One example, tens of millions of WordPress sites now have AMP pages with page load speeds up to 90% faster than normal in some cases. We are also working on an initiative called AMP for Ads, a new approach to creating and serving ads with speed at the heart of the experience.
On YouTube, we continue to invest in bringing engaging content to the platform. We've worked with many news organizations to live stream all 3 U.S. presidential debates, and we saw record-breaking interest from the YouTube community. In fact, the 3 debates ranked as the 3 most viewed political live streams of all time on YouTube with over 8.5 million hours watched live, a 5x increase from the 2012 debates.
Elections-related searches on YouTube are also at an all-time high, with searches for U.S. election content up almost 550% compared to this time in the last election. And YouTube originals, like the recently released Single by 30, remained incredibly popular and continue to drive subscriptions for YouTube Red. 
And in Google Play, earlier this summer, we introduced Family Library, a way for up to 6 family members to share app, game, movie, TV show or book purchases.
Third, powerful computing platforms and hardware. We have long been committed to building powerful computing platforms like Android, Chrome and now Daydream in VR so that people can have great experiences regardless of their device.
Taking a step back, we have always believed that an open, horizontal, free platform like Android breeds more innovation, more options for users and better business models for partners. We open source our code. We build the most open APIs possible, and we work to create a sustainable, open ecosystem. With over 4,000 distinct Android devices, we are really proud of how so many partners are having success on the platform.
This quarter, we began rolling out our newest update on Android called Nougat and shared that we are bringing Android apps to Chromebooks. We can't wait to see all of the incredible experiences that developers will build on Daydream, our newest platform for high-quality virtual reality experiences via smartphones.
We also think there's an opportunity for us to more deeply integrate software and hardware together to deliver great experiences that we hope will also contribute to future innovation and development of the ecosystem. Earlier this month, we launched a family of hardware products made by Google, which, in addition to the Google Pixel and Google Home, include the Daydream View headset and controller; our premium TV streaming device, Chromecast Ultra; and the new connected WiFi system called Google Wifi. This portfolio of products is an example of how we can marry the best of hardware and software to deliver the best Google experience to people. 
Fourth, our increasing momentum in cloud. As we focus our efforts in the cloud, we continue to see strong customer engagement. Last month at our Horizon event, we introduced a new business unit, Google Cloud, our unique and broad portfolio of products and services that let our customers operate easily in a digital world with the performance they demand. Google Cloud includes Google Cloud Platform; our user-facing collaboration and productivity applications now called G Suite; all of our data analytics and machine learning tools and APIs; and the enterprise-ready Android phones, tablets and Chromebooks that access the cloud.
Our Cloud team has also been busy delivering new capabilities for our customers. We announced plans to expand to 8 new cloud regions in 2017 from Mumbai to Singapore to São Paulo to Frankfurt with more to come. We announced an enhanced video conference experience in Google Hangouts with an updated user interface, instant screen sharing, support for 50 participants and a seamless integration into calendar. We've been using this same technology to power meetings at Google and are so excited to share the improved experience with our customers.
We also significantly upgraded Google BigQuery, our fully managed data analytics warehouse and made Google Cloud machine learning available in beta to help businesses easily train quality machine learning models.
In addition to building the best products and infrastructure, we are partnering with great companies. This quarter, we forged new partnerships with Okta, Box and Accenture. Our investments in machine learning continue to be a very clear advantage for Google Cloud, and we are helping customers apply ML in very concrete ways. For example, Ocado, the world's largest online-only grocery retailer, is using machine learning to categorize and prioritize customer e-mails, which will help their support center respond to customers faster.
As we officially move into the Google Cloud era, our goal remains the same. We want to build the most open cloud for all businesses and make it easy for them to build and run great software. The team is firing on all cylinders to create the best cloud products in the industry for our customers.
Now moving on to growing advertising business, which is thriving in a mobile world. Our proposition to marketers on mobile is simple and is resonating. Our mobile properties, like Search, YouTube, Maps and Google Play, are where people turn when they are actively interested in something. They are using our services because they want to actively watch something they are passionate about or because they want to know, go, do or buy something. They are super attentive and engaged. It's just like people used to be glued to their TV screen during prime time. 
Our services are prime time for the mobile world. This matters for marketers because those prime time moments, when people are actively interested and attentive, are the perfect time for a brand to place their ads.
For instance, hotel chain La Quinta now sees 1/3 of their website traffic coming from mobile, and they use our Hotel Ads to help them reach travelers right when they are looking for hotel stays. They have found conversion rates to be twice the size with Hotel Ads compared to regular mobile traffic, which is helping them capitalize on those prime time moments when travelers are on their phones and ready to book.
In video, YouTube continues to shine. More than 1 billion monthly users are watching hundreds of millions of hours every single day. YouTube has become the platform of choice for major brands, with a highly engaged audience, the best formats and industry leading measurement tools. Recent research found that nearly half of U.S. adults between the ages of 18 and 54 say that at least once a month, YouTube helps them in making a decision about buying something.
One format that's been working really well for advertisers are Bumper ads, which are snackable 6-second videos that help brands drive incremental reach and frequency. Brands like Universal Pictures have been pairing these shorter videos with their standard-length ads on YouTube, and they're seeing great results, especially on mobile.
We also recently announced expanded capabilities to show marketers how TV and YouTube campaigns increase Google and YouTube searches for their brand. From early tests, we have seen that YouTube generates almost twice as many searches per impression that TV generates. In fact, across our advertising business, measurement is a critical investment. We want to give marketers the best tools out there to close the loop between television and digital, online and offline. For example, global retailer iCare with their agency, iProspect UK, used our Store Visits measurement tools to see how effective their digital marketing campaigns were bringing shoppers into their stores. By incorporating store visit data, they realized that more than 10% of the people who clicked on their search ads went on to visit a physical store and that their ROI from online ads was actually 5x higher than they had previously estimated. We introduced even more measurement solutions at this year's Advertising Week in New York, helping marketers close the loop with new tools like location extensions and Store Visits measurements for the Google Display Network.
We have thousands of great partners who are getting terrific results from our products. I'm really pleased with how our business teams are working closer than ever with our advertising partners: agencies, marketers and publishers. We can't succeed unless they do, and we have made a huge push to develop deeper partnerships and long-term win-win relationships. It's a big focus for us.
To wrap up, it's been an incredibly exciting few months and a very successful quarter. We feel extremely confident as we move into a new era of computing and are thrilled to be working with our partners as we embark on the journey together.
I want to thank all of the Googlers around the world who work tirelessly to turn ideas into reality for our users and partners. It's an honor to work alongside you every day.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Ruth.",2169

On the enterprise, thanks for laying out all the vision for the medium to long term on enterprise in Cloud. I think one of the big questions we get from investors all the time are where are the key areas you need to invest going forward in both capabilities, go to market and how those might evolve over the next couple years? And then maybe a second question for Ruth, which more housekeeping matter. Ruth, with highlighting the increased marketing expense behind the product launches this year, were you referencing quarter-over-quarter or compared year-over-year when you also launched products a year ago?",106

We have stepped up our partnering considerably so that we can offer our customers everything they want, and we have more vehicles for going to market. So scaling up through partnerships is a big area of focus and investment for us. We're also establishing a large Cloud machine learning group so that we can take advantages of working with our Cloud customers and make machine learning more accessible to all of them. I would say, other areas are hiring across sales, engineering and marketing, and as we head into 2017, I expect Cloud to be one of our largest areas of investment and headcount growth.",117

One, pretty obvious, is that sales and marketing is seasonally higher whenever we go into the holiday season, and so year-on-year, I wanted just to accentuate the point that we expect this trend to be pronounced this year because we're expanding and -- we're launching an even more expanded suite of hardware products. So it's really emphasizing the fact that the fourth quarter is higher and even more so this year with the expanded suite.",89

I guess, I was wondering, Sundar, if you could share with us kind of what milestone should we be watching for in this business? And then also, if you had to characterize -- you mentioned a couple of different ones, but I'm wondering what type of workloads are you having the most success with in GCP. And kind of what's on your customers' wish list? What are the things -- what's the top 1 or 2 things that your enterprise customers for Cloud might be asking for?",98

In general, like, the way we see is that customers don't want to be locked in, and they want to make sure their workloads can work and then be managed by containers that run on any platform. So our virtual machines and containers, including excellent open-source container management, Kubernetes, which was developed by Google, offers that solution. So Kubernetes manages the provisioning, reliability and auto-scaling of workloads. So we want to pursue a hybrid strategy, including on-prem and in all public clouds. So from a customer standpoint, they will want to use an open-source workload management product, and Kubernetes can work with multiple customers. So that's broadly how we think about it.",114

Sundar, first, on the Alphabet kind of structure high level. So there's been some incredible innovation that's come out of Alphabet, the various businesses. If we look at something like Otto, which was acquired by Uber or Niantic, which was the old Google Maps team, those were teams that were inside of Google that left Alphabet to start a new company and could have been potentially wholly owned businesses of Google in a parallel universe. So do you think this structure is ideal for entire companies? Or is it just new products and new technologies that you see as the vision here for Alphabet long term? And then, Ruth, the second question just on core operating margins for Google declined a little bit versus the prior quarter trend of increasing. Can you just give us some color on how much of that was due to mix towards cloud and other things that might carry lower margin versus margin compression within the advertising business.",165

So I think our track record speaks there. And we generally want to create a culture of innovation, and that's what we focus on. And I think it is fine that some of them happen outside. So we don't view it as a 0-sum game, and we're very comfortable with how we approach it.",100

And that primarily reflects trends in Other Bets. I think your question was probably more within Google. The operating margin on a non-GAAP basis is down modestly year-on-year. That's primarily to other cost of sales as distinct from TAC. The Google GAAP operating margins year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter do reflect the impact of the equity refresh that we called out last quarter that I talked about. I think one of the core things to your question is just is we're -- how we're looking at it, and our view continues to be that, given the breadth of opportunities and our commitment to long-term revenue growth, as we've talked about, quarter after quarter, we do remain committed to investing in this growing set of opportunities. And we spend a lot of time trying to manage that revenue growth and as I've said, manage expense growth with this -- the utmost respect for the resources deployed in getting the best return on those resources. So there are a number of different factors in here. I think I mentioned one of the things, as you're looking forward, was the sales and marketing. And just to make the -- another point, which I said in my opening comments, we do expect ongoing gross margin pressure from higher TAC associated with mobile search and with programmatic. But it does still result in more revenue and gross profit dollars but at a lower margin, and that's the other really important point with our starting point. We are continuing to invest, and we will point you to the revenue and gross profit dollars that come from that.",292

And as you point out, we've done hardware products over the years, but we saw an opportunity to bring all our disparate hardware efforts together in a thoughtful structure. I'm glad Rick [ph] is here. And we've been very focused on how we approach everything end to end so that we can bring together software and hardware for a great user experience. So along those lines, both Google Home and Google Pixel are important new efforts for us, and I think we will thoughtfully evolve our go-to-market strategy as well. These are important areas, and you already see with the Google Pixel, we have a deep partnership with Verizon with which we are going to market in the U.S. And so we are constantly thinking about how to do this well, and you will see new approaches as we go through it more.",145

I think one thing we did not hear about was Maps. And I think you've talked about it in the past. There's 1 billion plus users and pretty massive engagement.

I mean, today, a big part of what you're seeing with our transition to mobile that's working really well, the reason mobile search and mobile monetization works really well for us is because a lot of it is inherently local by nature. And the thing which helps us deliver a great local search experience is Maps. And so that's the direction we have always pointed in. We want it to be a great experience for consumers as Google Maps but in terms of also really enhancing the local search experience. And I think you'll continue to see us pursue it that way. And over time, to the extent there are opportunities to create value within the application itself, we'll pursue that as well.",129

From my standpoint, I look at it as -- and if you look back in time, all this is -- computing is becoming more and more important to people, and so they are engaging with it more and more. So as we went from desktops to mobile, it's not like one replaced the other. The sum total of all of this, it expanded the pie. I approach this the same way. I think, as I see people using voice, et cetera, they are interacting more with computing and with Google, too. So we view this as providing us more access across many different surfaces, many different contexts, being there for them when they need it. So in that view, I think it'll all be a big positive for us going forward.",133

Just to go back to the Voice Search question. Sundar, can you just talk whether that -- about if we do continue to migrate toward a world of voice search. Just talk about infrastructure and potential build you think you need to put in place to kind of continue to monetize search in a voice world as well as you do in a phone or a desktop world. And then secondly, can you just talk a little bit about where you are on rollout of extended text ads? I know you talked about a 20% bump to clickthrough rates. Just curious for where you are now kind of a pushout. Or is there any update on the clickthroughs?",120
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3426.0,1216618.0,49753749.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,27,"On the first question, I think I briefly answered it before. In terms of -- we are thinking about the voice experience deeply end to end. A lot of it is going -- because of how we are approaching our core investments, both from a software and hardware standpoint, so we leverage it all to make it better. So for example, even things like TPUs, which we talked about at Google I/O, play a role into something like Voice Search as you're talking about. And as we evolve the Google Assistant, I think voice is going to play a major role that way as well. So we are in very early days of all of this in relation to our overall volumes we see, and so I think we will be thoughtful about it. For example, the Assistant team talked about conversational actions as a way by which we can integrate third parties into the voice experience. So it's early days, and I think we will evolve with a lot in the coming, coming, coming years. In terms of your second question around expanded text ads, I would say, again, it's early. It's being adopted by advertisers across the board. We see both large and small advertisers using it. For us, we find advertisers who actually spend their time being thoughtful about the ad creatives and extensively testing and optimizing for this new format, they find strong performance. So we are pleased with the progress so far, but the transition is going to take some time as advertisers get comfortable with it. But we are excited about it.",268

Heading into this quarter's results, you had called out the ad format change in the third quarter of last year, which had driven a step-up in the year-ago growth rate. I wonder, is there anything specific on the revenue side that you'd like to call out in terms of comparisons versus the fourth quarter of last year as we try to calibrate our revenue expectations for the fourth quarter either in terms of mobile search, YouTube or ad tech programmatic? And then my second question is either for Ruth or Sundar. Can you just talk about the decision to pause efforts for Google Fiber? Wondering, was that decision more about financial discipline as you, I think, explained it, Ruth, in your prepared remarks for the Other Bets? Or does it more have to do the shift to wireless Internet technology or point-to-point wireless, which ultimately can take the place of a fiber or facilities-based infrastructure over time?",161
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3426.0,1216618.0,49753752.0,Answer,Ruth Porat,,Executives,30,"Okay, great, 2 good questions. So in terms of sites revenue, we are very pleased by the strength. It was broad based. It had 2 real drivers: first, the ongoing -- our ongoing focus on improving the experience for advertisers and users. And we introduced a number of enhancements, including format changes and ad tools. I think the most important point is that no one enhancement came close to the magnitude of the changes that we made in the third quarter of last year. That's why we kept calling out the 2015 change, and what's been gratifying is, in the aggregate, the results reflect the benefit of ongoing innovation. But again, very importantly, it wasn't one particular item. The second contributor is the secular shift to mobile, and we continue to benefit from that, be an important part of enhancing opportunities for engagement. As we look forward to the fourth quarter, I think that was part of your question as well, I think the only thing to point out is that in looking at growth rates, we're obviously at a higher revenue base versus last year. So just that, to us, is an important point to -- may be obvious but important to note there. In terms of Fiber, the impetus for it was really about the opportunities that we see to focus on innovation and what does that mean if the objective with Other Bets is really these 10x opportunities. And when you go back to the initial impetus for creating the business, it was the founder's view that there's a sizable opportunity given the need for abundant connectivity on networks that are always fast and always open. And we do continue to be committed to that vision. The team had some important breakthroughs in new technologies. You noted the most important, in our view, all that we're doing with wireless but also, technologies that are key implementation. And we believe that both of those -- the number of things they're doing enhance both our effectiveness and efficiency. And so we wanted to focus on the potential with these efforts before we reaccelerate deployment. And it was about being -- ensuring that we can take advantage of those before, again, pushing forth. We are very active in a lot of cities. In the third quarter alone, we rolled out 4 new cities, so that brings us to 12 cities across the U.S., where we're deployed in construction or in developments. And we're making great progress in those cities. We remain very committed to growth across those cities. And then we also have a presence in 6 cities with our wireless acquisition, Webpass. So we're pausing for now our work in 8 cities, where we've been in exploratory discussions. But very much to your question, it's to better integrate some of the technology work we've been developing, and there's more detail on the cities on the Fiber side to the extent you want to go into those.",497

So I'm wondering what concrete steps you may have taken to increase productivity or focus at the company and what you're doing now to continue to drive those gains going forward. Then, separately, as you called out earlier, you are shipping an unprecedented amount of hardware devices. So as you think about what your portfolio -- product portfolio might look like over the next 5 years, even the next decade, but does the Pixel phone mark a change in direction for Google to become maybe more of an integrated software and hardware company?",142

On the first thing, I would say we are very focused on our core mission, and we see a huge opportunity to do that in a unique way, thanks to what we view as a point of inflection with machine learning. So refocusing the company on a set of initiatives, recognizing that point of inflection is what has helped us really focus on things. And things like the Google Assistant are a manifestation of that, and you will see us continue to stay focused and innovate that way. In terms of hardware, I think, in our vision, computing is becoming more and more integral. It's going to be there for users in many different contexts. And so to really think and evolve it, you need to think about software and hardware together. That's where a lot of innovations happen. And so for us to push the paradigm, push the boundary, we are very committed to doing that. So it's a thoughtful effort from us. But overall, as I said in my remarks, we deeply remain committed to building an open ecosystem because, at the end of the day, we want Google to be there for every user everywhere. And to do that well, we want to work with partners and build a great ecosystem to make it happen.",220

And that's enabled us to support growing demand but at the stable investment level. We've talked about that on prior calls as well. But I think we're proud of what they've been doing there. Some examples of efficiencies include improvements in server utilization and the use of machine learning that Sundar's talked about and the deployment of innovations like our Tensor Processing Units that he's commented. So the main thing is we're building greater productivity with existing machines.

We want to make sure that the -- this -- that all these new capabilities for machine learning and AI are available to Google Cloud to all our partners. We don't see it as a 0-sum game. I think, internally, core to our mission, we see areas where we can execute, and we will continue to do that. But we want to do both, and we can do it thoughtfully well.",132

And when we went through the third quarter results, that was -- has been our intent with all of the color, commentary on Cloud. I guess, the only other thing to add is that the largest percentage growth year-on-year in our other revenue line and actually even across all of our revenue lines was in our Google Cloud Platform, and that reflects a significant momentum in compute and storage.",90

But could you talk about machine learning in search and how much it's making a difference over the last few quarters and how much you still have to go, how important that is to the revenues? And then, Ruth, a couple of questions. Any thoughts on whether hardware sales can make a difference to margins going forward; and also, on the stock-based comp, how Google thinks about that expense internally?",77

And we have made great progress on it, but I would still -- I would characterize it as very early stages in terms of the long-term impact they can have. In generally -- similarly, we are in the very, very early stages of incorporating machine learning, the newer machine learning systems and ads, and again, that's the beginning of a long journey as well. Overall, I think all of these systems are incredibly complex systems, and they are handcrafted systems over many, many years. And so over time, I think machine learning will surface newer approaches and newer insights. And so we see it as a huge area of opportunity, but it'll play out over a period of time.",147

I think Sundar's given a lot of color on that. It's still early days with the rollout of some of these newer lines that we're super excited about, and so early to make a call on that but certainly, investing meaningfully in the line given the importance we see in this. And then in terms of stock-based compensation, we've always said we will remain focused on long-term revenue growth, and that does require investing in talent. And we do believe equity ownership is a really valuable part of overall compensation consistent with alignment of interest. It's something we keep an eye on, and we're mindful of the full cost of equity-based compensation and certainly look at that as part of the overall cost that we're investing in across the businesses.",138

And I was just curious to hear your thoughts on what your goals are for the group and how it may -- you may take lessons back to your leadership at Google.",53

We are in extraordinarily early days for AI, and it's super important that we approach it thoughtfully as an industry. I am encouraged to see the commitment across these companies. Our goal is to promote open collaboration, help the public understand AI and establish best practices and R&D. Without something like this, I think ideas would develop in silos, and so I think it's good to do this to promote an informed dialogue on AI. And so I'm very excited. All along, just like with TensorFlow, where we are doing this in an open way and all the other things we have done at Google, I think it's important as we work on new technology to contribute and to give back. And so in that context, I think all of this is personally very meaningful to me.",150
