Our results reflect strong momentum and product innovation continuing into 2024. Today, I'm going to talk about four main topics. One, our investments in AI, including how it's helping Search; two, subscriptions, which reached $15 billion in annual revenue, up 5x since 2019. Subscriptions is growing strongly powered by YouTube Premium and Music, YouTube TV and Google One. Three, Cloud, which crossed $9 billion in revenues this quarter and saw accelerated growth driven by our GenAI and product leadership; and four, our investments and focus to meet the growth opportunities ahead. 
First, AI and Search. As you know, we have long led the way in using AI to improve many of our products from Search to Ads to most of our consumer and enterprise products, helping billions of people already. Last year brought new excitement around GenAI, and I'm proud of how we responded responsibly with deep advances in foundation models and a number of great launches. 
We closed the year by launching the Gemini era, a new industry-leading series of models that will fuel the next generation of advances. Gemini is the first realization of the vision we had when we formed Google DeepMind, bringing together our 2 world-class research teams. It's engineered to understand and combine text, images, audio, video and code in a natively multimodal way, and it can run on everything from mobile devices to data centers. 
Gemini gives us a great foundation. It's already demonstrating state-of-the-art capabilities, and it's only going to get better. Gemini Ultra is coming soon. The team is already working on the next versions and bringing it to our products. 
That starts with Search. We are already experimenting with Gemini in Search, where it's making our Search Generative Experience, or SGE, faster for users. We have seen a 40% reduction in latency in English in the U.S. I'm happy with what we are seeing in the earliest days of SGE. It's available through Search Labs in 7 languages. 
By applying generative AI to Search, we are able to serve a wider range of information needs and answer new types of questions, including those that benefit from multiple perspectives. People are finding it particularly useful for more complex questions like comparisons or longer queries. It's also helpful in areas where people are looking for deeper understanding, such as education or even gift ideas. 
We are improving satisfaction, including answers for more conversational and intricate queries. As I mentioned earlier, we are surfacing more links with SGE and linking to a wider range of sources on the results page, and we'll continue to prioritize approaches that add value for our users and send valuable traffic to publishers. 
Beyond SGE, we are continuing to use AI to make searching more accessible and intuitive. Circle to Search lets you search what you see on Android phones with a simple gesture without switching apps. It's available starting this week on Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro and the new Samsung Galaxy S24 Series. 
And Lens now offers generative AI overviews. You can add text to a visual search to ask questions about anything you see and get AI-powered insights in the moment. In addition to Search, we are also seeing a lot of interest in our AI-powered solutions for advertisers. That includes our new conversational experience that uses Gemini to accelerate the creation of Search campaigns. 
Then there is Bard, our conversational AI tool that complements Search. It's now powered by Gemini Pro and is much more capable at things like understanding, summarizing, reasoning, coding and planning. It's now in over 40 languages and over 230 countries around the world. Looking ahead, we'll be rolling out an even more advanced version for subscribers powered by Gemini Ultra. 
That's a good segue to subscriptions. As I said earlier, it's now a $15 billion business annually. YouTube is the key driver of our subscription revenues. Available in over 100 countries and regions, YouTube Music and Premium have real momentum. They're engaging passionate users and driving great returns for the music industry and creators. 
YouTube TV is also doing well. We've had great consumer feedback on the viewing experience. People love the navigation, multiview and unlimited DVR. NFL Sunday Ticket has found its perfect home on YouTube, and Philipp will talk about that more. 
Let me also talk about our subscription service, Google One. It's doing incredibly well with strong user growth. It provides expanded storage, unlocks exclusive features in Google products and allows us to build a strong relationship with our most engaged users. Google One is growing very well, and we are just about to cross 100 million subscribers. From here, we are going to bring in more AI features and look forward to more strong growth to come. 
Next, Google Cloud. Throughout 2023, we introduced thousands of product advances, including broad GenAI capabilities across our AI infrastructure, our Vertex AI platform and our new Duet AI agents. In Q4, our product and GenAI leadership enabled us to win and expand relationships with many leading brands, including Hugging Face, McDonald's, Motorola Mobility and Verizon. 
Google Cloud offers our AI Hypercomputer, a groundbreaking supercomputing architecture that combines our powerful TPUs and GPUs, AI software and multi-slice and multi-host technology to provide performance and cost advantages for training and serving models. Customers like Anthropic, Character.AI, Essential AI and Mistral AI are building and serving models on it. 
For developers building GenAI applications, we offer Vertex AI, a comprehensive enterprise AI platform. It helps customers like Deutsche Telekom and Moody's discover, customize, augment and deploy over 130 GenAI models, including PaLM, MedPaLM, Sec-PaLM and Gemini as well as popular open source and partner models. Vertex AI has seen strong adoption with the API request increasing nearly 6x from H1 to H2 last year. 
Using Vertex AI, Samsung recently announced its Galaxy S24 Series smartphone with Gemini and Imagen 2, our advanced text-to-image model. Shutterstock has added Imagen 2 to their AI image generator, enabling users to turn simple text prompts into unique visuals. And Victoria's Secret & Co. will look to personalize and improve the customer experience with Gemini, Vertex AI, Search and Conversations. 
Customers are increasingly choosing Duet AI, our packaged AI agents for Google Workspace and Google Cloud Platform, to boost productivity and improve their operations. Since its launch, thousands of companies and more than 1 million trusted testers have used Duet AI. It will incorporate Gemini soon. 
In Workspace, Duet AI is helping employees benefit from improved productivity and creativity at thousands of paying customers around the world, including Singapore Post, Uber and Woolworths. In Google Cloud Platform, Duet AI assists software developers and cybersecurity analysts. Duet AI for Developers is the only GenAI offering to support the complete development and operations life cycle, fine-tuned with the customer's own core purpose and policies. It's helping Wayfair, GE Appliances and Commerzbank write better software, faster with AI code completion, code generation and chat support. With Duet AI and Security Operations, we are helping cybersecurity teams at Fiserv, Spotify and Pfizer. 
Our robust growth has been driven by strong direct and indirect channels. With ISVs, we have nearly tripled the number of co-sell deals from 2022 to 2023. In our ecosystem, there are nearly 90,000 Google Cloud GenAI-enabled consultants. And Accenture has teamed up with Google Cloud to create a joint generative AI center of excellence. 
Next, let me turn to our focus and discipline as we pursue the opportunities ahead. Search, YouTube and Cloud are supported by our state-of-the-art compute infrastructure. This infrastructure is also key to realizing our big AI ambitions. It's a major differentiator for us. We continue to invest responsibly in our data centers and compute to support this new wave of growth in AI-powered services for us and for our customers. Through this, we are being disciplined in how we run the company. 
You've heard me talk about our efforts to durably reengineer our cost base and to improve our velocity and efficiency. That work continues. Teams are working to focus on key priorities and execute fast, removing layers and simplifying their organizational structures. As just one example, our devices team has brought together different teams from across Nest, Fitbit and other teams into a new functional structure. This will help us pull resources and drive progress across our Pixel portfolio. Across different teams, we have wound down some nonpriority projects, which will help us invest and operate well in our growth areas. 
We are also improving our machine utilization, building on our years of experience in driving cost efficiencies in our computing infrastructure and operations. And through our supplier efficiency efforts and automation of certain processes, we have made major improvements in areas like procurement, achieving significant savings. 
That's a snapshot of the quarter. Before I close, a couple of other highlights. Pixel 8, our AI-first phone, was awarded Phone of the Year by numerous outlets. It now uses Gemini Nano with features like Magic Compose for Google Messages and more to come. 
In our Other Bets portfolio of companies, Waymo, which is deeply focused on safety, reached over 1 million fully autonomous ride-hailing trips. And Isomorphic Labs entered into strategic partnerships with Eli Lilly and Novartis to apply AI to treat diseases, which has great potential. 
2023 was a year of profound innovation and product momentum. Thank you to our many partners. We succeed when our partners do, and we are grateful for the work we do together. From our partners across the Android ecosystem who are on display at CES to our deep relationships with retailers, small businesses and advertising partners, to the next generation of AI start-ups and developers and many more. I also want to thank all of our employees for their hard work throughout 2023 and the start of the new year. I'm excited for what's ahead in 2024. Philipp?",1644
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2024",2024-01-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3413.0,3007347.0,109919626.0,Presenter Speech,Philipp Schindler,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Sundar, and hi, everyone. Google Services revenues of $76 billion were up 12% year-on-year. In Google advertising, Search and other revenues grew 13% year-on-year, led again by solid growth in the retail vertical. We had particular strength in retail in APAC, a trend that began in the second quarter of 2023 and continued through the end of the year. 
YouTube ads revenue were up 16% year-on-year driven by growth in both direct response and brand. And network revenues declined 2% year-on-year. In subscriptions, platforms and devices, which was previously named Google Other, year-on-year revenues increased 23% driven by strong growth in subscriptions. 
Now for some color on the quarter and where we see continued upside for long-term advertising growth. Over the last few calls, I have consistently highlighted how we're putting Google AI to work for our customers to deliver profitability and help them achieve their goals in a do-more-with-less environment. 
From a product perspective, in Q4, Performance Max remained a bright spot. We're also excited about demand gen momentum. This is our big bet to help social advertisers find and convert consumers via immersive, relevant visual creatives across YouTube, including YouTube Shorts, Gmail and Discover. In a single campaign, you get access to over 3 billion users as they stream, scroll, connect and decide what to buy. Tens of thousands of advertisers are testing and on average seeing 6% more conversions per dollar versus image-only ads and discovery campaigns. 
As we look ahead, we're also starting to put generative AI in the hands of more and more businesses to help them build better campaigns and even better performing ads. Automatically created assets help advertisers show more relevant search ads by creating tailored headlines and descriptions based on each ad's context. Adoption was up with strong feedback in Q4. In addition to now being available in 8 languages, more advanced GenAI-powered capabilities are coming to ACA. 
And then last week's big news was that Gemini will power new conversational experience in Google Ads. This is open and beta to U.S. and U.K. advertisers. Early tests show advertisers are building higher-quality search campaigns with less effort, especially SMBs who are 42% more likely to publish a campaign with good or excellent ad strength. We can't wait to see how this continues to drive performance and level the playing field for advertisers of all sizes. 
As we shared last quarter, Ads will continue to play an important role in the new search experience, and we'll continue to experiment with new formats native to SGE. SGE is creating new opportunities for us to improve commercial journeys for people by showing relevant ads alongside search results. We've also found that people are finding ads either above or below the AI-powered overview helpful as they provide useful options for people to take action and connect with businesses. 
Looking at our strong Search performance for the fourth quarter. Retail was a highlight. We continue to see a stronger start to the season up to and including Cyber Five. In Q3, we indicated that we were seeing early trends of consumers being very price-conscious, and we saw this play out in Q4. With promotional demand at an all-time high, deal seekers using Google had access to 2x the deals in the U.S. versus last season as well as a better shopping experience. Launches included a one-stop shop deals destination, new filters like [ Get it Fast ] and AI-generated gifting recommendations in SGE. These new features drove incremental query growth during key shopping moments like Cyber Five. 
Our proven AI-powered ad solutions were also a win for retailers looking to accelerate omni growth and capture holiday demand. Quick examples include a large U.S. big-box retailer who drove a 60%-plus increase in omni ROAS and a 22%-plus increase in store traffic using Performance Max during Cyber Five; and a well-known global fashion brand, who drove a 15%-plus higher omnichannel conversion rate versus regular shopping traffic by showcasing its store pickup offering across top markets through pickup later on shopping ads. 
Moving on to YouTube. We're obviously pleased with YouTube's advertising revenue growth in Q4 and also significant growth in our subscription revenue. I'll reiterate what I have said before: YouTube's success starts with creator success. We give millions of creators more ways to create content and connect with fans and more ways to make money and build their own businesses than any other platform. More creators means more content, which leads to more viewers. And via ads and subscriptions, these viewers fund our creators and drive the eyeballs and engagement our advertisers want. 
To keep this momentum going, we're focused on delivering value across 4 pillars: creation, viewers, monetization and responsibility. First, creation, which increasingly takes place on mobile devices. We've invested in a full suite of tools, including our new YouTube Create app for Shorts, to help people make everything from 15-second Shorts to 15-minute videos to 15-hour live streams with a production studio in the palm of their hands. 
GenAI is supercharging these capabilities. Anyone with a phone can swap in a new backdrop, remove background extras, translate their video into dozens of languages, all without a big studio budget. We're excited about our first products in this area from Dream Screen for AI-generated backgrounds to Aloud for AI-powered dubbing. There is more to come. 
Number two, viewers. We continue to grow watch time across YouTube with strong growth in Shorts and connected TV. Shorts remains a top priority. We have 2 billion-plus logged-in users every month, and we are averaging 70 billion in daily views. Connected TVs, or what we refer to as the living room, is where viewership is growing the fastest. We're investing to make this experience even better with interactive features tailored to TVs, plus the content people love: our creators, NFL Sunday Ticket and the range of live sports and studio content via YouTube TV and Primetime Channels. Put this all together and YouTube is the must-have app on every connected TV. 
Monetization is pillar #3 and realized through a combination of ad-supported and subscription offerings. Advertising generates the bulk of our revenue, and we continue to invest heavily here. We've rolled out CTV-first formats like 30-second nonskippable ads and pause experiences as well as an industry-first send-to-phone experience that lets people use a second screen to engage with ads. 
For Shorts, we've developed new formats that are less interruptive to viewers. It's early. We're learning but excited by the opportunities for ads this can unlock. Shorts monetization continues to progress nicely. 
Our AI-powered video formats from video reach and video view campaigns to demand gen and video action continue to make advertiser dollars go further and drive results across the funnel. We're also introducing new and existing advertisers to YouTube via sports content. 90-plus upfront and scatter advertisers, including Unilever, are partnering with YouTube in our first year across NFL Sunday Ticket in-game advertising opportunities. 
Our subscription offerings are also growing at a healthy clip. YouTube Music and Premium performed well. Premium users are delivering more value to our partners and YouTube than even ad-supported users do. On average, each additional Premium sign-up boost earnings for creators, music and media partners and YouTube itself. And we've made Premium even more attractive with new features, bundles and other enhancements. 
We're also pleased with our first season of NFL Sunday Ticket. It gave creators new opportunities to create content and feed user engagement across traditional user content and professional sports content. Feedback on the user experience, including multiview, has been great. We're excited to continue to innovate here. 
Responsibility is our fourth pillar, and it underlines everything we do across YouTube. We continue to focus relentlessly on this. As always, deepening our relationships with key partners to bring them the best of Google is a key priority for us, and we continue to do this across industries in Q4. 
We just talked about the NFL. Sundar mentioned Samsung, among others earlier. Another highlight was our expanded partnership with Porsche to enhance customers' digital experiences with a deeper in-vehicle integration of Google built-in services, including Google Maps and Play. Whether it's continued collaboration with our partners and key ecosystems, we're putting Google AI to work for more customers. I'm excited about the opportunities for continued impact in 2024. 
I'll wrap with a huge note of gratitude to our customers and partners. Our success is only possible because of their success and then to our Googlers for their outstanding work and focus this year. 
Ruth, over to you.",1425
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2024",2024-01-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3413.0,3007347.0,109919627.0,Presenter Speech,Ruth Porat,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Philipp. We are very pleased with our full year results with 2023 Alphabet revenues of $307 billion, up 9% versus 2022, which added $25 billion to revenues for the year. We ended with a strong fourth quarter with consolidated revenues of $86.3 billion, up 13% versus last year in both reported and constant currency. 
Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the fourth quarter, unless I state otherwise. 
Total cost of revenues was $37.6 billion, up 6%. Other cost of revenues was $23.6 billion, up 5%, with the increase driven primarily by content acquisition costs associated with YouTube subscription offerings. The growth rate also reflects the offsetting benefit of lapping $1.2 billion in inventory-related charges that we called out in the fourth quarter last year as well as a reduction in depreciation expense due to changes in estimated useful lives we made starting in the first quarter of 2023. 
In terms of total expenses, the year-on-year comparisons reflect an additional $1.2 billion in exit charges that we took in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with actions to optimize our global office space. As you can see in our earnings release, these charges were allocated across the expense lines in other cost of revenues and OpEx based on associated head count. 
Operating expenses were $25 billion, up 11%, primarily reflecting an increase in R&D expenses, which were driven by the real estate charges, followed by compensation. Operating income was $23.7 billion, up 30%, and our operating margin was 27%. Net income was $20.7 billion, and EPS was $1.64. We delivered free cash flow of $7.9 billion, which was affected by the timing of the $10.5 billion tax payment we made on October 16 that we called out previously related to the deferral of certain tax payments to the fourth quarter. 
For the full year 2023, free cash flow was $69 billion. We repurchased a total of $62 billion of our Class A and Class C shares in 2023 and ended the year with $111 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
Turning to segment results. Within Google Services, revenues were $76.3 billion, up 12%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $48 billion in the quarter were up 13%, led again by growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $9.2 billion were up 16% driven by both direct response and brand advertising. Network advertising revenues of $8.3 billion were down 2%. 
Subscriptions, platforms and devices revenues, which we previously referred to as other revenues, were $10.8 billion, up 23%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube subscription revenues. TAC was $14 billion, up 8%. Google Services' operating income was $26.7 billion, up 32%, and the operating margin was 35%. 
Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $9.2 billion for the quarter, up 26%. We're very pleased with the momentum of GCP with an increasing contribution from AI. Google Workspace also delivered strong revenue growth primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud delivered operating income of $864 million and an operating margin of 9%. 
As to our Other Bets, for the full year 2023, revenues were $1.5 billion and the operating loss was $4.1 billion. Results in the fourth quarter benefited from a milestone payment in one of the Other Bets. 
Turning to our outlook for the business. With respect to Google Services, first, within advertising. We were pleased with the sequential revenue growth of Search and YouTube advertising throughout 2023, which reflects the extraordinary work across our teams to drive improved experiences for users and attractive ROI for advertisers. As we enter 2024 with advertising revenues of more than $100 billion higher than 2019, we remain focused on sustaining healthy growth on this larger base. 
Second, within subscriptions, platforms and devices, our total revenues from subscription products reached $15 billion for the full year 2023 driven primarily by substantial growth in subscribers for our YouTube subscription offerings. The substantial increase in our subscription revenues over the past few years demonstrates the ability of our teams to deliver high value-add offerings and provides a strong base on which to build, including through YouTube and newer services like Google One. 
Play had solid growth again in the fourth quarter driven primarily by an increase in the number of buyers. In devices, we continue to make sizable investments with increased emphasis on our Pixel family, particularly with AI-powered innovation while driving further efficiencies across the portfolio. 
Turning to Google Cloud. We are pleased with operating performance in the year. Full year revenues of $33 billion were up 26% versus prior year, ending with strong Q4 performance. The Cloud team is intensely focused on bringing the benefits of Gemini, our industry-leading AI technology, to enterprises and governments globally, and we are gratified with the level of engagement. The strong demand we are seeing for our vertically integrated AI portfolio is creating new opportunities for Google Cloud across every product area. 
In terms of profitability, the improvement in 2023 reflects sustained focus across the team with the intent to maintain healthy profitability while we continue to invest to support long-term growth. 
Turning to margins and expenses. As we have repeatedly stressed, we remain committed to our framework to durably reengineer our cost base as we invest to support our growth priorities. Key contributors to moderating our expense growth include: first, product and process prioritization to ensure we have the right resources behind our most important opportunities and to reallocate resources where we can; second, organizational efficiency and structure. We're focused on removing layers to simplify execution and drive velocity. 
Both product prioritization and the organization design efforts result in a slower pace of hiring, as you can see with our head count down year-on-year, reflecting the reductions we announced in the first quarter of 2023 and a much slower pace of hiring. We will continue to invest in top technical and engineering talent. 
Finally, we continue to execute the other work streams to slow expense growth, including improving efficiency in our technical infrastructure, streamlining operations across Alphabet through the use of AI, increasing efficiency of our spend with suppliers and vendors through our central procurement organization and optimizing our real estate portfolio. 
With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the fourth quarter was $11 billion, driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure with the largest component for servers followed by data centers. The step-up in CapEx in Q4 reflects our outlook for the extraordinary applications of AI to deliver for users, advertisers, developers, cloud enterprise customers and governments globally and the long-term growth opportunities that offers. In 2024, we expect investment in CapEx will be notably larger than in 2023. 
With regard to Other Bets, we've been working to sharpen our investment focus while capturing the upside given compelling technology breakthroughs across the portfolio. For example, last week, Alphabet's X announced that it would be moving to spin out more projects as independent companies through external capital, giving X the opportunity to bring more focus to the breakthrough technologies it is working on to address some of the world's most pressing challenges.

You obviously have a lot of irons in the fire here. You've been talking about some of the early momentum with tens of thousands of advertisers.
The question is, can you sort of walk us through some of the hurdles and gating factors that we should be thinking through that dictate the pace at which these tools can really be rolled out broadly just so we and advertisers can kind of get an understanding for when they could have a bigger impact on the whole business? And then secondly, how do you think about the long-term sales force intensity of the advertising business as you roll more AI-based tools like PMax impacting the overall ad allocation?",138
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2024",2024-01-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3413.0,3007347.0,109919630.0,Answer,Philipp Schindler,,Executives,7,"Yes. Thank you so much. So I've covered this a little bit on previous quarters. AI has been at the core of our advertising products for a very, very long time. And the recent advances are really allowing us to drive more value for advertisers across a large range of different areas: bidding, targeting, creative as well as our core advertiser and publisher experiences.
We are seeing in core search ads, for example, the bidding side, the value-based bidding as a very significant one; on the targeting side, the broad match; on creative, responsive search ads automatically created ads assets. And we are very happy with the progress we're seeing in those areas.
I think I mentioned in one of the previous calls that one, you asked about hurdles and gating factors. The AI essentials play neutral in this, trying to get everybody ready to really take full advantage of those tools. We talked about the progress on PMax as well that we're very happy with in Q4. So overall, I think we are on track with what we're expecting here.
On the sales force intensity side, we have done a few reallocations or let me call it portfolio adjustments. As you know, we have 2 large different teams. One is our LCS, large customer solutions team that's really focused on transformational growth for our largest and most sophisticated customers. And we have our -- we call them GCS, Global Customer Solutions team, which is the channel where really every customer starts from some of our largest customers now to also the millions of smaller ones and SMBs.
The GCS is really then scaling growth by dynamically delivering really the right treatment for every customer. And important to note, it's also our fastest-growing channel, and it delivered particularly strong growth in Q4. So we have done adjustments here to focus more resources on the GCS side.
But I also want to be clear, when we restructure, there's always an opportunity to be more efficient and smarter in how we service and grow our customers. We're not restructuring because AI is taking away roles that's important here. But we see significant opportunities here with our AI-powered solution to actually deliver incredible ROI at scale, and that's why we're doing some of those adjustments. So I look at sales force intensity as a stronger focus going forward on the channels I mentioned here.",401

So we are very pleased with the progress we're continuing to make, and we are very committed to the framework to durably reengineer our cost base really as we're investing to support the growth priorities. I tried to call out a number of them in opening comments, but really, as you're looking at the work being done across Google, across Alphabet, it does start with product and process prioritization to make sure we've got the right resources behind the most important opportunities, and then that creates the opportunity for reallocating resources where we can.
Then we talked a lot about this quarter about organizational efficiency and structure, and we're focused on removing layers to simplify execution and drive velocity. The combination of those 2, product prioritization and organizational design work, has resulted in the slower pace of hiring. You can see that in our head count numbers down year-on-year. You can see it in some of the -- in the results that we delivered in the fourth quarter.
You can -- and it also goes to the announcements around first quarter and much lower pace of hiring. At this point in the quarter, we do estimate that severance-related expense will be roughly $700 million in the first quarter as we've continued these efforts. But as I said in opening comments, we will continue to invest in top engineering.
So that's sort of the big one, if you start with product prioritization and organizational design, which is why also I made the note about the severance-related expense, which helps pave the way as we're continuing to do the work that we're doing. But then we have a host of other work streams, which I talked about, everything with improving efficiency in our technical infrastructure, which is a very large ongoing effort; streamlining operations across Alphabet through use of AI; all the work we're doing with our suppliers and vendors; the work we're doing optimizing our real estate portfolio. So when we've described durably reengineering, it's about continuing to build on work that started, and that is ongoing.",350

You asked about some of the learnings. Maybe I'll start with the viewing experience. We've received great feedback so far. People like the navigation, multiview, the chat, the lack of latency, really, really positive feedback on this one. You asked about the ads and the subs. Maybe I'll start with the subscribers.
We're pleased with the NFL Sunday Ticket sign-ups in our first season both as part of the YouTube TV bundle and as a stand-alone offering on YouTube Primetime Channels. Remember, you can access them via both. Nothing more to share on the sub side today on this one.
On the ad side, as you know, advertisers can buy from an NFL lineup as part of our YouTube Select portfolio. And this actually allows advertisers to reach football fans across YouTube's pretty unique breadth of NFL content, independently of whether you're viewing live NFL games or on YouTube TV or Primetime Channels or watching NFL highlights, post-game commentary on YouTube channels.
And we saw solid demand across the ad market around our YouTube Sunday Ticket offering here. We're excited about the partnership ahead or the partnerships ahead. This is our first season. And I mentioned over 90 upfront and scatter advertisers partnered with YouTube in our first year across NFL Sunday Ticket in-game opportunities, which we really appreciate.",252

Sundar, a bigger-picture question, coming back to your comments earlier in the call on Search Generative Experience. When you think about the evolution of product over the next couple of years, how do you envision more traditional search and things like the Google Assistant continuing to evolve in a world of Search Generative Experience and Bard? And what that might mean for elements of commercial and noncommercial search and how use cases might change in the years ahead?
And then Ruth, I just want to make sure we understood some of the messaging from the release and the public comments around one-timers in the quarter itself. It seems as if they were not allocated to the segments but are more elements of Other Bets and Alphabet-level activities. I just want to confirm whether elements of those one-timers were captured in the P&L statement and whether there were also any elements of legal one-timers that would be called out this quarter as well.",166

Great question. Look, it is an exciting time. Clearly, as I said, as we are incorporating SGE in the product, the early feedback is positive. And we've been iterating on it, and it clearly works for certain type of queries very well. We are expanding the set of queries where it works very well. It definitely is answering a certain category of queries for the first time in a better way. So that gives us direction to proceed as well.
Overall, one of the things I think people underestimate about Search is the breadth of Search, the amount of queries we see constantly on a new day, which we haven't seen before. And so the trick here is to deliver that high-quality experience across the breadth of what we see in Search.
And over time, we think Assistant will be very complementary. And we will again use generative AI there, particularly with our most advanced models in Bard and allows us to act more like an agent over time, if I were to think about the future and maybe go beyond answers and follow through for users even more. So that is the -- directionally, what the opportunity set is. Obviously, a lot of execution ahead. But it's an area where I think we have a deep sense of what to do. And all the work we have taken so far, the feedback has been super positive.",239

But the other comment I was making in opening comments is when you go through the various line items, R&D, et cetera, you see it spread there.

Given the importance of connected TV engagement in YouTube, can you talk about the opportunity outside the U.S. for connected TV? And what the company is doing at large to drive more adoption of YouTube or connected TVs given the Google operating system? And can you talk about outside the U.S.?
And then you've been consistent about the strength of Shorts over the past year. Can you talk a bit about the modernization challenges? Do you still see the headwinds that you saw at the beginning? Anything you could share about the density of the auction or advertising interest on Shorts. So help us with whether or not that's still a headwind to growth.",121

Thank you so much for your question. On the connected TV side, I mentioned it actually continues to perform really well. I said before, YouTube is the leader in U.S. streaming watch time and it's not just one audience group diving deep it's really all audiences. On the international side, it's something we are closely looking at. There's nothing specific I have to add at this moment in time on this one.
On the Shorts monetization side, look, we built Shorts to respond to the huge demand from both creators and viewers for short-form video. And we're very pleased with the growth we've seen. I mentioned 2 billion-plus logged-in users every month, 70 billion in daily views. Specifically to the monetization question, Shorts monetization continues to progress nicely. In fact, actually, since we introduced revenue sharing for Shorts, the total creator earnings generated from Shorts have increased every month, and we expect this to continue. And similar, obviously, to our long-form videos, we're really committed here to a long-term partnership. And you heard me say this before, right, when creators succeed, we succeed.",184

But it seems like there's been this long lineage of product development and rollout of things like smart bidding in your history, which I believe at the time was designed to help smaller advertisers more easily run search advertising.
And today, you're helping me to generate creative as well as manage my spend and maximize ROI across multiple Google Services. So how are you feeling about enabling SMBs who otherwise could not advertise with you before? And what kind of TAM expansion tailwind does that create for your revenue growth over the longer term?",113

We mentioned this several times before. They're part of our GCS channel, not only there's more in this. But they've been under a ton of change over the last few years. And our focus has always been here on investing in solutions that really help level the playing field, and you mentioned several of those. So actually, SMBs can compete with bigger brands and more sophisticated advertisers.
And so the feedback we're always getting is they need easy solutions that could drive value quickly, and several of the AI-powered solutions that you're mentioning are actually making the workflow and the whole on-ramp and the bidded targeting creative and so on, you mentioned that is so much easier for SMBs. So we're very satisfied with what we're seeing here. We will continue to invest. And I feel AI is really a helpful, very interesting future path to make life not only easier but also much more productive and better ROIs over time, more level playing field for SMBs.",178

Just on Search growth, I think there are some concerns on use of competitive AI tools as an alternative to Search. Just wondering if you're seeing any changes in query volumes, positive or negative, since you've seen the year evolve and more Search Generative Experiences. And what can really make Google stand out versus other AI tools?
And then Ruth, CapEx was $11 billion, a step-up, obviously. Any onetime items in there? Or is that how we should think about the new run rate into '24.",94

First of all, look, we think about effects on Search, obviously, more broadly. People have a lot of information choices. So -- and user expectations are constantly evolving. And so we've been doing this for a long time. And I think what ends up mattering is a strong continuous track record of innovation.
Obviously, generative AI is a new tool in the arsenal. But there's a lot more that goes into Search: the breadth, the depth, the diversity across verticals, stability to follow through, getting actually access to rich, diverse sources of content on the web and putting it all together in a compelling way.
And I think, through the year 2, when we test, we test Search Generative Experience, particularly against everything that's out there. And we can see the progress we are making and how much users are liking the experience better. And so I think I feel very good about the progress. And our road map for '24 is strong both on the Search and the underlying AI progress, including the model. So I'm pretty excited about what's ahead of us in '24.",188

To your question, there was no onetime item in there. It really reflects is our outlook for everything Sundar and Philipp and I have been talking about, the extraordinary applications of AI within Google DeepMind, Google Services, Google Cloud, it's across the board for users, for advertisers, developers, cloud enterprise customers, governments. And it's really the long-term opportunity that offers.
So last quarter, we did note that CapEx would continue to grow in 2024. We do expect 2024 full year CapEx to be notably larger than 2023. As a note, I think you all know this, but timing of cash payments can affect the quarterly CapEx number. But the main point is we're continuing to invest.",140

So dating back to 2019, your business has, I think, more than doubled since then.
So I guess, as we sit here today in early 2024, how do you feel about Google's ability to drive Search RPM going forward? And I guess in the context of what Ruth said tonight about the large revenue base, just how do you feel about the monetization?",124

So the fundamental attributes don't change. I think AI gives us opportunity both on the organic side as well as on the monetization side. And I think we are in the early days of it. I think we'll be able to, taking a long-term view, serve information needs in a deeper way.

On cloud first, there's just this volatility, this material deceleration last quarter and the nice reacceleration this quarter. Is that explained by where we are in the optimization cycle, and it may be generative AI workloads starting to trickle in now and cause that growth curve to bend back up? Any commentary just on the sort of the volatility, the deceleration and the reacceleration that we've seen?
And then Philipp, I wanted to ask on the creative side, and particularly on YouTube and ads and the creative, using AI to improve the creative and really to offer SMBs who have been with Google forever but offer them now performance-based video ad campaigns created by AI. Is that kind of a new growth area? How far along are you in terms of offering this out into the market? And do you think that this opens up a new area of spend that wasn't there before?",163

On cloud, let me take that. First of all, a combination of factors. I think definitely excitement around the AI solutions on top of our foundational pillar, be it data and analytics, infrastructure, security, et cetera. But AI is definitely something which is driving interest and early adoption. And as you saw that greater than 70% of GenAI unicorns are using Google Cloud. And so I think it's an area where our strengths will continue to play out as we go through '24, especially when I look at innovation ahead from us on the AI front. And second, I think there are regional variations, but the cost optimizations in many parts are something we have mostly worked through. And I think that was a contributing factor as well.",130

YouTube's mission, you know, has enabled millions of creators around the world to share their voice and connect with audiences and obviously build thriving businesses here. And AI has been a very critical piece of this already.
You are obviously aware of the made YouTube announcement where we introduced a whole lot of new complementary creativity features on YouTube, including Dream Screen, for example, and a lot of other really interesting tools and thoughts. You can obviously imagine that we can take this more actively to the advertising world already. As you know, it continues already to power AI, a lot of our video ad solutions and measurement capabilities. It's part of video-rich campaigns. Multi-format ads are -- actually, there is a generative creator music that actually makes it easier for creators to design the perfect soundtrack already.
And as I said earlier, AI will unlock a new world of creativity. And you can see how this will -- if you just look at where models are heading, where multimodal models are heading, where the generation capabilities of those models are heading, you can absolutely see how this will impact and positively impact and simplify the flow for creators, similar to what you see already emerging in some of our core products like ACA on the Search side.",231

It was a great quarter led by strong performance from Search, YouTube, and Cloud. 
Today, I want to share how we are thinking about the business and the opportunity more broadly. Of course, that's heavily focused on AI and Search. Then I'll take you through some highlights from the quarter in Cloud, YouTube and beyond. 
Let's discuss our momentum and strategy. Taking a step back, it took Google more than 15 years to reach $100 billion in annual revenue. In just the last 6 years, we have gone from $100 billion to more than $300 billion in annual revenue. Of course, Search continues to power that as you see in our Q1 results. But in addition, we expect YouTube overall and Cloud to exit 2024 at a combined annual run rate of over $100 billion. This shows our track record of investing in and building successful new growing businesses. 
Now let's look at how well we are positioned for the next wave of AI innovation and the opportunity ahead. There are 6 points to make: one, research leadership; two, infrastructure leadership; three, innovation in Search; four, our global product footprint; five, velocity in execution; six, monetization paths. 
First, our foundation of research leadership. We've been an AI-first company since 2016, pioneering many of the modern breakthroughs that power AI progress for us and for the industry. Last week, we further consolidated teams that build AI models under Google DeepMind. This will help simplify development and establish a single access point for our product teams as they build generative AI applications with these models. The teams are making rapid progress, developing Gemini and other models. 
In February, we rolled out Gemini 1.5 Pro, which shows dramatic performance enhancements across a number of dimensions. It includes a breakthrough in long context understanding, achieving the longest context window of any large-scale foundation model yet. Combining this with Gemini's native multimodal understanding across audio, video, text code and more, it's highly capable. We are already seeing developers and enterprise customers enthusiastically embrace Gemini 1.5 and use it for a wide range of things. Beyond Gemini, we have built other useful models, including our Gemma open models as well as image and visual models and others. 
Second, infrastructure leadership. We have the best infrastructure for the AI era. Building world-leading infrastructure is in our DNA, starting in our earliest days when we had to design purpose-built hardware to power Search. Our data centers are some of the most high-performing, secure, reliable, and efficient in the world. They've been purpose-built for training cutting-edge AI models and designed to achieve unprecedented improvements in efficiency. We have developed new AI models and algorithms that are more than 100x more efficient than they were 18 months ago. 
Our custom TPUs, now in their fifth generation, are powering the next generation of ambitious AI projects. Gemini was trained on and is served using TPUs. We are committed to making the investments required to keep us at the leading edge in technical infrastructure. You can see that from the increases in our capital expenditures. This will fuel growth in Cloud, help us push the frontiers of AI models and enable innovation across our services, especially in Search. 
AI innovations in Search are the third and perhaps the most important point I want to make. We have been through technology shifts before, to the web, to mobile, and even to voice technology. Each shift expanded what people can do with Search and led to new growth. We are seeing a similar shift happening now with generative AI. For nearly a year, we've been experimenting with SGE in search labs across a wide range of queries. And now we are starting to bring AI overviews to the main Search results page. We are being measured in how we do this, focusing on areas where gen AI can improve the search experience while also prioritizing traffic to websites and merchants. 
We have already served billions of queries with our generative AI features. It's enabling people to access new information, to ask questions in new ways and to ask more complex questions. Most notably, based on our testing, we are encouraged that we are seeing an increase in search usage among people who use the new AI overviews as well as increased user satisfaction with the results. And with Circle to Search, people can now circle what they see on their Android screens, ask a question about an image or object in a video and get an AI overview with Lens. 
Fourth, our global product footprint beyond Search. We have 6 products with more than 2 billion monthly users, including 3 billion Android devices. 15 products have 0.5 billion users, and we operate across 100-plus countries. This gives us a lot of opportunities to bring helpful gen AI features and multimodal capabilities to people everywhere and improve their experiences. We have brought many new AI features to Pixel, Photos, Chrome, Messages and more. We are also pleased with the progress we are seeing with Gemini and Gemini Advanced through the Gemini app on Android and the Google app on iOS. 
Fifth, improved velocity in execution. We've been really focused on simplifying our structures to help us move faster. In addition to bringing together our model-building teams under Google DeepMind, we recently unified our ML infrastructure and ML developer teams to enable faster decisions, smarter compute allocation, and a better customer experience. 
Earlier this year, we brought our Search teams together under one leader. And last week, we took another step, bringing together our platforms and devices teams. The new combined team will focus on delivering high-quality products and experiences, bolstering the Android and Chrome ecosystems, and bringing our best innovations to partners faster. 
We also remain focused on long-term efforts to durably reengineer our cost base. You can see the impact of this work reflected in our operating margin improvement. We continue to manage our head count growth and align teams with our highest priority areas. This speeds up decision-making, reduces layers, and enables us to invest in the right areas. 
Beyond our teams, we are very focused on our cost structures, procurement and efficiency. And a number of technical breakthroughs are enhancing machine speed and efficiency, including the new family of Gemini models and a new generation of TPUs. For example, since introducing SGE about a year ago, machine costs associated with SGE responses have decreased 80% from when first introduced in Labs driven by hardware, engineering, and technical breakthroughs. We remain committed to all of this work. 
Finally, our monetization path. We have clear paths to AI monetization through Ads and Cloud as well as subscriptions. Philipp will talk more about new AI features that are helping advertisers, including bringing Gemini models into Performance Max. Our Cloud business continues to grow as we bring the best of Google AI to enterprise customers and organizations around the world. And Google One now has crossed 100 million paid subscribers, and in Q1, we introduced a new AI premium plan with Gemini Advanced. 
Okay, those are the 6 points so now let me turn to quarterly highlights from Cloud and YouTube in a bit more detail. In Cloud, we have announced more than 1,000 new products and features over the past 8 months. At Google Cloud Next, more than 300 customers and partners spoke about their generative AI successes with Google Cloud, including global brands like Bayer, Cintas, Mercedes-Benz, Walmart and many more. 
Our differentiation in Cloud begins with our AI hypercomputer, which provides efficient and cost-effective infrastructure to train and serve models. Today, more than 60% of funded gen AI start-ups and nearly 90% of gen AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers. And customers like PayPal and Kakao Brain are choosing our infrastructure. We offer an industry-leading portfolio of NVIDIA GPUs along with our TPUs. This includes TPU v5p, which is now generally available and NVIDIA's latest generation of Blackwell GPUs. We also announced Axion, our new Google design and Arm-based CPU. In benchmark testing, it has performed up to 50% better than comparable x86-based systems. 
On top of our infrastructure, we offer more than 130 models, including our own models, open source models and third-party models. We made Gemini 1.5 Pro available to customers as well as Imagine 2.0 at Cloud Next. And we shared that more than 1 million developers are now using our generative AI across tools, including AI Studio and Vertex AI. We spoke about how customers like Bristol-Myers Squibb and Etsy can quickly and easily build agents and connect them to their existing systems. For example, Discover Financial has begun deploying gen AI-driven tools to its nearly 10,000 call center agents to achieve faster resolution times for customers. Customers can also now ground their gen AI with Google Search and their own data from their enterprise databases and applications. 
In Workspace, we announced that organizations like Uber, Pepperdine University and PennyMac are using Gemini and Google Workspace, our AI-powered agent that's built right into Gmail, Docs sheets and more. We also announced Google Vids, a new application to create stories in short video format. And we introduced Gemini for Meetings and Messaging and Gemini Security for Workspace. 
Customers are choosing Workspace because they have deep trust in our powerful security and privacy features. 
Our Cloud business is now widely seen as the leader in cybersecurity. I saw this firsthand when I went to the Munich Security Conference in February. Cybersecurity analysts are using Gemini to help spot threats, summarize intelligence and take action against attacks, helping companies like American Family Insurance aggregate and analyze security data in seconds instead of days. 
Turning next to YouTube, which continues to grow and lead in streaming. We announced that on average, viewers are watching over 1 billion hours of YouTube content on TVs daily. AI experiments like Dream Screen will give anyone the ability to make AI-generated backgrounds for YouTube Shorts. And on subscriptions, which are increasingly important for YouTube, we announced that in Q1, YouTube surpassed 100 million Music and Premium subscribers globally, including trialers. And YouTube TV now has more than 8 million paid subscribers. 
Finally, in Other Bets, Waymo's fully autonomous service continues to grow ridership in San Francisco and Phoenix with high customer satisfaction, and we started offering paid rides in Los Angeles and testing rider-only trips in Austin. 
Overall, it was a great quarter, and there's more to come. IO is in less than 3 weeks, followed by Brandcast and Google Marketing Live. 
I want to thank our employees around the world who are at the heart of this progress and who continue to focus on building innovative products, helpful services and new opportunities for businesses and partners around the world. Thank you. Philipp?",1802

Google Services revenue of $70 billion were up 14% year-on-year. Search and other revenues grew 14% year-on-year led again by solid growth in the retail vertical with particular strength from APAC-based retailers, which began in the second quarter of 2023. 
YouTube Ads revenues were up 21% year-on-year driven by growth in both direct response and brand. Network revenues declined 1% year-on-year. In subscriptions, platforms and devices, year-on-year revenues increased 18%, driven again by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions. 
Let's now talk about a few highlights from the quarter from a product innovation and advertising performance perspective. 
First, it bears repeating that AI innovation across our Ads ecosystem is core to every aspect of our product portfolio, from targeting, bidding, creative, measurement, and across campaign types. We've talked about whole solutions like Smart Bidding use AI to predict future ad conversions and their value in helping businesses stay agile and responsive to rapid shifts in demand and how products like broad match leverage LLMs to match ads to relevant searches and help advertisers respond to what millions of people are searching for. This is foundational. 
As advances accelerate in our underlying AI models, our ability to help businesses find users at speed and scale and drive ROI just keeps getting better. We're especially excited about the doors gen AI is opening for creative capabilities, helping deliver on the premise of getting the right ad to the right user in the right moment. 
Look at Performance Max. In February, we rolled Gemini into PMax. It's helping curate and generate text and image assets so businesses can meet PMax asset requirements instantly. This is available to all U.S. advertisers and starting to roll out internationally in English, and early results are encouraging. Advertisers using PMax asset generation are 63% more likely to publish a campaign with good or excellent ad strength. And those who improve their PMX ad strength to excellent see 6% more conversions on average. 
We're also driving improved results for businesses opting into automatically created assets, which are supercharged with gen AI. Those adopting ACA see, on average, 5% more conversions at a similar cost per conversion in Search and Performance Max campaigns. 
And then there's Dimension. Advertisers are loving its ability to engage new and existing customers and drive purchase consideration across our most immersive and visual touch points like YouTube, Shorts, Gmail and Discover. 
Hollywood film and TV studio, Lionsgate, partnered with Horizon Media to test what campaign type will deliver the most ticketing page views for its The Hunger Games: Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes film. Over a 3-week test, demand gen was significantly more efficient versus social benchmarks with an 85% more efficient CPC and 96% more efficient cost per page view. Lionsgate has since rolled out demand gen for 2 new titles. 
We're also bringing new creative features to demand gen. Earlier this month, we announced new generative image tools to help advertisers create high-quality assets in a few steps with a few simple prompts. This will be a win for up-leveling visual storytelling and testing creative concepts more efficiently. 
And then there's obviously Search generative experience, which Sundar talked about. I laid out that innovation and the user experience on Search has historically opened up new opportunities for advertisers. We saw this when we successfully navigated from desktop to mobile. We're continuing to experiment with new ad formats, including search and shopping ads alongside search results in SGE. And we shared in March how folks are finding ads either above or below the SGE results helpful. We're excited to have a solid baseline to keep innovating on and confident in the role SGE, including Ads, will play in delighting users and expanding opportunities to meet user needs. 
Which brings me to Search and our strong performance in the first quarter. In Q1, retail was again the top contributor. Our focus remains on driving profitability and growth for retailers, helping them optimize digital performance for both online and off-line as well as innovate across our shopping and merchant experiences. 
Highlights include continued upsides for retailers, leading into agile budget and bidding strategies across Search, PMax, or both; take-home goods retailer IKEA, who leaned into Google's store sales measurement to understand its total omnichannel revenue opportunity across search. By measuring 2.3x more revenue and using value-based bidding solutions to bid to its omnichannel customers, IKEA drove a significant increase in omni revenue in Q1 and is now scaling this strategy globally. We also expanded local inventory ads into 23 countries, helping drive shopper confidence and off-line sales. Retailers can convert intent into action by showcasing in-store availability, pricing, pickup options and more all in one ad format. 
Moving to YouTube. Last quarter, I went deep into our strategy. It all starts with creation, which drives viewership, which leads to monetization. A few updates to build on Sundar's remarks. 
First, creation, which is all about giving creators the tools to create amazing content, grow their audiences and build their businesses. In 2023, more people created content on YouTube than ever before, and the number of channels uploading Shorts year-on-year grew 50%. We also hit a new milestone with 3 million-plus channels in our YouTube Partner Program. We recently shared that YPP has paid out more than any other creator monetization platform, including over $70 billion to creators, artists, and media companies over the last 3 years. 
From a viewer's perspective, watch time across YouTube continues to grow, with strength in both Shorts and CTV. According to Nielsen, YouTube has been the leader in U.S. streaming watch time for the last 12-plus months. In the first quarter, Livingroom. benefited from a combination of strong watch time growth, innovation in the user and advertiser experience, and a shift in brand advertising budgets from linear TV to YouTube. Viewers are watching YouTube because they expect to access everything in one place across screens and formats, their favorite creators, live sports, breaking use, educational content, movies, music and more. And advertisers continue to lean in to find audiences they can't find elsewhere. 
Which brings me to monetization. We're pleased with our Q1 performance across both our ad-supported and subscription offerings. Sundar covered subscription growth. On the Ads front, direct and brand were both strong this quarter. Shorts monetization continued to improve, with Shorts ads now supported on mobile, tablet, Livingroom. and desktop, and available to both performance and brand advertisers. 
In the U.S., the monetization rate of Shorts relative to in-stream viewing has more than doubled in the past 12 months, including a 10-point sequential improvement in the first quarter alone. Just last week, we introduced new ways for brands to get the most out of their Shorts ads with new lineups on YouTube Select, including sports, beauty, fashion and lifestyle, and entertainment. For YouTube advertisers, increasing brand lift is one of the core goals. In Q1, we saw strong traction from the introduction of a pause ads pilot on connected TVs, a new non-interruptive ad format that appears when users pause their organic content. Initial results show that pause ads are driving strong brand lift results and are commanding premium pricing from advertisers. 
Before I wrap, two quick highlights on how we're helping our partners transform and accelerate impact with the best across Google. 
Number one, to help McDonald's build the restaurant of the future, we're deepening our partnership across cloud and ads. Part of this includes them connecting Google Cloud's latest hardware and data technologies across restaurants globally and starting to apply Gen AI to enhance its customer and employee experiences. 
Number two, WPP. At Google Cloud Next, we announced a new collaboration that will redefine marketing through the integration of our Gemini models with WPP Open, WPP's AI-powered marketing operating system, already used by more than 35,000 of its people and adopted by key clients, including The Coca-Cola Company, L'Oreal and Nestle. We're just getting started here and excited about the innovation this partnership will unlock. 
With that, a huge thank you to our customers and partners, many of whom we're excited to see at Google Marketing Live and Brandcast in just a few weeks. And a huge thank you, as always, to our incredible teams for their agility and hard work this quarter. 
Ruth, you're up.",1384
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2024",2024-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3406.0,3097833.0,112006518.0,Presenter Speech,Ruth Porat,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Philipp. We are very pleased with our financial results for the first quarter driven, in particular, by strength in Search and Cloud as well as the ongoing efforts to durably reengineer our cost base. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. 
For the first quarter, our consolidated revenues were $80.5 billion, up 15% or up 16% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. 
In terms of total expenses, the year-on-year comparisons reflect the impact of the restructuring charges we took in the first quarter of 2023 of $2.6 billion as well as the $716 million in employee severance and related charges in the first quarter of 2024. As you can see in our earnings release, these charges were allocated across the expense lines in other cost of revenues and OpEx based on associated head count. 
To help with year-on-year comparisons, we included a table in our earnings release to adjust other cost of revenues, operating expenses, operating income, and operating margin to exclude the impact of severance and related office space charges in the first quarter of 2023 versus 2024. 
In terms of expenses, total cost of revenues was $33.7 billion, up 10%. Other cost of revenues was $20.8 billion, up 10% on a reported basis, with the increase driven primarily by content acquisition costs associated with YouTube given the very strong revenue growth in both subscription offerings and ad-supported content. On an adjusted basis, other cost of revenues were up 13% year-on-year. 
Operating expenses were $21.4 billion, down 2% on a reported basis, primarily reflecting expense decreases in sales and marketing and G&A, offset by an increase in R&D. The largest single factor in the year-on-year decline in G&A expenses was lower charges related to legal matters. 
On an adjusted basis, operating expenses were up 5%, reflecting, first, in R&D, an increase in compensation expense, primarily for Google DeepMind and Cloud; and second, in sales and marketing, a slight increase year-on-year, reflecting increases in compensation expense primarily for Cloud sales. 
Operating income was $25.5 billion, up 46% on a reported basis, and our operating margin was 32%. On an adjusted basis, operating income was up 31%, and our operating margin was 33%. Net income was $23.7 billion and EPS was $1.89. We delivered free cash flow of $16.8 billion in the first quarter and $69.1 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $108 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
Turning to segment results. Within Google Services, revenues were $70.4 billion, up 14%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $46.2 billion in the quarter were up 14% led again by growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $8.1 billion were up 21% driven by both direct response and brand advertising. Network advertising revenues of $7.4 billion were down 1%. Subscriptions, platforms and devices revenues were $8.7 billion, up 18%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube subscription revenues. 
TAC was $12.9 billion, up 10%. Google Services operating income was $27.9 billion, up 28%. And the operating margin was 40%. 
Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $9.6 billion for the quarter, up 28%, reflecting significant growth in GCP with an increasing contribution from AI and strong Google Workspace growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud delivered operating income of $900 million and an operating margin of 9%. 
As to our Other Bets, for the first quarter, revenues were $495 million, benefiting from a milestone payment in one of the Other Bets. The operating loss was $1 billion. 
Turning to our outlook for the business. With respect to Google Services, first, within Advertising, we are very pleased with the momentum of our Ads businesses. Search had broad-based strength across verticals. In YouTube, we had acceleration in revenue growth driven by brand and direct response. 
Looking ahead, two points to call out: first, results in our advertising business in Q1 continued to reflect strength in spend from APAC-based retailers, a trend that began in the second quarter of 2023 and continued through Q1, which means we will begin lapping that impact in the second quarter; second, the YouTube acceleration in revenue growth in Q1 reflects, in part, lapping the negative year-on-year growth we experienced in the first quarter of 2023. 
Turning to subscriptions, platforms, and devices. We continue to deliver significant growth in our subscriptions business, which drives the majority of revenue growth in this line. The sequential quarterly decline in year-on-year revenue growth for the line in Q1 versus Q4 reflects, in part, the fact that we had only 1 week of Sunday Ticket subscription revenue in Q1 versus 14 weeks in Q4. Looking forward, we will anniversary last year's price increase in YouTube TV starting in May. 
With regard to platforms, we are pleased with the performance in Play driven by an increase in buyers. 
With respect to Google Cloud, performance in Q1 reflects strong demand for our GCP infrastructure and solutions as well as the contribution from our Workspace productivity tools. The growth we are seeing across Cloud is underpinned by the benefit AI provides for our customers. We continue to invest aggressively while remaining focused on profitable growth. 
As we look ahead, two points that will affect sequential year-on-year revenue growth comparisons across Alphabet: first, Q1 results reflect the benefit of leap year, which contributed slightly more than 1 point to our revenue growth rate at the consolidated level in the first quarter; second, at current spot rates, we expect a larger headwind from foreign exchange in Q2 versus Q1. 
Turning to margins. Our efforts to durably reengineer our cost base are reflected in a 400 basis point expansion of our Alphabet operating margin year-on-year, excluding the impact of restructuring and severance charges in both periods. You can also see the impact in the quarter-on-quarter decline in head count in Q1, which reflects both actions we have taken over the past few months and a much slower pace of hiring. As we have discussed previously, we are continuing to invest in top engineering and technical talent, particularly in Cloud, Google DeepMind and technical infrastructure. 
Looking ahead, we remain focused on our efforts to moderate the pace of expense growth in order to create capacity for the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with the higher levels of investment in our technical infrastructure. We believe these efforts will enable us to deliver full year 2024 Alphabet operating margin expansion relative to 2023. 
With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the first quarter was $12 billion, once again driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure, with the largest component for servers followed by data centers. The significant year-on-year growth in CapEx in recent quarters reflects our confidence in the opportunities offered by AI across our business. Looking ahead, we expect quarterly CapEx throughout the year to be roughly at or above the Q1 level, keeping in mind that the timing of cash payments can cause variability in quarterly reported CapEx. With regard to Other Bets, we similarly have work streams underway to enhance overall returns. 
Finally, as I trust you saw in the press release, we are very pleased to be adding a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share to our capital return program as well as a new $70 billion authorization in share repurchases. The core of our capital allocation framework remains the same, beginning with investing aggressively in our business as you have heard us talk about today. Given the extraordinary opportunities ahead, we view the introduction of the dividend as further strengthening our overall capital return program. 
Thank you. Sundar, Philipp, and I will now take your questions.",1304

The first one, I wanted to ask about overall search behavior. Philipp, I know you talked in the past about how overall query trends continue to grow. Can I ask you to drill a little bit more into monetizable and commercial query trends? Has there been any changes in sort of your commercial query trends growth. There's just been all these new entrants moving around in e-commerce. That is my first one.
Then the second one for Ruth, when you talked about sort of more efforts to moderate expense growth from here, can you just sort of give us some examples of areas where you still see the potential for more optimization or work streams in place to continue to durably reengineer the OpEx base as we go throughout 2024.",133
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2024",2024-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3406.0,3097833.0,112006521.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,7,"Thanks, Brian. To your first question, look, I think broadly, we've always found that over many years, when things work well on the organic side, monetization follows. So typically, the trends we see carry over well. Overall, I think with generative AI in Search, with our AI overviews, I think we will expand the type of queries we can serve our users. We can answer more complex questions as well as, in general, that all seems to carry over across query categories. Obviously, it's still early, and we are going to be measured and put user experience at the front, but we are positive about what this transition means.",109

And I made this point in opening comments, but we are very cognizant of the increasing headwind we have from higher depreciation and expenses associated with the higher CapEx, and so these efforts are ongoing. And they're very much the same that we've talked with you about previously. It starts with product and process prioritization, all of the work around organizational efficiency and structure. These are ongoing. 
And so as an example, the work that Sundar talked about, combining devices and services with our platforms and ecosystems, product area is a really good example because unifying the teams not only helps us deliver higher-quality products and experiences, but we think it enables us to move with greater velocity and efficiency.
And then the other work streams we've talked to you about in the past, like all of the work around technical infrastructure, which Sundar alluded to; streamlining operations within the company through the use of AI; what we're doing with procurement with our suppliers and vendors, which he also referenced; the work you've seen on real estate optimization, these are all ongoing work streams, which is why we have them under the umbrella, durably reengineering our cost base, and they are ongoing.",243

Can you just talk about what kind of queries or scenarios do you think that that's working best for so far? And just how we should think about the cadence of continuing to adopt more of those features within core search. 
And then Ruth, on CapEx spending, the $12 billion in 1Q, can we assume that run rating that and above is reasonable for this year? And I know it's very early, but should we generally expect higher CapEx next year as well?",97

On SGE in Search, we are seeing early confirmation of our thesis that this will expand the universe of queries where we are able to really provide people with a mix of actual answers linked to sources across the Web and bring a variety of perspectives, all in an innovative way. And we've been rolling out AI overviews in the U.S. and the U.K., trying to mainly tackle queries which are more complex, where we think SGE will clearly improve the experience. We've already served billions of queries and it seems to cut across categories, but we are still continuing our testing. And we are metrics-driven in these areas. But I am optimistic that it clearly improves the user experience. Users are telling us that. And we are seeing it in our metrics, and we'll continue evolving it through the course of this year.",146

As I said, you can always have variability in the reported quarterly CapEx just due to the timing of cash payments, but roughly at or above this level. And it really goes to Sundar's opening comment that we're very committed to making the investments required to keep us at the leading edge in technical infrastructure to support the growth in Cloud, all the innovation in Search that he and Philipp has spoken about and our lead with Gemini.
I will note that nearly all of the CapEx was in our technical infrastructure. We expect that our investment in office facilities will be about less than 10% of the total CapEx in 2024, roughly flat with our CapEx in 2023, but is still there. And then with respect to 2025, as you said, it's premature to comment so nothing to add on that.",179

Sundar, if we come back to your earlier comments at the beginning of the call and framing up longer-term initiatives and longer-term narratives, I wanted to know if you could talk a little bit about both the opportunities and the challenges of operating at scale in a time like this where there's a lot of technology innovation going on and how you see the elements of trying to strike a balance towards moving the organization forward while still continuing to both invest for growth as well as balance margins.",100

Great question. Obviously, I think the AI transition, I think it's a once-in-a-generation kind of an opportunity. We've definitely been gearing up for this for a long time. You can imagine we started building TPUs in 2016, so we've definitely been gearing up for a long time. The real opportunities we see is the scale of research and innovation, which we have built up and are going to continue to deliver. I think for the first time, we can work on AI in a horizontal way and it impacts the entire breadth of the company, be it Search, be it YouTube, be it Cloud, be it Waymo and so on. And we see a rapid pace of innovation in that underlying. So it's a very leveraged way to do it, and I see that as a real opportunity ahead. 
In terms of the challenges, I think it's been a mindset shift, which we've been driving across the company to make sure that we are embracing this opportunity but being very efficient in how we are approaching it, making sure we are redirecting our people to the highest priorities across the company, building on our 20 years of experience in driving machine efficiencies year-on-year so that we can put our dollars to work as efficiently as possible. So making sure balancing all of that moving forward in a very bold and responsible way at the same time. Those are the important things to get right from my perspective.",249

And you've given us an update on monetization pickup sequentially. But with that in mind, I think YouTube has launched an array of ad products and automation tools to help advertisers transfer what they're doing to the vertical screen. So how is this translating into buy-in among your advertiser clients?
And secondly, based on what you've seen over the last 2 years, are there any structural reasons that you can cite as to why the monetization cannot match what is already the case on the horizontal screen?",103
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2024",2024-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3406.0,3097833.0,112006532.0,Answer,Philipp Schindler,,Executives,18,"Yes. Look, this is a great question, first of all. I mean, let's start with the fact that YouTube performance was very strong in this quarter. And on Shorts specifically in the U.S., I mentioned how the monetization rate of Shorts relative to in-stream viewing has more than doubled in the last 12 months. I think that's what you were referring to. And yes, we're obviously very happy with this development.
The way to think about it is advertisers really only spend with us when they see a positive ROI. So you can assume that this wouldn't be happening unless it were to work for advertisers in the short term and also in the long term. That's an important part, I think. 
Overall, Shorts is a long-term bet for the business. It has really helped us respond to both creator and viewer demand for short-form video. We talked about the strong growth, averaging 70 billion daily views. I mentioned the number of channels uploading has increased 50% year-over-year, so again, very happy with us development. And to your question, structural reasons, whether we can't get to a match here, I have a hard time seeing those at the moment over time.",201

It seems to be your biggest investment area. Just first, you saw the big uptick the last 2 quarters, but you've been investing in AI for years. Is the uptick because supply is getting easier to get? Or do you see more opportunities with the available supply to really fuel AI? So has the GPUs and everything gotten better that you feel more, investing more? And then thinking about the returns, both for Advertising and Cloud on the CapEx, do you feel like this is a higher cost of doing business? Or do you think this is an opportunity to even get better returns on your capital spend than you've had in the past?",123
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2024",2024-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3406.0,3097833.0,112006535.0,Answer,Ruth Porat,,Executives,21,"So the increase in CapEx, as Sundar said and I said, really reflects the opportunity we continue to see across the company. It starts with all that we're doing in support of the Gemini foundational model but then also, clearly, the work across Cloud, on behalf of Cloud customers, and the growth that we're seeing with GCP and the infrastructure work there, and then, of course, as both Sundar and Philipp talked about the application across Search, YouTube and, more broadly, the services that we're able to offer. So it's the growing application and our focus on ensuring that we have the compute capacity to deliver in support of the services and opportunities we see across Alphabet. 
And it really goes to the second part of your question, which is that as we're investing in CapEx and applying it across our various businesses, it opens up more services and products, which bring revenue opportunities. And we're very focused on the monetization opportunity. It does underlie everything that we're doing in Google Services and Google Cloud. And as Sundar noted, we're, at the same time, very focused on the efficiency of all elements of delivering that compute capacity from hardware, software and beyond.",202

A couple of questions. One, just maybe an expansion on the Search, query questions on before, more like Search volume, and maybe in the context of the off-Google environment like AI chat bot, for example, we've seen kind of Meta AI directing to Google Search results. Do you think there's actually a scenario where like AI system can create a step function change in Search volume or use cases of Google? If you can give us more color on what are you seeing right now or what are you expecting to see in that area.
And then the second question on just the comment of YouTube and Cloud exiting at $100 billion run rate. What is informing this outlook or visibility for you? If you can talk about, is it driven by any sort of Cloud demand inflection or step change in the gen AI workload demand, if you can flesh it out a little bit?",163

And I think it allows us to evolve our product in a profound way. And Search is a unique experience. People come, be it if you want answers, if you want to explore more, if you want to get perspectives from across the web, and to be able to do it across the breadth and depth of everything they are looking for and the innovation you would need to keep that up, I think it's what we've been building on for a long time. And so I feel we are extraordinarily well set up, particularly given the innovation path we are on. And overall, I view this moment as a positive moment. So that's how I would say it.

And so what we were really getting at in that comment, what Sundar was getting at, is that we've continued to build strong businesses over time, and that just helps dimension it. We had similar comments last quarter when you talk about our subscription business. We're really proud of all the work that the teams are doing across the company, building new, strong opportunities, delivering for our users, for customers, for advertisers in profound ways. And so it was just helping to dimension what we have built over the years.",121

First on GCP, you had nice acceleration in the quarter. Could you talk a little bit about the opportunities and constraints upon GCP's ability to continue to address that large addressable market and accelerate growth? Is it more sales-oriented? Is it more product sales solutions or both? And do you plan to address most of these organically? Or could a partner approach work for you?
And then the second one, just more detail on YouTube and sports rights. Could you reiterate your view on further live sports rights? There's some larger, mostly in the U.S., league rights coming up soon and will be more over the next several years. Could you just talk about your philosophy there beyond NFL Sunday Ticket?",125
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2024",2024-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3406.0,3097833.0,112006545.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,31,"Look, on the Cloud side, obviously, it's definitely a point of inflection overall. I think the AI transformation is making everyone think about their whole stack, and we are engaged in a number of conversations. I think paid AI infrastructure, people are really looking to Vertex AI, given our depth and breadth of model choice, or using Workspace to transform productivity in your workplace, et cetera. So I think the opportunities there are all related to that, both all the work we've built up and AI being a point of inflection in terms of driving conversations. I think you'll see us do it both organically and with a strong partner program as well. So we'll do it with a combination. 
And the challenges here, always, there are switching costs to Cloud and the challenges we see is how do we make it easier for people. There's a lot of interest, but there's definitely barriers in terms of people switching. And so that's an area where we are constantly investing to make it easier for our customers.",176

So you guys are powering all these new AI interactions and searches on Pixel and on Samsung devices. And I think there's speculation that Gemini might be used on iOS in a future state. So the question is, as users start searching on smartphones and those searches are basically rendered on the model, on the phone, without accessing the web, how do you guys anticipate monetizing some of these smartphone-based behaviors that are kind of run on the edge? Any thoughts on that?",92

So I think there will be a set of use cases which you will be able to do on device. But for a lot of what people are looking to do, I think you will need the richness of the cloud, the Web and you have to deliver it to users. So again, to my earlier comments, I think through all these moments, you saw what we have done with Samsung with Circle to Search. I think it gives a new way for people to access Search conveniently wherever they are. And so we view this as a positive way to bring our services to users in a more seamless manner. So I think it's positive from that perspective. 
In terms of on-device versus cloud, there will be needs which can be done on-device and we should to help it from a privacy standpoint. But there are many, many things for which people will need to reach out to the cloud. And so I don't see that as being a big driver in the on-cloud versus off-cloud in any way.",205

I guess I'm wondering, along with some of those changes in behavior, is there a way to quantify that overall engagement shift, whether that's an increase in time spent or the level of increase in queries for both sort of traditional search as well as more generative answers.
And then secondly, on the hardware road map, I assume later this year, we'll hear more about some of the products. But any areas of particular focus or that you would point out that we should keep in mind in terms of hardware launches in the back half?",112

And we've been in live experiments just for a few weeks in U.S. and U.K. on a slice of our queries, and all indications are positive that it improves user satisfaction. We see an increase in engagement, but I see this as something which will play out over time.
But if you were to step back at this moment, there were a lot of questions last year, and we always felt confident and comfortable that we would be able to improve the user experience. People question whether these things would be costly to serve, and we are very, very confident we can manage the cost of how to serve these queries. People worried about latency. When I look at the progress we have made in latency and efficiency, we feel comfortable. There are questions about monetization. And based on our testing so far, I'm comfortable and confident that we'll be able to manage the monetization transition here well as well. It will play out over time, but I feel we are well positioned. And more importantly, when I look at the innovation that's ahead and the way the teams are working hard on it, I am very excited about the future ahead.",222

I'm really pleased with our results this quarter. They showed tremendous ongoing momentum in Search and great progress in cloud with our AI initiatives driving new growth. Search had another excellent quarter. And in terms of product innovation, we are seeing great progress with AI Overviews. 
In Q2, cloud reached some major milestones. Quarterly revenues crossed the $10 billion mark for the first time, at the same time passed the $1 billion mark in quarterly operating profit. Year-to-date, our AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for cloud customers have already generated billions in revenues and are being used by more than 2 million developers. 
As I spoke about last quarter, we are uniquely well positioned for the AI opportunity ahead. Our research and infrastructure leadership means we can pursue an in-house strategy that enables our product teams to move quickly. Combined with our model building expertise, we are in a strong position to control our destiny as the technology continues to evolve. Importantly, we are innovating at every layer of the AI stack, from chips to agents and beyond, a huge strength. 
We are committed to this leadership long term. This was underscored by the announcements we made at I/O, Cloud Next and Google Marketing Live, and we'll touch on many of them here. Today, I'll start with Search, then move to our AI momentum more generally, followed by cloud, YouTube and some closing thoughts.
Let's dive in. Over the past 25 years, we have continued to reimagine and expand Google Search across many technological shifts. With AI, we are delivering better responses on more types of search queries and introducing new ways to search. We are pleased to see the positive trends from our testing continue as we roll out AI Overviews, including increases in Search usage and increased user satisfaction with the results. 
People who are looking for help with complex topics are engaging more and keep coming back for AI Overviews. And we see even higher engagement from younger users aged 18 to 24 when they use Search with AI Overviews. As we have said, we are continuing to prioritize approaches that send traffic to sites across the web. And we are seeing that ads appearing either above or below AI Overviews continue to provide valuable options for people to take action and connect with businesses. 
Beyond AI Overviews, AI expands the types of queries we are able to address and opens a powerful new ways to Search. Visual search via Lens is one. Soon, you'll be able to ask questions by taking a video with Lens. And already, we have seen that AI Overviews in Lens leads to an increase in overall visual search usage. Another example is Circle to Search, which is available today on more than 100 million Android devices. 
We are seeing tremendous momentum from our AI investments. More than 1.5 million developers are now using Gemini across our developer tools, and we recently unveiled new models that are more capable and efficient than ever. Gemini now comes in 4 sizes with each model designed for its own set of use cases. It's a versatile model family that runs efficiently on everything from data centers to devices. 
At 2 million tokens, we offer the longest context window of any large-scale foundation model to date, which powers developer use cases that no other model can handle. Gemini is making Google's own products better. All 6 of our products with more than 2 billion monthly users now use Gemini. This means that Google is the company that's truly bringing AI to everyone. Gemini is powering incredibly helpful features in Search, Workspace, Google Messages and more. At I/O, we showed new features coming soon to Gmail and to Google Photos. Soon, you'll be able to ask Photos questions like, what did I eat at that restaurant in Paris last year? 
For a glimpse of the future, I hope you saw Project Astra at I/O. It shows multimodal understanding and natural conversational capabilities. We've always wanted to build a universal agent, and it's an early look at how they can be helpful in daily life. Our AI product advances come from our long-standing foundation of research leadership as well as our global network of infrastructure. 
In Q2, we announced our first data center and cloud region in Malaysia and expansion projects in Iowa, Virginia and Ohio. Our TPUs are a key bet here, too. Trillium is the sixth generation of our custom AI accelerator, and it's our best-performing and most energy-efficient TPU to date. It achieves a near 5x increase in peak compute performance per chip and a 67% more energy efficient compared to TPU v5e. And the latest NVIDIA Blackwell platform will be coming to Google Cloud in early 2025. We continue to invest in designing and building robust and efficient infrastructure to support our efforts in AI given the many opportunities we see ahead. 
Of course, as we do this, we'll continue to create capacity by allocating resources towards our highest priorities. We are relentlessly driving efficiencies in our AI models. For example, over the past quarter, we have made quality improvements that include doubling the core model size for AI Overviews while at the same time improving latency and keeping cost per AI Overviews served flat. And we are focused on matching the right model size to the complexity of the query in order to minimize impact on cost and latency. 
Separately on our real estate investments, we are taking a measured approach to match the current and future needs of our hybrid workforce as well as our local communities. 
Next, Google Cloud. We continue to see strong customer interest, winning leading brands like Hitachi, Motorola Mobility and KPMG. Our deep partnership with Oracle significantly expanded our joint offerings to their large customer base. Our momentum begins with our AI infrastructure, which provides AI start-ups like Essential AI with leading cost performance for models and high-performance computing applications. 
We continue to drive fundamental differentiation with new advances since Cloud Next. This includes Trillium, which I mentioned earlier, an A3 Mega powered by NVIDIA H100 GPUs, which doubles the networking bandwidth of A3. 
Our enterprise AI platform, Vertex, helps customers such as Deutsche Bank, Kingfisher and the U.S. Air Force build powerful AI agents. Last month, we announced a number of new advances. Uber and WPP are using Gemini Pro 1.5 and Gemini Flash 1.5 in areas like customer experience and marketing. We broadened support for third-party models including Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet and open-source models like Gemma 2, Llama and Mistral. We are the only cloud provider to offer grounding with Google Search, and we are expanding grounding capabilities with Moody's, MSCI, ZoomInfo and more. 
Our AI-powered applications portfolio is helping us win new customers and drive upsell. For example, our conversational AI platform is helping customers like Best Buy and Gordon Food Service. Gemini for Workspace helps Click Therapeutics analyze patient feedback as they build targeted digital treatments. Our AI-powered agents are also helping customers develop better-quality software, find insights from their data and protect their organization against cybersecurity threats using Gemini. Software engineers at Wipro are using Gemini Code Assist to develop, test and document software faster. And data analysts at Mercado Libre are using BigQuery and Looker to optimize capacity planning and fulfill shipments faster. 
Cybersecurity risks continue to accelerate, and the number of breaches continue to grow, something we all see in the news every day and that our Mandiant teams help manage. Our strong track record of uptime, quality control and reliability make Google Cloud the trusted security choice for organizations like Fiserv and Marriott International. In Q2, we infused AI throughout our security portfolio, helping TELUS strengthen its proactive security posture.
Turning next to YouTube. YouTube is focused on a clear strategy, connecting creators with a massive audience and enabling them to build successful businesses through ads and subscriptions while helping advertisers reach their desired audience. We had a great brand cast this quarter, and Philipp will say more. I'm pleased with the progress here. YouTube has remained #1 in the U.S. streaming watch time according to Nielsen. Views of YouTube Shorts and Connected TVs more than doubled last year, and we are making it easier for creators to add captions and turn regular videos into Shorts. 
Next, on Android and Pixel. We joined Samsung for their Galaxy Unpacked event a few weeks ago, and we shared that Samsung's new devices will include the latest AI-powered Google updates on Android. It was a great event. I'm looking forward to our Made by Google event happening in August. We'll have lots to share around Android and the Pixel portfolio of devices. Our Pixel line is doing well. We recently introduced a new Pixel 8a powered by our latest Google Tensor G3 chip. It provides beautiful AI experiences like Circle to Search, Best Take and a Gemini-powered AI assistant. 
In Other Bets, I'm really pleased with the progress  Waymo is making, a real leader in space and getting rave reviews from users. Waymo served more than 2 million trips to date and driven more than 20 million fully autonomous miles on public roads. Waymo is now delivering well over 50,000 weekly paid public rides, primarily in San Francisco and Phoenix. And in June, we removed the wait list in San Francisco, so anyone can take a ride. Fully autonomous testing is underway in other Bay Area locations without a human in the driver seat. 
Before I close, I want to acknowledge that today is Ruth's final earnings call. Let me take a moment to thank her for all she has done for Google and Alphabet as our longest-serving CFO. I'm excited to continue to work with her in her new role. And I look forward to welcoming our newly appointed CFO, Anat Ashkenazi. She starts next week, and you'll hear from her on our call next quarter. 
Thanks, as always, to our employees and partners everywhere for a great Q2. With that, over to you, Philipp.",1682

Starting with performance, Google Services delivered revenues of $73.9 billion for the quarter, up 12% year-on-year. Search and other revenues grew 14% year-on-year, led by growth in the retail vertical followed by financial services. YouTube ads revenues were up 13% year-on-year, driven by growth in brand as well as direct response. Network revenues declined 5% year-on-year. In subscriptions, platforms and devices, year-on-year revenues increased 14%, driven again by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions. 
For the rest of my remarks, I want to double-click on 2 topics: first, how we are applying AI across the marketing process to deliver an even stronger ads experience; second, YouTube's position as the leading multiformat platform. So let me start by sharing some of the ways we're applying AI to bring more performance benefits to even more businesses. 
Q2 brought several major opportunities to meet and learn from users, developers, creators and customers. From I/O to Brandcast, Google Marketing Live and [ Cannes ], a growing number of our customers and partners are looking to understand how to successfully incorporate AI into their businesses. This quarter, we announced over 30 new ads features and products to help advertisers leverage AI and keep pace with the evolving expectations of customers and users. Across Search, PMax, Demand Gen and retail, we're applying AI to streamline workflows, enhance creative asset production and provide more engaging experiences for consumers. 
Listening to our customers, retailers in particular have welcomed AI-powered features to help scale the depth and breadth of their assets. For example, as part of the new and easier-to-use Merchant Center, we've expanded Product Studio with tools that bring the power of Google AI to every business owner. You can upload a product image from the AI with something like feature this product with Paris skyline in the background, and Product Studio will generate campaign-ready assets. 
I also hear great feedback from our customers on many of our other new AI-powered features. We're beta testing virtual try-on and shopping ads and plan to roll it out widely later this year. Feedback shows this feature gets 60% more high-quality views than other images and higher click out to retailer sites. Retailers love it because it drives purchasing decisions and fewer returns. 
Our AI-driven profit optimization tools have been expanded to Performance Max and standard shopping campaigns. Advertisers who use profit optimization and Smart Bidding see a 15% uplift in profit on average compared to revenue-only bidding. 
Lastly, Demand Gen is rolling out to Display & Video 360 and Search Ads 360 in the coming months with new generative image tools that create stunning, high-quality image assets for social marketers. As we said at GML, when paired with Search or PMax, Demand Gen delivers an average of 14% more conversions. 
The use cases we're seeing across the industry show the incredible potential of these AI-enabled products to improve performance. Let me briefly share 2 examples with you. Luxury jewelry retailer Tiffany leveraged Demand Gen during the holiday season and saw a 2.5% brand lift in consideration and actions such as adding items to carts and booking appointments. The campaign drove a 5.6x more efficient cost per click compared to social media benchmarks. Our own Google marketing team used Demand Gen to create nearly 4,500 ad variations for Pixel 8 campaign shown across YouTube, Discover and Gmail, delivering twice the clicks per rate at nearly 1/4 of the cost. 
In addition to strengthening our ads products for customers, we continue to evolve our existing systems and products with improved models delivering further performance gains. In just 6 months, AI-driven improvements to quality, relevance and language understanding have improved broad match performance by 10% for advertisers using Smart Bidding. Also, advertisers who adopt PMax to broad match and Smart Bidding in their Search campaigns see an average increase of over 25% more conversions of value at a similar cost.
We'll continue to listen to our customers and use their feedback to drive innovation across our products. And as you can hear, I continue to be excited about the AI era for ads. 
Now let's turn to YouTube. I've talked before about our approach to making YouTube the best place to create, watch and monetize. First, the best place to create. What sets YouTube apart from every other platform are the creators and the connection they have with their fans. Audience is tuning in to watch their favorite creators continue to grow. For example, 2 weeks ago, MrBeast's channel hit more than 300 million subscribers. 
Next, the best place to watch. Our long-term investment in CTV continues to deliver. Views on CTV have increased more than 130% in the last 3 years. According to Nielsen, YouTube is the #1 most watched streaming platform on TV screens in the U.S. for the 17th consecutive month. Zooming out, when you look not just at streaming but at all media companies and their combined TV viewership, YouTube is the second most watched after Disney. And this growth is happening in multiple verticals, including sports, which has seen CTV watch time on YouTube grow 30% year-over-year. 
Lastly, the best place to monetize. CTV on YouTube is continuing to benefit from a combination of strong watch time growth, viewer and advertiser innovation and a shift in brand advertising budgets from linear TV to YouTube. Our largest advertisers across verticals, including retail, entertainment, telco and home and personal care, are partnering with creators on ads and organic integrations. 
Verizon, for example, worked with a YouTube creator and Verizon customer to show the many ways that plans and offerings can be customized to fit people's lives. Using AI-powered formats, they created sketches in multiple lengths and orientations to serve the right creative to the right viewer and drive people to their site. Verizon's creator ads had a 15% lower CPA and a 38% higher conversion rate versus other ads.
Turning to Shorts. Last quarter, I shared that in the U.S., the monetization rate of YouTube Shorts relative to in-stream viewing is showing a healthy rate of growth. Again, this quarter, we continue to see an improvement in Shorts monetization, particularly in the U.S. We're also seeing a very encouraging contribution from brand advertising on Shorts, which we launched on the product in Q4 last year.
Lastly, a few words on Shopping. Last year, viewers watched 30 billion hours of Shopping-related videos, and we saw a 25% increase in watch time for videos that help people shop. While it's early days, Shopping remains a key area of investment. At GML, we rolled out several product updates to YouTube Shopping, helping creators sell products to their viewers. These updates included product tagging where creators can tag products in their videos for viewers to discover and purchase, product collections and a new affiliate hub, a one-stop shop for creators to find deals and promotional offers from brands and track their affiliate earnings. 
With that, I'll finish by saying a huge thank you to Googlers everywhere for their extraordinary commitment and to our customers and partners for their continued collaboration and trust. And Ruth, thanks for your amazing leadership and partnership over all these years. 
Now for one last time, it's over to you.",1204
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2024",2024-07-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3413.0,3193335.0,113919432.0,Presenter Speech,Ruth Porat,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Philipp, and thanks, Sundar, for those kind words. We had another strong quarter, driven in particular by performance in Search and Cloud as well as the ongoing efforts to durably reengineer our cost base. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. 
For the second quarter, our consolidated revenues were $84.7 billion, up 14% or up 15% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. In terms of expenses, total cost of revenues was $35.5 billion, up 11%. Other cost of revenues was $22.1 billion, up 14%, with the increase driven primarily by content acquisition costs, followed by depreciation as well as the impact of the Canadian Digital Services Tax, which was applied retroactively.
Operating expenses were $21.8 billion, up 5%, primarily reflecting an increase in R&D partially offset by a decline in G&A with sales and marketing essentially flat to the second quarter last year. The increase in R&D was driven primarily by compensation, which was affected by lapping a reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities in certain Other Bets in the second quarter last year followed by depreciation. The largest single factor in the year-on-year decline in G&A expenses was lower charges related to legal matters. 
Operating income was $27.4 billion, up 26%, and our operating margin was 32%. Net income was $23.6 billion and EPS was $1.89. We delivered free cash flow of $13.5 billion in the second quarter and $60.8 billion for the trailing 12 months. As a reminder, last year, we had a timing benefit in the second and third quarters from a $10.5 billion deferred cash tax payment made in the fourth quarter, which depressed reported free cash flow growth this quarter and will do so again next quarter. We ended the quarter with $101 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
Turning to segment results. Within Google Services, revenues were $73.9 billion, up 12%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $48.5 billion in the quarter were up 14%, led again by growth in retail followed by the financial services vertical. YouTube advertising revenues of $8.7 billion were up 13%, driven by brand followed by direct response advertising. Network advertising revenues of $7.4 billion were down 5%. Subscription platforms and devices revenues were $9.3 billion, up 14%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube subscription revenues. TAC was $13.4 billion, up 7%. Google Services operating income was $29.7 billion, up 27%, and the operating margin was 40%.
Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $10.3 billion for the quarter, up 29%, reflecting, first, significant growth in GCP, which was above growth for Cloud overall and includes an increasing contribution from AI; and second, strong Google Workspace growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud delivered operating income of $1.2 billion and an operating margin of 11%. As to our Other Bets for the second quarter, revenues were $365 million and the operating loss was $1.1 billion.
Turning to our outlook for the business. With respect to Google Services, first, within advertising. The strong performance of Search was broad based across verticals. In YouTube, we are pleased with the growth in the quarter. We had healthy watch time growth, continued to close the monetization gap in Shorts and had continued momentum in Connected TV with brand benefiting in part from an ongoing shift in budgets from linear television to digital. As we look forward to the third quarter, we will be lapping the increasing strength in advertising revenues in the second half of 2023, in part from APAC-based retailers. 
Turning to subscriptions, platforms and devices. First, we continue to have significant growth in our subscriptions business, which drives the majority of revenue growth in this line. However, there was a sequential decline in the year-on-year growth rate as we anniversaried the impact of a price increase for YouTube TV in the second quarter last year. The impact will persist through the balance of the year. Second, with regard to platforms, we are pleased with the performance in Play driven by an increase in buyers. Finally, with respect to devices, the most important point as we look forward is that our Made by Google launches have been pulled forward into the third quarter from the fourth quarter last year, benefiting revenues in Q3 this year. 
Turning to Cloud, which continued to deliver very strong results. For the first time, Cloud crossed $10 billion in quarterly revenues and $1 billion in quarterly operating profit. As Sundar noted, year-to-date, our AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for cloud customers have already generated billions in revenues and are being used by more than 2 million developers. We're particularly encouraged that the majority of our top 100 customers are already using our generative AI solutions. We continue to invest aggressively in the business. 
Turning to margins. The margin expansion in Q2 versus last year reflects our ongoing efforts to durably reengineer our cost base as well as revenue strength. Our leadership team remains focused on our efforts to moderate the pace of expense growth in order to create capacity for the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with the higher levels of investment in our technical infrastructure. 
Once again, headcount declined quarter-on-quarter, which reflects both actions we have taken in the first half of the year and a much slower pace of hiring. Looking ahead, we expect a slight increase in headcount in the third quarter as we bring on new graduates. As we have discussed previously, we are continuing to invest in top engineering and technical talent, particularly in cloud and technical infrastructure. 
Looking forward, we continue to expect to deliver full year 2024 Alphabet operating margin expansion relative to 2023. However, in the third quarter, operating margins will reflect the impact of both the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with the higher levels of investment in our technical infrastructure as well as the increase in cost of revenues due to the pull forward of hardware launches into Q3. 
With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the second quarter was $13 billion, once again, driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure with the largest component for servers followed by data centers. Looking ahead, we continue to expect quarterly CapEx throughout the year to be roughly at or above the Q1 CapEx of $12 billion, keeping in mind that the timing of cash payments can cause variability in quarterly reported CapEx. 
With regard to Other Bets, we continue to focus on improving overall efficiencies as we invest for long-term returns. Waymo is an important example of this with its technical leadership coupled with progress on operational performance. As you will see in the 10-Q, we have chosen to commit to a new multiyear investment of $5 billion. This new round of funding, which is consistent with recent annual investment levels, will enable Waymo to continue to build the world's leading autonomous driving technology company. 
To close, this is my 56th and last earnings call, 37 of them at Alphabet. So I have a few closing thoughts of gratitude. I've been so proud to be at Google and Alphabet as CFO and to work with some of the smartest people in the world every day. I think we have accomplished a lot in the last 9-plus years, and I am confident that progress will continue. Of course, I'm not going far, and I'm honored to have my new role, which I've been slowly working my way into during the past 11 months. And I look forward to continuing to work with Sundar and our great team. 
Being CFO of one of the most important companies in the world has been the opportunity and responsibility of a lifetime. Google's mission of advancing technology and bringing information to people throughout the world is as relevant today as it was when I worked on its IPO. Technology has been a catalyst for economic growth throughout human history. The people on this call know that if a technological advancement is not the focus of every business and government, they will be left behind. Underpinning this is the need for sound and responsible investment. That has never been more important than today, and certainly, that is Google and Alphabet's focus.
I want to end by thanking Googlers around the world for the innovation and commitment that has enabled us to deliver such extraordinary products and services globally. I also want to thank our investors and analysts for your long-term support and your feedback. Thank you.

The first one, it's a little bit of a jump, I guess, for Sundar, Philipp or Ruth. I guess we're sort of 18 months, this fever pitch around a gen AI focus in the world. Maybe from any of your perspective, can you just sort of talk to us about areas where you've seen faster-than-expected traction or testing adoption of some of the AI, generative AI capabilities versus slower-than-expected traction and testing from a Google perspective? And then, Ruth, I appreciate all the comments about structurally reengineering the OpEx base. Are there any more tangible examples of areas you can talk to us about where you still see further ways to drive more efficiency across the company?",132

I'll take the first part. I think it's a good question. Obviously, I think there is a time curve in terms of taking the underlying technology and translating it into meaningful solutions across the board, both on the consumer and the enterprise side. Definitely, on the consumer side, I'm pleased, as I said in my comments earlier, in terms of how for a product like Search, which is used at that scale over many decades, how we've been able to introduce it in a way that it's additive and enhances overall experience and this positively contributing there. 
I think across our consumer products, we've been able -- I think we are seeing progress on the organic side. Obviously, monetization is something that we would have to earn on top of it. The enterprise side, I think we are at a stage where definitely there are a lot of models. I think roughly, the models are all kind of converging towards a set of base capabilities. But I think where the next wave is working to build solutions on top of it. And I think there are pockets, be it coding, be it in customer service, et cetera, where we are seeing some of those use cases are seeing traction, but I still think there is hard work there to completely unlock those.",224

Look, the reason we've consistently used the term, the phrase that we're focused on durably reengineering our cost base is because these are deep work streams. They're not tactical fixes, and we continue to build on them. And so the main areas that we've talked about are around product and process prioritization, around organizational efficiency and structure. Both of those are reflected in the headcount and the fact that headcount is down year-on-year. And across all of those -- as I said, across our entire leadership team, we remain focused on continuing to execute against them. 
So in terms of the most recent examples, as we talked about last quarter with the combination of the devices and services product area with the platforms and ecosystems product area. We announced that back in April. And what we discussed last quarter and what we're seeing is that unifying teams across these organizations helps with product execution, and what we're really focused on is really adding to velocity and efficiency. So kind of the gift that keeps giving. 
And then more broadly, all of the work streams that we've talked to you about before, we continue to remain focused on. A big one, very important one, is all of the efficiency efforts, the work streams around technical infrastructure and improving efficiency there. We're also working on the use of AI across Alphabet. We're working on continuing to build on what we've done with our centralized procurement organization. We're continuing to optimize our real estate portfolio. And so again, this is across our leadership team. These are efforts that all build to this phrase, durably reengineering our cost base.",287

Ruth, you've now had Google Services operating margins roughly 40% for the past 2 quarters. Just as you create more capacity to help offset the future investments, is it reasonable to think that you could sustain at those kind of levels going forward? And then, Sundar, just as it relates to AI Overviews, you talked about the positive trends there. Can you just help us understand where you are, how far along in rolling out AI Overviews and then any more color around kind of click-through rates and monetization levels relative to your traditional searches?",102
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2024",2024-07-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3413.0,3193335.0,113919439.0,Answer,Ruth Porat,,Executives,11,"So in terms of the Google Services operating margin, it did reflect all the work that we're doing on durably reengineering the cost base. It also reflected the benefit of strong revenue performance in Search. And so what I tried to lay out in the comments as we look forward to the third quarter is operating margins will reflect the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with higher levels of our investment in technical infrastructure. It will also reflect higher expenses associated with the Pixel launch due to the pull forward. So those are important factors. I would say overall, company-wide, it's important to note that we do expect to continue to deliver full year '24 Alphabet operating margin expansion relative to 2023, but I did want to highlight those important points as we look forward to Q3.",138

Look, innovation and improvements to the user experience on Search have historically opened up new opportunities for advertisers. We talked about this before. We saw this when we navigated from desktop to mobile, for example. And we can see gen AI obviously expand the types of questions we can help people with, as Sundar mentioned. And as we said before, people are finding ads, either above or below AI Overviews, helpful. We have a solid baseline here from which we can innovate. And as you have probably noticed at GML, we announced that soon we'll actually start testing search and shopping ads in AI Overviews for users in the U.S., and they will have the opportunity to actually appear within the AI Overview in a section clearly labeled as sponsored when they're relevant to both the quarry and the information in the AI Overview, really giving us the ability to innovate here and take this to the next level.",161

And then Philipp, I know it's only 1 quarter. It's interesting that Search is growing faster than YouTube, which surprised some of us.

So Look, as we both noted, Search revenues really reflected broad-based growth across verticals. That was led by retail followed by financial services. I think your question really goes to the heart of the year-on-year growth comparison. And as both Philipp and I noted, we're really pleased with YouTube, the YouTube team, all that was done. It was driven by brand followed by direct response. And they have very strong ongoing operating metrics, which Philipp will comment on. 
I think the important point to note, and I tried to tease out in opening comments, was that the deceleration in this year-on-year revenue growth for the second quarter versus the first quarter, primarily reflected the tougher comparison versus the first quarter because at that point, as you probably recall, YouTube was lapping negative year-on-year growth in Q1 last year. And then also Q1 benefited from the extra from leap year. And so what you're also seeing here is with YouTube, we were anniversary-ing the ramp in APAC-based retailers that began in the second quarter last year and foreign exchange headwinds as well that we noted. And so it's -- there are some timing issues going on. And what we're trying to highlight is the underlying operating strength. Back to you, Philipp.",211

I think, look, we are all building multimodal models. At least Gemini has been natively multimodal from the ground up. But most of the use cases today that have been unlocked have been around the tech side. So in terms of getting real generative audio, video experience is working well. I think there is still -- it's going to take some time. But over time, obviously, it will be deeply relevant to YouTube. And so it's an area I'm excited about in the future.",103

Sundar, maybe first for you. In terms of Cloud and bringing AI to the enterprise, I wanted to know if you go a little bit deeper in terms of how you're seeing AI actually get adopted implemented, what it potentially could mean for the strategic positioning of the Cloud business and the potential for AI workloads to be a stimulant to revenue growth for Cloud first. And then following up the last set of questions on YouTube or really about the macro or the ad environment. What do you guys, as a team, continue to learn about the subscription side of YouTube and the appetite for consumers to engage with a broader array of media products at the subscription layer?",140

Look, on the Cloud and AI stuff, obviously, it's something which I think will end up being a big driver over time. I mentioned in my opening remarks, already, if you take a look at our AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for cloud across everything we do, be it compute on the AI side, the products we have through Vertex AI, Gemini for Workspace and Gemini for Google Cloud, et cetera, we definitely are seeing traction. People are deeply engaging with the Gemini models across Vertex and AI studio. We now have over 2 million developers playing around with these things, and you are definitely seeing early use cases. 
But I think we are in this phase where we have to deeply work and make sure on these use cases, on these workflows, we are driving deeper progress on unlocking value, which I'm very bullish will happen. But these things take time. So -- but if I were to take a longer-term outlook, I definitely see a big opportunity here. And I think particularly for us, given the extent to which we are investing in AI, our research infrastructure leadership, all of that translates directly. And so I'm pretty excited about the opportunity space ahead.",208

As I noted in opening comments, that overall line subscriptions platforms and devices delivered healthy growth, and that was led by subscriptions. And as we've said on many calls here in a row, the subscription revenue growth continued to be quite strong. It was driven by subscriber growth in both YouTube TV and YouTube Music Premium. And then the other component within that line is Google One that also delivered strong subscriber and revenue growth. 
But I think the heart of your question is really around YouTube, and that is the heart of the revenues in that line. So it continues to be very strong. We see a lot of take-up in it, strong subscriber growth, really pleased with it. We did note that growth on that line decelerated due to anniversary-ing this YouTube TV price increase. But at the heart of it are people interested in the subscription offerings and [ is to take significant ]. We're really pleased with it.",180

So it looks like from the outside at least, the hyperscaler industry is going from kind of an underbuilt situation this time last year to better meeting the demand with capacity right now to potentially being overbuilt next year if these CapEx growth rates keep up. So do you think that's a fair characterization? And how are we thinking about the return on invested capital with this AI CapEx cycle? And then related to that, do you think that the AI industry is close to or far away from hitting some kind of wall on foundation model improvement in AI training based on like lack of availability of new data to train on? Just your thoughts on that would be great.",128
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2024",2024-07-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3413.0,3193335.0,113919456.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,28,"I think great questions. Look, I -- obviously, we are at an early stage of what I view as a very transformative area and in technology, when you're going through these transitions, aggressively investing upfront in a defining category, particularly in an area in which in a leveraged way cuts across all our core areas or products, including Search, YouTube and other services as well as fuels growth in Cloud and supports the innovative long-term bets and Other Bets is definitely something for us makes sense to lean in. 
I think the one way I think about it is when we go through a curve like this, the risk of under-investing is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing for us here, even in scenarios where if it turns out that we are over-investing, we clearly -- these are infrastructure which are widely useful for us. They have long useful lives, and we can apply it across, and we can work through that. But I think not investing to be at the front here, I think, definitely has much more significant downside. 
Having said that, we obsess around every dollar we put in. Our teams are -- work super hard. I'm proud of the efficiency work, be it optimization of hardware, software, model deployment across our fleet. All of that is something we spend a lot of time on, and that's how we think about it. 
To your second question on whether -- how do the scaling laws hold? Are we hitting on some kind of wall or something? Look, I think we are all pushing very hard, and there's going to be a few efforts which will scale up on the compute side and push the boundaries of these models. What I would tell is regardless of how that plays out, I still think there is enough optimizations we are all doing, which is driving constant progress in terms of the capabilities of the models. And more importantly, taking them and translating into real use cases across the consumer and enterprise side, I think on that frontier, I think there's still a lot of progress to be had. And so we are pretty focused on that as well.",369

So Sundar, I guess to ask the AI question a different way, as we talk to some of the model builders out there, it looks like the initial use cases are more on the cost savings or efficiency side. But when do we -- when do you think we'll start thinking about products that can help revenue generation for the Fortune 500, Fortune 1000 companies, which is probably something that can hopefully create greater value over time versus just cutting costs? And Philipp, listening to what will be, I guess, Ruth's final comments on YouTube on these public calls -- and thank you, by the way, Ruth, for all the help. I couldn't help but notice that the bigger factors were brand followed by direct response. And if we continue to think that the one you bring up first is the larger factor and tying this into your prior commentary about shopping being an important consideration, when do you think we'll start talking about direct response being a much bigger contributor to YouTube's growth versus brand?",177
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2024",2024-07-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3413.0,3193335.0,113919459.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,31,"On the first part of the question, look, I think the technology's horizontal enough, it can apply on both sides. If you take a use case like improving the customer service experience, it is part of it, which is driving efficiencies. And you can look at it from a cost standpoint, but you could also be overall improving the experience, improving conversion, driving the funnel better, and so increasing basket size if you're a retail e-commerce player, et cetera. So we are seeing people experiment across both sides. And so I think you will see it play out across both sides. Philipp, on the second one?",106

On the second one, look, on the direct response side, as you know, it's about driving and converting commercial intent and customers are obviously benefiting from including video in their AI-powered campaigns. It could be PMax. It could be Demand Gen and obviously using our automated tools to enhance and create video creatives. And we're very, very optimistic about this path. On average, advertisers who run both image and video ads with Demand Gen campaigns see 6% more conversions per dollar than those running image-only ads and discovery. And this is just one little example of how this can obviously boost your performance business. So that's a big part. 
The brand side, as you know, Google AI continues to make it easier for brands to show up next to the content where viewers are obviously the most engaged. And they're finding it, as you can see from the numbers, a very effective way to drive awareness and consideration. And we're also quite excited about some of the recent launches on YouTube Shopping side, if you want to put that into the direct response bucket.",185

I'll ask a couple of areas. First, on the cloud acceleration, would you characterize that as new AI demand helping drive that year-to-date? Or is that more of a rebound in just general compute and other demand? Or is AI really moving this forward and helping drive acceleration? And then I wanted to ask about your internal cost savings, which has been really strong. How are you using AI internally to help cut costs? Are you seeing better efficiencies with your engineers? And just would love to hear about how you're applying AI to cut your own costs.",99
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2024",2024-07-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3413.0,3193335.0,113919463.0,Answer,Ruth Porat,,Executives,35,"Great. Thank you for that. So overall, we're -- as both Sundar and I said, we're very pleased with the results in Cloud. And there is clearly a benefit as the Cloud team is engaging broadly with customers around the globe with AI-related solutions, AI infrastructure solutions and generative AI solutions. I think we noted that we're particularly encouraged that the majority of our top 100 customers are already using our generative AI solution. So it is clearly adding to the strength of the business on top of all that they're doing. And just to be really clear, the results for GCP, the growth rate for GCP is above the growth for Cloud overall. 
And then I'll turn it to Sundar on the cost saving point, but just one point. We're really pleased as well that Cloud's margin improved as it did. And in part, that reflects the revenue strength that they delivered and all of the efficiency efforts that I've already spoken about. But looking ahead in Q3, we do expect the same seasonal pattern that you saw last year with respect to margin, and we are continuing to invest in the business.",194

I think we are making these tools available to some of the most productive engineers and demanding engineers out there, and they are definitely kicking the tires hard. But I would say it's still all in very early stages, I think, particularly when it comes to writing high-quality secure code. But I think all the learnings, what we are gaining here will translate into our models and products, and that's the virtuous cycle which I'm excited by. So there's a lot more to come.",108
