It's a privilege to join the call as the CEO of both Alphabet and Google after 4 years as CEO of Google. I'd like to start by thanking Larry and Sergey for giving all of us at Google a timeless mission, endearing values and an opportunity to have an impact on the world.
There's a lot I want to cover today, and I also want to leave plenty of time for any questions you may have for me and Ruth. As you've seen in our press release, we've added new revenue disclosures to give greater insight into our business. Search and other Google properties continue to drive great results with total revenues in 2019 of $98 billion and strong growth. I'm also really pleased with 2 of our newer growth areas. YouTube reached $15 billion in ads revenues in 2019, growing at 36% compared with 2018, and it now has over 20 million music and premium paid subscribers and over 2 million YouTube TV paid subscribers, ending 2019 at a $3 billion annual run rate in YouTube subscriptions and other nonadvertising revenues. Google Cloud ended 2019 at a more than $10 billion run rate, up 53% year-on-year, driven by significant growth in GCP. The growth rate of GCP was meaningfully higher than that of Cloud overall, and GCP's growth rate accelerated from 2018 to 2019.
Before I talk about the highlights of the quarter, I want to take a step back and give some early thoughts about my approach to managing Alphabet and Other Bets. We have always taken a long-term view, investing in deep computer science and technology. Important trends like the wider adoption and application of artificial intelligence, ambient computing and the move to the cloud underline our investments across Google and our other Alphabet companies.
Our work in health care is a great example of how our investments in these areas allows us to deliver solutions across an entire sector. Google Cloud works with hospitals and health care providers to securely manage their patients' data, data that is much more secure in the cloud than in paper records or on-premises. Our AI teams at Google also work with partners to apply AI to help them and their patients, whether it's developing better health systems or helping with the diagnosis and deduction of disease.
Among their broader efforts are Other Bets. Verily and Calico are also partnering with industry leaders to use AI and cloud technologies to improve clinical trials, research and drug development. Our thesis has always been to apply these deep computer science capabilities across Google and our Other Bets to grow and develop into new areas. The Alphabet structure allows us to have a portfolio of different businesses with different time horizons without trying to stretch a single management team across different areas. We'll continue to take a long-term view, managing the portfolio with the discipline and rigor needed to deliver long-term returns.
Many of our Other Bets are getting to the stage where it now makes sense for them to partner closely with other players and investors in the industry. Waymo's technological leadership is widely reported. Its cars have driven 20 million miles across more than 25 U.S. cities. Waymo is now serving over 1,500 monthly active riders in Metro Phoenix and continue scaling fully driverless by matching early riders with driverless vehicles and charging for these rides. As Waymo looks to its evolution as a business, it's focusing on strategic partnerships. For example, it's working closely with OEMs and other businesses to build out ride-hailing and delivery business lines. And Verily is an example of a company in the portfolio that has outside investors, Silver Lake and Temasek as well as its own board. We'll consider opportunities for some of our Other Bets to take similar steps over time.
Now on to highlights from the quarter. First, Search and related Google properties. As I mentioned on our last call, our neural network-based technique for natural language processing called BERT is the biggest advancement in search in the last 5 years. It now impacts 10% of searches. And in Q4, we rolled it out in over 70 languages.
In Maps, we are celebrating our 15th anniversary very soon. And in the past year, we brought reliable directions to 630 million additional people in locations that previously weren't well mapped. We added as many buildings to maps using ML in 2019 as we have added using all techniques in the previous decade. With all these improvements, user growth is strong, and the range of things people are doing with Google Maps continues to expand as well.
The Google Assistant now helps more than 500 million monthly users across 90 countries get things done, across smart speakers and smart displays, phones, TVs, cars and more.
Shopping and commerce is another exciting area. We are making strong leadership hires in this area to help build a thriving business for partners of all sizes. Over the Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday weekend, we had the largest number of daily shoppers on google.com ever in our history. Throughout the entire holiday shopping season, we also expanded the selection of products on Google due to a 4x uptick in the number of U.S. merchants participating in our Shopping Actions program.
Second, YouTube. Speaking of shopping, people can now easily buy products in YouTube's home feed and search results, making it possible for advertisers to reach even more audiences. Try searching for Puma shoes review on YouTube to see an example. With all the related content on YouTube like unboxing and beauty videos, this is a format people love, and it delivers a simple in-video buying experience.
A huge focus is continuing our work to keep YouTube safe for users, creators and advertisers. You may have seen a blog post today about our work to promote authoritative content and remove misleading information about the upcoming 2020 elections. For example, we are applying our disruptive content policies to reduce misleading information about voting locations or the census process. As I mentioned earlier, we are pleased with YouTube's growth in advertising and subscriptions, and we're also pleased with the early results from other revenue options we offer creators, including memberships, brand integrations, merchandise and ticket sales.
Continuing on now to Cloud. We are really pleased with the momentum we are seeing in Cloud. Year-on-year, the number of deals over $50 million more than doubled. The investments in Cloud's go-to-market expansion are resulting in customer momentum. Wayfair is one of the many retailers who successfully ran holiday operations on Google Cloud. In addition, Lowe's, which began transitioning off its legacy e-commerce system in late 2018 to Google Cloud, worked with us during this year's peak holiday buying season to improve the stability of their e-commerce site.
Worth noting, at peak time, customers in our Black Friday/Cyber Monday program used 4x the compute resources compared to previous year, and our platform experienced 100% uptime. Lufthansa Group is using our AI solutions to develop new tools that will improve air travel operations. The U.S. Postal Service also chose Google Cloud AI to improve business processes and customer experience. We have recently signed a 10-year agreement with Sabre to help them improve operations and develop new airline and hospitality services.
Finally, Google other revenue. Android continues to thrive. I'm proud to announce that over $80 billion has been earned by developers around the world from Google Play, showing the popularity of our platform. There are now over 2 billion active monthly users of Google Play. Hardware is still in the early stages of delivering on our vision for ambient computing. Our home devices demonstrate how this vision can come to life in creating the home of the future with our new Nest Mini and Nest Hub Max selling well over the holidays, following on from the Pixel 3a, which sold well last year. With Pixel 4, we continue to build out our capabilities and are keenly focused on execution, delivering great user experiences and broadening our distribution. And our pending acquisition of Fitbit will give us a foundation in wearables. I'm excited about our road map ahead across our products.
Overall, in 2020, our teams at Google are focusing on 4 key things. First, creating the most helpful products for everyone. We are really focused on ensuring that our products like Search, Maps and Assistant are helping people in their daily lives. Second, providing the most trusted experiences for our users. We are doing lots of work to keep improving users' privacy and security while also keeping harmful content off our systems. Third, executing at scale. This will show up as more seamless products across various surfaces and platforms like the Google Assistant, deeper partnerships and better use of our shared infrastructure. For example, Activision Blizzard recently chose Google as a strategic partner, using Google Cloud's computing infrastructure, YouTube for live streaming and our AI tools. Putting together these multiproduct partnerships helps us unlock great opportunities for our partners. And fourth, creating sustainable value. This means optimizing our usage of computing resources and also growing business opportunities in areas like YouTube, Cloud, Play, Hardware and beyond.
So as you can see, there's a lot happening at the company and a real sense of excitement and focus. I want to thank our employees for all the great work in 2019.
With that, I'll turn it over to Ruth, and I look forward to your questions.",1585
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2020",2020-02-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3435.0,1952239.0,76633239.0,Presenter Speech,Ruth Porat,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Sundar. We're very pleased with our strong 2019 results with total Alphabet revenues of $162 billion, up 18% year-on-year or 20% in constant currency. In dollar terms, this represents an increase of $25 billion in revenues relative to 2018. I will review our quarterly and annual results, including our new revenue disclosures, and conclude with our outlook. Sundar and I will then take your questions.
Starting with consolidated Alphabet results. In the fourth quarter, our total revenues were $46.1 billion, up 17% year-on-year and up 19% in constant currency. Our results were driven by ongoing strength in Search, YouTube and Google Cloud, offset by a decline in Hardware revenues. Details of Alphabet's consolidated revenues by geographic region are available in our earnings press release.
Regarding our key expense lines. On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, was $21 billion, up 17% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $12.5 billion, up 19% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The biggest factors here again this quarter were costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, and then content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube and mostly for our advertising-supported content in what has been a seasonally strong quarter for YouTube, but also for our newer paid YouTube Music and Premium subscription services as well as YouTube TV, which have higher content acquisition costs as a percentage of their revenues. These were partially offset by a decline in costs associated with lower Hardware sales.
Operating expenses were $15.8 billion, with head count growth being the largest driver of year-on-year growth for R&D and sales and marketing expenses. Head count drives both compensation and related facilities expenses. After head count growth, the biggest driver in R&D expenses was an increase in valuation-based compensation charges in certain Other Bets.
Stock-based compensation totaled $2.6 billion. Head count was up 4,803 from the third quarter and up 20% over 2018. Again, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable head count increases were again in Google Cloud for both technical and sales roles, including the impact of the Looker acquisition, which closed in December.
Operating income was $9.3 billion, up 13% year-over-year for an operating margin of 20%. Other income and expense was $1.4 billion, which primarily reflects an increase in the market value of certain publicly traded equities as well as a noncash gain from the Verily transaction. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.
Our effective tax rate was 0.3% for the fourth quarter and was 13% for the full year. The fourth quarter ETR reflects the impact of discrete items, including the resolution of multiyear audits. As you have seen in prior years, ETR can vary on a quarterly basis. Net income was $10.7 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $15.35.
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $6 billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $14.4 billion with free cash flow of $8.4 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $120 billion.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $45.8 billion, up 17% year-over-year, and this, of course, is on a GAAP or floating FX basis. Google Search and other advertising revenues were $27.2 billion in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year, reflecting ongoing momentum in mobile and desktop. YouTube advertising revenues were $4.7 billion, up 31% year-on-year, driven by substantial growth in direct response and ongoing healthy growth in brand advertising, which remains the largest component. Network advertising revenues were $6 billion, up 8% year-on-year, led by growth in Google Ad Manager.
Turning to Google Cloud, including GCP and G Suite. Revenues were $2.6 billion for the fourth quarter, up 53% year-over-year driven by significant growth at GCP and ongoing strong growth at G Suite. The growth rate of GCP was meaningfully higher than that of Cloud overall. GCP growth was led by our infrastructure offerings in our data and analytics platform. We also saw a strong uptake of our multi-cloud Anthos offering. Ongoing growth in G Suite continue to reflect growth in both SMB and enterprise segments and both seat count and average revenue per seat.
The other revenues line now consists of Google Play, followed by Hardware and YouTube's nonadvertising services, mainly its subscription offerings, YouTube Premium, YouTube Music and YouTube TV. In the fourth quarter, other revenues were $5.3 billion, up 10% year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in YouTube and Play, offset by declines in Hardware. YouTube's contribution to other revenues benefited from subscriber growth across its various offerings. Within Play, app revenues had strong growth driven by an increase in the number of active buyers.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $8.5 billion or 22% of total advertising revenues and up 14% year-over-year. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was down year-over-year, reflecting once again a favorable revenue mix shift from network to Google properties.
Google operating income was $11.5 billion, up 20% versus last year, and the operating margin was 25%. Google accrued CapEx for the quarter was $6.6 billion, reflecting investments in data centers, followed by servers and office facilities.
Moving on to the performance of Other Bets. For the full year 2019, revenues were $659 million, up 11% versus 2018, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss for Other Bets was $4.8 billion for the full year 2019 versus an operating loss of $3.4 billion in 2018.
Let me conclude with a few observations on the quarter and our longer-term outlook. Based on the strength of the U.S. dollar to date relative to the first quarter of last year, we expect continued FX headwinds again in the first quarter of 2020. With our expanded revenue disclosures this quarter, I'll talk about the revenue and investment outlook for each of these newly disclosed component parts.
First, with respect to Search and other advertising. Although we don't report Search revenues on a fixed FX basis, the delta between fixed and floating growth rates at the Alphabet level is a good proxy for the effect on Search revenues or a headwind of approximately 2 percentage points in 2019. At our scale, we are pleased with our rate of growth for 2019 and see ample opportunity going forward. What's exciting for us as we look ahead at Search and other Google properties is the ongoing opportunity to support users and advertisers with new ads experiences and improved measurement.
Second, with respect to YouTube advertising. At a year-on-year growth rate of more than 30% in the fourth quarter, we're pleased with the ongoing strength and opportunity at YouTube. We see substantial, continuing opportunity in direct response as well as with brand advertisers. As Sundar shared earlier, the nonadvertising services at YouTube, mainly from subscriptions, reached a $3 billion revenue run rate in the fourth quarter. We continue to invest across YouTube to grow over the long term. In the ad-supported portion of YouTube, we pay out a majority of revenues to our creators, reflected in our content acquisition costs. On top of that, there are other expenses, including infrastructure and networking costs as well as the cost of our content responsibility efforts to keep YouTube safe for users, creators and advertisers. We're also investing meaningfully to grow our subscriptions, which have higher content acquisition cost ratios.
Turning next to Google Cloud. We are very confident that there is an enormous opportunity here that plays to our core strengths. We're pleased with the growth trajectory of GCP, which we see in customer momentum, the growing size of the average contract and, of course, revenues. The traction we're having with large customers who are making multiyear commitments with us is reflected in our backlog, which ended the year at $11.4 billion, substantially all of which relates to Google Cloud. Given our position as a challenger, we're investing aggressively, focused on building out our go-to-market capabilities, executing against our product road map and extending the global footprint of our infrastructure focused on 21 markets and 6 industries.
In terms of Hardware, as Sundar noted in his opening remarks, we remain focused on the long-term opportunity with ambient computing. We believe our strengths in AI and software give us an advantage in providing seamless experiences to users wherever they are across multiple surfaces. We have been investing heavily in developing our capabilities in hardware engineering as well as building out supply and physical distribution chains, and we've created a multi-billion dollar revenue business in the past 3 years.
We're looking forward to our acquisition of Fitbit, which will add strong capabilities in wearables and advance our vision of ambient computing for the Android ecosystem. As we look at the near-term product road map, we continue to execute at a measured pace.
In Other Bets, we are sharpening our focus on the metrics and milestones against which capital allocation is determined, and we continue to assess where external capital is additive to governance and execution.
I'll now turn to the investments we're making in head count and in CapEx to support the growth opportunities we see across Alphabet. With respect to head count, in 2019, Alphabet head count grew by 20%, reflecting investment in key areas such as Cloud. Overall, we expect the growth rate of head count to be slightly higher in 2020 due to the combined impact of investment in priority areas plus the decision to move certain vendor functions in-house as well as from the planned impact of the Fitbit acquisition.
On SBC, as a reminder, our full year equity refresh grants are made to employees during the first quarter of 2020, and you will see the step-up in our first quarter results. In terms of CapEx, in 2020, we intend to increase our investment in both technical infrastructure and office facilities versus 2019. Within technical infrastructure, the investments, in particular, support ongoing demand for machine learning across our business as well as for Cloud, Search, Ads and YouTube. Relative to 2019, we anticipate relatively more spend on servers than on data center construction. At this scale of investment, we remain very focused on driving efficiency through fleet optimization and tight management of our supply chain.
Finally on capital returns. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $6.1 billion of shares, which was more than double the amount of repurchase in the fourth quarter of 2018. As of year-end, we had $21 billion remaining in the program and are focused on executing on the remaining authorization at a pace that is at least consistent with what you saw in the fourth quarter.
In conclusion, we remain very confident about the opportunities across Alphabet and in our ability to continue to deliver at the steady pace we've shown.
Sundar and I will now take your questions.",1831

I think this is the best Google call or Alphabet call I've been on since I've covered the company. So thank you again. You've given us a lot of stuff here.
I just wanted to focus a little bit on GCP and the comments that you made and either if you want to think about this for Google Cloud collectively or just for GCP. Just given the revenue run rate that you're at, how do we think about the gross margin profile of this business? Is it fair to look at some of the other cloud players when they were disclosing similar run rates to get a sense of what their gross margins were? Or is there a reason why your business might look slightly different?",157

So first and foremost, we're obviously really pleased with the momentum here. GCP had fantastic revenue momentum in the fourth quarter, and as we noted, it is growing at a meaningfully higher pace than Google Cloud overall.
In terms of your margin question, look, I think our view is, obviously, the competitive dynamics in the cloud market are very different today. We are investing aggressively given the opportunity, which I tried to make clear in opening comments. Given the opportunity we see and the momentum we're having, we've accelerated our investment in our go-to-market team. And as we've talked about before, we've set a goal to triple the size of the sales force. We're also focused on building out our product road map and extending the global footprint of our infrastructure. And I'll leave the forecasting to you.",143

Sundar, for you first, a lot of innovation that the company put on display over the past year. Ruth talked in her sort of forward commentary section about sustainability of growth and outperformance going forward. What are you most excited about when you see the company trying to align what improves consumer utility along with what continues to drive growth in the various segments of the business? That would be number one.
And two, Ruth, maybe for you, you had talked about variability of revenue last quarter going into Q4. But unless I missed that, I don't think you used the same word again in Q4. What were you expecting in terms of variability in Q4? And any color you could give on how that played out or how we should be thinking about variability of revenue going forward?",145
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2020",2020-02-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3435.0,1952239.0,76633245.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,9,"Eric, I think overall, I presume you're meaning across everything we do, and if that's the case, I am -- I mean the trends we are seeing -- and we've been investing on it for a while but applying it and actually driving use cases to users. So for example, using AI to dramatically improve natural language processing to make 10% of our search results better is a kind of opportunity I'm excited by. When I look at -- we do see a lot of commercial experiences across our properties, be it Search or YouTube and the opportunity to create a better experience there and hence bring more value to our users, that's something which we see as a big opportunity. And across our businesses, be it YouTube, Cloud, Play or Hardware in addition to Search, we are seeing strength in a lot of these areas, and we share a common technological approach across all of them. And so that gives us a synergistic way to approach these areas as well.",171

When we talk about variability of revenue, the way we've talked about it in the past very much holds true, which is we're -- we don't manage for any particular quarter, we manage focused on what's in the best -- best for users, and we have a lot of testing that goes around it. And so really, the point is there will be variability, and we're focused on continued -- the continued long-term opportunity and we do see that opportunity, the ads opportunity, to be significant. Apart from the secular shift to digital, we continue to be very focused on the benefit from better measurement, better ad delivery, better user experience. Our view is that all helps grow the addressable market, but there will be variability over time because we're very focused on what's in the right long-term interest.",172

Sundar, first, just hoping you could talk more about Google Cloud. Great to see the $10 billion run rate. Just curious if you can help gauge the progress over the past year. Then where do you think the biggest areas of differentiation lie in an increasingly competitive space?
And then Ruth, can you just give some of your latest thoughts on balancing growth and profitability across the Google segment and Other Bets? And as you enter this year, do you see additional opportunities to drive increased profitability without impacting the long-term potential of the businesses?",102
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2020",2020-02-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3435.0,1952239.0,76633249.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,13,"Doug, on Cloud, I think maybe a few thoughts on some of the progress we made last year and talk about the differentiation, which you asked about as well. Definitely under Thomas' leadership, I think we have clearly focused on 6 industry verticals across 21 markets and so doubling down on those efforts, bringing in a lot of new products and compliance certifications, so effectively expanding the TAM, which we serve. Ruth mentioned the team is on track to triple our sales force in 3 years, including bringing in a number of senior strategic hires and supplementing it with a channel partnership program. I think the progress I've seen in our customer focus with our customer success organization and the contracting framework have all been great progress for us.
Overall, every time we're in especially in one of these larger deals, they are effectively looking for a technology partner. So differentiation is not just what we bring to table in terms of Cloud where we have differentiated capabilities but, in many cases, it's what we bring as Google. So if you take an area like health care, all the investments we are making in health care across Google and, in some cases, Alphabet. If you look at Sabre, the partnership we can bring to them across our experience working in travel verticals as well. So I think -- and over time, I also think the AI-based, industry-specific solutions we are working on will end up being a differentiating factor as well.",251

When we look at the biggest investment areas within Google, we, as we've talked about already on this call, continue to be focused on investing to support the growth that we see. It starts with Search while also investing to build new businesses, and we've talked about a couple of them already today. Cloud is clearly an area where we're investing aggressively. In Hardware, we've been investing heavily by developing our capabilities in hardware engineering as well as building out supply and physical distribution chains. And then in YouTube, as I mentioned in opening comments, we do continue to build out our subscription services. It's still in the early days there, and we're making a sizable investment to build it out, taking a long-term view here.
So we are leaning into investing for long-term growth. That's been a core principle here and remains such while looking at where can we optimize within portfolios and where can operational efficiencies be additive.",263

Just Sundar, I thought your 2020 focal points are really helpful, creating the most helpful products for everyone and then the most trusted experience for users. Was curious to kind of focus in those comments on payments in YouTube. You've had a lot of payment strategies over the last couple of years, so talk about what types of investments or products you think you need to really remove friction and drive better payment adoption. And then on the YouTube side, if you sort of look at how people are using YouTube now from an engagement perspective, what types of changes do you foresee you need to make in order to really make it a more helpful product to drive engagement even higher on the YouTube platform?",129
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2020",2020-02-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3435.0,1952239.0,76633253.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,17,"Brian, thanks. On the payment side, clearly, I spoke earlier about the kind of experiences people see across our properties, including people do come with an intent to discover, learn and commercially engage as well. And when they're looking to transact, payments ends up playing a critical role. So the less friction you have, it tends to work better. So we've been really focused on doing that and getting more of our users set up in the right state. We've had a lot of traction with our payments product over the past 18 months. We had a tremendously successful launch in India from which we learned a lot of features, and we are bringing that and we are revamping our payments products globally. And so I'm excited by that rollout, which is coming up in 2020. I think that will make the experience better.
On the YouTube side, what -- I guess your question is about how are users engaging with the product. Overall, all our user metrics are very strong. They're global in nature, and increasingly, we see newer verticals beginning to grow as well. So YouTube is working horizontally well at scale. And for us, it's making sure, as an ecosystem, it works better so that the content there, the experiences there are improving. We take our content responsibility work seriously, which makes more content creators engaged and makes it a more valuable product for advertisers as well but also supplementing the content you see there with other types of accessorizing things, be it merchandising, ticket sales. When we make it contextually relevant, what we have done in Search and Search ads over time, if we can bring that at YouTube when we see an opportunity, I think that sets us up well for the long term there.",300

So the regional breakdown also reflects product mix within regions. The U.S. year-on-year growth rate does reflect a decline in Hardware revenues relative to what was a fairly strong Hardware revenue growth rate in 4Q '18 and not much more to call out than that.,48

But you've come up through the ranks at Google, so you're undoubtedly pretty sensitive to the various interests across various teams. But we're wondering what you may be looking to do to break down, I guess, what might have been more of a siloed effort in Google's history.",74

And so for us, that means you have these product areas, which are focused on their users, but we are setting up teams which cut across all these areas and make sure they can bring their synergies and work at scale. So last year, we set up a core infrastructure team, which looks at things like how does the user journey work across, what does the shared infrastructure engineers can't use so that we don't reinvent the wheel in multiple areas, how can we commonly deploy AI across all these products. So I think that's been a good example of bringing teams together.
Another big area where we invested like that to break down silos is our partnerships. We set up a global partnerships team. And our ability to bring a common Google perspective to our big global partners has helped us strike many new partnerships. I mentioned Activision Blizzard as an example. And they work and they're very synergistic with Cloud as well. To my point earlier, when people engage with us on cloud, they're looking for -- they're interested in a bigger digital transformation across the board.
Google Assistant is a great example of -- because we are focused on the user, and the experience cuts across several of our product areas, it's been a great mechanism by which we can break down silos as well. But it's a great question, and I spend a lot of time on it.",251

Ruth, you distinguished between the growth of brand advertising and direct response on YouTube. Those comments were very clear. I just want to follow up and ask you just how you make that distinction between brand and direct response. Is it a different pricing model? Is it the presence of ad revenue share with a creator or both? Would just be curious on that distinction.
And then to Sundar, the big picture one, we have heard others in the ecosystem talk about headwinds from targeting growing. Certainly, there are regulatory changes that also apply to you. You've made some changes to various Google advertising platforms. And of course, you're an owner of 2 of the largest, most important platforms in Chrome and the Android operating system. I could ask you 1 billion things on that last one. But what I'd really like to ask is the big picture question. If we roll up these sort of things for your total advertising business, how important are changes here to your top line growth? Are you seeing notable headwinds from these types of changes in the ecosystem as well?",205
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2020",2020-02-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3435.0,1952239.0,76633262.0,Answer,Ruth Porat,,Executives,26,"So on the first one, we have again this quarter talked about brand and direct response. And as we've talked about in prior quarters, brand is growing at a healthy pace and remains the largest component of YouTube ads. Direct response is growing -- continues to grow at a very substantial growth. The distinction here is the format for -- in direct response, we're letting brands insert a tailored call to action in a video ad, such as signing up for a newsletter or scheduling an appointment or downloading an app or booking a trip, things of those sort. And that's why it's the direct response category.",107

We try to stay focused on users and our partners. And we realize for these things to scale, you need to make sure the ecosystem is working well. And so we are engaged in these issues, and we anticipate and structurally work on them early on. So it's how we broadly approach these things. And so there's nothing notable to call out other than there will be continued changes in these ecosystems, and our ability to anticipate and adapt is key to the years ahead.",102

So first on YouTube monetization, assuming you have about 2 billion users, it's about $7 or $8 per user. Just wondering how you feel about that monetization level given all the usage you're seeing there. And is there significant room to raise that when you compare it to other social networks?
And then secondly, on the Cloud backlog, a very strong number, $11.4 billion versus our IaaS/PaaS revenue rates. Just wondering about how strong the new deals have been that you've signed in the last 6 months. It sounds like really good traction there. And then the profitability of these deals, how you feel about that?",121
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2020",2020-02-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3435.0,1952239.0,76633266.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,30,"On the question around YouTube, I do think there is a lot of opportunity ahead. You're right, it's a platform working at scale. I think -- Ruth spoke a little bit about brand and direct response. I think direct response is a huge growth area for us. And increasingly, I think when you look at the fact that people are consuming a lot of goods and services as part of their experience in YouTube, how can we create better commerce experiences also is a big opportunity for us. So looking across, I think there is more room, significantly more room, over the mid to long term on monetization levels. And so I think we see that as a big opportunity and are investing for it.
On Cloud, definitely, we are increasingly doing much larger deals. And these deals can sometimes span beyond Cloud as well, and they can touch many areas. So as an example, if you're an automotive company, we can be talking to you across Cloud, Android Auto, in some cases, Waymo, and they all happen to be strong platforms -- partners on the advertising side as well. So these are large deals, and we do want to build these in a sustainable way so that we can serve the partner well, and so profitability has been something we are very focused on as well.",227

And as you know well, in the enterprise phase, these tend to grow over time, and profitability as such comes across the cohorts. However, the point that we were trying to make and have made a couple of times here on the call is we are investing aggressively in Cloud overall given the opportunity that we see and the momentum we're having, and we'll continue to do so.",99

As you think about the risk profile of some of your businesses like Waymo, like Verily in health care, how do you manage those risks, which likely in a scenario where autonomous cars have some accident or something like that, having those in-house and perhaps brand damage that could do to Google versus what you could do if those were entirely separate enterprises? I know they're all held underneath the Alphabet umbrella, but just sort of big picture how you think about managing that risk over time.",92

We are -- as I spoke earlier in the remarks, part of the reason we are making sure we are investing in the proper governance structures so that we don't try to scale as a management across these important areas. Some of these are -- have regulatory aspects to it. We are, for some of these bets as well, and Verily is a great example, we have brought in outside investors, people with expertise and setting up proper Board structures and governance for these. So I think those all help, and we'll continue to evaluate these on a periodic basis and bring that rigor and discipline. But I do think Alphabet gives us a more flexible framework, if you will, to both have the independence when we need but where we can have common shared synergies, like our AI investments, bring that to bear as well.",148

Ruth, I just kind of want to double-click on something you said before in terms of Other Bets kind of like a sharpening focus on the allocation there. Was that kind of -- is that kind of signaling more of the same? Or is that kind of potentially maybe prioritizing investments more towards like share buybacks and stuff like that as opposed to -- like basically, I'm trying to ask, should we expect greater rationalization in the Other Bets segment going forward? Or is it more of the same?",95

And we look at that as we calibrate the pace of investment, the approach to investments, and we are continuing to do that. We're putting a sharper focus on this, as Sundar indicated, looking at where does it make sense to work with external capital as we did with Verily as an example. But the bigger point is we continue to invest for the long term. And when we look at our capital return approach, it's very consistent with what we've talked about previously. The primary use of capital continues to be to support long-term growth in Google and in Other Bets, and then it's about strategic investments and, on top of that, return of capital to shareholders.",151

The Google segment margin looked really strong in the fourth quarter. I think this is the first time that mix shift actually helped you guys from a margin perspective. So Ruth, can you just talk about how much of that margin increase year-on-year was from the Hardware business dropping off versus improving elsewhere? And then as you look forward, you mentioned that head count is going to accelerate in 2020. So is this an investment year in your view or just kind of more of the steady kind of increase?
And then second question, on YouTube, a lot of discussion here about direct response impact and the opportunity there. What percent of AdWords advertisers are buying Search only versus buying Search and YouTube at this stage? And it looks like from your new disclosure that you did decelerate a little bit in the fourth quarter. Any color on what's driving that relative to the full year '19 growth rate?",161
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2020",2020-02-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3435.0,1952239.0,76633280.0,Answer,Ruth Porat,,Executives,44,"Okay. So taking the first part of that. In terms of the operating margin in the fourth quarter, there were a number of discrete items in the fourth quarter last year in 2018, so that did result in a favorable Google op inc year-on-year comparison for this year. And as you said, the other cost of sales does reflect lower expenses related to Hardware in Q4, in particular, versus last year. But I think the main point to leave you with is that we do intend to continue to invest aggressively to support growth in the areas that we've already talked about quite a bit on this call: in Search, in Cloud, in Hardware and in YouTube.
In terms of head count, I tried to break it out in my closing comments that it starts with those areas -- putting head count behind the areas where we're investing for the long term, and then we have a couple of additional factors that are somewhat expected to boost the year-on-year growth rate. One is bringing some support in-house that's OpEx-neutral, and the other is the Fitbit acquisition.
In terms of the third part of your question, I'm just trying to recall it. The -- in terms of the mix, I'm not sure there's much to add there.",216

On commerce, I'm really excited Bill Ready is here. He brings a lot of experience. And you mentioned the transactional part of the funnel, and I think it's an area where he brings a lot of experience given his prior work. But we definitely see opportunity to improve the overall user experience in terms of how we present our results, the visual nature of it, making that experience more delightful. And when people are interested in something, how do you make it more seamless to complete the transaction and bringing in deep partnerships with merchants and retailers to making that happen. So excited about the opportunity there, and that's where we are investing.
On GCP, we did see -- it's been a lot to do with bringing to bear all the resources we have and engaging well on these deals, and the execution there has been great. And it's -- definitely, we see strong traction in data analytics. And so our strength there as a company is definitely contributing significantly as well as our overall leadership in AI.",179

When I last spoke with you in early February, no one could have imagined how much the world would change and how suddenly. Our thoughts are with everyone who has been impacted by COVID-19, especially those who have lost loved ones or their livelihoods. It's a challenging moment for the world. Through it all, we are incredibly grateful for all of the essential workers on the front lines of this crisis: from health care workers and first responders; to the grocery store clerks and delivery workers; to teachers, grappling with new technology to help children learn remotely; to all the scientists and researchers working hard to develop vaccines and treatments; and many others who are leading through these difficult times. Thank you. These people fill us with hope and show us the power of human resilience. We'll need that energy and resolve in the months and years ahead. 
Today, there is still a great deal of uncertainty regarding the path to recovery, but there are some things that we can understand better with the patterns we are seeing. For example, it's clear from data that people are being more cautious and are seeking authoritative advice and guidance to protect their families' health and safety. A return to normal economic activity depends on how effectively societies manage the spread of the virus. There is no one-size-fits-all, and the timing and pace of recovery will vary from location to location. This is a long-term effort. 
It's also clear that this is the first major pandemic taking place in a digital world. Many parts of the economy are also able to continue with some semblance of normalcy, thanks to advances in remote work, online shopping, delivery options, home entertainment and telemedicine. At the same time, newer technologies like AI, Bluetooth exposure notifications and 3D printing are being used to help fight the disease head on. It's now clear that once the emergency has passed, the world will not look the same. Some social norms will change, and many businesses are speaking to us, looking to reinvent their operations. We have seen that the most pressing concern of small and large businesses right now is business continuity, solving for issues like employee safety, dramatic falls or surges in demand, supply chains and managing a remote workforce. Ultimately, we'll see a long-term acceleration of movement from businesses to digital services, including increased online work, education, medicine, shopping and entertainment. These changes will be significant and lasting. 
Given the depth of challenges so many are facing, it's been a huge privilege to be able to help people and businesses at this moment. In today's call, I'll cover 4 areas. First, I'll mention some of the ways we have marshalled our resources and product development to help. Second, I'll talk about how people are using our products at this unprecedented moment. Third, I'll talk about our business, especially our advertising business, which was significantly impacted in the last few weeks of the quarter. And I'll close with our investment plans and focus for the rest of the year. 
In the early days of the crisis, we were able to put in motion a number of efforts quickly. This is a testament to strategic areas where we have invested over recent years: products that people trust, our technical leadership and innovation, deep partnerships, a highly skilled workforce, and the scale and resilience of our operations. I've been proud of all these efforts and what they say about our company. I'll give just a few examples. 
First, we've been working with health care providers, researchers, authorities and communities to help combat the virus. Our community mobility reports help authorities see and aggregate how social distancing requirements are working. Verily has tested thousands of people in California and has partnered with Rite Aid to bring free testing to 8 additional states. Google Cloud is forming deep partnerships such as with leading health care provider at CA Healthcare to understand data around ICU bed availability, ventilator supplies and test results. And you may have read about our exposure notification partnership with Apple designed specifically and carefully to protect users' privacy while helping public health authorities and governments manage countries reopening. 
Second, we are working hard to provide accurate and authoritative information to people using our services. In Search, we have launched a number of features, such as up-to-date answers from health authorities and remote medical care options. On YouTube, we are quickly removing content that violates policy and raising authoritative content from news organizations and experts. Up to last week, our COVID-19 info panels have had 20 billion impressions. 
Third, we are playing a role in supporting businesses and workers that are hurting because of the downturn. In March, we made a commitment upwards of $800 million to support small businesses and crisis response efforts through a combination of grants, small business loans and ad credits. And the Google News initiative is offering financial support to thousands of small, medium and local news publishers through a journalism emergency relief fund. We've also waived ad serving fees for news publishers globally on Ad Manager for the next 5 months. 
Turning to the way people are using our products. People are relying on Google services more than ever. This is a strong recognition of the value of our products, particularly in important and urgent moments. As a few examples, we have seen a significant rise in search activity. To put it into perspective, in the U.S., coronavirus-related search activity at its peak was 4x greater than during the peak of the Super Bowl. People are spending significantly more time on their Android apps with downloads of apps from Google Play, rising 30% from February to March. YouTube watch time has also significantly increased. One area in particular is live streams. I hope you saw Andrea Bocelli on YouTube live on Easter, which has had over 39 million views, and it was truly beautiful. 100 million students and educators are using Google Classroom, double the number from the beginning of March. We've seen a massive increase in demand for Chromebooks. Analysts have reported a 400% increase during the week of March 21 year-over-year. And schools and businesses in particular, are using our secure video conferencing platform, Meet. Last week, we surpassed a significant milestone and are now adding roughly 3 million new users each day and have seen a thirtyfold increase in usage since January. There are now over 100 million daily Meet meeting participants. Stay tuned for much more. 
Turning to our business. Let me touch on our performance this quarter. Q1 was, in many ways, the tale of 2 quarters. For our advertising business, the first 2 months of the quarter were strong. In March, we experienced a significant and sudden slowdown in ad revenues. The timing of the slowdown correlated to the locations and sectors impacted by the virus and related shutdown orders. As the impact of COVID-19 came into view, we delayed some ad launches and prioritized supporting our customers as many adjusted their strategies. We are focused on products where we can help most advertisers and merchants during the crisis. For example, under our new leader of commerce, Bill Ready, last week, we announced that merchants can list products in Google Shopping for free. It's been widely rolled out in the U.S., with more countries to come, and the response has been positive. Overall, recovery in ad spend will depend on a return to economic activity. 
There are 2 key aspects of our business that give us confidence about the future. First, as we saw after 2008, one of the strongest features of Search is that it can be adjusted quickly, so it's relatively easier to turn off and then back on, and marketers see it as highly cost-effective and ROI-based. Second, our business is more diversified than it was in 2008. For example, cloud. In the public sector, we are helping governments deliver critical health and social services. We are supporting the state of New York's new online unemployment application system as it deals with a significant increase in demand.
In retail, we have helped Loblaw, one of Canada's largest food retailers, and Wayfair, scale to support exponential traffic increases. We are helping communication companies adapt to new behavior patents. Vodafone is using Google Cloud platform to help it analyze network traffic flows to keep everyone connected, and we are helping energy technologies keep real-time online games stay up and running. Institutions like Lloyds Bank are digitally transforming their businesses, and we are helping even more businesses do the same through new partnerships with Accenture, AT&T and T-Systems. We now have more than 6 million paying G Suite customers. G Suite is helping Netflix and German manufacturer, KAESER KOMPRESSOREN, transition quickly to remote work; while Twitter, Shopify, retailer Schnucks and Italian bank, Credem, are using Meet for things like all hands and customer meetings elsewhere across the business. 
YouTube subscriptions continue to grow. The team has launched YouTube Kids in 15 new countries around the world since the beginning of the year and rolled out new features to make kids-focused channels safer. Android previewed Android 11, which includes seamless 5G connectivity and a smarter keyboard with a faster messaging experience. And as I mentioned, we have seen significant growth in Play. There are now over 2.5 billion monthly active Play devices worldwide. And in hardware, we saw a decline in device activations in the quarter due to falling consumer demand globally. But I'm excited about the product road map ahead for the year, including yesterday's launch of Pixel Buds 2.
Finally, moving on to our focus for rest of the year. We are taking a long view and continuing to invest in our long-term priorities, but are being thoughtful in the short term. So we made the decision to slow down the pace of hiring for the remainder of 2020, while maintaining momentum in a small number of strategic areas. We are also recalibrating the focus and pace of our investments in areas like data centers and machines and nonbusiness essential, marketing and travel. We'll also continue to thoughtfully manage our Other Bets portfolio. Waymo raised $2.25 billion in its first external investment round, a terrific validation of their technology and long-term business model. Wing saw a surge in deliveries and new users, increasing its daily volume fivefold with great momentum in test programs in Australia and Virginia.
At Google, we'll continue to be focused on the 4 key areas that I outlined in the last earnings call. First, creating the most helpful products for everyone, particularly at a time where people rely on us for information, work, education and entertainment. 
Second, providing the most trusted experiences for our users. This includes our efforts to tackle misinformation and digital threats as well as our work to safeguard consumer privacy. 
Third, executing at scale. I've been proud of how we continue to work so cohesively and productively, even with the distributed workforce. We'll continue to build on the internal tools, support systems and infrastructure we have built over the years. 
And finally, creating sustainable value. We'll be optimizing the way our data centers work and prioritizing strategic areas of investment where we need to support our users and partners. 
Let me express my thanks to our employees for their herculean efforts under these difficult circumstances. While the road ahead for everyone is uncertain, we'll continue to support our users, communities and partners, and we'll all emerge together from this moment. Thank you, and please take care, everyone. 
Over to Ruth.",1938
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",2020-04-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3809.0,2017496.0,78937709.0,Presenter Speech,Ruth Porat,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Sundar. Our results for the first quarter are a tale of 2 quarters, with strong results across our revenue lines for January and February, followed by an abrupt decline in March in our advertising revenues as governments globally instituted stay-at-home orders in response to COVID 19. At the same time, even through March, our non-advertising revenue lines maintained their strong performance, particularly Google Cloud. I'll provide more details on the impact of the crisis as I review the Google segment revenue results and conclude with an update to the outlook that I shared on our fourth quarter call. Sundar and I will then take your questions. 
Starting with consolidated Alphabet results. In the first quarter, our total revenues were $41.2 billion, up 13% year-on-year and up 15% in constant currency, driven by Search, YouTube and Cloud. Details of Alphabet's consolidated revenues by geographic region are available in our earnings press release. In short, advertising results reflect, in large part, the nature and timing of actions around the globe in response to COVID-19. The decline in APAC was more muted than what we have seen in the rest of the world given the uneven impact of COVID as well as the composition of our revenues in the region. The impact in the rest of the world began later and was more acute by the end of the quarter. In terms of the foreign exchange impact, exchange rate movements resulted in a modest headwind to reported revenues. 
Regarding our key expense lines, on a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, was $19 billion, up 19% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $11.5 billion, up 26% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The biggest factors here again this quarter were costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation; and then content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube's advertising-supported content; followed by content costs for YouTube TV and our paid YouTube Music and Premium subscription services. Operating expenses were $14.2 billion, with head count growth being the largest driver of year-on-year growth for R&D and sales and marketing expenses. For G&A, the biggest driver of expense growth was attributable to a reserve for estimated credit deterioration as a result of COVID-19. 
Stock-based compensation totaled $3.2 billion. Headcount was up 4,149 from the fourth quarter. Again, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable head count increases were again in Google Cloud for both technical and sales roles. Operating income was $8 billion, down 4% year-over-year, excluding the impact of the EC fine in the first quarter of last year for an operating margin of 19%. Other income and expense was a loss of $220 million, driven primarily by losses in equity securities. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. 
Our effective tax rate was 11.9%. Net income was $6.8 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $9.87. 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $6 billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $11.5 million with free cash flow of $5.4 billion. We repurchased $8.5 billion of our shares. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $117 billion. 
Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with our Google segment. Revenues were $41 billion, up 14% year-over-year. I'll now go through the individual advertising revenue lines. Starting with Google Search and other advertising revenues. We generated $24.5 billion in revenues in the quarter. That was up 9% year-over-year. This reflects strong year-on-year growth for the first 2 months of the quarter. In March, revenues began to decline and ended the month at a mid-teens percentage decline in year-on-year revenues. Although users' search activity increased, their interest shifted to less commercial topics. In addition, there was also reduced spending by our advertisers. YouTube advertising revenues were $4 billion, up 33% year-on-year. Significant YouTube revenue growth persisted until late in the first quarter, with different performance trajectories for the brand and direct response components. Direct response continued to have substantial year-on-year growth throughout the entire quarter. Brand advertising growth accelerated in the first 2 months of the quarter but began to experience a headwind in mid-March. As a result, by the end of March, total YouTube ads revenue growth had decelerated to a year-on-year growth rate in the high single digits. 
Network advertising revenues were $5.2 billion, up 4% year-on-year, with healthy year-on-year growth for the first 2 months of the quarter. We ended March at a year-on-year percentage decline in network revenues in the low double digits. 
Turning to Google Cloud, including GCP and G Suite. Revenues were $2.8 billion for the first quarter, up 52% year-over-year, driven by significant growth at GCP and ongoing strong growth at G Suite. Once again, the growth rate of GCP was meaningfully higher than that of cloud overall. GCP growth was led by our infrastructure offerings and our data and analytics platform. We're pleased with the ongoing growth in G Suite, which continues to reflect growth in both seat count and average revenue per seat. 
With respect to the implications of the global crisis for Google Cloud, we're proud of the accelerated traction we achieved across sectors, including public sector and health care for disease monitoring and control, working with leading retailers on demand forecasting, working with companies across media and communications to enhance their customer service and across industries on supply chain optimization. 
In the first quarter, other revenues were $4.4 billion, up 23% year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues and Play. YouTube's contribution to other revenues benefited from subscriber growth across its various offerings. Within Play, app revenues continued to benefit from strong growth in the number of active buyers in the first quarter. In addition, in the latter part of the quarter, we started to see an increase in user engagement in apps as well as in digital content. Total traffic acquisition costs were $7.5 billion or 22% of total advertising revenues and up 9% year-over-year. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was down slightly year-over-year, reflecting once again a favorable revenue mix shift from network to Google properties. Google operating income was $9.3 billion, up 1% versus last year, and the operating margin was 23%. Google accrued CapEx for the quarter was $5.7 billion, reflecting investments in data centers, followed by servers and office facilities. 
Moving on to the performance of Other Bets. For the first quarter, revenues were $135 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss was $1.1 billion for the first quarter. 
Let me now conclude with our thoughts on the impact of the global crisis on our revenues and investments, including an update on the outlook I shared on our fourth quarter earnings call. 
We remain optimistic about the underlying strength of our business over the long term. On a daily basis, our products play an important role for consumers and businesses globally. This has been evident throughout the crisis and the usage metrics that Sundar referenced earlier. We're humbled that users continue to turn to us as much as they do at a time of global need and uncertainty. We take that responsibility very seriously. Users clearly are depending on us to provide useful and accurate information. They are looking to YouTube for information, education and entertainment constantly as they study, create and work from home. They are using our G Suite products to collaboratively communicate, connect and work. Although users may not be focused as much on purely commercial activities right now, over the long term, the value we provide to billions of users globally serves us well. Our previous investments in technical infrastructure ensure that we have the capacity and resilience to meet the increased demand from our users in this extraordinary time. We are redoubling our efforts to help our advertising customers and partners by sharing insights and developing new tools to keep them connected to their customers and help them be best positioned for recovery. 
In terms of more specific product points, I will start with search advertising, where our financial results are driven in part by users' search behavior. At the inception of the crisis, the increase in user interest was for information about COVID-19 and related noncommercial topics. Although we have seen some very early signs of recovery in commercial search behavior by users, it is not clear how durable or monetizable this behavior will be. In order to gauge the ongoing potential financial impact to our business from COVID-19, a key signal to monitor is macroeconomic performance, which is tended to be correlated with advertising spend. As of today, we anticipate that the second quarter will be a difficult one for our advertising business. As we move beyond the crisis and the global economy normalizes, this should be reflected in our advertising revenues, but it would be premature to comment on timing, given all the variables here. 
In terms of Google Cloud, we remain very pleased with the execution by the team. Reflected in the ongoing pace of customer adoption of both GCP, industry-specific solutions and G Suite collaboration tools to help businesses operate efficiently and effectively. 
Moving on to profitability. While TAC and content acquisition costs are obviously tied to revenues, there is a sizable percentage of items in other cost of revenues that are generally less variable in nature, such as depreciation and operations costs of our technical infrastructure as well as for activities like customer support and content review. Much of our operating expense is also not directly correlated to changes in revenues. Given that we are faced with a global crisis of uncertain depth and duration, we have been focused on taking steps to enhance efficiency, including slowing the pace of hiring and some categories of marketing spend as well as further enhancing machine utilization. More specifically, with respect to the pace of hiring, last quarter, I indicated that the rate of head count growth in 2020 would be slightly higher than the 20% growth in 2019. We now anticipate a deceleration in head count growth that should start to be visible in the third quarter and continue into the fourth quarter. Although we are focused on these and other steps to moderate the overall pace of investment, we remain committed to the long-term opportunities for which we are well positioned. So we will continue to invest in these areas, including Search, machine learning and Google Cloud. 
Finally, with respect to CapEx, on the fourth quarter call, we shared our expectation that investments in both technical infrastructure and office facilities would increase compared to 2019. We now anticipate a modest decrease in the level of total CapEx in 2020 compared with last year. The biggest change in our outlook is a reduction in global office facility investments due to both the need to pause most of our ground-up construction and fit-outs in response to COVID-19, and our decision to slow down the pace at which we acquire office buildings. In terms of technical infrastructure, we expect a moderate reduction to our forecast relative to the beginning of the year given the impact of COVID-19 on data center construction delays as well as the benefit of our ongoing focus on server efficiency. Overall, we anticipate technical infrastructure investment to remain at roughly the same level as in 2019, with relatively more spend on servers than on data center construction. Thank you. 
And Sundar and I will now take your questions.",1944

Two questions, if I can. One, on the comment with respect to direct response advertising on YouTube, would love to get a little more color on how direct response advertising as ad units continue to evolve and perform and how advertisers are using those ad units as part of their broader advertising goals. And then maybe, Ruth, for you. On the comment on expenses, I just want to understand a little bit of how much of what your messaging on expenses is efficiency gains that you were aiming for in 2020 before we got to COVID-19 versus elements of the cost structure that you're reexamining as a result of the pandemic.",125

We, on YouTube direct response, we've definitely seen traction there. I think an area where it really for example, is app installs. That's a great example of it. Gaming is another good example of it. So to -- and we are working on iterating and making the formats work better so that it applies to more context as well. But in general, I think businesses are learning to adapt. Obviously, we've had great success with Search. And so we're bringing a lot of those learnings and we are sharing it with our customers. And so we expect to see more traction there over time.",109
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",2020-04-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3809.0,2017496.0,78937713.0,Answer,Ruth Porat,,Executives,7,"And on your second question, I like the way you framed it. Yes, we do have efficiency efforts that we started that we had going as we enter this year. But as a result of what we're seeing in the environment, our view was that we should really double down on those. And so when we go through the various areas that I mentioned, we had started the year with an expectation about really optimizing head count around the various areas. What we've determined is we're going to, at this point, slow the pace of hiring. To be very clear, we are continuing to hire, but we are slowing the pace of hiring. And that's helping as we're driving a deeper look into how do you optimize within each area. 
The same is true, for example, in some of the comments on marketing, we are continuing to invest in marketing. As you know well, sales and marketing line, the majority of it is head count-related, and we do continue to invest here in ads, and in particular, in cloud. As it relates to the marketing component, namely ads and promo spend, we did reduce it relative to our plans in the beginning of the year, and we continue to have a healthy budget for ads and promo, particularly in digital, to support many business areas. But as with the other areas of investment, we're really focused on optimizing across products and services. And with physical events canceled for much of the year, marketing spend is also reduced. And so that's another example. With machines and servers. We've been focused on efficiency of the fleet for some time now. This is giving us the opportunity to push that even further. 
So we're looking at the operating environment and saying we should continue to lean into the efficiency programs we can. It does help us free up some resources for the growth areas that continue to be a priority, but it is an accentuation of where we were.",336

First, Sundar, you just talked about how once the crisis has passed, the world will not look the same. I'm curious if you can just elaborate a little bit more on how you think Alphabet comes out stronger on the other side of this downturn. And then, Ruth, maybe taking the question on expenses a little bit further. Does this give you any more opportunity to be even more disciplined or diligent on costs on the other side as well?",86
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",2020-04-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3809.0,2017496.0,78937716.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,10,"Thanks, Doug. It's a good question, and we are thinking deeply about it as well. In general, I would say, the highest level of opportunities across everywhere, we see businesses thinking deeper about the shift to digital. And that's true across marketing, cloud, in every place we see that trend. And so part of this is making sure our investments deliver value with respect to that shift. So if you look at advertising, people who in the past may have debated things like how do I get virtual showroom-ing, now, are really thinking about it. People who may have been hesitant to shift their budgets do -- are looking through moments like this and trying to get all that working better. Cloud is an obvious area. Every company has been thinking about digital transformation, but they are asking the questions deeper. For example, if you have data centers, there are fixed costs through something like this. And you learn going through a moment like that, and you're thinking about the opportunity harder. So across everything we do, be it Search, be it YouTube, be it Play, be it Cloud, I think we are investing to capitalize on this long-term opportunity. And I would say, overall, on Alphabet as well, when you look at investments like Waymo and Bing, you can imagine, in the future, these things working well, can play a significant role. And even in the limited areas of [ Ingesan ], we clearly saw its potential through a moment like this. So we're betting on those big trends.",260

I think that the way I would answer that is after a decade of growth, there have to be opportunities for added efficiency, and we've been focused on that for some time. But painful times like this put a spotlight on an urgency around taking -- making sure you're focused on the levers that you have and, hopefully, those instill the right kinds of health metrics, et cetera, against what you're managing. So I would say that the intent most certainly is that these are durable investments to ensure that we're operating as effectively and efficiently as we can be. And I just need to reiterate, and Sundar and I have both said this, we remain committed to investing for the long term. So we're not compromising where we need to invest for long-term growth.

Ruth, I have 2 questions for you, actually. First, I wanted to thank you for the color around the growth you're seeing as you were exiting the quarter in the ad business. And there's been some signs from different partners or different companies that ad spending, while still down considerably, has actually improved a little bit, maybe some green shoots from the declines that you might have been referencing at the end of March. Any chance you can give us a sense of the type of growth you've been seeing for the first kind of 3, 4 weeks of the quarter, just kind of just to help level set us.

So in terms of ads revenue, as I said in the opening comments, for our ads business, a key signal to monitor is macroeconomic performance, which has tended to be correlated with ad spend. And I think it's premature for me to comment on the trend. In terms of what we saw in the first quarter, as I said, for Search and other revenues, they were up 9% year-on-year for the quarter. But in March, revenues began to decline and then ended the month at a mid-teens percentage decline in year-on-year revenues. And then with YouTube, we had strong revenue growth until late in the quarter when trajectories for direct response and brand diverged. And as I said, direct response does continue to have substantial -- had substantial growth throughout the quarter, while brand began to experience a sizable headwind starting in mid-March. So by the end of March, total YouTube ads revenue growth had decelerated to a year-on-year growth rate in the high single digits. 
And then for the second quarter, so far, I think it's premature to gauge given uncertainty in the environment. And a few weeks, obviously, is not a quarter. So in such an unprecedented crisis, I would not want you to extrapolate from just a couple of weeks. That being said, the decline in our search and other ads revenue was abrupt in March. And although we're seeing some early signs at this point that users are returning to more commercial behavior, it's not clear how durable or monetizable that will be. So based on our estimates from the end of March through last week, for Search, we haven't seen further deterioration in the percentage of year-on-year revenue declines. For YouTube, direct response has remained strong. However, we've seen a continued decline in brand advertising, and it's really too early to add more. I think the main point, though, is a few weeks, obviously, is not a quarter. And given it is such an unprecedented environment, I would not extrapolate from these comments for the full quarter. 
And then I'm sorry, you have the second question on the...",357

Sundar, people asked you about your priorities. You talked about it. But I wonder, if you could back and think about what this crisis will do to the other side and maybe for reorienting of your priorities. So perhaps where you would shift spend in the long-term to maybe take advantage of where this is going. 
And then, Ruth, we appreciate the color on YouTube. Just want to dig in some more. If you can give us any sense of YouTube geographies. Is there any difference by change by geography? That's really helpful, too.",103

And we've been convinced for a while that those trends will play out in the long term. And so if anything, through moments like that, the strong foundation we have built allows us to continue to be able to invest in our long-term area. So AI is a good example of it. 
The shift over time on computing to ambient computing is something we are going to be deeply committed to and continue to invest there. Cloud and productivity software for businesses of all sizes is a deep area of investment. And so the thesis still remains. So we continue to focus anywhere we think the actual work we are doing is based on deep technology, deep computing, deep computational scale, is the kind of investments we think still stand the test of time through things like that. 
Beyond that, we are actively looking at how user patterns are emerging. So for example, e-commerce is an area, and you saw us respond through this with the changes we announced on our shopping property and going for comprehensiveness there and with new leaders in place. We're going to be making sure we work on the user experience there. And so we are looking at shifts, be it video conferencing with Google Meet and G suite. And adapting and investing in those areas as well. So that's how we're approaching it.",266

And to give you a little more color there in mid-February, revenue growth across the business began to decelerate in APAC. Although as I noted, the decline in APAC was more muted just given the uneven impact of COVID and the nature of our business across the region. And then the impact in EMEA was first evident in mid-February with a steeper fall off in March. And in the second week of March, we then saw results in the U.S. as well as other Americas fall off shortly. But nothing more specific by product.",127

The first one, Ruth just to go back to your comments around the early signs of improvements in behavior in Search. I know it's early and don't want to over extrapolate, but just any more detail on the types of behavior you're seeing of which verticals or which categories or which geographies where you're seeing sort of the first sign of green shoots on the Search side. 
And then Sundar, just to go back to your comments about the shift toward digital opportunities or digital transformation. Maybe talk to us about, as you sort of look back over the last couple of years at what you've done on the SMB side, and what are sort of 1 or 2 of the key hurdles where you see you really need to invest and build more comprehensive SMB products for post recovery?",143
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",2020-04-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3809.0,2017496.0,78937729.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,23,"Maybe I can give color both on the SMB and a bit on that side, too. On the SMB side, it's an area we've been investing for a while, and obviously, we have assets both across AdWords, Google Maps, Google My Business and, obviously, providing them with G Suite and the tools to get their business running. So I do think we have a lot of touch points. But the focus has been simplifying it, making it more of a one cohesive, easy experience, making sure it works well from mobile, that there is a truly lighter-weight AdWords experience so that they can get onboarded quicker. And so reducing the work they need to, and also, over time, bringing technologies like AI to just make it all much simpler and seamless for them. And it's going to be a continued focus for us and especially scaling this up and making sure it works internationally well as well. We have clear metrics and targets internally, and we are aligning the teams better to get there. And you will see us do more. 
On the ad side, a question -- to your question about maybe I can give more qualitative cover to what Ruth said earlier. And we -- the good thing about search ads and direct response on YouTube as well, but search primarily, is that it's an extraordinarily effective system. It's a transparent system. You have a very clear sense of ROI. It's very measurable, highly cost effective. And so we have always seen, and we saw this in 2008 as well. People respond in the short term, but the recovery is also fast when it comes back, and so it tends to work. It is very diversified, not just geographically by different verticals. And even through moments like that, we do see businesses responding to demand shift. And so we see through our system if people suddenly are looking for office furniture or even pajamas, the system response, right? And so you see the dynamic nature of it. I mentioned earlier, people are really thinking about the shift to digital. So Philipp and our ads team are super engaged with our customers, helping them think through the opportunities through moments like that. I gave an earlier example. If you're thinking about cars and you've been hesitant to do virtual car showroom-ing, now is the time you're beginning to have those conversations in a deeper way. 
There are budgets which are shifting in certain cases. Some of our large customers, maybe they've spent a lot of money on live sports. That is clearly on hold. So they are looking to shift some of those budgets into opportunities they see. But having said that, there are large sectors of the economy which are affected, things like travel and our large partners and customers are impacted. And so we clearly see the impact of that, and that's the color Ruth gave as well.",491

And if we can -- all of Google works this way. Products like Gmail, Google Docs, they're built from the ground up to really help people be productive and collaborative in a distributed work environment. And so we are clearly seeing traction there. Google Meet is seeing great traction. And I gave -- I mentioned some user momentum there. But we have more announcements coming up, including later this week. And so we are seeing tremendous traction and engagement on G Suite. On Cloud, the shift to digital has been a deep trend. And if anything, people are really engaged on it. I earlier talked about, you can imagine if you're a customer and you have data centers, these are fixed costs when you go through moments like this. And so people are really looking at opportunities there. And so our teams are super engaged. But I do want to acknowledge, maybe -- the small businesses across the world are deeply impacted. As a company, we've announced several efforts to support small and medium businesses, and we are going to be deeply engaged with them. But I think it's a tough journey we are all on, and we look forward to working with them to help them through this.",219

Could you explain a little bit more about the reasons for making those changes and expanding the free listings or creating the free listings, and what drove you to make that decision now? 
And then a related follow-up for Ruth, same question essentially. But as we think about the financial impact of such a change, I imagine this is one of those things which may qualify as causing maybe some variability in the quarter-to-quarter rate, but something that benefits all parties over the long term, I think, is how we've often visited these sorts of changes. But any color you could add on sort of the near and the long-term impact of the Google Shopping changes would be great, too.",157

And that's true for Shopping. They spend time discovering. And comprehensiveness really matters. That's how we can have a great user experience. And so as we've been thinking about the space, we realized, and this is our organic search works, for us to truly give that comprehensiveness and the quality of experience, we need the widest catalog possible. And then we are good at ranking it and providing -- and matching users to what they're looking for. And so it is -- it made a lot of sense for us. And just looking through the range of experiences people were seeking through the COVID pandemic validated it even more. And obviously, we have been executing really hard there with new leadership in place. And so we saw the opportunity to go back to our first principles and improve the comprehensiveness there. 
One of the tricky things about when you do that is making sure you don't have spam and you're managing and giving people good quality experiences. And that's where our deeper partnership, be it with PayPal and other providers, so that we get the quality signals and really improve the experience as we improve comprehensiveness. So both of them are going hand-in-hand. And as we've demonstrated with Search, when we improve the organic experience, the advertising experience also gives an opportunity and the system works well. And so I'm really excited about this change. It is still early, and -- but it's been very positively received. And you're going to see us enhance the experience in this area deeply. 
While we talk about Shopping, another area where we are investing and building the right foundation is with Google Pay. And we have great leadership there as well. We've been executing well over there for the past year. And the growth on Google Pay has been strong. And so being able to bring all of that together, along with strong players like PayPal, et cetera, will help us give great experience for our users here.",361

We are obviously making a lot of progress both across GCP and G Suite. And we find our offerings are getting deeper, and we are really helping customers from a deeper standpoint. So we see overall momentum. There are cases where even though the deal trajectory is the same and we have the wins, things are taking a bit longer. Naturally, as you would expect, our customers are impacted through moments like this, too. So I would say time to closing some larger deals are impacted. But companies, if anything, all the way at a CEO level, are thinking about the shift to digital in a deeper way. And I think that's a longer-term trend we are excited about. Obviously, consumption gets impacted, depending on the sectors which companies are in. And so that has some correlation with the general underlying performance of that sector. And so that's something we'll have to wait and see how it develops. But the teams are doing well, and it's an area where we are committed to the course we are on and investing deeply for the long run.",195

Just to reiterate what Sundar said, we're really pleased with the Q1 performance for both GCP and G Suite, and the dynamics affecting cloud are obviously very different than those from ads. And just to build on Sundar's comments with a little more on G Suite and some of our opening comments. In this work from home environment, what we're seeing is significant interest from governments and companies looking for work-for-home solutions. So just to add one more example, Cambridge Health Alliance is a U.S. health system with 140,000 patients. And they relied on G suite to support their staff and caregivers during COVID-19, helping them connect across hospitals, health centers that are from home.

Sundar, the question for you really relates to the resiliency you're seeing with the direct response piece of YouTube. Like, are there specific factors? Or is it a question of mix of advertisers there that's sustaining the growth? 
And then the question for Ruth, you highlighted that this has given you an opportunity to refocus on cost discipline. It looks like that the capital returns by way of buyback will remain quite strong in the quarter. Has this affected your thoughts on buybacks and capital returns going forward?",96

People are turning to YouTube. Our watch time has increased across the board. People are also looking for authoritative news content. Viewership on YouTube has increased significantly compared to last year, too. So in many ways, through the pandemic, people are using YouTube, and the trends are global across North America, EMEA and Asia Pacific as well. 
On direct response, I do think -- I think people are -- it's a journey, and people who have been investing or seeing that it is cost effective. And so over time, more people are looking at it. Our sales teams are doing an excellent job of helping our customers understand the opportunities there. And so being able to bring all of that to bear. In the case of app campaigns, we have done it with universal app campaigns. So we've just made it easier as a customer, not to think about whether you're trying to do this across Search or YouTube, and bring the simple holistic solution. So all of that is impacting. I mentioned gaming earlier. When you think about things like unboxing and product reviews, those are natural home for transactions as well. Now I earlier mentioned about all the work we are doing now on commerce. All of that, I'm looking forward to those integrations coming into YouTube and working better as well.

You mentioned this recovery or modest move up in consumer commercial search queries. Have you also seen a small improvement in advertiser interest in running campaigns. I think you said both of those factors kind of deteriorated in March. One of them came back. Did the other come back, too? You also see advertisers starting to come back. 
And then secondly, the YouTube result in the March quarter was phenomenally strong given what happened in the month of March to YouTube. Is that a comp issue? Was the comp much easier? It sounded like January and February could have been up strong 40% year-over-year. So is there any color? Is that just comps, easy comps? Or was there something that fundamentally changed that caused that kind of material acceleration?",143

So brand is maybe slower to change, both on the downside and the upside, and search is much faster to adapt as well. And so I think that's worth keeping in mind. But overall, look, we see a vibrant system. Advertisers are definitely very engaged in looking at it. And we are seeing active conversations between our teams and our large advertisers where they're trying to understand the demand shifts and how they can respond.

It's certainly been a busy week, and I'm glad to be here. I hope everyone is staying safe and well. All of us at Google continue to send our deepest gratitude to everyone on the front lines of the pandemic all around the world. I also want to personally thank all our employees who continue to work so hard to make sure our products and services are available for everyone right now. People looking for important health information, hard-hit businesses working to inform customers about opening hours or delivery options or teachers connecting to their students. The macroeconomic environment caused by the pandemic created headwinds for our business. Our revenue declined on a reported basis and is flat year-over-year on a fixed FX basis. Like other companies, this quarter, we saw the early signs of stabilization as users return to commercial activity online. This is true across most of our advertising verticals and geographies. Of course, the economic climate remains fragile. 
One thing I'd like to call out is our continuing journey to invest in and grow new businesses. We delivered strong growth in our non-ads revenues particularly from Cloud, Google Play and YouTube subscriptions. This, in turn, is helping our partners, developers and creators earn revenue and deliver valuable services to people. We are focused on the steps to build long-term value with these opportunities. 
Today, I'll review the quarter by walking through the 4 key areas for 2020 that you heard me mention over the last several quarters: creating the most helpful products for everyone; providing the most trusted experiences for our users; executing at scale; and creating sustainable value. 
First, creating the most helpful products for everyone. This has been especially important during this time. We are focused on providing locally relevant, helpful and authoritative information about COVID in over 70 languages in 200 countries. This has been an enormous effort across search and all our products. YouTube, for example, engage with public health officials in over 90 countries and services panels with locally relevant information in response to COVID-19 queries. 
On Google Maps and Search, we now display more than 12,000 COVID-19 testing centers across 20 countries, working with local governments and data providers to source accurate and helpful information. Using our technical capabilities, we are helping people find more information about local businesses such as takeout, curbside, updated hours, donations, gift cards and virtual services. 
With more kids at home, Google Play launched a special kids tab with only teacher-approved apps and YouTube has seen traction with learn at home as well as a virtual summer camp for kids called Camp YouTube, plus a virtual commencement series. 
To help Indian Internet users, we announced a Google for India Digitization Fund. Through this effort, we'll invest approximately $10 billion over the next 5 to 7 years to accelerate and participate in India's burgeoning digital economy. We'll enable information in local languages and apply technology and AI to important areas like health, education and agriculture. Jio platforms is the first partnership agreement in the fund and will work with them to help millions of users in India become owners of smartphones. 
Second, providing trusted experiences for our users. Doing even more to protect users' privacy, keep information safe and provide high-quality information was a key focus this quarter. In one important update, we now set people's location history and web in-app activity to delete automatically after 18 months as the default. We also integrated password checkup into our core security checkup to help people detect any instance of their online accounts being compromised. More than 100 million people have used it. Android 11 Beta launched this quarter with many new features to help people better manage their connected devices. It contains a significant focus on privacy and security, including more granular control over app permissions and restrictions on app's usage of background location. Our exposure notifications API for Android and iOS, developed with Apple, launched this quarter. It's designed to empower public health agencies to create apps to help fight the spread of COVID with the strongest user privacy safeguards. 
As of today, authorities have rolled out official apps in 12 countries to alert people that they were in contact with another person who tested positive for the virus and that they should isolate and get tested. We expect several more apps to launch in the next week or 2, including the first state apps in the U.S. We are also focused on election security efforts around the globe, whether it's removing coordinated foreign influence operations, prevent hacking and phishing attempts or enforcing our political ad policies that require transparency and prohibit narrow micro targeting. 
Moving on now to executing at scale. All businesses are adjusting to work-from-home and we are no exception. While building products across distributed teams was new for us, this experience allowed us to make good use of our infrastructure investments and productivity tools. G Suite products, in particular, Google Meet have been absolutely critical, and we quickly reengineered it and made it available widely to help millions of other businesses and organizations connect and collaborate. 
One area where we have executed really well to improve the user and merchant experience in the last year is shopping. We know that we and merchants face incredible competition for consumer attention and wallets. We are helping merchants lower their costs and improve their reach in a few ways. They can now list their products for free on the Google Shopping tab and on Search helping them drive more traffic and making our results more comprehensive and useful. We also recently announced that sellers on Buy on Google will no longer pay us a commission fee. Plus, we are giving retailers more choice by opening our platform to third-party providers, starting with PayPal and Shopify. Shopping ads also continue to be a great tool for merchants with new visual features for retailers such as smart shopping campaigns that let customers know about free shipping. We are continually adding more ways for advertisers to reach shoppers. 
Now let me talk about our fourth area, building sustainable value, which is all about driving business value for our partners and investing smartly in new areas. In our advertising business, our focus is on helping businesses find customers as they work to rebuild and recover. We gave search advisers the ability to add high-quality images to their ads, helping shoppers quickly see products to consider and take action faster. We added features to make video ads more easily shoppable and browsable on YouTube as more businesses are shifting to online to offset physical store closures. For SMBs, we are proud that so many are taking advantage of new features, including Smart Campaigns to reach new online audiences and promoted pins on Google Maps to let customers know that their businesses are open. And to empower businesses to understand in an easy and visual way, what products people are searching for, during the special circumstances that COVID-19 has created. The rising retail categories, too, surfaces fast-growing product-related categories. 
As I mentioned earlier, beyond advertising revenue, we see good traction in areas such as YouTube subscriptions, Google Play and Cloud. YouTube Premium Music and TV subscriptions performed well during the quarter. We are seeing strong demand for these services and are adding content regularly, including many Viacom networks like BET and Comedy Central. In Q2, Google Play app and game downloads were up more than 35% year-over-year, which means that revenue for developers continue to grow. 
Let me go a bit deeper on Cloud. In the first half of 2020, technology and innovation proved to be a significant recovery mechanism for businesses. Those who are shifting to digital and embracing the spirit to innovate are evolving and growing. Our commitment to bringing innovative products to market, building and scaling our go-to-market organization, and strengthening our partner network helped us continue to meet the growing needs of our customers this quarter. We see 2 distinct trends as businesses embrace the future of work. 
First, the future of business will be more digital. Customers are choosing Google Cloud to either lower their cost by improving operating efficiency or to drive innovation through digital transformation. Brands like Keurig Dr. Pepper, Deutsche Bank, Lowe's, Telefónica, Orange and Group Renault. And we are helping many government agencies deliver care for their citizens, including the states of Oklahoma and New York here in the U.S., and Italy and Spain in Europe. 
Second, the future of work will be more collaborative. Virtual collaboration is critical in order to adapt and succeed in the changing global landscape. In Q2, we saw continued demand from customers using G Suite to help their employees work from home, including Wipro in India and expanded our relationship with the state of Arizona here in the U.S. Our customers are using G Suite tools across industries in new ways, whether it be financial advisers working with clients, doctors and nurses turning to telemedicine or teachers educating students with remote learning. In Q2, we peaked at more than 600 million Meet participants in a single week. As one example, PwC employees reached nearly 10 million hours of video conferencing in Google Meet in a single month. To make collaboration easier for everyone, we introduced an integrated workspace for Gmail, Chat, Meet and Drive on mobile and desktop. Our Cloud product strategy is differentiated and our investments in direct sales and indirect distribution are beginning to deliver results. 
Before I move to Other Bets, I want to note that our hardware team continues to make good progress, and I'm excited by the new upcoming devices we have coming this fall. 
And finally, in our Other Bets. Waymo announced that Fiat Chrysler automobiles will work with Waymo as its strategic partner for L4 autonomous technology across our full portfolio. We also entered into a partnership agreement with Volvo Car Group to work together to integrate the Waymo driver into an all-new electric vehicle platform for ride-hailing services. Finally, Waymo closed its externally-led investment round, bringing the total funding to $3.2 billion, which includes investment from Alphabet. And Wing's drone delivery service started delivering library books to students in Virginia. 
In closing, it's an important and uncertain time in the world. We are all grappling with the pandemic and a struggling economy, while also reckoning with centuries of injustice that affect our Black communities every day. John Lewis' funeral today provides a timely reminder of the struggle. In June, we announced a significant package of commitments to help our Black+ community internally at Google as well as the wider Black community. This included product experiences that matter to Black users, including the option for business owners to identify their business as Black-owned in Google Maps and search. We also announced $175 million economic opportunity package to support Black business owners, start-up founders, job seekers and developers. In addition to YouTube's $100 million fund to amplify Black creators and orders. We commit to contributing to long-term meaningful change, both externally and within Google. 
And with that, I'll now turn it over to Ruth.",1863
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3236.0,2085480.0,81851982.0,Presenter Speech,Ruth Porat,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Sundar. We are cautiously encouraged by our results for the second quarter, although mindful of the fragile global economic environment. Our advertising revenues gradually improved through the quarter, and our nonadvertising revenue lines maintained their strong performance particularly Google Cloud and Play. I will begin with a review of the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google, followed by Other Bets and conclude with outlook. Sundar and I will then take your questions. 
Starting with consolidated Alphabet results, our total revenues in the second quarter were $38.3 billion, down 2% year-on-year and flat in constant currency. Year-on-year declines in our advertising revenues from Search and Network were offset by growth in Google Other and Google Cloud revenues. Details of Alphabet's consolidated revenues by geographic region are available in our earnings press release. Across each region, we saw a gradual improvement in revenues in the quarter with some differences reflecting product mix. In terms of the foreign exchange impact, exchange rate movements resulted in approximately a 2% headwind to reported revenues. 
Regarding our key expense lines. On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, was $18.6 billion, up 7% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $11.9 billion, up 18% year-over-year primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The biggest factors here again this quarter were costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation and then content acquisition costs primarily driven by content costs for YouTube TV and our paid YouTube Music and premium subscription services, followed by costs for YouTube's advertising-supported content. 
Operating expenses were $13.4 billion, up 7% year-on-year. Headcount growth was the largest driver of year-on-year growth for both R&D and G&A. Secondarily, the increase in G&A reflects contributions mainly for COVID response and reserves for estimated credit losses of our customers. The year-on-year decline in sales and marketing expenses was due to lower advertising and promotional spend as we paused or rescheduled campaigns and pivoted to digital formats for flagship events. All 3 categories benefited from lower T&E expenses. Stock-based compensation totaled $3.3 billion. Headcount was up 4,450 from the first quarter. Again, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were again in Google Cloud for both technical and sales roles. 
Operating income was $6.4 billion, down 30% year-over-year, and our operating margin in the quarter was 17%. Other income and expense was $1.9 billion, which primarily reflects an unrealized increase in the market value of equity securities. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. 
Our effective tax rate was 15.9%. Net income was $7 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $10.13. 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $5.4 billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $14 billion with free cash flow of $8.6 billion. We repurchased $6.9 billion of our shares. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $121 billion. 
Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with our Google segment. Revenues were $38 billion, down 2% year-over-year. 
I'll now go through the individual advertising revenue lines. Starting with Google Search and other advertising revenues. We generated $21.3 billion in revenues in the quarter, down 10% year-over-year in the aggregate with improvement as the quarter progressed. We saw a gradual return in user search activity to more commercial topics throughout the quarter followed by an increase in spending by advertisers. This resulted in an improvement in year-on-year search revenue trends during the quarter with Search revenues essentially flat to last year by the end of June. 
YouTube advertising revenues were $3.8 billion, up 6% year-on-year driven by ongoing substantial growth in direct response offset by a continued decline in brand advertising, which then moderated toward the end of the quarter. 
Network advertising revenues were $4.7 billion, down 10% year-on-year with trends improving somewhat toward the end of the quarter as advertisers spend began to return. 
Turning to Google Cloud, including GCP and G Suite. Revenues were $3 billion for the second quarter, up 43% year-over-year. GCP maintained the strong level of revenue growth it delivered in the first quarter, and its revenue growth was again meaningfully above cloud overall. GCP growth was again led by our infrastructure offerings and our data and analytics platform. Overall, the lower Google Cloud revenue growth in the second quarter relative to the first quarter reflects the fact that G Suite lapped a price increase that was introduced in April last year. G suite maintained healthy growth in average revenue per seat as well as in seat growth, which does not include customers who took advantage of our free trials as they shifted their employees to work-from-home. 
Other revenues were $5.1 billion, up 26% year-over-year primarily driven by growth in Play and YouTube nonadvertising revenues. Within Play, app revenues in the second quarter benefited from the impact of very strong growth in the number of active buyers with more people at home looking for entertainment. Within YouTube subscription revenues, we continue to benefit from subscriber growth across its various offerings. Total traffic acquisition costs were $6.7 billion or 22% of total advertising revenues and down 8% year-over-year. Total TAC, as a percentage of total advertising revenues, was up slightly year-over-year. 
Google operating income was $7.6 billion, down 26% versus last year, and the operating margin was 20%. Google accrued CapEx for the quarter was $4.8 billion, reflecting investments in servers, data centers and office facilities. 
Moving on to the performance of Other Bets. For the second quarter, revenues were $148 million primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. The operating loss was $1.1 billion. 
Let me end with our outlook. As I said earlier, ads revenue gradually improved during the quarter across Search, YouTube and network. However, we believe it is premature to gauge the durability of recent trends, given the obvious uncertainty of the global macro environment. 
As we discussed on last quarter's earnings call, global macroeconomic performance has tended to be correlated with ad spend and is a key signal to monitor. Over the long term, we remain optimistic about the underlying strength of our business. 
In terms of Google Cloud, we are pleased with the traction we're having with large customers who are making multiyear commitments with us. This is reflected in the strength of our backlog, which ended the quarter at $14.8 billion, substantially all of which relates to Google Cloud. This performance is a result of the investments we are making into the cloud go-to-market organization. Google Play's Q2 results reflect growth in the number of new buyers with accelerated adoption as people stayed home. Performance also reflects the significant investments we have made in the ecosystem to support developers and users, such as successful promotion and adoption of our partners' apps and games in new locales around the world and expanding the availability of local forms of digital payments. 
Moving on to profitability. The decline in our Search revenues put significant pressure on profitability, which was further impacted by our ongoing investments for long-term growth. As I discussed last quarter, much of our expense base, both in cost of revenues and OpEx is not directly correlated with changes in revenues. For example, although TAC and content acquisition costs are obviously tied to revenues, there's a sizable percentage of items in other cost of revenues that are generally less variable in nature, such as depreciation and operations costs of our technical infrastructure as well as for activities like customer support and content review. We remain focused on the user and customer experience, and we'll continue to invest to support our products. .
With respect to operating expenses, although we still expect the pace of headcount growth to decelerate somewhat in 2020, we're continuing to hire aggressively in priority areas like cloud. We still expect that headcount additions will be seasonally higher in Q3 as we bring on new graduates. Consistent with prior years, we expect sales and marketing expenses to be more heavily weighted to the back half of the year, in part to support product launches and the holiday season. 
Turning to CapEx. We continue to expect a modest decrease in the level of total CapEx in 2020 compared with last year. This is particularly due to our decision to slow the pace at which we acquire office buildings in the near term as we focus on reimagining the optimal work environment. This also reflects the slower pace of ground-up construction for both our office facilities and data centers due to COVID-19. In terms of technical infrastructure, as we discussed last quarter, we anticipate investment to remain at roughly the same level as in 2019 with relatively more spend on servers than on data center construction and benefiting from our ongoing focus on server efficiency. With respect to capital allocation, our primary use of capital continues to be, to support organic growth in our businesses followed by retaining flexibility for acquisitions and investments. We complement these growth drivers with a return of capital. As we indicated in our press release today, our Board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $28 billion of our Class C stock. Thank you, and Sundar and I will now take your questions.",1576

One, on the commerce initiatives, a lot of announcements from the company in the quarter, moving towards sort of commission-free and amplifying both the advertising and e-commerce efforts. I want to understand some of the moves you're making strategically and how you think that positions you broadly against, obviously, an e-commerce landscape that's seeing a lot of pulled forward penetration given the current environment. And second on YouTube, obviously, a fairly volatile brand advertising environment and TV advertising remains in flux. What are the opportunities both in the U.S. and globally to go after sort of TV ad budgets under the YouTube umbrella?",110
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3236.0,2085480.0,81851985.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,6,"On Shopping, I spoke a little bit in my remarks, but really excited at the potential there. The team has been executing very well. Overall, users come to Google a lot to find the products they are looking for, but we see an opportunity to invest and make the experience better. Sometimes the journeys may fail because they don't find what they're looking for. So we want to make sure it's comprehensive. 
Next when people find what they like, we want to make it simple for them to transact. And so working on that end-to-end experience has been a big focus. And obviously, making sure for merchants, really making sure we are open to business for merchants, and we are giving value to them has been the focus. The early indications are that users are responding positively, both in terms of user engagement and more importantly, giving value back to merchants for their investment there. So in some ways, it's a return to our first principles. We want to ensure that Google is the best place for merchants to connect with users. And so I'm excited by it, and you'll continue to see us focus in this area. 
The second was on YouTube brand. Obviously, YouTube has been doing well in terms of engagement and watch time. And so we see a long-term opportunity there. We've had strength on direct response as well through this quarter. But on brand, which was your question, we are obviously investing not just in YouTube main product, YouTube TV as well. And so areas where we can offer a bundle, advertisers are interested in streaming, and so bringing that bundle together, especially to advertisers and upfronts through YouTube Select is a big opportunity as well. So we are focused on that.",297

Just first, Ruth, curious if you can just talk about the cost structure a little bit more. We know you'll continue to invest to drive growth over the long term. Just curious how you're thinking about it as the top line starts to recover more hopefully over coming quarters. And then secondly, I know you said that search trends were flat to last year by the end of June. Just curious if there's anything you could add in terms of what you've seen more recently over the last month as well.",94
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3236.0,2085480.0,81851988.0,Answer,Ruth Porat,,Executives,9,"Thanks for this, Doug. So in terms of cost structure, as we talked about last quarter, we have been focused on taking steps to enhance efficiency in the near term. And that being said, as Sundar and I both noted, what you're seeing is the fact that we do remain focused on investing for the long term. So sort of breaking that down in cost of revenues, while TAC and content acquisition costs are obviously tied to revenues, there is a sizable percentage of other cost of revenues that are not directly correlated with revenue growth, as I noted in opening comments, and we are very focused on the user experience and the overall ecosystem. So we are investing to make sure that we're supporting our products so they remain reliable in all environments. 
And then in OpEx, much of our operating expense is generally less variable and not necessarily correlating to revenues in the near term. So in terms of a couple of the items, although we do continue to expect the year-on-year headcount growth rate to decelerate, as I noted, we are hiring aggressively in priority areas like Cloud. And so we're taking near-term steps to enhance efficiency but still investing for the long term. So we're trying to make sure that we're getting those tradeoffs right. And as I noted, we do expect the year-on-year headcount growth rate in 2020 to be down somewhat from the 20% year-on-year rate last year, and that's even adjusting for 2 items that put upward pressure on headcount growth. The first, we're moving certain customer support roles from third-party vendors to Google's in-house operation center. That is actually OpEx neutral, but does increase reported spend. And then second, the pending acquisition of Fitbit. So we're trying to navigate it appropriately. 
In terms of your second question, in terms of search trends and what we saw throughout the quarter, I would say that following a rough end to the first quarter, ads revenue gradually improved in the quarter, not only in Search, but YouTube and Network. And so for Search, we ended March at a mid-teens percentage decline in year-on-year revenues. And then as we progressed through the second quarter, we saw a gradual return in user search activity to more commercial topics, and then that was followed by an increase in spending by advertisers. So that resulted in a gradual improvement in year-on-year Search revenue trends in the second quarter. We ended basically flat to last year by the end of June and you know to carry it forward, although we're pleased that ads revenue gradually improved throughout the quarter. 
As I said, we do believe it's premature to say, they were out of the woods given the fragile nature of the macro environment. And as you're aware, ad spend does tend to be correlated with macroeconomic performance. And so the macro backdrop will continue to be a key signal to monitor. But to your question, based on our estimates from the end of June through last quarter, there has been a modest improvement in July.",515

One, Sundar, I was wondering if you could share with us how you've seen the change in pace of customers migrating workloads to the cloud given COVID? And I'm also wondering if you could share with us kind of the puts and takes, and Microsoft talked about this a little bit last week with their Azure business, but for those that have accelerated workload migration to the cloud, how much has that offset the impacted industries or companies that you might be serving where they're seeing lower utilization than what they normally do of cloud capacity?

Overall, from my vantage point, obviously with Google Cloud, we've been investing to scale up, especially on the people side, on engineering, go-to-market and then, obviously on our investment side with data centers, cloud regions and so on. And so for me, it's been good to see as we are scaling up, we are executing more effectively. I've been personally involved in many, many conversations last quarter. We had many large customers come on to cloud, big telco deals and banking deals, Deutsche Bank, as an example. So overall, I felt the momentum was strong. Generally, felt like things were continuing well through the course. Felt like more a secular interest in our digital transformation companies are deeply thinking long term and planning for us. So overall, I felt at the moment, almost there. And I felt our execution as we are scaling up. Obviously, we are scaling up a lot. And so it's -- the combination is working well. 
Your second question in terms of puts and takes. Overall, I think there are -- I won't -- I don't know whether there's anything significant worth for me highlighting.

The first one, Sundar, we try to always figure out changes in consumer behavior. I guess as you have sort of been studying what people have been doing through shelter-in-place and from the way things are changing from a consumer perspective, talk to us about areas you're most focused on, investing in and driving your teams to create new products to really help consumers with their changing habits. And then the second one, Ruth, I know as we sort of we look ahead with potentially a larger percentage of the workforce, work remote or work from home, without looking for quantification, maybe just talk to us about some puts and takes to areas where you could see either efficiency or higher potential costs from a larger percentage of the workforce being remote over the long term.",139
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3236.0,2085480.0,81851994.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,15,"Yes. On the first one, when there is -- the shift to online is profound. We see people engaging a lot, doing newer things than they did before. People's interests have -- are broadening, I would say, across the board. And so for example, we are -- for me, I'm looking at different types of user journeys and making sure each of them is getting deeper and better. So for example, in Google, as people have started coming for more health-related information, how is that experience working, thinking about that for the long-term and investing in it. I obviously spoke about shopping earlier, and that's been a big focus for us. Education in general. And when we think through small, medium businesses and bigger companies thinking through collaboration, where G Suites' potential is, the investments we are undertaking, all that is very exciting to me. 
But I would say cutting underneath all that, maybe while we didn't talk about it, really focused on our AI teams doing the investments they need, evolving our next-generation TPUs and the team's building better models and better algorithms. All that, I think, our ability to do more things is something I'm really interested in and focused on as well. So that's something I'm excited about -- for the longer term.",216

So that's where I would actually start, but I appreciate what you're asking is how are we looking at our own cost base. And we called that out last quarter, in particular, with respect to CapEx, and you can sort of see it here this quarter. The main change in CapEx has really been we slowed the pace on the office facilities front. And what we're looking at is really how to reimagine what the workplace will look like. We continue to be very much focused on the fact that place and space are important. We believe in collaboration. Serendipity is key to innovation. So we do view space in office as important and are very focused on what does that mean over the long term. 
We've actually opened quite a number of our offices, in fact, in 40 countries and do hope to reopen in many more. But your question to what does it mean for overall cost structure, we're looking at that with the place you see it now is in our CapEx, and the way we've been looking at it and our indication that we do expect 2020 will be lower CapEx on the facility side as a result.",241

29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3236.0,2085480.0,81851998.0,Answer,Ruth Porat,,Executives,19,"Sure. I already commented on that with respect to Search, but to broaden it a bit more, and again, this is based on estimates from the end of June through last week. So for YouTube, we ended March with a year-on-year growth rate in the high single digits, and that's reflecting a substantial headwind from brand. The headwind from brand moderated modestly at the end of the second quarter, and then we saw a further improvement in July. Direct response has been consistently strong. 
For Network, revenues improved toward the end of the second quarter, and we have seen a further slight improvement in July. Obviously, 3 weeks is not a quarter, but that's based on the estimates here from the end of June. And then as Sundar and I both said, when you look at, for example, Cloud, it has maintained its strength consistently. And I'd say that with a business that's growing at this pace, it's really much more about a secular trend to the move to cloud. So really nothing to comment on there.",177

Sundar, I don't know how much you can comment on the regulatory environment, but it's obviously top of mind with the hearing yesterday. Maybe just characterize it for Google right now. And are you seeing any progress with the regulatory environment? And then secondly, we saw the YouTube TV price increase, a pretty interesting business model. But longer term, do you see that as really strategically important for the YouTube brand? Or do you think you can have a really profitable business on that?",85
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3236.0,2085480.0,81852001.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,22,"On the regulatory front, we've obviously been operating under scrutiny for a while, and we realize, at our scale, that's appropriate. And we've engaged constructively across jurisdictions. And from my standpoint, I'm confident in the approach we take, our focus on users and in the evidence in almost all areas we operate in. We expand choice or overall lower prices. And it's -- overall, there's a very fast pace of innovation. So it's dynamic and competitive. 
Having said that, obviously, we will operate based on the rules. And so to the extent there are any areas where we need to adapt, we will. And as a company, I think we will be, I think, being flexible around those things is important, I think. I think the scrutiny is going to be here for a while, and so we are committed to working through it. On the second question around YouTube TV, yes, there is -- I mean it's a good question. I spoke earlier about even from a brand and how people think about it, they are interested in streaming. So as YouTube TV gets more scale, I think we will see more opportunities there. We are obviously still in the early stages of building out the product. And just recently, we've added a bunch of new channels and making sure it's working well. 
In the U.S., the TV market is a big part of the advertising market, too. So overall, if we can invest here and scale up, I think the synergies with YouTube will become more meaningful over time. And so excited the traction the product is getting. But still too early.",274

I was hoping you might be able to expand on the earlier comment you made about the AI strategy. I'm particularly wondering, if there's been things over the past 5 months since the pandemic began, that you thought an expansion of a very high strategy or an evolution of the past strategy might be able to solve for whether that relates to commercialization or monetization or really anything across the business. Just really, really curious.",80

So I'm very happy with the pace at which our R&D on AI is progressing. And for me, it's important that we are state-of-the-art as a company, and we are leading. And to me, I'm excited at the pace at which our engineering and R&D teams are working both across Google and DeepMind. So I'm excited about it. Specifically, we are making good progress in areas like language understanding. And you saw some improvements last year, significant improvements with BERT and Search. But BERT took us a few years to get there. But things like that, I see more stuff in the future. And so excited by it. 
An area where I think we are still under-tapped vis-à-vis potential is definitely Cloud. We see the potential there. But -- and I think it's a bit related to Heather's question, too. I think companies are thinking about migrating workloads and so on. But the longer run opportunity of actually using AI to truly have business solutions for you for whatever industry you are in, that feels like there's a lot of potential, and we are still very early there. And so part of it is, for us, connecting the dots internally and bringing it as solutions to our users. We have done it in certain product areas, but I see there's a bigger opportunity in the future.",240

I just had 2 questions. First, on YouTube subscription. So can you talk about the size of that area of the business relative to that $15 billion? We had it at about 15% of total YouTube revenue. And then how is the faster growth in that area relative to advertising impacting your long-term profitability goals at YouTube? And then the second question is on Search. So it sounds like the flat exit run rate year-on-year is pretty encouraging. If we strip out travel, I'm guessing it's well above that. So how would you characterize the query growth versus just the ad auction dynamics outside of travel across the other categories? Are we back to pre-COVID levels in those areas?",120
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3236.0,2085480.0,81852007.0,Answer,Ruth Porat,,Executives,28,"So in terms of the first question, we haven't broken out the specifics within the YouTube subscription revenues. YouTube subscriptions are in other revenues, it's not in advertising revenues. And overall, as we think about the opportunity -- our view is -- and we talked about this when we were launching the subscription product, it was really responsive to what we were hearing from users. And as we look at it, music is a key part of the overall YouTube experience. It's an important component of watch time. And what we found is that users wanted -- they wanted choice and some wanted a premium YouTube experience with ad-free viewing and the ability to download songs and videos. And that was really the impetus. 
In addition, YouTube Premium provides additional revenue streams for music labels and publishers. So for example, in 2019, YouTube paid the music industry over $3 billion. And what we've done is meaningfully ramp our geographic presence from 5 countries in the beginning of 2018 to 94 countries today. And earlier this year, we announced that YouTube Premium had more than 20 million paid subscribers, up more than 60% versus the prior year. So our subscriber numbers have continued to grow there, and it really was driven by the goal to give users choice.",217

Beyond the marketplace functionality and some of the free year promotional transactions, I wonder how some of the other initiatives are going to play a role. And things I'm thinking specifically are, were you focused before on Google Checkout and Maps and some of the assistant functionality, how those may play a changing role in commerce on the Google platform.",72

I think the bar is to have that super simple experience, which is delightful and that you have peace of mind and satisfaction in terms of getting the product and being able to return it and so on. So the end-to-end funnel matters a lot. And part of the reason why through the changes, a couple of things we have done. As you saw, we changed and we removed the commission for merchants to be on the platform. And part of it is by removing that. They can take that and invest in, be it shipping, be it delivery, be it the customer experience. And so that matters, matters I think in the overall experience. 
And from our standpoint, the Buy on Google experience is something which deeply investing in. Obviously, our integrations with PayPal, our investments are underlying it to make sure for a lot of users that it's as close to a one-click experience as possible is a big part of the investment as well.",170

Google's place or position, whatever, in online retail. And I asked this because Google has also -- obviously been central. Search has been central, but also YouTube has been central to commerce, online commerce for the last 20 years. We've gone through this pandemic where there's a real inflection point. We see it in Amazon's results. We see it in Shopify's results. And I'm not sure I see it in Google's results. So just talk about how you think, broadly, Google is positioned for what's really been like a 2- or 3-year pull-forward in accelerated ramp up of online retail demand. And are you positioned the way you want to be positioned now? Are there things you need to make to the -- changes you needed to make the products and services to be better positioned?",145

And it's not just product, it's services, it's wide areas, including areas like travel. So it's diversified. And -- but it also means through a pandemic, there are areas of strength, but there are areas of -- areas where you get impacted as well. So I think that's what is reflected in what you see. On e-commerce, you're right, direct e-commerce providers are seeing a big inflection point. But in it are essential categories like groceries and stuff, which are built in, which we don't directly play in. But to us, the reason we are doing this long-term focused effort on shopping with the new leadership team is to precisely make sure as a platform, we are improving and as the shift continues, Google continues to be an important place by which people come and participate in those journeys. 
So long run, I see a growth opportunity with related to what we are investing in there as well. Not just through Search, but a Search in the Shopping investments we are making, but in YouTube, and also helping retailers on the cloud side. It's an area where there's naturally a lot of interest to work -- to partner with Google, and so we see that as a big opportunity as well.",230

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Sundar Pichai and Ruth Porat.
Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance, including the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on those areas, may be considered forward-looking. And such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.

This quarter, our performance was consistent with the broader online environment. It's also a testament to the investment we have made to improve Search and deliver a highly relevant experience that people turn to for help in moments big and small. We saw an improvement in advertiser spend across all geographies and most of our verticals.
With the world accelerating its transition to online and digital services, in Q3 we also saw strength in Google Cloud, Play and YouTube subscriptions. This is the third quarter we are reporting earnings during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Access to information has never been more important. This year, including this quarter, showed how valuable Google's founding product, Search, has been to people. And importantly, our products and investments are making a real difference as businesses work to recover and get back on their feet. Whether it's finding the latest information on COVID-19 cases in their area, which local businesses are open or what online courses will help them prepare for new jobs, people continue to turn to Google Search. 
You can now find useful information about offerings like no-contact delivery or curbside pickup for 2 million businesses on Search and Maps. And we have used Google's Duplex AI technology to make calls to businesses and confirm things like temporary closures. This has enabled us to make 3 million updates to business information globally.
We know that people's expectations for instant perfect searches are high. That's why we continue to invest deeply in AI and other technologies to ensure the most helpful search experience possible. 
Two weeks ago, we announced a number of Search improvements, including our biggest advancement in our spelling systems in over a decade, a new approach to identifying key moments in videos and one of people's favorites, hum to search, which will identify a song and artist based only on humming. We also announced that Bird, a huge breakthrough in natural language understanding that we introduced last year, now improves results for almost every English search query.
We are also investing in improving the shopping experience in Search to help people find the best products and prices available from a wide range of merchants. We recently added easy-to-see price comparisons to help consumers know if they are getting a good deal. We have also improved our features like price tracking so people can request an alert if there is a discount on a product they are following.
These investments are also benefiting merchants and advertisers and helping them recover. As of today, merchants can list products for free on our Shopping tab in 48 countries around the world. For advertisers, we recently announced a new Insights page in Google Ads to help businesses better understand consumer trends and track current search demand for products and services.
We're also investing to create improved search experiences that provide additional value to news publishers. We recently committed $1 billion in investments that include licensing content from national, regional and local news publishers for Google News Showcase, a new product that features the editorial curation of award-winning news shows. We have signed partnerships with nearly 200 publications around the world, with more to come. 
We know our success in Search is not guaranteed. We are proud that people choose Google Search not because they have to but because it's helpful. We remain committed to investing to build the most helpful, most trusted search experience, just as we have for the last 22 years. 
On that note, regarding the DOJ's lawsuit, we believe that our products are creating significant consumer benefits, and we'll confidently make our case. Our company's focus remains on continuing our work to build a Search product that people love and value.
Moving on to other parts of our business this quarter. In hardware, we highlighted some great new products available for the holidays. Our new Pixel phones bring together the very best of Google's hardware, software and AI at an affordable price with new camera and assistant features. And our latest Chromecast now comes with Google TV, which brings together movies, shows and live TV from across apps and subscriptions and organizes them for you. We are pleased with the positive reviews, and we have a terrific product road map ahead.
On to YouTube. People come to YouTube for entertainment, information and opportunities to learn something new. As a sign of the times, views for guided meditation videos are up 40% since mid-March, while DIY facemask tutorials have been viewed over 1 billion times. YouTube subscriptions also continued to grow. YouTube now has over 30 million music and premium paid subscribers and over 35 million including those on free trials. YouTube TV now has more than 3 million paid subscribers.
Next, Cloud. Three trends are driving the continued momentum of our Cloud business. First, as the shift to digital accelerates, Google Cloud continues to provide a foundation for data processing and analytics, one of the fastest-growing segments of the market. BigQuery, which provides real-time and predictive analytics, is winning retailers like Best Buy, helping them create better experiences for shoppers. Customers value our differentiated AI/ML-based industry-specific solutions. This is leading to significant wins with brands like Unilever, Amwell and Reckitt Benckiser.
Additionally, we are working with government agencies like the U.S. Navy to modernize maintenance operations for vessels and facilities. We are also partnering with the Defense Innovation Unit, part of the U.S. Department of Defense, to help military doctors with cancer detection research. And recently, we signed an enterprise agreement with the U.S. Department of Energy to help scale research efforts and innovate across national labs and field sites.
Second, customers are increasingly moving to the cloud to drive efficiencies and lower IT costs. Our strength in multi-cloud is an advantage here. This is helping us win large data center and IT transformation deals like Nokia, which recently announced it's migrating and modernizing approximately 30 data centers across 12 countries on to Google Cloud.
And third, the future of work is creating a more collaborative world. Customers are looking to support hybrid work environments, and we are seeing significant growth in demand. Earlier this month, we announced Google Workspace, which brings together all our communication and collaboration apps and ensures they work better together. This is helping organizations like the state of West Virginia and shipping company Ocean Network Express improve collaboration and productivity for their employees. Google Workspace continues to grow. For example, Google Meet saw a peak in Q3 of 235 million daily meeting participants and more than 7.5 billion daily video call minutes.
Finally, in our Other Bets, Waymo announced its fully autonomous ride-hailing service in suburban Phoenix will open to the public, making it the only company to offer a fully autonomous service for riders. Waymo also entered into a strategic global partnership with Daimler Trucks to enable fully autonomous trucking.
Before I close, I want to reiterate our 4 key areas of focus, which you've heard me talk about all year. First, creating the most helpful products for everyone. Our investments in Search, Maps and Shopping that I discussed earlier as well as YouTube are prime examples. Second, providing the most trusted experiences for our users. We continue to work hard to keep users safe and put them in control of their information. Every day, Gmail blocks more than 100 million phishing attempts, and Google Play Protect scans over 100 million apps for malware and other issues. Third, executing at scale productively, securely and collaboratively; and finally, creating sustainable value, which means creating financially viable and self-sustaining products.
Before I hand over to Ruth, one important update. Starting with the results for the fourth quarter of 2020, we'll break out Google Cloud as a separate reporting segment. I'm working with Ruth and Thomas Kurian to make investment decisions to drive progress here. As we have told you on these calls, given the progress we are making and the opportunity for Google Cloud in this growing global market, we continue to invest aggressively to build our go-to-market capabilities, execute against our product road map and extend the global footprint of our infrastructure. With this segmentation, you will additionally see information about the scale of our investments, which would help you gauge the progress we are making on the multiyear path ahead to create sustainable value.
Thanks to all the Googlers around the world for everything you're doing to help our users and partners. I hope everyone stays safe. And let me reiterate my gratitude to essential workers, health care providers, first responders, teachers and scientists everywhere.
With that, I'll now turn it over to Ruth.",1449
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2020",2020-10-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,2717.0,2154237.0,84653358.0,Presenter Speech,Ruth Porat,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Sundar. We are very pleased by our results in the third quarter, which reflect both broad-based increases in advertiser spending in Search and YouTube as well as ongoing strength in our non-advertising revenue lines, in particular Google Cloud and Play.
Starting with consolidated Alphabet results, our total revenues in the quarter were $46.2 billion, up 14% year-on-year and up 15% in constant currency. Our total cost of revenues was $21.1 billion, up 20% year-on-year, primarily driven by other cost of revenues, which was $13 billion and up 29% year-over-year. The biggest factors here again this quarter were costs associated with our data centers and other operations including depreciation and then content acquisition costs, primarily driven by costs for YouTube's advertising supported content followed by costs for subscription service content.
Operating expenses were $13.8 billion, up 1% year-on-year, reflecting both the impact of actions taken earlier in the year as a result of COVID as well as lapping a $554 million legal settlement in the third quarter of 2019. In terms of the 3 component parts of OpEx, first, the deceleration in R&D growth was due primarily to slower head count. Second, the year-on-year decline in sales and marketing expenses reflects a planned reduction in advertising and promotional spend that we implemented toward the end of the first quarter. Third, G&A growth reflects the lapping of the settlement. All 3 categories benefited from lower T&E expenses due to COVID.
Head count was up 4,623 from the second quarter. Again, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable head count increases were again in Google Cloud for both technical and sales roles.
Operating income was $11.2 billion, up 22% year-over-year. And our operating margin in the quarter was 24%.
Other income and expense was $2.1 billion, which primarily reflects unrealized gains in the value of investments in equity securities. Net income was $11.2 billion. Operating cash flow was $17 billion, with free cash flow of $11.6 billion in the quarter and $34 billion in the trailing 12 months. We ended the third quarter with $133 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with our Google segment. Total Google revenues were $46 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Google Search and other advertising revenues were $26.3 billion in the quarter, up 6% year-over-year, as advertiser spend began to pick up in August.
YouTube advertising revenues were $5 billion, up 32% year-on-year driven by ongoing substantial growth in direct response followed by a rebound in brand advertising from increased spending by advertisers. Network advertising revenues were $5.7 billion, up 9% year-on-year.
Turning to Google Cloud, including GCP and Google Workspace, which was previously known as G Suite. Revenues were $3.4 billion for the third quarter, up 45% year-over-year. GCP maintained the very strong level of revenue growth it delivered in the second quarter, and its revenue growth rate was again meaningfully above Cloud overall. Growth in Google Workspace revenues was driven by seat growth followed by growth in average revenue per seat. 
Other revenues were $5.5 billion, up 35% year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in Play and YouTube non-advertising revenues. Within Play, app revenues in the third quarter benefited primarily from an increase in the number of active buyers as well as increased spend per buyer. Within YouTube subscription revenues, we continued to benefit from subscriber growth across its various offerings.
Google operating income was $12.6 billion, up 17% versus last year. And the operating margin was 27%.
As to our Other Bets, revenues in the third quarter were $178 million. The operating loss was $1.1 billion.
Let me end with our outlook. Regarding revenues, in the third quarter, we benefited from a broad-based improvement in advertiser spend across all geographies and nearly all verticals. This is reflected in both search results as well as the rebound in brand advertising spend on YouTube. While we're pleased with our performance in the third quarter, there is obviously uncertainty in the external environment.
In terms of Google Cloud, we're pleased with the consistent strong revenue growth that you saw again this quarter, reflecting the extraordinary secular trend underway. And with respect to other revenues, the primary driver of growth was Play, where revenue growth reflected elevated engagement during the pandemic on top of strong underlying growth. There are signs that user behavior is beginning to return to normalized levels.
Moving on to profitability. We are pleased with the improvement in profitability versus the prior quarter, reflecting both the revenue performance versus Q2 as well as the tactical adjustments we made to slow down certain categories of spend in response to COVID. In particular, the deceleration in head count growth this quarter reflects the actions we took at the outset of the pandemic to focus hiring on our highest-priority areas like Google Cloud. Excluding the impact of closing the pending Fitbit acquisition, we expect a moderate further deceleration in the pace of head count growth in the fourth quarter.
We also saw the impact of steps we took to slow down some categories of marketing spend. In the third quarter, sales and marketing expenses declined year-on-year, primarily due to a planned slowdown in ads and promo. We expect a more moderated year-on-year decline in sales and marketing in the fourth quarter as we increase spend sequentially to support product launches and the holiday season.
Turning to Capex. Once again, this quarter we had a year-on-year decline in investments, primarily due to a reduced pace of real estate acquisitions, which we implemented at the outset of the pandemic. Servers continue to be the largest driver of investment in the third quarter, followed by data centers. Our CapEx outlook for the full year has not changed as we continue to expect a modest decrease in 2020 compared with last year.
Looking ahead, we remain focused on making the right investments to support growth. As Sundar said in his opening comments, we continue to invest where we see the potential to create long-term sustainable financial value, including investing aggressively to support growth in Cloud. In addition, given the acceleration in digital transformation, we are focused on ensuring that we remain well positioned to deliver for users and advertisers in this evolving environment.
Thank you. Sundar and I will now take your questions.",1061

You called out some of the innovation you're aiming for over the medium to long term with respect to Search. Could you take a step back and maybe give us your sense of how Search is going to evolve from the product it is today where there's a lot of input by the user? Just sort of the push dynamic with the Discover feed and Discovery ads and things that could drive both engagement and monetization across your platform.
And the second part of the question was it seems like you're taking a little bit of a different tactic with your hardware strategy this year. There was a little bit less of it, and it was more on mid- to lower end of the price range of hardware. How does hardware and broadly timely Assistant into the hardware strategy fit broadly, Sundar, into your view for where Search is going for the medium to long term?",167
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2020",2020-10-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,2717.0,2154237.0,84653361.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,6,"Thanks, Eric. Good questions. On Search, you're right, today particularly with mobile and with ambient computing, that is you having access to computing across other form factors, I think information, both you go looking for it, and there are times it's important that you have relevant information at your fingertips. So I do think about it as a holistic user journey. And obviously in Search, we'll continue to evolve. 
Discover has been very good in terms of -- Discover and YouTube both play a role in making sure people are getting relevant information. And I think for us, it's important holistically, we are meeting users' information needs, and out of which the monetization opportunity also works as well. So long -- this is why be it Discover or be it how we pick up on YouTube, all of that matters for us. 
On your second question on hardware, I'm excited about the -- we are doing some deeper investments in hardware, which are -- some of it takes 2 to 3 years to come together. And so I'm excited at the terrific road map ahead. I think we have definitely shown with Pixel 4a, Pixel 5, clear value proposition, and we'll build on that. 
Our portfolio, we are thoughtfully thinking about what are the important form factors which matters. And we do think about it with a view of where Search and Assistant will be important as well. So in many ways, hardware is there to strategically benefit both how we guide the Android ecosystem, how do we make sure information is right there at users' fingertips. And so those are both strategic views we take into it as well. 
But I'm excited about the road map ahead. And next year, you will see us lean more into -- some of our deeper investments will come into play there.",309

I was just hoping that you could help us understand the cost structure a little bit more kind of as we're coming out of this and just whether you're anticipating any more notable changes just coming out of the pandemic, kind of around the sustainability of the margin improvements that you saw in this quarter.",66

So as I said, as a result of COVID, we did make tactical adjustments to slow the pace of spend in certain categories. And that started late in the first quarter. And in part, that's what you see here, plus the impact from the improvements in revenue performance. 
And we do remain focused on optimizing efficiency where we can. We've said that on many prior calls. But as we also discussed with you on prior calls, as both Sundar and I noted today, we are committed to making the right investments to support long-term profitable growth. 
I think what's exciting in this environment, there appears to be an acceleration in digital transformation that underscores the importance of the products and services that we provide and the longer-term opportunities. So we will continue to invest to best position us for the long-term opportunity. 
An obvious example is Cloud. We do intend to maintain a high level of investment given the opportunity we see. That includes the ongoing increases in our go-to-market organization, our engineering organization as well as the investments to support the necessary CapEx. So hopefully that gives you a bit more color there.",198

Just Thomas has been the head of Google Cloud now for around 2 years, if I remember correctly. I'm just wondering, what do you see as the biggest changes he's put into place that has allowed the business to start gaining what appears to be materially more share? And as you look ahead to 2021 and what's going on with digital transformation, what would you say his top strategic priorities would be?",79
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2020",2020-10-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,2717.0,2154237.0,84653367.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,12,"Thanks, Heather. A couple of things stand out for me. I think it's been a very consistent focused strategy. So the focus on the 5 major geographies, the 4 customer segments and the 6 priority industries, health care, retail, financial services, media and entertainment, manufacturing and public sector, that focus in going deeper and scaling our go-to-market both in terms of our people, our partner -- partners, I think that's been key. 
The second thing I would say is some of the key differentiators are playing out particularly as we have taken them deeper as unique industry solutions. So going deeper and having solutions and in some of those cases where we are now pricing based on value, I think that kind of deeper play is something I'm very excited about, definitely have strength in -- just based on our underlying technology. So we do have differentiation in areas like data analytics, AI, et cetera. So that's been huge as well. 
But I'm pleased with the execution obviously in the -- in this -- there is a time lag between when you hire the sales and when we train and when you enable them to be more productive. And that's the investment Ruth has been talking about. And I can see it ramping, and I can see the results come into play. So credit towards that focus and execution, and so looking forward to the next phase.",237

And it seems to become increasingly competitive within the e-commerce funnel. So maybe talk to us about, one, what types of consumer behavior changes are you seeing within e-commerce search on the platform? And then in your mind, what are the key priorities of investment you need to really execute on to ensure you stay at the top of the funnel within e-commerce?",72
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2020",2020-10-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,2717.0,2154237.0,84653370.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,15,"I think things that stand out, first of all, I'm excited at the set of announcements and progress we've had in the last few months. And obviously, we're really focused on the user experience. And we want to make sure as a consumer, you have wide, comprehensive, high-quality inventory and offerings and experience on the platform. 
Our free shopping listings, which we launched in the U.S., is now available in 48 countries around the world. Additionally, we eliminated commission fees for the Buy on Google checkout option, opened the platform up to PayPal, Shopify for integration as well. So that gives rise to comprehensiveness, and we are focused on quality there. 
In terms of the funnel and behavior, to me, what's interesting is obviously Search captures the intent at the moment. And the breadth of Search, I think, has been a real asset and both -- as users adapt, advertisers adapt, too. So you can see the dynamic play in real time. 
But you do see, I would say YouTube is an important platform for e-commerce as well. I can see advertisers in YouTube at the mid-funnel level, even currently that's not the intent at that moment, invest to create demand, create interest and so on. So for us, we see commerce working across the platform, and I think it's an opportunity. And then making sure the rest of the experience is good for users is something we are deeply focused on.",242

And they're reacting in part to, I think, evidence that consumers are showing strong demand across nearly all verticals. It's everything from home and garden to computer to work from home. And so very helpful there. 
And then YouTube's strong watch time growth enables advertisers to reach audience that they can't reach on TV, as we've often talked about. And so they're increasingly looking to us to help them reach people who are going to YouTube to learn new topics and engage with fresh entertaining content, great unique content. So it's been an opportunity. We're pleased to have seen the performance in the third quarter here.",125

Sundar, thanks for the update on the DOJ. As you think about all the regulators all over the world, is there any hope of coming to a middle ground here? How are you thinking about how far apart you guys are in different regions? 
And then maybe for Ruth. On the YouTube opportunity, if you assume about 2 billion users, you're on a run rate of maybe $10 per user. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about the monetization. Are you still very early? And if you can give us any help on what the margins might look like.",107

I think as we've talked to you about quite frequently in our ad-supported business within YouTube, we do pay out a majority of revenues to all of our content creators. We pay all of the infrastructure and networking costs. That's for storing, for serving video, otherwise for running YouTube. And that includes marketing, supporting content creators. 
There's quite a bit more that we think is invaluable for creators in the overall ecosystem to make sure we're creating not only great experiences for users and creators but really the right overall ecosystem. And we've talked about that in the context of how we invest to protect the content, that people are seeing content moderation investments we view as really an invaluable part of what we're doing and critically important. So we're continuing to support that, do view the experience that both creators and users have as just really differentiated as a result. 
And then on the subscription side, we're continuing to build it out. As Sundar noted in his opening comments, both YouTube Music Premium and YouTube TV do have higher content acquisition costs as a percentage of revenues than YouTube ads. And we are really there continuing to build out that subscriber base.",226

And in some ways, it's now sector-wide and not surprisingly so. We will engage constructively where possible. And as we have shown through some of the past cases, when there is -- we are confident about the benefits we bring to our users. We'll make our case. Where there is feedback or rulings, we'll be flexible and adapt. And so we're building that into it. 
I think while there's lot on the legislative and regulatory front, as some of this gets resolved, it also creates certainty and in some cases clarity and opportunities as well. And so that's the framework with which we approach it, and we'll take a long view towards it. And -- but at the end of the day, what's in our control is our ability to relentlessly focus on users and build great products, and that's where most of our energy will go into.",160

It sounds like you're going to provide more disclosure on Google Cloud in the fourth quarter. Will that also be on the profitability of Google Cloud? Or could you address the question of whether Google Cloud has reached a point of scale where it's no longer dilutive to overall margins? 
And then briefly, 2 new revenue opportunities or growing revenue opportunities over the year, Google Maps and the Discover tab. Any update or any new data points that suggest the monetization opportunity with those 2 assets?",89

And when we break out Cloud, we will be also reporting not just the fourth quarter results, but we'll be providing full year results for 2018, '19 and '20. We'll be providing not just the revenue disaggregation data that we expanded earlier this year, but we will be adding operating income for each of our segments, which we think is the most relevant data. 
And the point that both Sundar and I have underscored is that we are investing aggressively in cloud given the opportunity that we see and frankly the fact that we were later relative to peers. We're encouraged -- very encouraged by the pace of customer wins and the very strong revenue growth in both GCP and Workspace, but we do intend to maintain a high level of investment to best position ourselves.

An example where we, I think, work well as developers, we're looking to promote apps with the Universal App Campaigns, you could really reach across. And it's a good model to think about recently, for example, to serve small and medium businesses the expanded Smart Campaigns to 150 countries. And if you're a small business owner, you can set up your first campaign, create your first ad in 15 minutes from your mobile device. 
So for me, thinking about these surfaces as we'll do the hard work to make sure the most relevant information gets and thinking about it more holistically and I think gives us a chance to also engage users the way they want us to, sometimes when they come looking for it and sometimes when they proactively want information given to them.

We've also heard Philipp Schindler talk about your addressable market being potentially twice as large as commonly viewed, and maybe that includes things like those payments inside supermarkets. 
So my question is 2-part. Firstly, is it fair to tie those 2 types of comments together and assume that they're related to each other? And then second, could you maybe talk about how that might matter to your bigger-picture thinking about the advertising and commerce opportunity for Google and in particular the competitive environment you face?",120

The competitive environment we face is particularly with mobile, and users are looking for information, there's so many choices they have. And so the question is making sure Google is a relevant way by which they get that information. And you can imagine when people are looking to buy products or the competitors that exist, travel, booking hotels or any category you take. And so for us, that's why I talk about holistically competing and making sure we can provide relevant information is both the competition we face for mind share, and that's the opportunity we have ahead. 
In terms of specifics of the DOJ case and stuff, I'm confident we have approached everything both with the view of making sure we create the best user experience; and b, we really want -- we've always built Google for everyone. So we wanted to be available on all platforms and be convenient for users to access our services, and as part of that, partner with other companies in doing so. And so look forward to making our case there, but it's definitely early days. And we are still reviewing and understanding it all, and I'm sure we'll update more as time goes by.",222

Maybe just a follow-up on the shopping question, specifically on YouTube, if you could expand on the role that shopping and shopping ads are now playing in the growth strategy there? 
And on Google Workspace, it seemed like this is a unique opportunity with work from home to really drive adoption and monetization of these services, including Meet as well as bundling with cloud services. So I wonder if you could provide any more detail on levels of usage and engagement you're seeing with those applications and how you plan to monetize those going forward.",102

On shopping in YouTube, I can definitely say we are on the earlier part of the journey, but we have seen the strength in YouTube for direct response and on a few other categories. And I think the experiences we see there, I think, can directly carry over to commerce and as we build out the experience. So I see that as an opportunity. 
I earlier also mentioned about while Search is currently capturing the intent at that given time, YouTube advertisers can take a longer-term view, create brand awareness, create interest and so on. So that also offers opportunities. 
So we today in many, many categories have creators with very compelling content. And I've always felt things work well if you match user interest, and it's very relevant to users. And so I think commerce, there is a lot of commercial activity on YouTube organically. And so I see it as a long-term opportunity. 
On Google Workspace, I'm very excited at the -- we both have strong growth. I mentioned Meet metrics earlier that we saw a peak of 235 million daily meeting participants in Q3 and more than 7.5 billion daily video call minutes. Definitely significant growth in Meet as well as our other products like Docs, Drive and Chat. But Google Workspace also now creates that unified experience, and I think we are definitely seeing a lot of interest and demand there. 
I do think COVID is really accelerating the future of work, and many of the trends there are -- will last through time and I think gives all of us a chance to reimagine this, reimagine what does collaboration and productivity at scale, including people working remotely, looks like. And we plan to be at the forefront of it, and so I'm excited for the opportunity there.",303

If we look at Search, your growth rates in January and February compared to today, so pre-COVID versus today, I guess how many categories are above the Jan/Feb growth rate? Is travel the only large category at this stage that's running below your pre-COVID growth rates in Search? 
And then the second question is on the topic of the Apple search agreement. So as you guys said in your blog post, based on other agreements where you've seen things change hands, you didn't really lose a lot of query volume after the change. So what do you think the recapture rate of queries on Safari toolbar would be if that deal were to change hands? Is this really a code red situation? Or is it something that we should be able to manage through?",137

And that's across sectors, customer size, geographies. And with respect to sectors, we saw broad-based improvement across virtually all -- it basically mirrors what you see in the broader economy. And we don't break out more than that, but it was quite broad-based. 
In terms of your second question, Sundar, do you want to take that?",74
