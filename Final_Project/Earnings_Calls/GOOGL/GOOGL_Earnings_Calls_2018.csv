29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2018",2018-02-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3448.0,1379638.0,55144471.0,Presenter Speech,Ruth Porat,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Ellen. We had a fantastic 2017 with total revenues of $110.9 billion, up 23% over 2016; and operating income of $28.9 billion, up 22% year-on-year excluding the EC fine. Our momentum reflects a relentless focus on users, advertisers and enterprise customers, as well as the benefits of our commitment to long-term investing. 
For the fourth quarter, revenues of $32.3 billion were up 24% year-on-year. The ongoing very strong performance in sites revenue, in particular, reflects the combined benefits of innovation and secular growth with mobile search again leading the way. Healthy growth in network revenues was again led by our programmatic business. Substantial growth in other revenues, namely hardware, Cloud and Play, continues to highlight the benefits of our investments.
Our outline for today's call is, first, I'll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. In order to facilitate comparisons of this quarter's results to prior periods, we have also provided the tax-affected line items, excluding the impact of the U.S. tax legislation enacted at the end of 2017. You can see the components in our earnings press release.
Second, I will review results for Google and then Other Bets. I will then conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which, we will take your questions. 
Starting with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Total revenues of $32.3 billion were up 24% year-over-year and strong across all regions. U.S. revenues were $15.4 billion, up 21% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $10.3 billion, up 24% year-over-year. In fixed FX terms, EMEA grew 22%, reflecting strengthening of both the euro and the British pound. APAC revenues were $4.7 billion, up 30% versus last year and up 32% in fixed FX terms, reflecting weakening of the Japanese yen. Other Americas revenues were $1.9 billion, up 31% year-over-year and up 30% in fixed FX terms, reflecting strengthening of the Canadian dollar. On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, was $14.3 billion, up 34% year-on-year. 
Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.8 billion, up 34% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, specifically cost associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, hardware-related costs for our expanded Made by Google family of products and content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube. 
Operating expenses were $10.4 billion, up 19% year-over-year, in particular, reflecting an increase in marketing spend given the holiday season. Stock-based compensation totaled $1.8 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 80,110, up 2,009 people from last quarter. As in prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. 
In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount additions were once again made in Cloud for both technical and sales roles, consistent with the priority we placed on this business. Operating income was $7.7 billion, up 15% versus last year, and the operating margin was 24%. Other income and expense was $354 million. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. 
Our provision for income taxes on a reported basis includes $9.9 billion for items associated with the U.S. tax legislation, resulting in a reported net loss of $3 billion and loss per diluted share of $4.35. Excluding the impact of the U.S. tax legislation, our effective tax rate was 15%. Our net income was $6.8 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $9.70. 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $4.3 billion. Operating cash flow was $10.3 billion with free cash flow of $6 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $102 billion. 
Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. 
Revenues were $31.9 billion, up 24% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $22.2 billion in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year, led again by mobile search, complemented by solid growth from desktop search and strong performance from YouTube. Network revenues were $5 billion, up 13% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of programmatic and AdMob. Other revenues for Google were $4.7 billion, up 38% year-over-year, fueled by hardware, Cloud and Play. 
Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release. 
Total traffic acquisition costs were $6.5 billion or 24% of total advertising revenues and up 33% year-over-year. The increase in site's TAC as a percentage of sites revenues as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenues continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was up year-over-year, reflecting primarily an increase in the site's TAC rate, which was modestly offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites. The increase in the site's TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points. 
The underlying trend affecting the network TAC rate year-over-year continues to be the shift to programmatic, which carries higher TAC. Google's stock-based compensation totaled $1.7 billion for the year, up 1% year-over-year. Operating income was $8.8 billion, up 11% versus last year, and the operating margin was 27%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $3.8 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities and data center construction. 
Let me now turn and talk about Other Bets. I'll cover results for the full year 2017 because it remains most instructive to look at financials for Other Bets over a longer time horizon, as discussed on prior calls. 
Results for the quarter are in our earnings release. For the full year 2017, Other Bets revenues were $1.2 billion, up 49% versus 2016, primarily generated by Nest, Fiber and Verily. Operating loss was $3.4 billion for the full year 2017 versus an operating loss of $3.6 billion in 2016. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $507 million, down from $1.4 billion in 2016, primarily reflecting a reduced investment in Fiber. We're pleased with our progress across Other Bets. A couple of updates:
Nest turned in a strong holiday performance in the fourth quarter across an expanded family of products in energy, safety and security. In 2017, Nest products also became available in 12 new countries, more than double the number in 2016. Verily wrapped up its first field study, seeking to reduce the transmission of diseases through mosquitoes with positive results. And just last week Onduo, a joint venture between Verily and Sanofi, began a limited commercial launch of its diabetes management platform. 
At Waymo, progress is accelerating. For example, Waymo surpassed 4 million miles of driving in the real world, taking only 6 months to achieve the last million miles compared to about 18 months for our first million miles. And in November, Waymo announced that it is the only company to have a fleet of driverless cars on public roads that are completely autonomous without anyone in the driver seat. Let me close with some observations on our priorities and longer-term outlook, 
Our 23% revenue growth in 2017 was powered in particular by the ongoing extraordinary performance of our sites business. Both mobile and desktop search continue to grow and benefit from our approach to innovation with strong momentum as we identify additional opportunities to enhance the user and advertiser experience. 
As we've consistently emphasized, alongside the continued momentum in our advertising business, we are focused on building a second wave of growth within Google over the medium and long term, which includes the rapidly growing revenue businesses in Google: Cloud, hardware and YouTube. 
With respect to Cloud, we are seeing the benefits of a fully featured enterprise offering and an expanded go-to-market team, bringing our advantages in infrastructure, data analytics, security and machine learning to more customers. And we're pleased with the momentum in our hardware business in 2017, driven by an expansion in both our product line and geographic availability. 
Finally, as we look further into the future for our third wave of growth, we remain excited about the longer-term potential for our Other Bets businesses. 
Overall, operating income was up 22% year-over-year in 2017, excluding the impact of the EC fine, although there was obviously fluctuation in the rate of operating income growth quarter-to-quarter. Within cost of revenues, the biggest component is traffic acquisition cost, reflecting our strong revenue growth in mobile search and the fact that mobile search carries higher TAC than our desktop business. While we expect sites TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of sites revenue, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search, we anticipate that the pace of year-over-year growth in sites TAC, as a percentage of sites revenue, will slow after the first quarter of 2018. 
Within OpEx, we are keenly focused on prioritization in order to optimize the resources we're investing for longer-term growth. As I discussed on last quarter's call, marketing spend in the fourth quarter is significantly elevated, in particular, supporting hardware, but also across Cloud and YouTube. For 2018, we remain excited about the investments we are making to drive the next phase of growth in our big bets in Google, in Cloud, hardware and YouTube, and our machine learning efforts, which are powering innovation across our businesses. You'll see us continue to support our priority areas with increased headcount, which will remain concentrated in R&D. With the closing of our deal with HTC earlier this week, for example, we've added 2,000 employees to support our hardware business. 
With respect to SBC, we've completed the transition to a single annual compensation cycle for employees with a full year equity refresh grant to employees in the first quarter of 2018. Our biannual grant to SVPs will also occur in the first quarter, and you will see the combined step up in our first quarter results. 
For our Other Bets in 2018, we will continue to calibrate the magnitude and pace of investment appropriate to their individual execution paths. 
Finally, our framework for capital allocation is unchanged from our prior discussions. The primary use of cash continues to be to support organic growth in the business. We're excited about the significant opportunities we've identified in our businesses and continue to invest appropriately. We then layer in a sensitivity analysis regarding potential M&A as well as CapEx, in particular, computing infrastructure to support the needs of these growing businesses. The most sizable catalyst for added investment in compute power include the expanding application of machine learning efforts across Alphabet, as well as additional requirements for Google's Cloud, Search and YouTube businesses. This framework further considers complementary uses such as a share repurchase. After taking these potential investments into account, our Board has decided to extend our share repurchase program up to an additional $8.6 billion of Class C capital stock. 
In conclusion, 2017 was another great year, and we are very excited about the opportunities ahead. I will now turn it over to Sundar.",1873
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2018",2018-02-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3448.0,1379638.0,55144472.0,Presenter Speech,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Ruth. Our teams are off to a great start in 2018. This year is special as it will mark 20 years since Google was founded. A lot has changed, but our mission, organizing the world's information and making it universally accessible and useful, remains the best guide for the next 10 years. 
Technology is an incredibly dynamic industry. We've been laying a foundation for the next decade as we pivot to an AI-first company, powering the next generation of Google products, like the Google Assistant. And we have been making substantial investments in our 3 biggest bets: Cloud, YouTube and hardware. These bets have enormous potential and already, they are showing real momentum and gaining traction. Today, I'll start by sharing some of the exciting progress in these 3 big bets.
First, Google Cloud. Google Cloud, which includes Google Cloud Platform and G Suite, has reached meaningful scale. And I'm excited to share today that it's already $1 billion-per-quarter business. In fact, we believe that Google Cloud Platform, based on publicly reported data for the 12 months ending December 2017, is the fastest-growing major public cloud provider in the world. 
We're also increasingly doing larger, more strategic deals with customers. In fact, a number of deals worth over $1 million across all cloud products more than tripled from 2016 to 2017. The strength of our products and the value of working with Google is increasingly clear to partners and customers. 
In the fourth quarter, we forged new and deepened existing partnerships with industry leaders, including Cisco for open hybrid enrollments, Salesforce for customer insights and productivity and SAP for AI and data insights across their products. These collaborations span our entire companies from engineering integration to marketing programs to joint sales, and they cover Google Cloud Platform, G Suite and Google Analytics. 
We also saw accelerating customer traction on our [indiscernible] included global brands like Bed, Bath & Beyond, Dentsu Aegis Network, Keller Williams, Mattel and Tyco Retail Solutions. And underscoring the increasing importance of Google Cloud to the enterprise, we surpassed another new milestone, 4 million paying customers on G Suite. 
Next, YouTube. Every month, more than 1.5 billion people come to YouTube to watch their favorable content on channels ranging from TheEllenShow, which has more than 22 million subscribers; to the NBA, with over 8 million subscribers; to SciShow, a really popular educational channel with more than 4.5 million subscribers. In fact, there are over 1 billion learning-related video views every day on YouTube. I learned that this week. 
With all this great content, people are thinking of YouTube more as a key part of their TV viewing experience. For Tuesday night's State of the Union, more partners used YouTube to live stream the address than ever before, generating 5 million live views. And just yesterday, we announced a partnership with Major League Soccer's, LA Football Club. YouTube TV will be the exclusive home to watch all locally-televised English language matches in addition to their original programming and content. 
YouTube TV is now also available on Roku. There is great momentum around the world with localized versions of YouTube now in 90 countries in 80 different languages. Just this morning, we announced that we are expanding the popular YouTube Go app to over 130 countries around the globe. The app has great data usage transparency and controls built in, which is especially useful for people living in regions with limited connectivity. 
In the fourth quarter, we also strengthened our relationship with the music industry, signing new licensing deals with Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group. We also partnered with Ticketmaster to help fans buy tickets to see their favorite artists perform live. 
Third, our growing hardware business. Our Made by Google hardware products were very popular this holiday season. Device shipments in the fourth quarter have more than doubled year-over-year. Our retail partners also saw strong performance. Our devices are available in stores like Best Buy, Target and Walmart. I'm especially excited about the popularity of our Google devices for the home, like the Google Home Mini, Max and Chromecast. In the last year, we have sold tens of millions of these devices and counting. I want to call out the great work of our marketing and design teams. Our hardware is beautiful individually and as a family, and people love discovering the unique features like the built-in Google Assistant. 
Earlier this week, we officially closed our deal with HTC, which will bring great talent to drive even more innovation in the years to come. 
Turning to our efforts in machine learning. Or AI research and innovation leads the world. Our mission to better organize the world's information has been transformed by these technologies with our search products and the Google Assistant at the heart. There's great momentum around the Google Assistant, as we bring it to more people on more devices. It's now available on more than 400 million devices, including speakers like Google Home as well as Android phones and tablets, iPhones, headphones, televisions, watches and more. People love to use the Assistant on all these devices. There was a lot of excitement around the Google Assistant at CES from partners and consumers, where we brought the Assistant to new surfaces, like smart displays from brands like JBL and Lenovo as well as Android Auto, which is now available in more than 400 car models from brands like GM, Hyundai and Volvo. 
One area that's really benefiting from our advancements in AI is photography. The Pixel 2 phone is the leader in video rankings by industry standards with smoother and clearer videos, thanks to machine learning and our video stabilization technique. 
And Google Photos continues to go from strength to strength. On New Year's Eve alone, over 3 billion photos and videos were uploaded to Google Photos. 
More broadly, we want everyone to be able to use machine learning for their own needs. We recently gave Google Cloud customers access to Auto ML, which makes it far easier to build complex new [ enrollments ]. Since its launched a few weeks ago, over 10,000 customers have already signed up to try it.
Lastly, I'll give a quick update on our computing and advertising platforms. First, Android. To provide a better, more tailored experience for our next billion users, we made Android Oreo Go edition available for our device partners. This year, we expect to see Go devices from dozens of manufacturers and with great support for mobile operators and app developers around the world. I'm confident that this will bring the power of smartphones to many more people for the first time. 
Google Play is also growing well. Just last week, we introduced audiobooks so you can now catch up on your favorite books any time on multiple devices. And in Latin America, a number of unique monthly buyers on Google Play grew by over 50% year-over-year in 2017. 
Chromebooks also continued to gain momentum and traction. Third party research tells us that fourth quarter sales of consumer Chromebooks in the U.S. grew by over 70% year-over-year. 
Moving to our advertising platforms, which help large and small businesses. As shoppers turn to their mobile phones this holiday shopping season, Google was central to helping them discover new brands, compare products and find the best deals. We redesigned the mobile shopping experience on Google, bringing more product information to the forefront like reviews and ratings. We are also making the payments experience simpler, safer and more consistent. We brought our payments efforts together as the new Google Pay, which shoppers can use to pay online in stores and across Google products like Chrome and the Play Store. Companies like Airbnb and Insta Cart are using Google Pay to speed up mobile check out. And Hotel Tonight found that customers using Google Pay are 65% more likely to complete their bookings. 
We also have really strong momentum in app promotion ads. The majority of our app promotion campaigns are now using universal app campaigns, which is part of our focus on simplifying the advertiser experience. Additionally, we introduced a new playable ad format in Google Play that allows users to sample games before they install. Ads in Google Play are performing really well for developers. 
And our app promotion business on YouTube is flourishing. We launched major initiatives, such as [ tourism measurement ] and location-based ad formats to drive online to offline commerce. We are focused on making sure YouTube is a great place for users and advertisers while helping creators earn money from popular content. 
In addition to the significant work we are doing to product users and stop abuse on the platform, just a few weeks ago, we announced changes to advertising on YouTube, including stricter monetization criteria, new manual reviews for all videos in Google Preferred and simpler controls for marketers. The feedback we have received from advertisers and creators so far has been really positive. 
So as you can see, we are making great strides in our biggest bets, and I'm proud of the work we are doing across the company. I'm also incredibly proud that as Google grows, we are making significant contributions to our partners, the economy and our local communities. Our business continues to benefit our partners around the world. This includes news publishers, app developers and YouTube creators who we share revenue with. 
Over the last 4 years, our partners have earned over $100 billion. That's incredible, and we are working on new ways to drive even more value to our partners. In the U.S. specifically, we have offices and data centers across 21 states, and we plan to hire thousands of people across the U.S. this year. 
Last year in the U.S., we grew faster outside the Bay Area than in the Bay Area. To support this growth, we'll be making significant investments in offices across 9 states, including Colorado and Michigan. We'll also be building or opening 5 big new data centers in the U.S. And with digital skills in high demand by employers, our Grow with Google initiative will help jobseekers and small businesses gain education and skills to help them succeed. 
Just a couple of weeks ago, we announced that we are creating an IT support certification program that will give thousands of people scholarships and job opportunities. More than 10,000 people have already signed up, which is amazing. 
I want to thank all our employees, Google users, partners and advertisers around the world. I couldn't be more excited about what's in store for all of us this year. With that, I'll hand it back over to Ruth.",1775

One for Sundar, one for Ruth. Sundar, coming out of CES and the success you had with Google Home and the Google Assistant during the holiday period based on the blog post you guys put out, can you identify some of the key investments in either partnerships or hardware capabilities that you're targeting over the next 1 to 2 years to make sure the momentum around Assistant is sustained? And then, Ruth, looking at cost of goods sold, that came in quite a bit higher than we thought, and you were lapping a one-time charge, if we have it right, versus the year-ago period. Maybe you could talk a little bit about some of the pressures in cost of goods sold that were either seasonal or maybe a new normal in terms of a higher level going forward. Any color there would be really appreciated.",147
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2018",2018-02-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3448.0,1379638.0,55144476.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,7,"Thanks, Eric. On the Google Assistant and Google Home, we are very excited about the momentum we saw in CES. It actually reflects work we've been doing for a while. Google Assistant in some ways brings together all the technology we've been building for years, and it's an extension and it's supported by Google Search as well. We are also thinking about our capabilities broadly beyond just one device alone. And that's what we are doing here across phones, across all surfaces. So that's something big we are focused on. And the second is we always build ecosystems, be it Android or Chrome or Chromebooks. We work with many, many partners and scale up things, right? And so we are leveraging those best practices and trying to build this in a way in which the entire ecosystem can ship products with the Google Assistant and generate values. So I think the framework is great. And long term, our investments in AI will directly manifest those capabilities for users through the Google Assistant. So I'm very bullish on it.",178

And as you know well, the TAC rate for each of sites and network as a percentage of those revenue lines does continue to increase because they're our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, and so carry higher TAC. But as I indicated in my opening comments, we do estimate that the year-on-year increase in the sites TAC rate will slow after the first quarter of 2018. And then the other thing to note, other cost of revenue does reflect the seasonality of hardware, having increased both the number of products in the Made by Google family as well as continuing to expand geographically in Western Europe and APAC. You can see that reflected here.",131

One for Ruth and Sundar. I guess, Ruth, just to follow-up on your comments there, the partner agreements which you just cited. Is there any color you could give us on how these typically work? And what I mean by that is are they typically multiyear deals on average? And how do we think about these impacting the rate of change in tax since you were talking about the pace of growth in TAC as we look out, call it, in year 2 if these are multiyear deals? And then for Sundar, I guess, I wanted to follow up a little bit with what we saw at CES. But how do you think about voice? And given the significant number of devices in the market, how do you think in the future about traffic acquisition strategies on these devices as you look 5 years down the road? Is there any reason to think that the strategies might be different that you're going to follow as you look ahead than what we've seen over the past, call it, since the advent of the iPhone?",186
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2018",2018-02-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3448.0,1379638.0,55144480.0,Answer,Ruth Porat,,Executives,11,"So on your first question, there's not much really that I'm going to be able to add there. I mean, given the ongoing momentum in our mobile search business, this does continue to be relevant as you look forward, given mobile carries higher TAC. But the rate, as per your question, has also reflected changes in partnership agreement. So all factors considered, we expect the year-on-year increases will slow after the first quarter of '18. And as I've said on many of these calls, we're very pleased to have a very strong position in a rapidly growing market, and that momentum does continue. I guess, the only other thing to add is that Q4 TAC as a percentage of revenues does benefit from the fact that the fourth quarter is a seasonally strong quarter for YouTube. So quarter-on-quarter changes are less insightful because CAC is distinct from TAC. It's not in this number. But not much more to add there. Pass it to Sundar.",164

We obviously see it being adopted strongly in countries like India. It's actually a significant part of just mobile search queries in general. And things like Google Assistant and doing Google Home kind of really accelerates the trend. But we definitely see more multi-modalities. So as you saw, we also announced many smart displays at CES. And I think that will be an exciting trend as well. So we'll bet on all of that. In general, I think about we want to be there for users when they need us and we want to serve everyone. That's why we work across the ecosystem. We do first-party devices. We do it globally. And so we are committed to doing that well. So I think it'll be an extension of how we have approached search from day 1 and trying to serve everyone. And so I don't, overall, see a big shift.",160

So I was hoping, Ruth, you could just talk to us more about the timing for that business and how we should think about the economic model there as you move to operations and deployment phase. And then, secondly, the cash, now obviously much more accessible in terms of what is held overseas. Can you just talk more about your plans there. Obviously, a bigger buyback there, but still not meaningful in terms of the overall size of the company.",105

So first on Waymo, we do remain very excited about the opportunity with Waymo and our continued progress on multiple fronts, in particular, the rider program in Phoenix, we're excited about and we're expanding our testing to more states. In November, we announced that Waymo's self-driving TAC reached a major milestone, becoming the only company to have a fleet of driverless cars on public roads that are completely autonomous. And that builds on our more than 4 million test miles driven in the real world in 7 states, 25 US cities, we're currently driving -- self-driving, I should say, 10,000 miles every day, with billions of miles in simulation and robust testing at our private facility. So more to your question, we do continue to explore a range of options beyond the program we're piloting in Phoenix, including ride-sharing and personal use vehicles logistics, deliveries and working with cities to help them address public transportation objectives. That being said, our first commercial application is the ride service that we will launch in 2018 that would be open to members of the public in Phoenix. And riders will be able to use our Waymo app to hail one of our fully driving -- self-driving cars without a driver at the wheel. So very excited about that. And then in terms of cash. I think the main point, as we think about it, is there's no change in our approach to our capital allocation framework. We've consistently been focused on long-term investing. We talked a lot about that already on this call. And our framework has been, therefore, very consistent. The priority, the first use is organic. It's investing in the many opportunities that we have. And the second is strategic. And we do remain active with smaller M&A deals, in particular, to support our Cloud business in hardware. The HTC deal, which we just closed, is a good example of that. Third is CapEx. So we continue to invest in machines to support growth we see across Google. But in particular, supporting Cloud, Search, YouTube and all that we're doing in machine learning. And then finally, that leaves return of capital. When we considered all of that, that's what led us to extend -- have the Board extend the share repurchase program, which we announced a couple of years ago. And we'll let you determine what that number represents in true Google fashion, but it's just a modest increase to what we've been doing previously.",415

And how do you think about the sustainability of continued strong desktop growth into 2018 and beyond? The second one, kind of a question in search query volume. There's often speculation and question marks around how consumer behavior is changing in e-commerce and whether Google is still capturing as many e-commerce searches. Could you just talk to what you're seeing in retail search query volumes and search user growth within e-commerce in the United States?",112

So we're very, very comprehensive. And obviously, e-commerce is evolving a lot, and we continue to invest there. Google Shopping is doing well. I mean, we work hard to make sure we bring the best experience possible, which is why [ asset evolves ] Search and Assistant be partner with companies like Walmart, for example, to make it much easier to buy products and so on.

There really isn't one particular item to call out here. And that's why last quarter, I tried to walk through the process that our team goes through and the way they look at innovations really stepping back and recognizing that the way we all use smartphones and desktop is continuing to evolve. And so therefore, there's utility and challenging assumptions about evolving user behavior and advertiser preferences, and that opens new lines of inquiry, which benefits not just mobile, but also desktop. And desktop did deliver solid revenue growth. It does remain an important form factor for certain more complex tasks such as planning vacations or assessing insurance options, and we're pleased with the ongoing strength. So I'll leave it to you to do any of the forecasting. But we just view it as yet another valuable form factor and are really pleased with the performance there.",153

Sundar, on YouTube, you mentioned the 1.5 billion people come to YouTube. Any other information you can give us there on user growth or engagement trends, would be great, anything on time spent. I mean, particularly as YouTube becomes more mature, and mobile video, particularly in North America, gets more competitive. And then also on YouTube, anything around new products or features driving the monetization or ad business? And then Ruth, just a question on the growth in marketing spend. In the fourth quarter, I think you said that the 4Q is significantly elevated. Should we interpret that to mean that the growth rate in selling and marketing year-over-year should decelerate off the 4Q? And then just related to that, [ in ] getting a good return on investment from this marketing spend, particularly when you think about media mix and all the spend that we've seen on TV as compared to digital marketing.",163

Maybe one area, which for example highlights how well it's doing is if you think about YouTube on TV, people actually watching YouTube on the big screen, our growth has been significant there. And so increasingly, people will use YouTube for -- we see it being used across every possible use case. And I said it earlier in the call, every day, we get over 1 billion user on educational content alone. People use it to go catch up on sports, music, entertainment. And so you can think about the breadth of -- historically, YouTube has been very strong on mobile. It continues to be strong on mobile. It's doing particularly well in the next billion user markets. Our growth last year was very strong there, which is why we supported it with investments like YouTube Go. And we are seeing it now growth well beyond mobile, especially in the living room.

As I said, it particularly supported hardware, but was also supporting Cloud and YouTube. And as Sundar and I have said, these are important Google growth areas for us and we are investing to support growth in the business. The elevated levels this quarter did reflect both seasonality and strategic decision to invest in these brands.

On things like GDPR, we want to be -- we have been thoughtfully engaged there.

To me, that shows the rate at which we are bringing our internal advances. It's just a year ago, I remember, everyone reviewing with the team when they first showed me the Auto ML work. We spoke about it at Google I/O. And it's pretty cutting-edge work. And to turn it back around and to provide it to everyone in the world, I think that shows the power of what we can do with Google Cloud and get our state-of-the-art and get it to everyone. I think the momentum there, obviously, is due to our strength in machine learning, the kind of open agile development [ enrollment ] we provide security and then the combination with G Suite. But above all, I think we've always -- we've been doing cloud now for 19 years because Google itself was built on a cloud platform. But where the momentum is really coming from is over the past 2 years, we have put a lot of effort to make sure we are enterprise-scale ready. So now, we can handle any type of enterprise, any kind of regulatory complexities, security complexity and so on. And that's evident in the business wins we are seeing. So we are signing customers who are very large across the board globally, and I think that's driving a lot of momentum there. On your question on Google Home and voice-based Assistant and how we are thinking about monetization, there a lot of interesting ideas internally. So we acquire -- teams are excited about trying new things. We see a lot of potential. But the guidance have given the teams to be squarely focused on user experience. We are really getting started. I think these are going to be powerful technologies. But there are areas where we clearly feel all of us fall short for doing right by users and getting the expectation -- matching their expectations.

And how are you going to go about that? And then for Ruth, the past year was one where we heard a lot about brand safety.

Probably, we can talk about both as they're related. In -- we obviously want to make sure YouTube has a great experience for users, content creators and advertisers because it supports content creators. And we took a lot of steps last year, but particularly in December, we are up to a new rigorous approach. And that's a much more stringent standard for creators. For example, they need 1,000 subscribers to be eligible for monetization. We are manually reviewing Google Preferred videos. We obviously use machine learning to support that a lot, and they both go hand-in-hand. We've provided improved controls for marketers, and we are also working with trusted third-party vendors to assist brand suitability. So it's a comprehensive approach to make sure all of this works well. And so while there have been concerns and we are -- but we are working really hard to address them and respond strongly.

Is there any trend that goes along with that in terms of maybe depressing search volume growth to some extent because of the more filtered aspect? And then, secondly, does the higher qualification trend tie in at all to the shifts towards programmatic in terms of other parties that might be involved or the discussion that we've had around TAC? And then maybe, two, just as a follow-up. If you can provide just a little bit more color on Google Pay in terms of what might be different this round versus previous attempts?",123

But at a high level, as people are on-the-go, they are traveling, etc., if anything, I think search is more invaluable than ever before. All the work we do in local searches applies incredibly when you travel. The properties we have, like Google Maps, et cetera, go along with it. So overall, I think they all add up to a better user experience, and hence, a better opportunity for us. Google Pay turns out to be an important part of all of this. As we move from just answers to helping users complete actions over time, including transactions, their ability to complete the transaction is an important part of it, and which is why making sure Google Pay, in a unified way, works as seamlessly as possible, is a big part of our long-term strategy.",147

So it looks like for the first time, you have an integrated hardware and a software team under one roof.

Great question. You're right that part of the reason we are so excited about being able to bring this world-class team in-house is while we've been working together already, we've had to straddle a company boundary to do that. But now, having them as Googlers would really make that integrated development, which is so critical for us to do it better. We bring a unique approach to hardware. The combination of AI plus software, plus hardware. So being able to get those teams working together, I think, will really drive the pace forward. And the best example of that is you see the advances we have made with both still and media photography on our phones. And the Nest team is very, very closely aligned with the Google hardware team. They work hard to realize a lot of synergies there. We already shared a lot of our go-to-market efforts, and we increasingly are collaborating on product development as well.

So a lot of the innovation that we are doing has gone on to not just an individual query in how we respond, but how we think about what our user is trying to accomplish over a series of sessions. Are you trying to plan a trip and how do we do it better? Do you have a health-related area where you're trying to learn more about it? And how do we help you through that? And so it's not always just changing a specific format, but understanding context better and bringing you that information through a journey. And I think so, there's a lot of innovation that's happening in that direction. And also underlying is what I said earlier. It's not just providing the answers. How do you help them get to that information and act on it? And so maybe you found something and you want to call that place, or maybe you're trying to order a birthday gift and we actually want you to -- want to go a step further and help that -- help you buy that gift.

29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2018",2018-04-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3536.0,1434226.0,57071479.0,Presenter Speech,Ruth Porat,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Ellen. We delivered ongoing strong revenue growth, up 26% year-on-year and up 23% in constant currency. The sustained outstanding performance in sites revenues, in particular, reflects the combined benefits of innovation and secular growth, with mobile search again leading the way. Robust growth in network revenues was again led by our programmatic business. Ongoing substantial growth in other revenues, namely cloud, hardware and Play, continues to highlight the growing contribution of our non-ads opportunities. 
Our outline for today's call is, first, I'll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. Second, I will review results for Google and then Other Bets. As we highlighted in our earnings press release, our results this quarter were affected by a new accounting standard that changes the way companies account for equity security investments. I'll highlight the impact on particular line items as I review the quarter. I will then conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which we will take your questions. 
Starting with the summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Our total revenues of $31.1 billion were up 26% year-over-year. We realized the positive currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $1.3 billion or $1.1 billion after the impact of our hedging program. 
Turning to Alphabet's revenue by geography. You can see that our performance was strong again in all regions. U.S. revenues were $14.1 billion, up 20% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $10.5 billion, up 29% year-over-year. In constant currency terms, EMEA grew 21%, reflecting strengthening of both the euro and the British pound. APAC revenues were $4.8 billion, up 33% versus last year and up 30% in constant currency, reflecting strengthening of the Japanese yen and Australian dollar. Other America revenues were $1.7 billion, up 36% year-over-year and up 35% in constant currency. 
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, was $13.5 billion, up 37% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.2 billion, up 39% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The key drivers were: first, costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, which was affected by a reallocation of certain operating expenses primarily from G&A; second, content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube; and finally, hardware-related costs. 
Operating expenses were $10.7 billion, up 27% year-over-year, with the biggest increase in R&D expenses reflecting our continued investment in technical talent. The growth in sales and marketing expenses reflects advertising investments in cloud and hardware as well as the Assistant. 
G&A expense trends were affected this quarter by a number of factors, in particular, performance fees accrued in connection with the recognition of equity security gains, which were partially offset by the reallocation of certain expenses from G&A, primarily the other cost of revenues and the benefit of the Uber litigation settlement. 
Stock-based compensation totaled $2.5 billion. The quarter-on-quarter step-up reflects the full year equity refresh grant to employees at the beginning of the quarter and the biannual grant to SVPs. 
Headcount at the end of the quarter was 85,050, up 4,940 people from last quarter, including just over 2,000 people who joined at the end of January when we closed our previously announced deal with HTC. As in prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were the additions from HTC followed by hiring and cloud for both technical and sales roles. 
Operating income was $7 billion, up 7% versus last year, and the operating margin was 22%. Other income and expense was $3.5 billion, which includes $3 billion of primarily unrealized gains in equity security investments recognized under the new accounting standard. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. 
Our effective tax rate was 11% for the first quarter. As outlined in our earnings press release, this includes a 5 percentage point reduction from the release of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which offset the income tax expense on the equity security gains. 
Net income was $9.4 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $13.33. As indicated in the table in our earnings press release, these results reflect an increase in net income of $2.4 billion and $3.40 in earnings per diluted share due to the impact from the gains in equity security investments we've already discussed. 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $7.3 billion, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $11.6 billion with free cash flow of $4.3 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $103 billion. 
Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $31 billion, up 26% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $22 billion in the quarter, up 26% year-over-year, led again by mobile search complemented by solid growth from desktop search and strong performance from YouTube. 
Network revenues were $4.6 billion, up 16% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of programmatic and AdMob. Other revenues for Google were $4.4 billion, up 36% year-over-year fueled by cloud, hardware and Play. As a reminder, the hardware revenues in this line now include our Nest business, and prior periods were restated. 
We continue to provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. As we previously announced, we made a change this quarter to impression-based monetization metrics for our network business given the ongoing growth of programmatic. 
Total traffic acquisition costs were $6.3 billion or 24% of total advertising revenues and up 36% year-over-year. This year-on-year increase in sites TAC, as a percentage of sites revenues as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenues, continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Total TAC, as a percentage of total advertising revenues, was up year-over-year, reflecting primarily an increase in the sites TAC rate, which was modestly offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites. The increase in the sites TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC. The underlying trend affecting the network TAC rate year-over-year continues to be the shift to programmatic, which carries higher TAC. 
Google's stock-based compensation totaled $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. Operating income was $8.4 billion, up 12% versus last year, and the operating margin was 27%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $7.7 billion, reflecting investments in facilities, production equipment and data center construction. Facilities was the largest component of CapEx of this quarter due primarily to the $2.4 billion purchase of Chelsea Market that we announced in March. 
Let me now turn and talk about Other Bets. For the first quarter, Other Bets revenues were $150 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. As a reminder, Nest results are now reported as part of the Google segment, with revenues reflected in the Google other revenues line. Operating loss was $571 million for the first quarter. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $55 million. 
We're pleased with our progress across Other Bets. A couple of updates. At Waymo, we have achieved 5 million miles of driving on city streets, adding the latest million in just 3 months. We also announced a long-term partnership with Jaguar Land Rover for their fully electric I-PACE vehicles. Verily is seeing good progress with Onduo, its joint venture with Sanofi. The companies made its diabetes management platform commercially available in 3 states with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arkansas and South Carolina and Anthem's health plan in Georgia. 
Let me close with some observations on the quarter and our longer-term outlook. First, with respect to revenues. The opportunity set ahead of us is quite extraordinary, and we remain focused on investment to support long-term revenue and profit growth. We have both the business confidence to invest appropriately in the next phase of innovation as well as clarity about some very compelling opportunities that, in our judgment, will enable us to create shareholder value. We're pleased with the continued momentum of our revenue growth again this quarter, reflecting strong underlying trends across our business, which are amplified by our relentless focus on innovation, not only in our newer businesses, like cloud and hardware, but in our sites business. Specifically, we're excited by the still sizable opportunity in search advertising led by mobile. At 26% year-on-year revenue growth in our sites business, we continue to benefit from our investments to enhance the user and advertiser experience. 
Second, with respect to profitability. Within cost of revenues, the biggest component is TAC. While we expect sites TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of sites revenues, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search, we continue to anticipate that the pace of year-over-year growth in sites TAC, as a percentage of sites revenues, will slow beginning in this second quarter. 
Within OpEx, as I said last quarter, we are continuing to support our priority investment areas. Within R&D, this is reflected in increased headcount, particularly for technical roles. Sales and marketing is similarly elevated to support these areas, both in the quarter and for the full year, and we expect expenses to remain more heavily weighted toward the back half of the year to support the holiday season. 
As you've seen in prior quarters, G&A can be a more difficult line to forecast. In particular, this quarter, we had the impact of the accrual for performance fees related to the equity gains previously discussed, partially offset by the reallocation of some expenses to other cost of revenues and the Uber legal settlement. We appreciate the importance of prioritization and are keenly focused on the steps we can take to make the right investments with the proper intensity while being diligent about long-term plans and returns. 
For our Other Bets, we remain focused on moving toward commercial applications in a number of areas with a continued focus on calibrating investment to metrics for success. 
Third, with respect to CapEx. Our commitment to growth is evident in the trend in CapEx investment, almost equally split this quarter between compute capacity and facilities. Our facilities spent in Google dominated by the Chelsea Market acquisition reflects that we favor owning rather than leasing real estate when we see good opportunities. With respect to compute capacity, the largest component of CapEx is for machines that incorporate the latest technologies. We are also investing in data center growth and increased network capacity through undersea cables. These combined investments will expand our compute capacity to support our growth outlook across Google, including machine learning, the Assistant and cloud. 
In many respects, these investments underscore my opening comment about both our confidence and clarity about future opportunities with our focus on proprietary solutions that enable us to deliver the secure, reliable, high-performing compute infrastructure to support new and emerging products and services for our users, advertisers and enterprise customers. 
I will now turn the call over to Sundar.",1880
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2018",2018-04-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3536.0,1434226.0,57071480.0,Presenter Speech,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Ruth. The end of Q1 is always an exciting time as we prepare for our annual developer conference, Google I/O. Computing is evolving at a rapid rate, and we can't wait to share what's next and how we are tackling important issues. 
I want to call out an important highlight from Q1, the Google news initiative that we unveiled in March. Over the years, we have worked closely with the news industry to address key challenges through projects like Accelerated Mobile Pages. We are building on that partnership with the $300 million investment to elevate and strengthen quality journalism. As part of this effort, we announced more than a dozen new products, including Subscribe with Google developed in close collaboration with publishers, which lets you use your Google account to buy a subscription on participating news sites. We've had overwhelming interest. 
Since the launch, we have heard from more than 300 news publishers who are interested in Subscribe with Google. We also introduced new tools for journalists and improvements to our platforms to ensure that we are surfacing accurate quality content where it matters most. 
Today, I'll quickly talk about how machine learning is helping us advance that mission, then I'll highlight progress in our 3 big areas, cloud, YouTube and hardware, and share updates on our computing and advertising platforms. 
First, machine learning and making information accessible to everyone. Our own ML-powered products like Google Photos and Google Lens gets better every day. The Google Assistant is a great example of this. In the home, we have added over 200 new device partners that work with Assistant just on the last 4 months alone. We now partner with all major manufacturers of connected devices for the home in the U.S. 
All told, the Google Assistant can now help you with over 1 million actions, including new things like reminding you to buy bread when you get to the store or sending money to friends or if you want to get a ride share home. For a concept we unveiled at I/O less than 2 years ago, this is great progress. 
AI is also unlocking new opportunities for everyone. Just in the last few months, we have seen some amazing applications from dairy farmers in Georgia using TensorFlow to improve the health their herds to our own Google researchers who figured out how to use ML techniques to assess a person's risk of a heart attack. The possibilities of AI in health care are truly exciting. 
At our recent TensorFlow summit, we introduced TensorFlow hub, making it easier for developers to share and reuse models so that we can work together to tackle even more problems and get to better ideas faster. Our investments in this area are helped because of our specialized Tensor Processing Units, which are specifically designed to be highly efficient for machine learning applications. 
Of course, we continue to advance Google's core mission in other ways, too. We recently launched our Google Go app in 26 African countries. This app reduces the amount of data needed to display search results by 40%, and we continue to invest in ways to give people granular and easy controls over their information across all our products. Every single day, nearly 20 million people visit My Account, which gives them options to review their Google security, privacy and ad settings. Additionally, tools like security checkup and privacy checkup prompt people to keep their account secure and control their data settings. 
Now turning to our 3 big areas: cloud, YouTube and hardware. Last quarter, we shared some exciting metrics about the progress of Google Cloud, including that we passed $1 billion per quarter in 2017. In Q1, we saw increasing momentum. We are growing across the board and are also signing significantly larger, more strategic deals for cloud. Our security capabilities, the easy-to-use advanced data analytics and machine learning solutions and the secure and industry-leading collaboration platform, G Suite, are winning customers over. Google Cloud is growing well. Some examples of new technologies announced in the quarter include Cloud AutoML, which makes it easier for companies without machine learning expertise to build complex neural nets and more than 20 new security products. 
Our global infrastructure continues to expand to support demand. We commissioned 3 new subsea cables and announced new regions in Canada, Japan, Netherlands and Saudi Arabia, bringing our total of recently launched and upcoming regions to 20. 
G Suite has reached a point where it can serve all the needs of a large enterprise, and as a result, grow at a certain inflection point. The Suite is growing from strength to strength. We believe our secure environment is an important factor in driving enterprise customer wins. G Suite customers like Colgate-Palmolive Company tell us that no one offers a better combination of hardware, network and data security. In Q1, we also signed agreements with customers like Airbus and Thailand's Krung Thai Bank. As a result, G Suite revenue growth accelerated in Q1. 
Next, YouTube. The platform continues to grow as millions of creators build communities and find opportunity on YouTube. Over the last year, channels earnings 6 figures annually grew more than 40%. This quarter, Dua Lipa's video for New Rules became the 100th video on YouTube to reach 1 billion views. We are also investing in new experiences like life content, where we see tremendous momentum. One recent example was our exclusive Coachella live stream, which had more than 41 million live views from all over the world. 
Coachella was YouTube's most viewed live music festival ever. And no surprise, Beyoncé was the most viewed Coachella performance ever on YouTube. Even as we invest in new experiences, we stay very focused on making sure that YouTube remains a safe platform with great content. We are aggressively combating content that violates our strict policies through a combination of user and machine flags. Over 6 million videos removed in Q4 were first flagged by our machine systems, and over 75% of those videos were removed before receiving a single view. We also changed our monetization requirements to better identify creators who contribute positively to the community and drive more ad revenue to them. 
Moving to hardware. This quarter, we welcome Nest of the Google hardware team to supercharge our efforts. Nest is building industry-leading products for the home, including new additions like the Nest Hello doorbell and Nest temperature sensor. In 2017, they sold more devices than the previous 2 years combined. They are an incredibly talented team with fantastic momentum. 
Google Home continues to be super popular, and we are making it available in many more countries. Just recently, we launched Google Home in many -- in India and Singapore, and the response has been terrific. 
Our early 2018 Net Promoter Scores rank among the highest in the industry across all product categories. This shows how much love people have for Made by Google consumer hardware devices and makes us even more excited for what's ahead. 
There's great momentum across our computing platforms, like Android and Chrome. At Mobile World Congress, a new generation of Android partner devices was introduced, including Android One phones like the Nokia 7 plus. Android One pairs high-quality hardware with a secured and streamlined software and experience from Google. This quarter, we launched the Acer Chromebook Tab 10, the first Chrome OS tablet designed specifically for education. It is a secure and easily shareable tablet equipped with all the Chromebook features that educators and students love. 
And finally, our advertising platforms. We continue to make Google Search and Shopping the best places for people to find and buy products from a range of merchants. We recently announced shopping actions, allowing customers to easily buy from their choice of participating retailers on the Google Assistant and Search with the universal card across mobile, desktop and even Google Home. The results are really helping retailers. Early testing showed that participating retailers see an average increase in basket size of about 30%. 
YouTube is delivering great results for our advertisers. To help brands reach broad audiences on YouTube with even more flexibility, we introduced TrueView for Reach, which optimizes in stream ads to reach a wide audience. In beta testing, 9 out of 10 campaigns drove a significant lift in ad recall, with an average lift of nearly 20%. 
We are also helping small businesses take advantage of video with the expansion of YouTube Director onsite to over 170 U.S. cities. This gives SMBs access to a professional filmmaker to create and edit their video ads. 
Finally, we remain focused on investing in our publisher partners. Last year, we paid $12.6 billion to publishing partners in our ad network. We recently announced AdSense Auto ads. This uses machine learning to analyze ad placements on a publisher's page and show ads when they are likely to perform well while providing a good user experience. 
Google's success depends not just on the success of our partners but also on the community's very work. We recently announced the Rolling Study Halls program for rural areas across 12 states. It equips school buses with Wi-Fi devices and onboard educators so that students with long commutes can get their homework done during the trip. 
We are also making long-term investments in our offices and data centers around the country. Last month, we announced the purchase of Manhattan's Chelsea Market building. And in Tennessee and Alabama, we broke ground on 2 new data centers, which will have a big economic impact on the local economies. These investments are made hand-in-hand with our commitment to sustainability. 
In 2017, we officially met our goal to purchase enough renewable energy to match all electricity consumed by our operations around the world. 
I want to close by saying thank you to our employees. It's been a particularly tough few weeks for the Google family, especially at YouTube. I'm so proud of the resilience that our employees have shown, and I'm so grateful for the support we have gotten across the industry and from the community. Thank you.",1681

29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2018",2018-04-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3536.0,1434226.0,57071482.0,Question,Douglas Anmuth,,Analysts,5,"Ruth, just first on the accounting change, I was just hoping you could clarify. If we're trying to normalize that, is it right that we would be adding back about $632 million to operating income and then reducing EPS by $3.40, and then just on the EPS side, perhaps adjusting for the tax rate? And then just in terms of the business, I just wanted to ask about Waymo. If you could talk a little bit about just the latest timing for the commercial launch in Phoenix and how quickly you'd look to expand to other markets, and then just how you're thinking about the technology and whether you'll license it to others going forward or keep it more proprietary for Waymo services?",123
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2018",2018-04-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3536.0,1434226.0,57071483.0,Answer,Ruth Porat,,Executives,6,"Sure. So on the accounting standard, we try to lay out all the component parts clearly on the cover of the earnings release so that you would have it all in one place. I think you summarized it right, but I'll just direct everybody to the earnings release. The net of which was the gain from the equity investments was $2.4 billion to net income. That is net of performance fees as well as the release of a deferred tax asset that we have, so it does reflect $3 billion in gains. And I think you know this, but this quarter, the accounting standard requires marks for everything where there is an observable raise. So these are unrealized -- the majority of them are unrealized, not actually monetized by Alphabet, and then the performance fees are calculated based on investment returns. They're accrued but not paid until an exit event occurs, and they do appear in OpEx. And as you noted, there is also, therefore, the benefit that flows through on the tax line, and that is 5 percentage points of benefit offset to the effective tax rate for the quarter. As it relates to your Waymo question, there was a lot in there. We do remain very excited about the opportunity with Waymo and our continued progress on multiple fronts. It is still very early. In terms of our progress, this year is about offering a service that is safe, that works, that delight users in the Phoenix area. The rider program in Phoenix is open to members of the public, and riders will use a Waymo app to hail one of our fully self-driving cars without a driver at the wheel, and we'll pay for the service. We've also had progress on the vehicle partnerships, as I mentioned in my opening comments. Last month, Waymo announced it signed a long-term strategic partnership with Jaguar beginning with a collaboration to design and manufacture self-driving I-PACE vehicles for Waymo's transportation service. These are all electric cars. This new partnership in the vehicles adds to our strong position with FCA, and the production of the cars begins in 2020. And then we are expanding our testing to more states. We're also working on additional areas like applying the technology to logistics and deliveries and working with cities to help strengthen public transportation and for personal use vehicles. And as we've talked about on a bunch of calls, the opportunity is here for us because we started with safety, and we remain a leader in safety, and we do believe that's the foundation for success, and it builds on the -- all the testing miles that we've done. So we keep coming back to when you create vehicles that drive themselves faithfully, we think there's a lot of potential uses and business opportunities, and that's what we're focused on.",477

One, just one on GDPR then one on cloud. On GDPR, just wondering if you could share with us kind of any impact you're thinking about as the implementation occurs later in May, and so any thoughts you could share there would be great. And then on cloud, Sundar, you had mentioned you're seeing a lot of momentum. You said G Suite, I believe, accelerated in Q1. I was wondering if there was any color on the GCP side that you could share from a growth perspective if that business accelerated or not and kind of how were the deal sites trending for that business in particular.",114

Maybe I'll do the GDPR first. GDPR, I realize, is a fairly new public OPEC. But for us, it's not new. We started working on GDPR compliance over 18 months ago and have been very, very engaged on it. It's really important, and we care about getting it right. And overall, we have long had a very robust and strong privacy program at Google, too. So we are committed to meeting requirements on May 25 and also long term. We are working very closely with advertisers, publishers and our partners. And we will also update all the privacy policies and controls we provide to users worldwide. So it's a big effort. We are very committed to it. We are very focused on getting it right by our users and partners, and that's where our focus is now. On -- Heather, on cloud, I guess your question was about overall growth, and we are continuing -- the momentum has been very strong on cloud as well. We haven't talked about G Suite much, and so we highlighted it the moment I'm there, but cloud is continuing its great growth. We are seeing it across the board. Things worth I would call out is we are seeing larger deals as well. We are seeing good synergies between G Suite and cloud. Areas where we have done acquisitions like Apigee, they are beginning to work in terms of driving synergies to cloud. And the efforts we are beginning to put particular with our partners, that is beginning to bear fruit as well. So we have go-to-market programs now with SAP, Cisco and Salesforce.

One, on mobile search, continue to call that out as a point of strength in the results. What are you most excited about in terms of either the product innovation or the ability to get consumers to adopt mobile search more broadly on devices globally, which could lead to more ad budgets moving it to mobile search? And then on hardware, you've now been through 2 years of sort of Pixel devices. You've made the aqui-hire of ETC engineers. Can you give us a sense of what you've learned so far from your hardware efforts and how that might evolve product innovation or go-to-market strategies long term?",114

And if you look at the evolution of Search, we gave from -- we evolved to stay ahead of user expectations, and we evolved from just providing links to answers. I just feel at a high level the next big evolution we are doing as part of mobile search and assistant is to actually help users complete actions, to help get things done. And it's really hard to do at scale, and that's the work we are doing. And as we do that, it'll impact just -- not just the Assistant but mobile search more broadly. And obviously, that has a commercial impact as well. So we continue to be very excited about the opportunities there. On hardware, the exciting part for us is now, I think we have all the end-to-end capabilities of a world-class hardware organization, along with the quality of the software organizations we have always had. And in this area, it truly takes long-term planning. And so for example, if you think about silicon, et cetera, the longer you can do it, the more advantages you have. And so I definitely feel we are taking the steps towards being able to do this well for the long term. Part of that obviously involves scaling of our go-to-market strategies both in the U.S. and internationally so that we can drive adoption. I said earlier, our Net Promoter Scores show that we are right up there with the best-in-class devices and across all the products we have, not just our Pixel, across our Nest family and everything we do. So the opportunity is clearly there. We're going to lean into it, and it takes 2 to 3 years to really get to the scale where we want to see it and -- but we are committed to getting there.",311

Above everything else, as we are working through GDPR, we are making sure we are focused on getting the user experience right for our users and our partners.

And so we've been preparing this for 18 months, and I think we are focused on getting the compliance right.

Just curious, could you give 1 or 2 tangible examples or products that are still driving the desktop search growth? And Sundar, I understand you're always focused on user experience. At a high level, what do you see is the biggest areas potential further improvement in desktop search? And let me ask you the same question about YouTube. What are sort of the biggest areas of tension that you're focused on improving from a user perspective on YouTube right now?",101

Look, I mean, the same. First of all, users are having cross-device experiences, cross-screen experiences, right? So I think your desktop search experience, mobile search, everything goes hand-in-hand. And every -- all the work we are doing to make mobile search better translates to desktop search as well. Areas where desktop search historically has been a bit behind is in terms of things like identity and payments and having all that work well to enhance the user experience. And with Chrome now, we are investing a lot in those areas as well, and I think that will contribute overall to improvements there. On YouTube, there are many, many areas we are focused on YouTube. They're always very focused on making sure they are supporting emerging formats, be it mobile live streaming or emerging formats like VR, and so that's an area of focus for us. We are also really looking at what are all-new monetization options for creators beyond advertising. So be it subscriptions, features like super chat, which we have launched, are very popular. We have beta testing sponsorships, merchandise, merchandising and concept, ticketing and et cetera, right? So these are all areas by which we are improving.

Americas revenue accelerated nicely on a currency neutral basis. It's a geography that rarely comes up on your calls. So any color about what's driving that acceleration and the sustainability of what's going on in the Americas region? And then, Ruth, a question on sites TAC. So I know you said the pace of deleverage is going to start to improve next quarter. Is this something that we should expect to happen for a year and then kind of normalize back to pretty steady pace of deleverage? Or is this -- are we over some critical threshold, and we should see this trend of moderating deleverage continue for several years into the future?",117

I would say, like the other regions, really pleased with the strength we have. Across the regions, it is obviously one of the smaller ones, so growing at a slightly faster clip and really pleased with the broad strength there. It starts with the sites revenue strength. But on top of that, they benefited from hardware devices launching in some additional markets over the past year. And then in terms of TAC, I would say there's not much to add to what we've already said after some -- a kind of sustained period of stronger increases.

Ruth, on CapEx, even if we exclude the Chelsea Market one-timer, the gross in CapEx, is it really substantial even on a kind of recurring basis. Should we expect that sort of dramatic growth or step-up in the growth of rate in ongoing CapEx to continue throughout the year? Or other than the Chelsea Market one-timer, were there any -- do we have any reason to think that it was timing in terms of the timing, front-end weighted, it's the first quarter for CapEx? And then secondly on -- Sundar, just a question on YouTube and your media strategy at a higher level. In view of the success of other competitive subscription TV products out there, Internet video products, can you just talk about YouTube Red and any thoughts on ways you can accelerate growth for your YouTube subscription video products, whether that may be organic investment and content original production or even via acquisition?",165
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2018",2018-04-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3536.0,1434226.0,57071501.0,Answer,Ruth Porat,,Executives,24,"So in terms of CapEx, it's about equally split between facilities and our technical infrastructure. And as you know that we have the $2.4 billion purchase in New York as well as discontinued ground-up development projects. Facilities does tend to be lumpier over time. We are continuing with the ground-up development projects. And as a reminder, we do favor owning rather than leasing real estate when we see good opportunities, and that has served us well over the years. But I think more to your question with respect to technical infrastructure, that reflects investments in compute power to support growth that we see across Google, and the largest component is on machines. It's also on data centers and undersea cables. And on machines, the biggest contributor is the demand that we're seeing. So in particular, it's the expanding application of the machine learning efforts across Alphabet, plus the requirements for cloud and Search and YouTube, and then secondarily, the increased cost of newer technologies, CPUs, memory, network. So I think, really, to answer your question most directly, it reflects the demand that we're seeing, so I wouldn't want to suggest a one-off in terms of the investments we're making in technical infrastructure. And then in terms of the data centers, we are investing globally. We currently have over 20 sites on 4 continents, and that's under different stages of construction, as Sundar noted. And it's across the U.S. Tennessee, Alabama, South Carolina, Iowa. So we're really building out to support the growth that we're seeing.",255

We are doing a lot more work there. You will see us continue to invest further and develop those offerings better, and as part of that, further drive adoption. So for example, YouTube Originals end up playing a big part in YouTube Red subscriptions. And so far, we have launched in a handful of markets, and we'll continue to roll it out to more markets there. And on YouTube Music, we are working on enhancing the product, and I think this definitely create opportunities there as well.",112

And then second, a little bit more technical one on your advertising business you launched, shopping actions during the quarter with a pay-per-sale model, pricing model.

On the -- we obviously -- Search has been leading the company in terms of how they have been adopting machine learning and AI, and it's really working well through Search and Assistant. We sense that, obviously, as an AI-first company, AI cuts across everything we do in Google. And so as an organization, it's a horizontal organization, which needs to serve all our areas and in some ways, the change reflects that. And we have very capable leaders. Jeff, who runs -- was the Founder of Google Brain and really well positioned to lead our AI efforts. And Ben has been at Google since the early days of Search, started in Google in 2000 and has been driving Search for over 18 years.

First, on the cloud business. I was wondering if you could provide any color, at least in the relative momentum you're seeing in that segment from infrastructure services compared to platform or software services. And then related to the adoption of AMP. I guess, a key question we get asked is whether that ultimately changes usage, and maybe you have some perspective on this from Android. But in the ecosystem between mobile web pages and app usage, if you're seeing any shift among users between those formats.",92
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2018",2018-04-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3536.0,1434226.0,57071510.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,33,"On the first question of cloud, look, I mean, I think the main thing I would say is the fundamental drivers of adoption of Google Cloud based on what we hear back from customers is our advantage in data analytics and machine learning. The fact that we really support open, agile development environment. Kubernetes has literally become the standard for workloads and the fact that we are open in terms of how we approach this space. Security is becoming a big differentiator for us and something we've been leading for a while, and I think that's driving it. G Suite, as I called out earlier, is a good synergistic driver. G Suite is doing well, and clearly, a very unique offering, and it's gotten very comprehensive. And so I think overall, it comes together well. On your second question around AMP, AMP has been definitely very successful. It's really made publisher content much more friendly for users in terms of latency and the user experience, and hence, that option has been great. For sure, AMP has definitely helped the mobile web, and that's part of the big reasons we did it. Mobile web is still a big part of how users consume content, especially around news, and so us investing there clearly makes a difference. I guess, for example, when we look at, I don't know, J.Crew adopted AMP, their mobile page loading times are now over 90% faster. And now they are integrating the Google payment request API. That reduces checkout times from 2 minutes to 30 seconds or so. So things like that. We are going to constantly stay on improving the mobile web, and that plays a big part in how our ecosystem works.",287

First, Sundar, can you give us any sense of how Google Home consumers are using Search in these devices differently than maybe the traditional ways of Search? And you're finding in those homes, is it additive to overall search activity? And then for Ruth, if you look at the last page of press release, where you've shown the new monetization metrics, you see a real increase in the cost per impression on network sites. So can you talk about maybe what's happening there? Is there a mix shift types of publishers, types of products? Or is that just market inflation?",109

Call mom is a good example of something you say to Google Home a lot. I can -- which is different than what you would say to Search. We see this as a good complementary thing. You will see Search embrace some of the capabilities you find in Google Assistant and Google Home and vice versa. And so overall, I view this as additive in the long term, and we are definitely just getting started there.",100

First, just to give people a bit more color. When we launched the AdSense businesses, our network revenues were largely click-based. And over time, there's been a meaningful mix change in our business given the strong growth in programmatic, which is impression-based. So as a result, the shift now covers more of the business. And then in terms of the question on impression growth versus CPM growth, as we've discussed on prior calls, the network business is actually a number of different businesses. And then within that, we have flat year-on-year growth in the number of impressions that was driven by efforts to improve user experience through a reduction of less relevant ads and AFC. And so these changes had a positive impact on the year-on-year growth in CPMs. And then the trend and impressions in CPMs can clearly be volatile from quarter-to-quarter as we're optimizing for the user publisher and advertiser, but it really goes to the efforts that we make.",169

As we've talked about on many, many calls, we have been and remain focused on supporting long-term revenue and profit growth, and we think the opportunity set ahead of us is quite extraordinary. And as I said in opening comments, just given our confidence and as we're looking forward, we want to make sure we're investing appropriately in the next phase of innovation, and we have clarity about some very compelling opportunities. And then our judgment, that enables us to maximize shareholder value. So we're taking the steps really to put in place the support for long-term -- longer-term growth. Part of what I'm saying, you can see in our sites revenue growth, try to make that clear in opening comments, we see this consistent, strong momentum globally, and we're really excited about the still sizable opportunity led by mobile search. And so we're continuing to invest to enhance the user and advertiser experience, and thereby, extend the growth in our ads business. You can see this also in the trend on the CapEx spend. As I noted in our opening comments, the investments we're making there really provide the compute capacity to support our growth outlook, and that's supporting the opportunities that come out of machine learning and the Assistant. And then we also see extraordinary upside in the newer markets, as Sundar has talked about, most notably cloud computing and hardware. And so we're investing to support the long-term growth opportunity there. And then finally, when we look at the market opportunity in both self-driving cars and life sciences, our judgment is it makes sense to place the kinds of investments that we are. And with all of this, what also hasn't changed is we appreciate the importance of prioritization and picking our spots, and we're keenly focused on steps we can take to both make the right investments with the proper intensity while being diligent about long-term plans and returns. So at a high level, the approach hasn't changed. You're seeing the investments here.",342

29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2018",2018-07-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3731.0,1506960.0,59611597.0,Presenter Speech,Ruth Porat,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Ellen. We delivered another quarter with strong operating performance, reflecting our focus on building great experiences for users, advertisers and enterprise customers around the world. In aggregate, we had substantial revenue growth, up 26% year-on-year and up 23% in constant currency. Sites revenues continue to exhibit strong year-on-year momentum, benefiting from innovation and secular growth with mobile search again leading the way. Our network advertising business maintained healthy growth led by AdMob and programmatic advertising. The businesses comprising other revenues, namely Cloud, Play and Hardware, again had substantial growth.
Our outline for today's call is I'll begin with results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet focusing on year-over-year changes. There are 2 items to note in our earnings press release. First, we provided a table to highlight the impacts of the European Commission fines on operating income, net income and EPS results in the second quarters of 2018 and 2017. Second, as discussed last quarter, our results are affected by the new accounting standard that changes the way companies account for equity security investments. This new standard continues to result in greater volatility in OI&E. I'll highlight the impact on particular line items as I review the quarter. I will then review results for Google, followed by Other Bets and will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights. After which, we will take your questions.
Starting with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Our total revenues of $32.7 billion were up 26% year-over-year. We realized a positive currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $768 million or $665 million after the impact of our hedging program.
Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography. You can see that our performance was strong again in all regions. U.S. revenues were $14.9 billion, up 21% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $10.8 billion, up 26% year-over-year. In constant currency terms, EMEA grew 19%, reflecting strengthening of both the euro and the British pound. APAC revenues were $5.1 billion, up 36% versus last year and up 34% in constant currency, reflecting strengthening of the Japanese yen and Korean won. Other Americas revenues were $1.8 billion, up 31% year-over-year and up 34% in constant currency, reflecting strengthening of the dollar relative to the Brazilian real.
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, was $13.9 billion, up 34% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.5 billion, up 41% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The key drivers were costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, which continued to be affected by a reallocation of certain operating expenses; and content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube, followed by hardware-related costs.
Operating expenses, including the impact of the EC fine, were $16 billion. Excluding the impact of the EC fines, operating expenses were $10.9 billion in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year.
Once again, the biggest increase was in R&D expenses, reflecting our continued investment in technical talent. The growth in sales and marketing expenses reflects increases in sales and marketing headcount, primarily for Cloud, followed by advertising investments in Cloud and the Assistant.
G&A expense trends in the second quarter were affected by a number of factors. In particular, performance fees accrued in connection with the recognition of equity security gains, which were again partially offset by the reallocation of certain expenses from G&A primarily to other cost of revenues.
Stock-based compensation totaled $2.4 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 89,058, up 4,008 from last quarter. As in prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were in Cloud for both technical and sales roles.
Operating income was $2.8 billion. Excluding the impact of the EC fines, operating income was $7.9 billion, up 15% versus last year for an operating margin of 24%. Other income and expense was $1.4 billion, which includes $1.1 billion of gains and equity security investments. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.
Our effective tax rate was 24.2% for the second quarter, reflecting a sizable impact from the nondeductibility of the EC fine. Net income was $3.2 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $4.54. Excluding the impact of the EC fine, net income was $8.3 billion and earnings per diluted share were $11.75.
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $5.5 billion, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $10.1 billion with free cash flow of $4.7 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $102 billion.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $32.5 billion, up 25% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenues were $23.3 billion in the quarter, up 26% year-over-year. In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by mobile search with strong contributions from both YouTube and desktop search. Network revenues were $4.8 billion, up 14% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of AdMob and programmatic. Other revenues for Google were $4.4 billion, up 37% year-over-year, fueled by Cloud, Play and Hardware. We continue to provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $6.4 billion or 23% of total advertising revenues and up 26% year-over-year. Total TAC, as a percentage of total advertising revenues, was up year-over-year, primarily reflecting an increase in the Sites TAC rate, which was offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to Sites. The increase in the Sites TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC.
This quarter, we experienced the year-on-year decline in the network TAC rate as the result of a favorable mix shift within our programmatic business. Google's stock-based compensation totaled $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 21% year-over-year. Operating income was $9 billion, up 17% versus last year, and the operating margin was 27.6%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $5.3 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, data center construction and facilities.
Let me now turn and talk about Other Bets. Other Bets revenues were $145 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss was $732 million for the second quarter. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $10 million.
We're pleased with our progress across Other Bets. A couple of updates. Waymo expanded its partnership with Fiat Chrysler with the option to add up to 62,000 Chrysler Pacifica minivans to its self-driving fleet. And last week, Waymo announced that it has driven more than 8 million fully autonomous miles with most of those on city streets.
A couple of weeks ago, X announced that Loon and Wing have graduated to become independent companies under Alphabet. Graduation from X signals that these companies have reached certain technical and business milestones and that their focus is shifting toward commercialization. And just last week, Loon indicated that it is partnering with Telkom Kenya to launch commercial service in regions of Kenya by early 2019.
Let me close with some observations on the quarter and our longer-term outlook. First, with respect to revenues, we're pleased with the ongoing momentum in our advertising businesses. As discussed previously, we continue to identify new opportunities through innovation, including the benefits of applying machine learning to create more useful experiences for users and advertisers. Looking ahead, our Hardware business is seasonal, typically experiencing lower growth in the third quarter in anticipation of the launch of new products for the holiday season.
Second, with respect to profitability, within cost of revenues, the biggest component is TAC. As we've discussed for the past couple of quarters, we expected the pace of year-on-year growth in Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites revenue would slow after the first quarter of 2018, and you can see that clearly in our results this quarter. As frequently discussed, we do expect the Sites TAC rate to continue to increase year-on-year, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search, albeit at a more moderate pace relative to the year-on-year increases experienced over the past several quarters.
Within OpEx, we continue to take a disciplined approach to setting priorities as we invest for the long-term growth. The majority of our headcount growth continues to be in technical roles in engineering and product management. In terms of business areas, the largest number of headcount additions were in our Cloud business with hires for engineering, sales and marketing.
As a reminder, headcount additions tend to be seasonally higher in Q3 because that is when we bring on new graduates. As I mentioned last quarter regarding sales and marketing, we continue to expect expenses to be more heavily weighted toward the back half of the year to support the holiday season.
Another factor to consider in year-on-year comparisons next quarter is the timing of 2 expense items in Q3 last year. As we called out last year, there was a meaningful benefit in the third quarter of 2017 from the shift in timing of our annual equity refresh and also from the timing of sales and marketing spend, which was more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. For our Other Bets, we remain focused on making progress on a number of commercial opportunities across the businesses while continuing to manage investment against achievement of key milestones.
Third, with respect to CapEx, as I discussed with you last quarter, our commitment to growth is evident in the ongoing trend in CapEx investment. We have been investing meaningfully in Search and Ads consistent with the opportunities we see to benefit the user and advertiser experience. And we are investing in the additional compute power required to support growth in the number of YouTube users globally.
We're also investing in new businesses that are growing at a rapid pace and have sizable compute needs, most notably Cloud. The investment pace also reflects the importance of machine learning across all of our products, including Search and Ads. Although machine learning is more compute intensive, it is increasingly core to businesses across Alphabet and opens up the possibility of accelerated innovation in products and services.
In keeping with our approach across Alphabet to invest thoughtfully for long-term value creation, we remain focused on both performance and cost effectiveness. I will now turn the call over to Sundar.",1768
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2018",2018-07-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3731.0,1506960.0,59611598.0,Presenter Speech,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Ruth. It's been a busy few months at Google, and we showed a lot of what we are working on at events like Google Marketing Live, Brandcast and of course, our annual developer conference, Google I/O. It was exciting to have millions of people join us in person and via live stream. Tomorrow, I hope you'll tune in to Google Cloud Next, where the great momentum and innovation in our Cloud business will be fully on display.
The common thread you'll hear on today's call is the benefit of machine learning and AI and how it's improving our products and generating great results for our users and partners. I also hope that everyone enjoyed the World Cup as much as I did. I know our French Googlers were very excited. I love the competition and was extremely proud to see positive feedback about how useful Google Translate was for people who traveled to Russia. The app translates about 143 billion words a day, and during the World Cup, we saw a huge bump in volume.
In these simple moments when you're in an unfamiliar place or you don't know the language, Google is there to help with the right information at the right time. This is what we aspire to be best at, and it's why billions of people continue to put their trust in our products.
Today, I'll start with how AI is enabling us to advance our mission of making information accessible and useful to everyone in new ways. Then, I'll share updates on our computing, video and advertising platforms, which are helping our partners succeed and grow. And finally, I'll talk about our growing Cloud business. Let's begin with AI helping our mission.
We revamped the Google News app in May to great reviews. It uses machine learning to highlight top stories organized for users, explore topics more deeply with articles from a range of trusted news sources. We believe in the need to deliver high-quality information and news to users and to support the news industry as we do so.
The Google Assistant is another great product based on machine learning. By the end of this year, it'll be available in more than 30 languages and 80 countries. We have worked with partners to expand the number of smart devices that are now compatible with the Google Assistant like doorbells, dryers, refrigerators and more and connect with than 5,000 devices in the home.
At Google I/O, we also highlighted how AI is improving Google Maps, including enhancing the experience with Assistant and AR features. Through our improvements in machine learning, we have seen a 25x increase in our ability to build maps algorithmically and we have added 110 million algorithmically drawn buildings to Maps since the beginning of this year. And with over 1 billion users, we are continuing to see tremendous growth in Maps with especially strong growth in countries like Indonesia, India and Nigeria, each of which are growing over 50% year-on-year.
There are many more great AI powered features we rolled out this quarter, including the new version of Gmail with Smart Compose, a new feature that helps users draft e-mails faster. And Google Photos now suggests actions help you brighten, share, rotate or archive a picture.
Next, our computing, video and advertising platforms. These platforms are providing real economic opportunities for developers, creators and publishers in every corner of the world. Last year, I announced that in the 3-year period from 2014 to 2016, we paid out over $15 million in revenue to our creator, publisher and app developer partners in Europe, Middle East and Africa via AdSense, YouTube and Google Play. Our contribution is accelerating. In 2017 alone, we generated an additional $7 billion for these partners.
First, our computing platforms. 10 years ago, we launched the first Android phone with a simple idea: to build a mobile platform that's free and open to everyone. Today, there are more than 24,000 devices at every price point for more than 1,300 different brands. The Android ecosystem supports thousands of phone makers and mobile network operators who build and sell Android devices, millions of app developers around the world who have built their businesses with Android and billions of consumers who can now afford and use cutting-edge Android smartphones. This is all supported by a business model that encourages and enables this open ecosystem to [ triumph ].
Continuing this momentum, at I/O, we unveiled a plethora of new features throughout the Android platform like battery saving features in Android P, new Google Assistant capabilities on Wear OS, a new Android model to help developers optimize for a variety of devices and form factors as well as tools to help users understand and control how they are spending time on their device.
Our investments in our computing platforms as well as in AI and design are also helping us generate great momentum in our Made by Google Hardware business across Pixel, Home, Nest, Chromecast and more. We brought Google Home in many to Ireland, Australia, Spain and Mexico. Additionally, bringing the Nest and Google teams together is showing early results. The products can more seamlessly work together, and our product development and go to market are benefiting from the new alignment. There's a lot more to come here in the next few months.
Second, our video platform, YouTube, is growing tremendously. We launched a revamped YouTube Music service across 17 countries, and it's receiving great feedback from users and artists alike. This quarter, YouTube rebranded its subscription service, YouTube Premium, featuring originals like our hit series, Cobra Kai, which got 41 million views the first episode alone. While advertising on YouTube is an incredibly strong and growing source of income for creators, we are also investing in new ways for creators to generate revenue on the platform, including paid channel memberships, merchandise shelves on YouTube channels and endorsement opportunities through a company we acquired in 2016, FameBit. In fact, half of the creators that used FameBit in the first 3 months of 2018 doubled their YouTube revenue. And third, our advertising platforms, which are firing on all cylinders as we put the power of machine learning into marketers' hands.
At Google Marketing Live, we introduced our newly rebranded advertising products, our core product, Google Ads; Google Marketing Platform, which provides analytics and ad serving for large marketers and agencies; and Google Ad Manager, our monetization engine for publishers. We also announced a new ad format powered by machine learning called responsive search ads. It automates the manual process of building text ads and optimizes them in real time to show the best performing ad for each search query.
Advertisers also got a first look at local campaigns and Smart Campaigns. Local campaigns are designed exclusively to drive foot traffic to local businesses, and Smart Campaigns are now the default for new SMB advertisers. Small business owners love the simplicity and the results. This quarter, we announced shopping and commerce partnerships with leading global retailers like Carrefour designed to give people the power to shop wherever and however they want. Carrefour is a great example of how we can partner deeply with companies, bringing our Shopping and Ads and Cloud products together for them. They recently chose to migrate from Office to G Suite for their more than 160,000 employees and have selected us as their main cloud provider based on our ability to support the company's digital transformation.
Speaking of our efforts to help businesses succeed in the cloud, our Cloud business has great momentum. It's a natural extension of our long-time strengths in computing, data centers and machine learning. We have developed these over many years and they power our own services in the cloud and are now helping others.
This week's Google Cloud Next event will have more than 20,000 attendees, up from over 2,000 at our cloud conference in 2016 with over 250 customers speaking. I won't spoil any of the surprises, but I do want to call out Google Cloud's momentum. Success of our vertical strategy and customer-centric approach was illustrated by key wins, including Domino's Pizza, SoundCloud and PricewaterhouseCoopers. Target is migrating key areas of its business to Google Cloud Platform.
Financial institutions are increasingly turning to the cloud to modernize their systems, explore new business models and improve customer experiences. New customers include Banco Itaú in Brazil. We also have a rapidly growing business for our specialized cloud AI services. AirAsia expanded its relationship with us to use machine learning and data analytics.
We are seeing an acceleration in business adoption of Chromebooks, a more secure and cost-efficient way for businesses to enable their employees to work in the cloud. In Q2, unit sales of managed Chromebooks grew by more than 175% year-over-year, and we saw deployments at customers like Veolia. And to support our growing global customer base, we continue to invest in new cables, open new regions in Finland and Los Angeles and announced the Zürich region. We now have 17 open regions with 3 more on the way.
Before I close, I want to give a quick shout out to the work that we are doing to build great specialized products for the next wave of people coming online for the first time in countries like India, Indonesia, Brazil and Nigeria, many of whom experience the Web only through their mobile phone. This is a big area of focus for us.
Through a great partnership with Indian Railways and RailTel, we have hit our goal of enabling high-speed public Wi-Fi in 400 train stations across India. We have also rolled out this Google station model in Indonesia and Mexico. More to come soon.
And to help spur AI innovation in Africa, we recently announced a new Google AI research center in Ghana with the goal of bringing together top machine learning researchers and engineers to explore AI research and applications in Africa and beyond.
Of course, our commitment to help communities and people benefit from the digital economy extends beyond the products that they use. Last month, as part of our broader Grow with Google effort, we expanded the Google IT Support Professional Certificate program to more than 25 community colleges in the U.S. This will give students an opportunity to learn skills needed to jump-start their careers in IT support.
I want to thank Googlers for their hard work, which helps us create products that billions of people love and use every day. With that, I'll hand it back over to Ruth.",1760

Sundar, for you, following up on your comments, we've seen all of these partnerships announced in the e-commerce space. Want to understand how those partnerships might evolve over the next couple of years, what Google brings to the table for those partners, what it might do for the advertising services business as we think long term. And then we've been getting a lot of questions on Waymo in the quarter. Is there any sense you can give us of some of the key investment milestones or how we should be thinking about capital allocated to the Waymo business in the coming years?",107
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2018",2018-07-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3731.0,1506960.0,59611602.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,7,"Great. On the commerce front, obviously, it's a natural sector, I think, for us to drive partnerships. We already have deep advertising relationships with many of these providers. Increasingly, Shopping is an area where we are beginning to work together. And finally, I think cloud is another important way by which we can start working together. So I do think we are seeing a lot of traction there. I gave the Carrefour example. We also announced a strategic partnership and significant investment in JD.com, the second largest e-commerce company in China. Today, we are already, for example, in Google Express, we are partnering with over 100 merchants, including national retailers like Walmart, Costco, Target, Walgreens and PetSmart. So there's a lot of traction. I think we are building upon these relationships, trying to have more holistic conversations across the breadth of our offerings, and I think I see it all being very synergistic.",153

You've seen us talk about our progress on a number of fronts. I think the main point, it is still very early but -- in terms of our progress. So 2018, the focus has been to launch the commercial rider program in Phoenix that we've talked about, looking to do that by year-end. We do view that as a first step in building a more fully rolled out rider program in the future. And as we've discussed on prior calls, we continue to trial the program in Phoenix with an emphasis on delivering a safe experience that delights users. We've also continued to build out our vehicle relationships. You saw announcements regarding FCA and Jaguar. We're expanding our testing to more states. We're also working on additional areas such as logistics and deliveries. We talked this past quarter about licensing the technology for personal use vehicles, and we're also focused on working with cities to help strengthen public transportation. More specifically, your focus on CapEx, as I said, we're excited about the long-term opportunity, but creation of a new market does take time. And then on the CapEx versus OpEx, the way it works is once the commercial program is up and running beyond what's viewed as more of a development or R&D phase, then much of the investments are CapEx versus OpEx, and that's for car sensors and any other spend. So we're excited. We do think it's a really important market, but it is still very early.",264

I just had 2 questions. One, I was wondering if you could talk about what you've seen thus far with the rollout of GDPR. Anything you could share with us and just how that's played out versus your expectations at this point? And then, Sundar, as you mentioned, with Google Next upon us and you're obviously -- you guys are talking very positively about the business. But are there any more steps you can share with us even about the growth rates in G Suite or GCP or combined? And then when we think about this business scaling over time, is there any reason to think that the pace of gross margin progression would be materially different than, say, Azure or AWS at similar revenue levels?",127

On GDPR, obviously, it's something we have been working on for a long time, well over 18 months. But the rollout just happened towards the end of second quarter, so it's a bit early to ask us anything. But for us, it's been super important to get it right, and we've always been focused on user privacy. But it's been a big change for a lot of our partners as well, and so we are working closely with our partners and regulators and committed to doing it right. But it's too early to tell. And on Google Next and Cloud, obviously, the conference is tomorrow. So I will hold for the announcements there. A couple things. G Suite is definitely, I think, seeing a lot of momentum. We are definitely -- have noticed in the -- now I think it's -- it can definitely sell the needs of a large enterprise. It's clear. I gave the Carrefour example, but increasingly, we are seeing big companies take on the migration. So that's been, for sure, a positive development. And on Cloud, I think we are investing for the long run. We are definitely seeing traction. A lot of our effort from a product and technology standpoint, we are definitely there and differentiated. It's been a lot about investing in our go-to-market efforts, and as we do it, both developing our in-house strengths but as well as partnering, those things are beginning to pay dividends.

The first one, the Google Assistant and the Hardware on the Google Home Minis, was curious if you could just talk about sort of early learnings and differences in consumer behavior with how they interact with those devices as opposed through -- as opposed to mobile search on the phones. And I know you're always very focused on the long-term value proposition for your users and advertisers, if you talk to what's the focus in the Hardware is long term for users and advertisers. And Sundar, appreciate your color on India and Indonesia in emerging markets. Talk about how you're strategically trying to position yourself or the business potentially beyond advertising and payments or other areas in those countries, if you could, please.",126

And obviously, it's early days, but it's already exciting to see. People definitely are pushing the boundaries of what they can do with these devices. Home control and automation is a good example of the kind of use case that's very, very different consumer behavior and which is why our assets in Nest, et cetera, end up mattering over time. So there's a lot more actions people are trying to get things done, which is definitely areas where we are focused on. But I think it's important to understand that the experience not just in the context of Home and Home Mini but also your core mobile experience, how it evolves on the phone and across the screens you will have in your lives. So we are taking the end-to-end user experience in mind, and that's where all the investments we have done over many, many years, I think, will come into play as the product evolves. On your question about emerging markets, the user growth there is extraordinary to see, and we are seeing it across all our products. So all our major products, products which have over 1 billion users each, they are all doing well in these markets. And so that's where most of the growth is going to come from. And so it's an important area of focus. And we do see unique opportunities in these markets, which are different from the markets we are in here in our more mature markets. You highlighted payments as a good example, and you've seen us address that explicitly with Google Tez in India. And so we will look to do more like that. And beyond just getting our products working better, we're going to be opportunistic. We are investing in talent in these countries, and there's a lot of innovation, which is going to happen from these countries, both for their own markets and for the world beyond, and we want to be in a position to do that well.",345

First for Ruth. You've talked about the higher cost as you shift to machine-learning-driven business and then also your tech upgrade cycle around machine. Can you give us a sense of where you are in making those transitions and absorbing those investments from a cost perspective? And then, Sundar, mobile strength clearly in the quarter. Can you just help us understand better how machine learning and AI are driving the stronger growth in mobile search and if there's any specific innovations or products you can point to that are driving that outsized growth?",97

Part of it, as I called out, is with respect to OpEx. We're hiring, and what you're seeing is the investments we're making across the board. It's Ads. It's Cloud. It's Hardware. It's the Assistant. But it is also very much in machine learning, and we're really proud of the team that we have given the opportunity set that they're able to address. And I think you were trying -- you were getting more broadly at CapEx. The way we're focused on CapEx, as I've said last quarter as well, we view this as a lens into our outlook for growth in the required additional compute capacity. And there are a number of growth drivers there, and part is really to support growth that we're seeing in our Search and Ads business. That's really consistent with the momentum that we've commented on today and the exciting opportunities that we see to further enhance the user and advertiser experience. It's also for our newer businesses as I noted in opening comments. And then very importantly, it reflects the importance of machine learning across our products, including Search and Ads. We've talked about this in the past. Machine learning is more compute intensive, but it also opens up more services and products across Alphabet. And that's what we're investing in to make sure that we've got the capacity with best-in-class compute capacity. And so the build is really machines, data centers and network infrastructure. And just to make sure and put a fine point, while we're ensuring that we're well positioned to support the growth we see, we do constantly remain focused on efficiency per unit of compute. We've talked about that on many prior calls and are investing here for long-term value creation thoughtfully in order to be able to pursue the opportunities that we see ahead of us.",337

We've obviously used machine learning across the board, be it our ranking and actually understanding the intent and the context around the query and getting you the right answer. I think the experiences -- I mean, the improvements are happening continuously. And so we are -- I would just say we're getting deeper in terms of what we are able to do. In terms of specific innovations of products, it's super important to understand. I gave the Translate example earlier. While it may seem like a specific use case, it's obviously -- obviously, we can do Translate well because of machine learning. But where it helps us is we want Google to be the source you think of when you run into a problem. And the fact that the data shows that during the World Cup in Russia, our usage spiked up, to me shows that when people are running into new things, new experiences, when they have questions on their mind, Google is what they are reaching out to. And I think the way we continue to do that well is by -- increasingly by using machine learning. So that's the depth to which we think about this.",226

You talked about Android in your prepared remarks. In your blog post, you said that you're concerned that the Android ruling from the EC sends a troubling signal in favor of proprietary systems over open platforms. So I wonder, how are you thinking about the possible business impact from this Android ruling, specifically untying the Play Store from Search in the Chrome browser? And does it, in any way, change your strategic approach for Android going forward? And then for Ruth on the theme of OpEx investment trends, if we isolate just the other revenue businesses, Cloud, Play and Hardware, all growth drivers but clearly, structurally different in terms of the competitive landscape and profitability. You said most of the headcount additions are in Cloud, but would love to understand more about how you prioritize investment across Cloud, Play and Hardware, those 3.",146

You can clearly see there's robust competition. There's a lot of innovation, lower prices that has made Android possible at every price point. And so I think, overall, it's created more choice for everyone, not less. We have -- it's -- we are analyzing the decision, and I think it's too early to comment or speculate beyond what we've already said. But we will always take a constructive approach. We'll appeal the commission's decision and take the due process available to us. But we're also looking forward to finding a solution above all that preserves the enormous benefits of Android to users and so on. So there is more work to be done, and I think it'll become clearer as we go along. But I'm confident that we can find a way to make sure Android is available at scale to users everywhere.",167

Sundar commented on some of them. As did I., looking at opportunities to enhance the user experience, to continue to improve tools for advertisers and both of which extend the growth there. And that's for mobile, and what we're increasingly seeing is, as we focus on mobile, the benefits are across platform and help explain the growth we're seeing in desktop and YouTube. So we are continuing to invest here. I don't want to leave you with an answer, with the notion that the investment is just going to the newer businesses. And then more specifically to your question, what we look at is the opportunity set, the -- each one of these is different. When we start with Cloud, as Sundar commented, given the core capabilities that we are building upon, our technical infrastructure, security, apps, machine learning, analytical tools, our view is that we're addressing a rapidly growing market with the core pillars that are needed to win. And what has been the recurring theme that we've talked about on these calls is the need to further build out our go-to-market capabilities and ensure that we've got the functional requirements that enterprise customers deserve. So it's really looking at the scale of the opportunity, the pace of investment that can be done effectively and therefore, position us well. Our Hardware business continues to deliver significant growth, particularly with the sales of the Home family of products. And you've seen us invest there. We talked about the HTC acquisition last quarter because this is a scale business, and the ability to operate as effectively as possible underscores the types of investment we're making. Play continues to benefit from broad-based app strength, has been a long-standing strength of ours, and we're continuing to invest as needed there.",346

It seems like your commentary on cloud is very positive. It seems like that's also what we're hearing from Microsoft and my guess is from Amazon, what they're seeing. Do you think we're just at a broad industry inflection point in terms of cloud adoption? And any thoughts as to why we're seeing it now? And then on -- I had a question on advertising. There's this big bucket of ad spend called trade promotion spend that's largely been off-line I think, and it's almost as big maybe on a global basis as kind of traditional TV brand advertising. Any thoughts on that as an opportunity, whether there's an ability for that to really migrate heavily online and Google's ability to tap into those dollars?",127

I think all the major players are definitely seeing traction. And to me, the reason is, typically, when you look at enterprises, you -- once you've deployed and you have an architecture, you try and stay on it as long as you can in many, many cases because change is hard. But there's a case in which the benefits are super clear. And over time, I think there's a tremendous cost to your business of being on the wrong architecture, especially if you need to digitally transform yourself. Thinking through the cloud architecture becomes an important way by which you're improving your business. So I think, at a foundational level, it's clearly there on everyone's minds. It's not just on -- CEOs are asking questions about cloud. Almost all businesses I deal with I can clearly see the question is on the mind of their CEO, and so I think it's important. Also think it's going to be businesses are going to embrace multiple clouds over time, too. So I think not only is this early, but I think it is going to transform. And there's a lot of opportunity here. And our goal here is it's something we view. This is something we have built experience over 20 years, and we are thoughtfully gaining strength and committed to it for the very long term.",251

Over 90% of commerce is still off-line, and we do see a great opportunity for digital to play a bigger role in that and tap into our budgets -- into other budgets that have traditionally been there. And so we are quite focused on the advertising opportunities I've said and the fact that ad budgets are off-line.

I recognize that's an initiative that will help drive demand across a number of Google properties. But I'm curious in particular about Maps, and with it being product aimed at driving store visits, one would assume Maps would play an interesting part in that. And in the past when we've asked you about Maps, it was focused more on getting the user experience right.

Local is an extraordinary use case in mobile. Local mobile searches are growing faster than mobile searches for us and have increased by almost 50% in the last year alone. And we are continuing to invest in building a local experience that benefits merchants, users and advertisers. And local campaigns is something new, which we announced at Google Marketing Live a couple of weeks ago. It's a new campaign where if you're a local business, it's designed to drive foot traffic to you. You provide us with your budget, business locations and creatives, and we use machine learning to automatically optimize that to appear across our properties, right? And along with that, you've rightly noticed that we are beginning to experiment with new ad formats, which we have had in beta, but we are pushing on them a bit more in Maps itself, both promoted places and place page ads. So these are important ways by which we are exploring the commercial opportunity around Maps. I've always felt Maps is a tremendous asset we have. And we have really focused on the user side of things, and we will continue to do so because the growth is very, very high. So we see a lot of headroom. And -- but as their experience is -- we get a better understanding of it, we are developing our views on how we can bring monetization experiences. And so these are all steps in that direction.

I mean, the way we look at it is we're pleased with the strength in each of the regions at 19% year-on-year growth in EMEA on a fixed basis. We're pleased with the strength in the business, and as Sundar said, I think it is too early to comment on GDPR. We then hope that the geographic split gives you a better sense of what's kind of the dynamics in each of the various regions. And as we both commented on, as long as you raised the regional question, I got to comment on APAC here. Really pleased with the growth, 34% on a fixed FX basis, and it underscores Sundar's comments about terrific products in rapidly growing markets as well as a superb leadership group. Mobile strength is the key there as well, and we're really pleased about the breadth by country that we're seeing. We're very focused on the region.

Maybe first going back to the commerce theme. I wanted to ask about Shopping Actions and the level of adoption you might be seeing with that format.

And in all of these areas, we always have a high bar to make sure the user experience is working well. You have seen us do that with Maps or something like that. And I think, today, while we have taken promising steps with Shopping Actions, for all of this to really work well and to delight users, I still feel we have some work ahead of us, and that's what we are focused on. So we'll stay focused there, get the experience, and then that will give us new avenues to monetize it. I've seen this with YouTube now. Beyond ads, we are experimenting with a lot of new formats, and the same thing here. So I'm pretty confident of our ability to do that well if you get the experience right.",170

The main point is that we do continue to expect the TAC rate to increase on a year-on-year basis. And the primary reason is the one we've talked about with you in the past. It's the underlying shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC than desktop. So on a year-on-year basis, that's the trend that you're really seeing as the ongoing strength in mobile. Over the past 4 quarters, changes in partnership agreements have also been a driver of increases in the TAC rate, and then there are host of other factors that we've talked about that can have an impact in any quarter like device mix or partner mix or mix of organic in paid distribution points. And so as we called out last quarter, we did expect the pace of year-on-year growth in the Sites TAC rate to slow beginning in this quarter, the second quarter, and you can clearly see that in the data. And as we've repeatedly said, it is most instructive to focus on year-on-year changes given the significance of the shift to mobile and mobile growth. And so variations in quarter-on-quarter moves are less instructive.",218

If I go back a couple of years when we incorporated stock-based compensation into the way we're talking about the businesses, I made the point that, that is helpful both externally and internally. And looking at resource utilization, the same is clearly true of CapEx. And we're quite focused on long-term value creation, focused on ensuring that we're pursuing attractive opportunities in a prudent, appropriate way to capture the opportunity while making sure that we're looking at the full, again, resource requirements. So at this point, that's an interesting way of framing the question how does it grow even faster from here. We're quite focused on this being an aggressive pace and an appropriate one given the opportunity set we see, and it is across data centers, machines and network infrastructure as I said.",183

We've got an intense focus on innovation that we've discussed previously that's enabled us to deliver over 100 innovations each quarter, and really exciting area is the benefit of machine learning. It's a valuable driver of our growth, not only enhancing experiences for users but the tools that we talked about for advertisers and for app developers really helping them find the right audience to be able to optimize campaigns at scale to deliver more relevance and higher-quality ads. Sundar talked about a number of them. The Google Marketing Live, we really highlighted what we're seeing there and the benefits, whether we're talking about responsive search ads or local campaigns, smart shopping campaigns. Another great example is Universal App Campaigns. So across the board, and again, I'd made this comment previously, but the benefit we're seeing on mobile is extending to the growth opportunities across platforms.",182

And I would add that a good way to think about it is, today, there's a lot of complexity you need to deal with as an advertiser, and increasingly, we are using machine learning to do all the hard work and get them to focus on the business problem they are trying to solve. And that turns out to be a big driver overall. On YouTube, we definitely are continuing to see great product momentum. It's the user adoption and interest, and our metrics are very strong, continues to grow. And the growth is global. And we see it across many, many verticals. And overall, we've invested a lot in making sure we are delivering the content responsibly, and it's a been a big area of focus across Google. We are investing a lot in people to review the content that going on, improving the policies and again, using machine learning to make all of this work better. And I think people are noticing it, including our advertisers, and they are engaging with the platform more. So I would say, overall, there's a lot of momentum there, and I'm excited about it.",193

29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2018",2018-10-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3511.0,1580670.0,62369206.0,Presenter Speech,Ruth Porat,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Ellen. Our revenues in the third quarter continued to benefit from ongoing strength in mobile search with important contributions from YouTube, Cloud and desktop search, resulting in consolidated revenues of $33.7 billion, up 21% year-on-year and up 22% in constant currency. 
For today's call, I will begin with results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google, followed by Other Bets, and we'll conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which, we will take your questions. 
Starting with the summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Our total revenues of $33.7 billion reflect a negative currency impact year-over-year of $385 million or $305 million after the impact of our hedging program. 
Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography, you can see that our performance was strong again in all regions. U.S. revenues were $15.5 billion, up 20% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $11 billion, up 20% year-over-year. In constant currency terms, EMEA grew 19%. APAC revenues were $5.4 billion, up 29% versus last year and up 30% in constant currency. Other Americas revenues were $1.8 billion, up 19% year-over-year and up 28% in constant currency, reflecting weakening of the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso.
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, was $14.3 billion, up 28% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.7 billion, up 36% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The key drivers were costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, which continue to be affected by a reallocation of certain operating expenses, and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube. 
Operating expenses were $11.1 billion, up 26% year-over-year. Once again, the biggest increase was in R&D expenses, reflecting our continued investment in technical talent. The growth in sales and marketing expenses reflects increases in sales and marketing headcount, primarily for Cloud and Ads, followed by advertising investments in Cloud, Chromebooks for the back-to-school season and the Google Assistant. 
G&A expense trends in the third quarter were affected by a number of factors. In particular, the performance fees accrued in connection with recognition of equity security gains, which were again partially offset by the reallocation of certain expenses from G&A, primarily to other cost of revenues. 
Stock-based compensation totaled $2.2 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 94,372, up 5,314 from last quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. 
In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were in Cloud for both technical and sales roles. Operating income was $8.3 billion, up 7% versus last year for an operating margin of 25%. As discussed in the previous 2 quarters, both operating income and OI&E are affected by the new accounting standard that changes the way companies account for equity security investments. This new standard continues to result in greater volatility. Once again, we've provided a table in our earnings press release to highlight the impact on particular line items. 
Other income and expense was $1.8 billion, which includes $1.4 billion of gains in equity security investments. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. 
Our effective tax rate was 8.8% for the third quarter, reflecting discrete items, notably an adjustment associated with the U.S. Tax Act. Net income was $9.2 billion and earnings per diluted share were $13.06. 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $5.3 billion, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $13.2 billion with free cash flow of $7.9 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $106 billion. Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. 
Revenues were $33.6 billion, up 21% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $24.1 billion in the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by mobile search, with a strong contribution from YouTube followed by desktop search.
Network revenues were $4.9 billion, up 13% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of AdMob and programmatic. Other revenues for Google were $4.6 billion, up 29% year-over-year, fueled by Cloud and Play. 
We continue to provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. Total traffic acquisition costs were $6.6 billion or 23% of total advertising revenues and up 20% year-over-year. Total TAC, as a percentage of total advertising revenues, was relatively flat year-over-year, primarily reflecting a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites, offset by an increase in the sites TAC rate. The increase in the sites TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC. 
This quarter, we experienced a year-on-year decline in the network TAC rate due to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant. Google stock-based compensation totaled $2.1 billion for the quarter, up 23% year-over-year. Operating income was $9.5 billion, up 11% versus last year. And the operating margin was 28.2%. 
Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $5.6 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, data center construction and facilities. Let me now turn to Other Bets. Revenues were $146 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss was $727 million. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $55 million. In terms of Other Bets updates for the quarter. With Waymo in the third quarter, we built and our Early Rider Program, both expanding the group of participants and beginning to test pricing models. At Verily, the team continues to execute on its various partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies, consistent with its mission to move medicine from reactive to proactive. Recently launched efforts included joint venture with ResMed to focus on sleeping disorders and a research collaboration with Gilead. 
Finally, you can see in our results the benefit and quality of our investment teams, GV and CapitalG, which are also within Other Bets. Within the $1.4 billion of reported gains in equity securities in OI&E, approximately $400 million was realized in Q3. There will be more detail on these investment activities in the 10-Q.
Let me close with some observations on the quarter and our longer-term outlook. First, with respect to revenues. In the third quarter, results reflect FX headwinds with the U.S. dollar strengthening, in contrast to the tailwinds that enhanced reported results in the first half of the year. We continue to be pleased with the underlying momentum in our advertising businesses as we apply our strengths in machine learning to improve the experience for users and advertisers. As we noted, hardware was only a modest contributor in the third quarter as we launched a new Made by Google family of products for the fourth quarter holiday season. 
Second, with respect to profitability. Within cost of revenues, the biggest component is TAC. We indicated on the fourth quarter 2017 call that the pace of year-on-year growth in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenues would begin to slow after the first quarter of 2018, and you can see that again clearly in our results this quarter. 
As frequently discussed, we do expect the sites TAC rate to continue to increase year-on-year, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search. Looking ahead, we expect seasonal impacts to our other cost of sales from hardware sales, which are typically higher in the fourth quarter of the year as well as from increased content acquisition cost for YouTube, which have also historically been higher in the fourth quarter. 
Within OpEx, we continue to prioritize our investments to support long-term growth. In terms of headcount, growth was seasonally higher in the third quarter because we brought on new graduates. We are continuing to invest in adding talent to our priority areas, particularly for technical roles in engineering and product management, and to support our most sizable growth areas, in particular, Cloud. As I've mentioned previously regarding sales and marketing, expenses are more heavily weighted toward the back half of the year. As you have seen in prior years, these expenses are particularly elevated in the fourth quarter to support the holiday season.
Other Bets remains a portfolio of earlier-stage businesses focused on addressing sizable markets. We are moving toward early stages of commercialization while continuing to calibrate the pace of investment against achievement of key milestones. 
And finally, with respect to CapEx, you can see our continued investment as we build the infrastructure needed to support the opportunities we see across our businesses. This includes a number of data center construction projects in-flight as well as ongoing expansion in our compute capacity. 
I will now turn the call over to Sundar.",1488
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2018",2018-10-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3511.0,1580670.0,62369207.0,Presenter Speech,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Ruth. We had a great quarter, and it was particularly special because last month, we celebrated Google's 20th birthday and the 10th birthday of Chrome. It's exciting to think that 20 years in, we are still just at the beginning of what's possible. We get billions of questions from users every day, and about 15% of those are queries we have never seen before. 
Our mission to make the world's information accessible and useful is as relevant today as when we started. I want to begin by highlighting our recently launched family of hardware. It's a great example of how we bring together Google's strengths to help people through their day. Then I'll touch on ways AI is helping us approach our mission. I'll give an update on our video and advertising platforms. And finally, I'll talk about our growing Cloud business. 
First, hardware. Every year, we have a new opportunity to push the boundaries of computing. Those experiences come to life in our Made by Google hardware, which combines the latest advances in software, hardware and AI. 
Our third-generation is our best yet. It includes the Pixel 3, Google Home Hub, the Pixel Slate tablet and more. We're getting great feedback, and I'm very excited for users to try these devices, especially as the holiday season approaches. 
Our new hardware lineup showcases the best of Google, including the Google Assistant, Android and Chrome. With the Pixel 3, we've used AI to create a best-in-class camera. New features like Top Shot make it so you never miss a shot. If your timing wasn't perfect, the camera will suggest a better frame and give you the option to save it. And Night Sight will help you take really good pictures even in bad light. Pixel 3 also has a custom security chip called Titan M. It was built to secure Google's own data centers, and now we are bringing it to our users. We also released Google Home Hub, our first smart speaker with a screen. It shows your morning commute, let's you control your smartphone and gives you hands-free help in the kitchen. And Pixel Slate Chrome OS reimagined as a tablet with all the great apps from the Play Store.
Our hardware efforts are picking up real momentum. For example, daily active users of our Google Home devices have grown by over 5x in the last year alone. I'm incredibly proud of our growing hardware team, including the talented employees who came over from HTC and Nest. Our investments are paying off as we bring the best of Google to more users and in more countries around the world. 
Even as we build up our hardware business, we continue to advance our mission across our core products and platforms. Last month, we kicked off 20 years of Google Search by introducing some of the biggest updates in many years. They include a new AI-powered ranking approach that delivers more relevant results, a redesigned Google Feed called Discover to help you stay informed on topics that matter to you, and a new search experience for Google Images. 
We also continue to tackle the information problem of connecting people to relevant jobs right from search. This has already helped connect over 100 million people in 92 countries to job listings that meet their needs and skills. Now U.S. service members can search for jobs for veterans and enter their military occupational code to see relevant civilian jobs. The Google Assistant continues to gain traction, drawing on our strengths in machine learning and helpful Google services like Search, YouTube and Maps. We have expanded the Assistant to 20 languages and 76 countries, and it can now understand and speak more than one language at a time. We launched our first set of smart displays with Lenovo and JBL as well as our own Google Home Hub. 
Pixel users in the U.S. will be the first to try our new Duplex technology, which helps you complete real-world tasks over the phone, like calling a restaurant to book a table. And we introduced a new way to easily book ride services with your Google Assistant. 
In Maps, we also made several improvements, including a commute tab with live traffic and transit information and support for mixed-mode commutes. Earlier this month, we announced an exciting test called Project Stream. We are working with video game publisher, Ubisoft, to stream their latest game, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, to Chrome browsers on laptops and desktops. Streaming graphically rich content for video games represents a great technical advance, and we look forward to seeing what's possible here.
I'm particularly proud that our strengths in AI are creating life-changing contributions in other fields. For example, our recent flood prediction efforts, which use AI to better predict when floods will occur, has the potential to help millions of people get out of harm's way. We are starting in India, where 20% of flood-related fatalities occur today, and we're looking to expand to more countries soon. 
Earlier this month, our research has showed how they've applied deep learning models to improve the accuracy of diagnosis for metastatic breast cancer. Our research found that pathologists and AI can work together more effectively than either alone. 
Moving to our video and advertising platforms, which are creating economic opportunities for partners around the world. First, YouTube. One particular area of focus is educational content. Every day, people from all over the world turn to YouTube to learn something new, from career skills to coding to cooking. Just this week, we announced a $20 million investment to expand our YouTube learning initiative, which will help fund established and emerging educational careers. We are also partnering with organizations like Goodwill and Year Up to create curated playlists that teach career skills directly in our new learning channel. YouTube's ads business continues to provide great results for marketers and creators. At Advertising Week, we announced that we'll be expanding our popular TrueView actions format. This helps users take action directly from video ads. They can now do things like sign up for a newsletter. And soon, they'll be able to find movie showtimes, download apps or even book a trip right from the ad. For creators, YouTube is continuing to build alternative revenue products, like Super Chat, Channel Memberships and the ability to sell merchandise directly to fans. YouTube Gaming creator, Markiplier, increased its revenue by 20% using Channel Memberships. We continue to see positive traction for our newest subscription experiences too. YouTube Premium, YouTube TV and YouTube Music premium are continuing to expand to many new countries. The team is also investing in growing and improving the news experience on YouTube. More prominently surfacing credible news sources on the platform is a big priority for us. 
Next, our advertising platforms. Advertisers love that we are bringing our machine learning strengths to offerings like responsive search ads and Universal App Campaigns to create more effective ads. One new example is Smart Shopping campaigns, which use signals like seasonality and price to optimize where ads are shown. Tens of thousands of advertisers are using this and seeing an average of 20% more sales for the same budget. Just last week, we announced that Nike, Best Buy and Sephora are joining our Shopping Actions program. This allows people to move seamlessly from browsing to buying with a universal cart that works across Google Search and our system.
In apps, we announced a partnership with Unity Technologies, which gives our advertisers access to one of the largest global networks of mobile gaming titles across 1.5 billion devices. Unity's developers can monetize their apps with Google Ads without any additional development work. And lastly, our growing Cloud business.
At Google Cloud Next, we made over 100 announcements, including the Titan security key, which features Google-designed firmware to help verify that nothing on a customer's key has been tampered with. And we expanded our breakthrough Cloud AutoML portfolio, which now includes vision, natural language and translation. 
And all over the world, we are seeing great customer adoption of our Cloud Platform. With the help of SAP, Metro, one of our largest B2B wholesalers globally, is centralizing their finance system on Google Cloud Platform. They're using BigQuery to generate data-driven insights to help create more personalized marketing campaigns. 
In the U.S., we partnered with the National Institutes of Health to provide access to Cloud services that help researchers access large data sets to accelerate biomedical advances. We also added new customers like ING and Broadcom, joining existing customers like PayPal, ANZ Bank and Kroger. Our G Suite business continues to fuel transformation in companies large and small, and we crossed 2 important milestones in the quarter. Google Drive became the eighth Google product with 1 billion monthly active users. And Gmail now has more than 1.5 billion monthly active users. One of our big wins in the quarter was Fast Retailing, the Japanese retailer best known for its popular brand, UNIQLO, which is migrating its employees globally to G Suite, while also pursuing AI solutions like on-demand forecasting on Google Cloud Platform. Our Cloud business is benefiting from our investments in technical infrastructure, including a U.S.-Europe cable that will improve speeds for millions of people. 
Before I wrap up, I want to quickly call out our continued momentum in Asia as well as the investments that we are making in the U.S. As you can see from our results, revenue growth in APAC remains strong. This is a reflection of our very focused efforts to build great experiences for the billions of people across the region. We have adapted many of our core products like Search, Maps and YouTube to work well for the next generation of users coming online.
We're also building products to meet the specific needs of users in the region like Tez, a digital payments app for India to help people easily pay their electrician or split a dinner bill with just a few taps. Just 1 year since it launched, over 30 million people in businesses across India now use the app every month, and they've collectively made more than 1 billion transactions. We have recently rebranded the app to Google Pay as we look to bring many of the app's features to others around the world. We are also investing closer to home. In Q3, more than 80% of Alphabet's total capital expenditures was within the U.S. Not only do these investments in data centers, machines and offices allow us to provide great services to users, they have a strong positive impact on the communities around them, supporting thousands of jobs and countless local businesses. 
This year-to-date, we have added over 9,000 new employees in the U.S., and we continue to grow faster outside the Bay Area than in it. As you can see, there's exciting momentum across many different areas. I'm constantly struck by the number of incredible opportunities ahead of us as a company and how far we have come over the last 20 years. I want to say a big thank you to all of the Googlers around the world who help us deliver on that mission every day. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Ruth",1873

Referencing the blog posts and some of the changes about how you see the future of Search, I wanted to know what are some of the key investments you think the company needs to make so that Search becomes more visual or relevant. And what that might mean tying it back to the business for engagement with your products, relevancy of ads over the medium to long term. And then with respect to your comments on YouTube, we're starting to hear from advertisers there is some blurring between brand and direct response ad budgets as they look at products maybe more across blended lines. It sounds like the YouTube announcements coming out of Ad Week were about making YouTube more responsive or more direct response. How are you thinking about the blurring of those lines and what it means for product development long-term?",150

I'll take the two. The first on Search. You're right that with Search, we are always trying to anticipate where users -- what the user experience expectations are and trying to meet them there. And increasingly in mobile, people do want immersive, engaging experiences. They want their experiences to be more visual, and that's partly what you saw us announce in our 20th birthday event. And we are excited to move in that direction. And I do think we have a lot of important assets to bring here. YouTube is a big part of what we do. We are investing in image search, and we do have products like Google Maps and Photos, which all add to that visual experience. And as part of doing that, we are investing in our advertising offerings as well. And so over time, we'll adapt that so they go hand-in-hand. But I think it's an important evolution for us. In terms of YouTube, I think it is -- part of what makes YouTube great is I think we can offer different opportunities for advertisers. We've always felt direct response is something that can work well on YouTube, and our instinct is bearing out. And I look at my personal use cases. There are many times now, sometimes instead of search, I actually find something I want to do in YouTube, maybe thinking about going to a place and I research it on YouTube. So I think it offers the same opportunity over time. And from our standpoint, we want to make sure we are evolving the product to bring those opportunities to advertisers. I'm very excited about it.",276

First, earlier this month, or it might have been late last month, Sridhar Ramaswamy, your Head of Ads and Commerce, left to go to a VC firm. Betting that wasn't a surprise to you, but I'm just hoping you could shed a little light on sort of succession planning for that important role and whether or not you expect any sort of broad changes to ad product strategy. And then second, just amongst those announcements on the anniversary were the evolution of Feed to Discover. And I recognize that's an evolution of a product, but it does look like you're taking advantage of that long-unused white space on Google.com. And so just love to hear a little bit more, that's sort of a follow-up on Eric's question on the evolution of Search, but how you see that surface, in particular, evolving and particularly the potential for ad monetization over time.",155

On the first one, look, I mean, we -- one of the things I'm really proud about Google is we have a deep bench of talent and, for example, in the Ads team, almost all of our senior Ads leadership has been here for well over a decade. And so for us, we are fortunate to be able to tap into it. Our Ads leadership comes -- Prabhakar, who has taken over our Ads product and engineering efforts, is someone I worked with for many, many years, and most recently has led our G Suite business, but has done many roles before as a deep computer scientist. And I expect to -- for him to continue our tradition of technical excellence with which he approach our advertising work. Also, I want to mention Philipp and his team, his extraordinary team, who definitely lead many of our initiatives here. And Philipp and, Prabhakar, with them, I think it's in great hands. And I expect a lot of continuity there. On your question on Search and Discover, it's -- in addition to making Search more visual, one of the things we are very, very focused on is not always do users turn to us and actually ask a question. So we feel our job is to be there when users need us, anticipate what they want and, sometimes, proactively meet them. That's where services like Discover really play a role, right? I think -- and we are thinking hard about how we can surface relevant information for our users, stuff they are really looking for, can act on in a way in which it's delightful for them and it's showing up for them when they need it. So I see that as an important evolution of Search as well. And so you're going to see us investing more. Mobile offers us a great opportunity. And if you use it in Pixel 3, that's the latest product in which we bring our vision of how to bring all these products together. And we'll give you a good sense of how we plan to do that over time.",355

You spent time discussing your suite of hardware devices, the Google Assistant, the Pixel. How are you measuring the returns on those investments in hardware, both in the products and on the marketing side here, in a pretty competitive marketplace? What are the milestones for success that we should be looking for on hardware? And then for Ruth, as we start to look ahead to 2019, as you plan for '19, how are you thinking about the relationship between revenue growth and dollars of operating income growth for next year, particularly if the macroeconomic environment were to become, let's say, less of a tailwind to the broader ads environment as it was this year and in prior years?",127

And so -- and a lot of times, that involves thinking across the whole stack, bringing together the entire experience in an integrated way for our users. And we genuinely see a very differentiated way to do this. We think our approach of bringing together AI, software and hardware is unique, and we think we can deliver the best-in-class experience. And we are committed to doing it. At the same time, we want to build a great business here as well. So we are investing in the long run because we see it clearly as an important business opportunity for us as well. So both go hand-in-hand. We closely look at metrics. And the metrics, we've been very focused on for the last couple of years. This is our third generation of hardware. It's the first time we actually are doing our products end-to-end, and we've expanded to newer categories. We look at user feedback and reception. We measure NPS scores. And our scores are now reflecting best-in-class in the category. And beyond that, we are looking at how the market adoption is, and we are thoughtfully building a business, but we are committed to building and investing for the long run.",214

And many of the questions that have been already asked sort of point to the direction that we feel really good about the underlying strength in the Ads business. As we've talked about on numerous calls, we continue to invest here because we see ongoing opportunities, in particular, as we leverage machine learning to provide better experience for users and for advertisers. And some of the comments that Sundar made about the opportunities that open up with visual search, again, continue to point to the direction of direct response, continue to point to some of the underlying areas in which we're focused. But as we've talked about on prior calls, that's one element of it, and we continue to invest for opportunities that are sizable over the long term. Sundar has already commented on both hardware and Cloud as really important examples. And we think the steps that we're taking, the investments we're making, are -- provide kind of the foundational support for ongoing long-term, sustained growth. And so then we marry that with the second part of your question, which is on how do we think about the pace of investment. As we've said repeatedly, we're very focused on investing for the long term. We're trying to make sure that we prioritize crisply across the opportunity set that we have and we make the right types of trade-offs, but we do remain focused on long-term investing given the scale of the opportunities that we see.",263

One, Sundar, could you just update us with your thinking on China, the China market and the extent -- I know Google is already in that market, but the extent to which you want to expand -- reexpand your presence there with Search? And then in terms of Waymo, just a quick question. Commercialization of Waymo, do you know when -- do you have a sense of when you'll have pricing established and you'll have a roughly well-defined and action -- acted-on go-to-market strategy with Waymo? Is that the end of this year, beginning of next year, whenever?",101

We've been investing for many years, and especially from developing Android. But more recently, we have launched mobile apps such as Google Translate and Files Go and improved our developer tools there. So we are constantly looking for ways by which we can better serve Chinese users. And that's where we are today.",67

So we do now have people paying for rides, and we're also testing pricing models. I think the main point, we've said this repeatedly, is that we are intently focused on safety first and ensuring a great user experience. And so what that means is we're really expanding the program methodically. We're taking an iterative approach as we continue to broaden the geographic footprint. And then on top of that, as we've talked about on prior calls, we've been developing the B2B opportunity. So in Phoenix, as an example, we've been piloting with several partners who are sponsoring a service on behalf of their employees and customers. And again, it's early days, so small revenues. But we're pleased to be testing this out as well and then, on top of that, continuing to explore, applying our technology for logistics and deliveries and for personal use vehicles and for last-mile solutions for cities. So you can see a move in the third quarter. But as we said repeatedly, it's very early days, and we are taking a very deliberate, iterative approach to broadening it out.",218

The first one on map monetization and putting some more ads in the map. Can you just talk about sort of early learnings there? I know you talked about local mobile searches growing quite rapidly in the past. But any early learnings from the monetization, the return that advertisers are getting on that front? And the second one on video games and Project Stream. Could you just talk a little about how you think about the gaming opportunity for Alphabet and what you think are the key factors you need to tackle to really build and scale a direct-to-consumer-facing cloud gaming product?",105
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2018",2018-10-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3511.0,1580670.0,62369225.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,21,"Look, on the ad stuff, we've had ad formats in Maps for some time, and we are constantly working to make it more useful and relevant. But I wouldn't underestimate the focus we have on local. Just to give you a sense, local mobile searches are growing faster than just mobile searches overall and have increased by almost 50% in the last year. So for us, that's an important focus area, and Maps plays a big role there. So we recently announced local campaigns, which is a new campaign type specifically designed to drive foot traffic to local businesses, right? And it's going to roll out in the coming months. And so that is a big focus. And as you pointed out, we are definitely launching and experimenting with newer ad formats on Maps itself. We have promoted places, which appears on the map itself. Have placed page ads, which appear on Google listings in Maps and Search. But we are definitely in the phase of putting those, testing it out, making sure the user experience works and making sure we can deliver value for advertisers. We are being patient here because the opportunity in local search, it's a big opportunity, and we are focused there. On your second question, look, we today serve our users on gaming across Google Alphabet in many ways, right? Obviously, Google Play does this a lot. It's a big important vertical on YouTube. And so we are -- so we touch with gaming developers across many areas already. And so we are thoughtfully thinking about what more we can do there. And Project Stream, I -- having spent my life on computing, I was blown away by seeing our ability to stream a game which needs real-time interactions, and to be able to do that from the Cloud. And it's one of the most important technological advances I've seen in a while. And so we are going to focus on that and make sure we are making progress there and bring newer experiences for gamers.",341

On Europe, I mean, it's early to say. We'll begin on implementing the remedy in the next few weeks. But in all these cases, we always -- we're focused on complying with the commission's directive, and we want to make sure that the transition for both our users and our OEM partners is as smooth as possible. In this case, you're dealing with life cycles for mobile phones. So changes is going to take some time to reach users. And it's difficult to predict how the licensing model will be adopted. But our products are very popular with users across platforms. And so it's early to say, but we are focused on doing the right thing there.",119

As we talked about last quarter, CapEx reflects our view of the growing opportunity set in our core Ads and Search businesses as well as the longer-term opportunities in newer businesses, in particular, to support Cloud and then very importantly, as we've talked about, machine learning across Alphabet. And we're particularly excited about the opportunity with machine learning because it opens up more services and products for users and for advertisers and for enterprise customers. And so given our view about the long-term potential with these opportunities, we're very focused on ensuring that we have the needed compute capacity to support growth. And that's what you're really seeing with the uptick in investment. To give you a bit of a breakdown, the largest component continues to be machines. But relative to last year, it's important to note that data center construction is an increasing percentage of our CapEx investment. And so we're now in various stages of developing more than 20 data center sites globally. We're also investing in network infrastructure, such as undersea cable, so we can deliver speed and quality. So again, this really goes to our view of the opportunity set. Having said, we do remain very focused on optimizing the use of CapEx and also on compute efficiency. We're very mindful of the fact that our decisions here on CapEx don't just result in CapEx spend, but also translate into higher depreciation expenses, and that goes both to cost of sales and OpEx. So very careful about how we're using it but want to make sure that we've built for the requirements that we have. And as much as you asked about technical infrastructure, just a quick note that our facility spend, namely real estate, was more muted this quarter, and it was primarily just the ongoing work on our ground-up development. So you're primarily seeing what's going on, on technical infrastructure here.",327

So you guys posted pretty solid growth all around. But if we look at some of the international markets, each geography had a tougher comp and decelerated a little bit on a currency-neutral basis. So I guess, stepping back high level, the growth rates are solid. But can you give us any color on the overall macro picture here? I think we're getting mixed feedback from different companies across different sectors. So any high-level comments would be helpful on just the ad market, given that you're close to 20% of global advertising ex China. And then, Sundar, a question on, I guess, Pixel and just the overall advancement you're seeing in smartphone devices. So as you guys roll out more products like Lens and Gboard and some of these other utilities on top of your 1 billion-plus apps like Search and YouTube, is there any way to parse out what the overall engagement looks like in markets like the U.S. and Western Europe when the phones are improving their functionality and you keep adding these additional utilities? Is core volume going up on a per-user basis? Any color there will be helpful.",195

As Sundar noted what's going on in APAC, 30% year-on-year growth, it's now over a $5 billion revenue business, and we've had sustained quarter after quarter growth at this kind of 30%-ish area, feel really good about that. By country, it really does reflect broad-based strength. As you said, we're very focused on the region and we're delivering terrific products and experiences in rapidly growing markets. You see the same thing in Other Americas, neutralizing for currency movements, 28% year-on-year growth. So we're really proud of what the teams are doing around the globe.",130

And so we see an opportunity. And that's one of the bigger reasons why we do hardware as well, to show that end-to-end experience, both for our ecosystem as well as for us.

One on the Pixel 3. The marketing message is clear. The product looks great. But I wonder when you look at to date, the success of ramping the product, what's been the gating factor? Has it been the carriers? Has it been the price? And when we look at the factors for why it hasn't scaled as much as the product should have scaled, what are the factors? And then on Verily, you called out some deals with kind of the big pharmaceutical companies this quarter. But again there, I wonder, who's your most natural partnership? Is it hospitals, insurance, governments? So when we think about the big opportunity, where's the most natural fit to drive Verily going forward?",129

Look, first of all, part of the big thing is this is our third generation of hardware. Each generation, first of all, we've been scaling up the product in terms of even the number of units we can make and so on. So we -- if you remember the first couple of generations, we were struggling to meet the early demand we saw. This is the first year we have done it end-to-end, and we are ramping up from there. And so each year, when I look at all the metrics, be it NPS or be it our sales, be it our revenues, et cetera, everything is progressing well. But there are -- you're right, the gating factors to ramp this up, first of all, is to be able to build the supply we need. And second is go-to-market, getting ourselves in as many locations in retail as possible, in as many countries as possible, with as many carrier certifications as possible.

Look, overall, I mean, it's now -- now we've been doing this seriously, the next level, for 3 years. And we are definitely seeing strong indicators that are -- the investment in product is clearly beginning to work. Our value proposition does come through in many competitive situations. I've seen many important wins in what seem like very, very competitive situations. I also don't -- from the way we see it, it doesn't look like a zero-sum game. As you know, we're addressing a large market opportunity here. It seems like very early days. And more importantly, the general sense I get is we are very aligned with where the market is headed in the long run. And this notion of supporting open architecture so that enterprises don't feel locked in and allowing for a multi-cloud environment to develop, that's the direction we are betting on, and there are indications that the market is headed in that direction as well. So that gives us a lot of comfort -- that leaves us -- that gives us a lot of comfort as well. And on the go-to-market side, we have really ramped up both in terms of our investments, our direct investments, but also our partnership strategy is beginning to work. And when I look at the pipeline ahead, we are clearly seeing momentum there as well. In this business, obviously, the enterprise business plays in the way in which you do you have wins, but those accounts turn into larger revenue deals over time. And so it's very clear to us that we are laying the foundation, and we are getting the strong early momentum. And that's the big reason why we are investing in a strong way in the area. And over time, we'll obviously share more here as well.",303

I think it was a negative 1% for Q3. And in Q4, do you anticipate that to be similar or a little worse?",36

As you noted, it was a point here, went from a tailwind in the second quarter to a 1 point drag here going forward. But we called out the -- and we'll have more in the Q, but noted the impact, for example, of pretty big delta between our reported and fixed in Other Americas, 19% to 28% growth, and that was really what was going on with the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso. We saw some movements in other currencies around the globe. But you can see that, which is why we broke out the geography, the way we've done it a number of quarters ago to try and give you -- help give a better sense of the types of headwinds, and I'll let you forecast the dollar.",138

Real quick just on EMEA, you were flat on your constant currency growth, 19%, 19% the last 2 quarters despite with GDPR. So I believe that would suggest that you're probably not seeing as big a headwind, perhaps, as maybe some expected. Could you just talk to the European business and what you're seeing there?",61

First of all, I mean, we've always been, as a company, very, very focused on user privacy and security. And so in some ways, we were very early on engaged on GDPR. And we worked very hard to make sure our products are ready and in compliance. We've generally always approached our products with a strong privacy lens for our users. So -- and I think that helps us work through these changes because I don't think they are at odds with what we are trying to accomplish. I think GDPR is a very good and comprehensive set of regulations. And so I think it's been good to see a smooth transition on our products and for our users.",133

People are really asking about Amazon. Just wondering if your e-commerce vertical, was there any difference versus your other verticals in the quarter? Anything to call out there? And then, secondly, Sundar, a lot of interesting things going on with YouTube and Waymo and Cloud and other areas. As you look out 2 or 3 years, do you think any of these businesses could really make a financial positive difference on the bottom line for overall Google?",82

We see it as an important use case and that's why we are investing a lot. If you look at our recent work with Shopping Actions, that's an example of the kind of work we are doing there. And when we do those things, we clearly see users respond. Like, for example, on Shopping Actions, I think we just recently had partnerships with Best Buy and Nike and Sephora, I mentioned it earlier. So we are continuing to invest there, and we are also driving strong partnerships with the retail sector, both in terms of our shopping experiences as well as through Cloud. And I think that continues to be a big opportunity. And on your broader question, look, the reason we are investing across Google and Alphabet in a set of areas is because, as a company, over the past 20 years, we have developed deep capabilities in technology, in computer science and especially with machine learning and AI. And we see an opportunity to apply that across a set of important areas. There are a lot of opportunities ahead of us. We are pretty disciplined about where we're focused on. And we are focused on real large opportunities. And when we mention areas like YouTube and Waymo and Cloud and hardware, they all fit that category. But we take a very long-term view. And we want to invest to get the user experience right. And we are pretty confident that when we do that, the value will follow.",287
