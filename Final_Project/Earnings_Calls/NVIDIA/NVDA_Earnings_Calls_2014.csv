Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Colette Kress, our CFO. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the call to a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website and is also being recorded. A replay of the conference call will be available via telephone until Feb 19, 2014, and the webcast will be available for replay until our conference call to discuss our financial results for our first quarter of fiscal 2015.

During the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our Form 10-Q for the fiscal period ended October 27, 2013, and the reports we may file from time to time on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
All our statements are made as of today, February 12, 2014, based on information available to us as of today. And except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. Unless otherwise noted, all reference to market research and market share numbers throughout the call come from Mercury Research or Jon Peddie Research.
During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our release, which is posted on our website.
So let's begin. Revenue came in well above our outlook driven by high-end PC gaming. Our GeForce business benefited from the launch of many excellent graphically intensive games including Call of Duty: Ghosts; Assassins Creed 4: Black Flag; and Batman: Arkham Origins. In Asia, Blade & Soul has proved hugely popular. It has very high system requirements relative to the vast majority of games played in China, which is a very promising development that has driven GeForce GTX sales there. 
The PC gaming market is now larger than console gaming or mobile gaming according to DFC Intelligence. The same firm estimates revenue from graphics-intensive PC games will approach $20 billion this year.
We recently added a feature called ShadowPlay to enable gamers to save and share their best moments. They've already saved over 3 million clips. If this seems like a niche application, consider that Twitch.TV, which exists to stream gameplay to a global and leverages ShadowPlay, was actually the fourth largest generator of Internet traffic in the U.S. for the week ending February 3. That puts it behind Netflix but ahead of Hulu and Amazon.
On the professional side of the business, Tesla has established its position at the center of the high-performance computing market. This quarter, we inked a Tesla partnership with IBM, possibly the biggest name in supercomputing. According to IDC, 32% of all HPC computing systems are built by IBM. Having IBM's world-spanning sales force pitching Tesla is a natural consequence of the agreement. But perhaps more interesting that IBM is looking to apply GPU acceleration across its entire portfolio of enterprise applications, potentially opening up very significant new markets for us.
The Top 10 [indiscernible] supercomputers are now powered by Tesla GPU accelerators, as is the fastest supercomputer in Europe. And only this week, ANSYS announced that its fluid dynamics application is now accelerated by Tesla. ANSYS Fluent is the world's most widely used commercial HPC application. More than 40,000 companies worldwide depend on ANSYS in industries from consumer products to civil engineering.
We launched the Tesla K40 this quarter. It has doubled the memory of past products, and we're seeing a lot of interest from consumer Internet companies as we expand our market for print into big data analytics. The topic, we'll explore further at our Investor Day next month.
Created our GPU accelerated cloud computing platform. Our invention of the virtual GPU gives OEMs a major weapon to help drive virtualization across every aspect of the enterprise, including desktop PC applications. The number of GRID trials continues to grow strongly, up 46% from last quarter. Enterprise IT purchases have a long buying process but they are long term, and we're looking forward to sharing more when the time comes.
In mobile, we launched our latest Tegra system on chip at the CES Show in January. Tegra K1 is our first mobile processor to incorporate the Kepler GPU architecture and it's the first mobile processor to deliver PC class graphics. This means we can leverage our investments and those of others in the PC and console ecosystems. For example, Epic's Unreal Engine 4 now runs on Tegra K1. PC and console game developers can now port modern triple-A titles to android platforms powered by Tegra.
And developing android as a major game platform. It's an important element of our strategy, and we're excited about Unreal Engine running on Tegra K1. So, too, is Tim Sweeney, Founder of Epic Games, and developer of the Unreal engine. He said he didn't think the industry would be at this level on Mobile for another 3 or 4 years. Tegra K1 is quite literally game changing.
During our CES event, we showed android running on a 64 bit Tegra K1. The CPU was our own custom Denver core, and this was the first time anyone had publicly shown android running on a 64-bit ARM chip. We expect devices based on the 32-bit version of Tegra K1 to ship in the first half of 2014 and 64-bit devices in the second half.
Along with PC graphic features, Tegra also brings CUDA to mobile with 192 fully programmable processor cores. So it could be used to greatly accelerate applications like image recognition or computation of photography. For tablets and phones, we can imagine the future with devices that see your face and adapts to your mood. Or open a browser in response to a gesture. 
For cars, however, the implications are quite startling. At CES, we demonstrated K1 recognizing in realtime the white lines on a road from a video feed. It simultaneously identifies other vehicles ahead and traffic signs at the side of the road. These capabilities are the fundamental building blocks of the advanced driver assistance systems that manufacturers will include in future cars.
With Audi's CES keynote, where Jen-Hsun spoke, one of their vehicles drove itself onto the stage and Audi announced that Tegra K1 will power its pilot to driving and self-parking initiatives. Strategy Analytics expects the markets for advanced driver assistance systems to be worth around $15 billion by 2016 with a CAGR of 23%. 
Audi also announced that its next-generation in-vehicle systems will be powered by Tegra. These include a revolutionary high-resolution digital cockpit with 3D graphical displays, that we'll start shipping later this year, and an automotive grade Smart display running Android for integrated passenger entertainment.
Increasingly, the driver of a car is surrounded by pixels. And the quality of those pixels communicates as much about the car as once did in-leg warmers and hand-stitched leather. Graphics matters.
Ricky Hudi, Audi's Chief Engineer, Electrics/Electronics, noted that 90% of the innovation in automobiles today involves his field of Electrics/Electronics. NVIDIA's automotive initiative is focused squarely at this car revolution.
As we start fiscal 2015, we have 64% of the PC discrete graphics market, 81% of workstation graphics units and Tesla in pilot projects at 44% of all HPC sites. These numbers are from Mercury, IDC and Intersect360, respectively. Tegra 4 has shipped in phones in China, and our modem has been certified by both AT&T and Vodafone. Our automotive business has a $2 billion pipeline, and we've laid the foundation for the next generation of in-car electronics and advanced driver assistance.
GRID, our first product targeting the enterprise desktop, is being evaluated at hundreds of sites worldwide.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jen-Hsun.",1416

Many of you know that Rob Csongor has been recently assigned by me to head up our automotive business. Rob Csongor was previously your contact along with Chris in IR. I decided to put Rob Csongor in charge of automotive because it is becoming a very large business and a very fast-growing business, and also a very important business. In fact, before I tasked Rob to head up NVIDIA's corporate marketing worldwide, Rob started the Automotive business. And now that -- and he ran it for several years, and now that it is becoming quite a sizable business with great importance to us in customers all over the world, I've asked Rob to take reins back again and run our automotive business. He will report directly to me with the new automotive group.
Chris will become the lead of IR, and many of you -- most if you, in fact, know Chris very well. In addition to his masterful ability to read -- I just love to listen to him read. He also is one of the people in the graphics industry with extremely long tenure. He knows this market like the back of his hands. He grew up with this market. And long before he was in IR, he was in product marketing. And so he knows this industry very deeply, and he knows our company very deeply.
I know that many of you have reached out to me and over the years recognized how wonderful it is to work with Chris. And I think all of you would be delighted that he's heading up our IR team now.
Okay, So with that, I'll hand it over to Colette.",298
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2014",2014-02-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3666.0,584324.0,26547805.0,Presenter Speech,Colette Kress,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Chris and Jen-Hsun. Hello, everyone. Let me provide some details on the quarter and full-year results. Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 was $1.14 billion, up 9% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. Revenue results were well above our outlook for the quarter reflecting stronger than expected growth in GeForce, GTX, desktop and notebook GPUs sales. 
The GPU business revenue was $947 million, up 8% from last quarter and 14% year-over-year. The GPU revenue increased from last quarter led by desktops and notebook GPU sales.
On a year-over-year basis, the increase reflected nearly 50% growth in GeForce, GTX, GPU sales as our products were well positioned for the overall gaming market segment demand. Also Quadro workstations grew 4% and Tesla, for high performance computing, was up more than 20% year-over-year.
Customer evaluations of our GPU accelerated card technology GRID continued to grow at a balanced pace. The Tegra processor business grew 18% from Q3 to $131 million led by increased volumes for Tegra mobile devices, primarily from Tegra 4 sales to Xiaomi for their M3 smartphones.
Tegra infotainment systems for auto increased more than 60% from the year ago quarter. Revenue for fiscal 2014 was $4.13 billion down 3.5%. Strength in our high-end GeForce GPUs, Quadro, Tesla and Tegra for automotive products was partially offset by a decline in the market for desktop PCs and notebooks, which drove a decrease in volumes of our lower-priced mainstream GPUs.
The transition from Tegra 3 generation to Tegra 4 generation of products also contributed to the decline.
For the quarter, GAAP gross margin was 54.1%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 53.8%. The gross margin percent was slightly below our outlook for the quarter as a mix of Tegra and high-margin GPU products was different reflecting the higher-than-expected revenue.
Gross margin continues to reflect the growth in volumes and stable average selling prices of higher margin GeForce, GTX GPUs and strong sales of Quadro and Tesla.
Tegra platforms have lower gross margins than most of our GPUs, so as the mix can fluctuate of gross margin quarter-to-quarter. For the full year, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin reached record highs at 54.9% and 55.1%, respectively.
GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $452 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $408 million. Operating expenses came in below our outlook and incorporated leveraged expenses and a slowdown in employee hiring for the quarter.
GAAP interest expense for the fourth quarter included an incremental $7 million related to the convertible debt offering, $2 million for the coupon interest, and $5 million for the debt discount amortization.
We expect ongoing quarterly interest expense related to the convertible debt to be about $11 million per quarter, $4 million of coupon interest and $7 million of debt discount amortization.
GAAP net income and EPS for the quarter were $147 million and $0.25 per share, reflecting sequential growth of more than 25% as revenue increased and operating expenses were contained.
Now turning to some key balance sheet items. As previously announced, we completed a convertible debt offering in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 for $1.5 billion, with the net proceeds to be used primarily for the repurchase of common stock and quarterly dividend payments. We repurchased 2.3 million shares for $37 million in the fourth quarter and a total of 62 million shares for $887 million for the full fiscal year 2014. More than 10% of our shares outstanding have been repurchased since the beginning of fiscal 2014.
Cash dividends paid during the fiscal year totaled $181 million. Total capital return to shareholders in fiscal 2014 was $1,068,000,000. Cash flow from operating activities was $401 million in the fourth quarter of the full year and was $835 million for the full year.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter amounted to $55 million. Capital expenditures were $66 million.
In fiscal 2014, we've leased and occupied an office building within the boundaries of our main Santa Clara campus and it has balanced the workspace needs for our current Santa Clara staff. Given that this additional space meets our present needs, this gives us the opportunity to refine the design for the previously announced new campus building to optimize for functionality and cost.
Now turning to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. As you will recall, we provide guidance for just the next quarter out, which we believe is helpful to articulate where our future business growth opportunities are. Following the strong revenue results in Q4, our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal '15 is expected to be $1,050,000,000, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be approximately 54.2% and 54.5%, respectively. 
GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $454 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $413 million, nearly flat with the levels of Q4 as we work to optimize and leverage the level of spend to address our growth initiatives.
GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the first quarter and annual fiscal 2015 are both expected to be 20%, plus or minus 1%. If the U.S. R&D tax credit is renewed, the tax rate is expected to be 16%.
As previously announced, our capital return strategy for fiscal year '15 includes plans to return $1 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and cash dividends. That's in the first quarter, we intend to continue the repurchase of our outstanding shares.
With that, let me turn it back to Chris.",910

There was this ongoing major console transition, not all backward compatible. Seems like some of the game titles, if you listen to GameStop, might have disappointed.",44
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2014",2014-02-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3666.0,584324.0,26547809.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,7,"Yes. I'm not sure about that, but I think the megatrend associated with gaming is relatively clear now. The PC platform is the only open platform for gaming, and GeForce is obviously very strong within it. The open platform allows you to do things to support genres that are massively online, that are free-to-play, that have micro transactions for in-game commerce. And because it's an open platform, it's supported in every country. It's supported in China. It's supported in Russia. And we know that there are people who love playing games globally. And also because of the global ability to now develop games of different genres and different cultures, we're just seeing -- we're seeing that games is a global phenomenon now. And so there's a fair number of fundamental dynamics that's driving PC gaming growth. And then the one that you mentioned recently is important as well. It's important because for the first time, for the very first time in history, the architecture of a game console is exactly the same as the architecture of a PC. Although a PC is still more advanced, it's more open, it's more flexible, the game console titles that are developed, these triple-A titles with such enormous production value, the developers can take them to the modern -- the state-of-the-art or next-generation game consoles, at the same time they take it to PCs. And it's great for them because they're only a couple or 2 million, 3 million next-generation consoles, but there's already a couple of hundred million installed base of PCs. And so they protect themselves that way. This generation of transition is really much more friendly to the game developers, and as a result, it's much better for PCs as well.",290

32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2014",2014-02-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3666.0,584324.0,26547811.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,9,"Well, the next catalyst for Tegra driver, growth driver comes from 2 places. One of them is TK1, Tegra K1. Tegra K1 is the first time that we've brought our state-of-the-art GPU architecture to Tegra. And it's such a great discontinuity with 192 fully programmable processor cores that we decided to rename it to Tegra K1 and -- to reflect the discontinuity. The other component of Tegra K1 is our 64-bit custom Denver processor. People have been really excited about this processor for some time because they know what we're building, I guess. And at this point, based on what I know about the market and what's coming, Denver is likely to be the most advanced 64-bit ARM processor in the world. And so Tegra K1 will, as Chris mentioned earlier, start to ramp in the first half, and it will ramp further in the second half. So that's one growth catalyst. The second is T4I in our modem products, devices with modem in it. And we're still on track on that. There's nothing new to report today. We had mentioned earlier that late Q1 or early Q2 is when we expect devices to be announced, and I'm looking forward to that, and it is still on track. And the third growth catalyst is our automotive business. It has grown to be quite a large business. And at a time when the car industry is really going through a renaissance, just as the phone became a smartphone, TVs are becoming smart TVs, these cars are becoming -- are getting revolutionized by computing technology. And we're seeing our applications processors being used initially in infotainment. We recently made a big breakthrough and have our processors try to digital cluster, which for the automotive industry, the cockpit, is really important grounds. And because it's so vital to the driver experience, they're very protective of it. We have demonstrated our graphics technology, and our software stack is capable of supporting such a mission-critical application. It became a second growth driver for us, and now the third, which is using supercomputing technology. And the CUDA GPGPU that we invented for autopilot and self-driving cars. And so those are the near-term growth catalysts for the Tegra business and I'm looking forward to that.",378

When you look at the Tegra integrated SoC side of things, what's -- how do you view that? I mean how important is the integrated SoC when you think about -- or I guess with regards to your vision for Tegra going forward?",48

First of all, mobile is more than phones. That's just really important to remember, and we're starting to see it now. Mobile is both a device, a short for phones. It's also a technology. People kind of gave it the name of an application processor, that's an SoC built for low-power applications and people call that mobile, mobile technology. And so mobile is more than phones. Tegra is designed for -- is designed with a mobile technology sensibility. But it has an application space that's more than phones. We've only really targeted the superphone segment since the beginning. Our core market, our core targets are tablets, gaming set-top boxes, gaming smart TVs, and automotive. Those are really our core target markets for Tegra, and we'll be able to write products for the right time for those markets, and that's really our focus. Maybe another way of saying it is what is our non-focus. And our non-focus is mainstream phones. We've always been very clear about that, and our focus is plenty of growth opportunity for us, and that's an area where we can add value and where the unique capabilities of our company, and now with Tegra K1, where we brought the world's best GPU. It's years ahead of the competition to the Tegra market, the Tegra opportunity. So we're really excited about that.",226

That makes sense. My follow-up, I wanted to talk a little bit about GRID. I think it's probably the business line of yours that's my favorite one. Can you give us a milestone that we should look forward to over the next, I don't know, couple of quarters here? Clearly, there's a lot of demand for virtualizing graphics and VDI. But if you could just kind of maybe point out a couple of things we should look for?",80
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2014",2014-02-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3666.0,584324.0,26547816.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,14,"Yes, I appreciate that, Patrick. It's one of my favorites, too. This is an invention that has taken about 7 years to do. As you know, revolutionized enterprise computing is very, very hard. The software compatibility challenges, the infrastructure compatibility challenges are truly great. And you have to be backwards compatible with since the beginning of time. And GRID has really achieved some really great milestones. And in fact, you're seeing it all the time now. Now internally, we're tracking trials. We have several hundred trials around the world. It has grown a lot and it grows every single week. You know that the number of OEMs that are following it and supporting it around the world, just is it today, VMWare and Google announced that they'll be streaming desktop applications to devices. You could see that the industry wants to virtualize everything. We've been able to virtualize storage. We've been able to virtualize networks. We've been able to virtualize servers, but we've not really been able to virtualize every aspect of desktop computing. And by being with a virtualized desktop computing, you could put applications of any kind into the cloud and make it available to anybody, anywhere. And so turning an enterprise PC, a commercial PC into a service, if you will, is quite liberating for enterprises around the world. And so I'm quite excited about this and you're seeing milestones being announced all the time. And so this is a, of course, a new area for us. It's taken us several years to get here, but this is really NVIDIA's first enterprise computing product. And it's the first product that we've ever had the benefit of the global enterprise sales force of large enterprise companies selling on our behalf. So I think this is going to be a big opportunity for us.",305

And then just one more maybe for Jen-Hsun, Jen-Hsun, looking at growth in the -- your desktop business, it looks like you guys put up the strongest year-over-year growth since fiscal 2008, and I know you've gone through some of the drivers for the gaming market overall. There had been some discussion, I think, going into the report concerning some shortages that your competitor was experiencing at the high end of the market. I wanted to know how much you think that benefited growth in fiscal Q4 or do you think it was mostly market-driven?",96

On the other hand, our growth year-over-year is greater than their market share in that segment of the market. And so we must be growing the market. Maybe that's the easiest way to think about it. And I think for all intents and purposes, the anecdotal evidence is that we are growing the market. Every market, whether it's China, the gaming market is growing and it's growing in 2 ways. More and more people are playing games. There are more games that are becoming free-to-play. And even though it's free-to-play, you still need a gaming PC to enjoy it. And also this quarter, the work that we did with the game developer, the largest game developer in the world, Tencent, to produce Blade & Soul was a huge success. We found together, in China, that there is a market for high production value games. And so high production value usually translates to requiring a great deal of technology. And so you also, of course, seen this last holiday 3 very important games that show up on the PC. Many of which are also available on game consoles because of the dynamic that I mentioned earlier. And people are now talking about a 100 brand-new games coming out to the new generation of game consoles next year. Next year, may very well be the year where we see more high production value games than any time in history for the PC. And so we're quite excited about the high-end segment.",258

Do you think the superphones will go with in-modem [ph] applications or more integrated? I know they'll be ramping up 64-bit, so I'm curious if kind of the out processor alone is good in that market. And is the 4i applicable to the other target Tegra markets that you described here beyond superphones?",63

And so integration is sometimes a good thing and integration sometimes hurts you. It's just a higher risk to integrate 4 things that are -- that needs to be state-of-the-art at the same time. And so some companies use things like Tick-Tock to articulate the benefit of strategies and methodologies to reduce your risks. Some companies like us, we call them ping-pong, and we try to reduce our risks by moving one piece at a time. So then you can innovate on a rhythmic and a continued basis even though the market is moving dramatically. And so integration sometimes helps you, sometimes it doesn't help you, and it's just hard to say. Our focus for Tegra is pretty consistent. We care very much about the superphone segment. We care even more about the tablet segment, where we can add even more value because we're a performance-oriented company. Gaming, consoles, set-top boxes and, of course, automotive where performance and functionality is so important. And so those are really our target markets. Some of them can benefit from Tegra 4i. Most of them -- you know that the large catalyst for our company going with Tegra has always been about bringing our state-of-the-art GPUs to Tegra. And finally, this season, this last quarter, we were able to announce Tegra K1, which has been a huge endeavor of ours. And now we not only brought the state of the art GPU to the mobile market, we also unified the architecture in our company. And so the effort of building Tegra is now even more leveraged than ever before. And so we used one unified architecture now, one unified software stack, everything is identical. And so it's a very powerful lever for us on to expand our GPU market.",303

Let me comment about the gross margins. As you can see, our businesses tend to differ quarter-to-quarter in terms of that mix. I think our ASPs have been extremely solid over a long period of time, and we do expect that to continue. When we think about our high-growth businesses, particularly in the professional, the enterprise and the GRID, which have very nice margins above our overall company average and just seeing how those play out as they can be influenced by very large deals. As you can see, just finishing the Q4 and our overall GeForce GTX business, and it's a tremendous success. Did have a change in terms of our overall gross margin. As I spoke, the overall Tegra business has slightly lower gross margins. So again depending on the volumes of what percentage that business is of our total will have an influence. But we're extremely pleased in terms of the progress that we made on gross margins for the full year, fiscal year '14 and where it's leading. And then heading into Q1, I think it looks very solid as well.",186

First of all, thanks a lot. The growth drivers, the next catalyst for growth for us are the 3 that I mentioned: Tegra K1 and T4i devices coming to market and other modem devices coming to market and our automotive business. Those are the 3 near-term catalysts for growth. And they really kick in starting in late Q1, mostly in Q2, and then very largely in Q3, okay? So -- but they start kicking in, in late Q1 and in Q2 and very largely in Q3. And so that's kind of the way to think about it. Overall, for our Q1 guidance, seasonality aside, we're growing Q1 year-over-year at 10%, and so we're seeing nice growth across the board for the company.",124

The second part of it is enterprise business and they -- we tend to have visibility out quite a long time. And the third part of it is really about expanding Tesla into new fields of use. One of the most important commercial large scale simulation software packages in the world is ANSYS Fluent. I don't know how many companies use it, but I surely know we use it and most manufacturing companies in the world use it. And this is a piece of software that is vital to the industrial economy. And finally, we've been able to accelerate and port Fluent on to CUDA. This is a multiyear effort to us. This was a very, very significant announcement. We're super, super excited about it, and so this opens up a new field of use. There are applications like that, that are cropping out of the wood works all over the place. And the reason for that is because I think that accelerated computing with CUDA has really reached the tipping point that it's no longer whether this computing model is viable, it's no longer whether this computing model is going to be around. Those are foregone conclusions. It is now how quickly can I port my application, so that I can accelerate it and have a competitive advantage?",233

Thanks for the question. You know that NVIDIA is a core technology company, and we invented GPU, we invented GPGPU, and now we invented for virtualization of GPUs. And our company has over 7,000 patents granted and approved, and granted and filed. And so technology licensing is an important part of our company's strategy, and it's a part of our strategy that we've implemented for some time. These discussions take a long time, and it's always unpredictable, and we're patient. This is a -- we know how important GPUs are. We know how many companies in the world now utilize GPUs, and we know how our fundamental our technology patents are. The question that you asked also includes the fact that we, in July, I think it was last year, we announced that we would also open up our GPU technology, GPU designs to be incorporated in the products of large third party vertically integrated companies. And that strategy is very important to us, and we're making our latest generation GPUs available to them, and discussions are happening and they'll take time. This is not something that happens very quickly because it includes people's methodologies and designing it into their workflow. And so -- but we add so much value here, and this is something that I think we have a real great opportunity to find new growth venues for our company.",234

Tesla and auto, both are large businesses and have large growth opportunities. And in terms of -- so that's kind of the way I would do it.

Well, you know that SHIELD was -- is our strategy, is core to our strategy to cultivate, to develop gaming on the android platform. We believe that android is going to be one of the most important computing platforms in the future, if not already now. And it's available in every country. It's available on all kinds of devices. And because it's an open platform, allows for open innovation in a lot of industries. Gaming is very important to us. Where there are high production value games, there are typically great demand for GPUs, great demand for visual computing expertise like ours. We can add a lot of value in gaming. And so the android market has a lot of phones, but it doesn't have a lot of gaming -- genuinely good gaming platforms, and that's one of the reasons why we decided to build SHIELD. The reception of SHIELD is really fantastic. People who have used it love it. I'm really delighted by the capabilities of our company to build devices. And people who have enjoyed it love to build quality. Our -- but it's -- we're modest about the revenues from it. We're modest about its distribution because it's something that we're still learning. But it's important to our strategy to gaming, and at this point, there is more and more and more evidence that gaming is going to be very important for android.

And then more importantly on the revenue side, you mentioned percentage-wise, it's going to grow. But just help us understand, when does it become a meaningful portion, and then just also in terms of size? And I'll restrict my question just to those multipart questions.",87

Probably the single largest application is enterprise virtualization. Enterprise virtualization is a major thrust and has been a major thrust in enterprise IT for the last 10 years. Not only is it great for productivity, it's great for cost effectiveness, so that you can aggregate resources in a data center. It's great for manageability. It's great for security. And so -- but there's one class of computing in all enterprises that's not been able to be virtualized, and that's your desktop PC and all of the applications that are associated with it. GRID makes it possible for us to now virtualize desktop PC applications and literally stream it to you like we stream Netflix to you. And we can stream it to you from anywhere. And the wonderful thing about GRID is that it's compatible with every and any PC application that we know off. And so that's one application. Another application is cloud gaming. We're delighted that cloud computing infrastructure's getting more capable. Broadband is getting more available. Those things are becoming more and more commoditized. And over time, it stands to reason, we should be able to enjoy even the most heavy of PC applications, which is games, on any device, and anywhere you like to enjoy it. And the third, the third has to do with GRID being used for computing and in the cloud. It could be used for image processing, as more and more videos and images are being uploaded into the cloud. Our GPUs are incredible at image processing. So when you think about these -- all of these different applications in aggregate, the GPU could be quite a successful processor for data centers and cloud. So in time, it will be quite large. But if you look at where it is today, it's probably a couple of years behind Tesla. If you think about where we are with Tesla couple of years ago, and now it's a multi hundred million dollar business, it's a couple of years behind. But at some point, both businesses have the opportunity to be very, very large. It's our data center initiatives.",364

So our cash position is about the same if you look at it as a net position after looking at the convertible that we executed in Q4. The convertible was really to take care of the ability to be able to use that cash in the U.S. So we're sitting on the cash in the U.S. with a full plan to return that to shareholders in fiscal year '15 and beyond, both through our share repurchases program, as well as also our cash dividends that we have from a quarterly basis. We don't necessarily comment on our overall cash needs. We don't really talk about our overall acquisition or if there was an acquisition at this time. So steady as we go.

But let me first comment about Q1. First of all, our GPU position is stronger than any time in our history, whether it's GeForce for gaming and all of the innovations we have there and all the groundbreaking work that we're doing there, whether its GRID, where we invented virtual GPUs and is now strike right in the middle of enterprise virtualization initiatives all over the world to Tesla, which where we invented GPGPU and using our processors for massively parallel computing. Our position and our contributions in visual computing is stronger than ever before. And now with Tegra K1, we brought that exact same state-of-the-art GPU architecture to mobile. And so our position in GPU is just stronger than ever before. We guided what we guided in Q1. We're growing relative to last year, 10%, and then we'll come back and see how it turns out. You have asked a question about acquisition. If you take a look at our company, we're comfortable acquiring. We're also extremely comfortable innovating. This is one of the most inventive companies I'm sure that you see in technology, and we invented some very important and fundamental technologies that influences industries, large and wide today. And so we think about R&D and M&A in very similar ways, except unlike many companies, we have fundamental ability to be very inventive. And that's one of the reasons why our R&D budget is a little higher. But in total aggregate, when you think about the investments that we've made in aggregate between R&D and M&A, we're right there with many companies. Our ratio for R&D internal -- internal R&D of course is higher. But that's just because we have some of the world's best in visual computing. We are the best visual computing company ever. And the people who love doing this work want to do their life's work here on this platform. So we are very flexible with that. And then lastly, I'll hand it back to Colette.",346

And so as I'm looking at it, you guided revenue down 10% to 6%. And given this is always a seasonally weak quarter for the entire industry, is it fair to say as we look at your GPU business, it's going to kind of be down not much more in the lower end of your range of 6%? But given the seasonality of Tegra and the fact that it's so tied to the mobile devices, and we're in this lull [ph] of new products going to be announced, that it's going to be greater than the 10%. Is that kind of a fair way for us to look at it? That's my first question.",124

As we look at Q1, again the changes between those businesses could definitely occur. You are correct to say that seasonally on the GPU business, it usually does come down in Q1 associated with the general desktops and/or notebooks. So that's incorporated in there. We still have some high-growth businesses. So those have been not necessarily following the seasonal trend, so we do expect that in terms of on the GPU business. And then Tegra, as we see right now, steady as we go. We're not, at this time, providing very specific guidance on each of those as we have a couple of ranges for each of those businesses, we look at our guidance.",119

During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our financial release, which is posted on our website. We reported our core financials on Tuesday, following the inadvertent distribution of information to about 100 individuals. Therefore, we felt that the most prudent course was to release our financial results earlier than planned. 
Let's begin with today's call.
Revenue was $1.1 billion, up 16% year-on-year, and significantly higher than our outlook. EPS was up 85% year-on-year, driven by the outstanding performance of PC gaming, supported by growth in Tesla, Quadro, GRID and Integra. Desktop and notebook PC gaming delivered exceptional year-over-year growth, as gamers continue to buy high-end GPUs to play the latest PC games. 
In February, we launched our first-generation Maxwell GPU, delivering the most power-efficient GPU ever. The GeForce GTX 750 series starts at $99, and targets the entry PC gamer, it's received a great reception amongst PC review sites. It's in full production and demand is strong in all regions. And at the very high-end, we announced our newest flagship GPU, the GeForce GTX Titan Z, this is the highest performance graphics card we have ever designed, Titan Z will please both PC enthusiasts and computer developers, and will be available in Q2.
Notebook gaming has grown a 51% CAGR for the past 3 years. Building on our gaming notebook momentum, we've also launched a new family of notebook gaming GPUs, including the first phase on the Maxwell architecture. The performance battery life and thin form factor of these notebooks have built a great deal of excitement in the end market. Products are shipping now and will be available from every major OEM this quarter. 
Our workstation business had another solid quarter and we now have the highest market share level since 2010. 
The big event of the quarter was our GPU Technology Conference. This year's was the most successful ever with over 3,500 guests and 550 talks. Both metrics are up over 25% on the previous year. We used it as a platform to make major announcements on our -- for our data center GPU businesses, Tesla and GRID. The press published over 1,000 articles on the event and our blog recorded over 305,000 views. 
Jen-Hsun gave a vivid demonstration of the power of GPU-based machine learning at GTC, noting that the technology is already in active use or being evaluated by many consumer Internet companies, including Netflix, Baidu and Yandex. High-performance computing has driven the first phase of Tesla growth, and we expect that growth to continue. And now, we are seeing big data analytics further drive Tesla growth. 
In related news, IBM announced that it would incorporate our NVLink interconnect technology in its future Power8 CPUs. The Power8 CPU is poised to become a mainstream CPU through the OpenPOWER Foundation. Through the foundation, IBM has opened up Power as a licensable core and is enabling other set of manufacturers to build systems around it. Google and NVIDIA are co-founding members of the OpenPOWER consortium. 
IBM hosted over 9,000 attendees at its Impact business and IT conference in April, and demonstrated GPU acceleration working in the IBM Java framework on a Hadoop-based analytics problem. 
With new app -- with new product announcements from HP, Dell, IBM and Cisco, the world's top 3 servers, according to Gartner's server report, the HP DL380p, Dell R720 and IBM x3650, are all now available with NVIDIA Enterprise GPUs. NVIDIA GRID is now available in more than 50 server platforms from 18 OEMs or ODMs. 
GRID trials continue to grow rapidly. We're now nearly 600 worldwide, up over 35% on last quarter. We've also seen a 25% increase in the number of boards sold over the previous quarter, that's 200% increase from the same quarter a year ago. Many of the trials announced turning into sizable pilots and many of those are in blue -- big blue chip and government accounts. 
Further accelerating growth is the news from GTC that VMware ESX will soon fully support virtual GPUs. Much of the prior interest have been generated on the Citrix platform, and ESX had only supported GPU pass-through, which meant 1 GPU per user. Supporting vGPU means it can now time-slice that GPU and share it between users. We're already seeing ESX sites start evaluating GRID today, in the expectation that they'll add vGPU as soon as it's available. Fully supporting both Citrix and VMware is an important step in the evolution of this business. 
Shifting away from enterprise for a moment, Tegra showed its third consecutive quarter of growth, powered by strength in automotive. Audi launched its Tegra-powered A3 in the U.S. this quarter. And we're fueling the ecosystem with Jetson TK1, a development platform in the automotive-embedded and robotics applications. And the sign of level of interest, these are selling as fast as we can make them. 
I'll close now by circling back to GTC. We've talked on subjects from astrophysics to animation, from quantum chemistry to big data analytics. GTC is a window into the company that NVIDIA is becoming. We invented the GPU for gamers, but we've evolved the GPU well beyond consumer graphics. While we remain singularly focused on visual computing, our reach today spans consumer, scientific and enterprise computing. And through innovation, we've created growth drivers in each of the PC, mobile and cloud computing platforms. 
And with that, I'd like to hand it over to Colette.",1204

Hello, everyone. Let me provide some details on the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Revenue for the first quarter was $1.1 billion, up 16% year-over-year, and down 4% from Q4. Revenue was above our outlook for the quarter, reflecting continued strength in GeForce GTX, desktop and notebook GPU sales. The GPU business grew year-over-year to $898 million, up 14%. High-end GeForce GTX GPUs for desktop and notebooks grew 57%, fueled by continued demand for gaming GPUs, and the newly released GeForce GTX 750 series, our first Maxwell-based GPUs.
Desktop GPU demand was strong in all key markets. The notebook market has contracted. However, high-end notebook GPU volume grew substantially, reflecting continued demand for mobile solutions for high-performance gaming. Quadro revenue increased from both OEM desktop and mobile workstation. GRID sales were up strongly from the prior year's initial quarter of sales. Tesla for high-performance computing was up, as large commitments comprise an increasing percentage of the business. Our footprint in the data center is increasing as Tesla and GRID generate revenue from compute acceleration opportunities, DDI deployments and streaming gaming. 
The GPU business declined 5% sequentially. GeForce GTX GPU sales for the gaming segment grew from Q4, offset by a seasonal decline in the desktop and notebook market. 
The Tegra processor business grew 35% from a year ago, led by increased volumes for mobile and auto infotainment systems. Increased Tegra mobile sales were driven by strong growth in smartphone, SOCs, and the auto business grew more than 60% from prior year. The Tegra processor segment grew 6% from Q4, reflecting its third quarter of sequential growth. 
Moving to gross margins. GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 54.8%, up from 54.1% in the previous quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 55.1%, up 50 basis points year-over-year and up 130 basis points sequentially. These margins were better than our outlook held by a richer mix of high-end desktop and notebook GPUs as a percentage of revenue. Our gross margins continue to reflect the growth in volumes and stable average selling prices of higher-margin GeForce GTX GPUs and continued focus on cost. GAAP operating expenses for Q1 were $453 million, in line with our outlook and essentially flat from last quarter's $452 million. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $411 million, about $2 million lower than our outlook. The operating expense discipline reflects continued management of our investments in both R&D and capital expenditures to enhance our return on invested capital. Operating expenses grew year-over-year due to employee additions in fiscal 2014 and employee compensation increases and related costs. Employee additions during the quarter were minimal. GAAP operating income was $151 million, up 83% from a year ago, reflecting strong revenue growth and contained operating expenses. Other income and expense included $11 million of interest expense associated with the convertible debt, $17 million from an investment gain and $6 million of income from the investment portfolio. Going forward, our quarterly other income and expense should include our interest income from the investment portfolio of approximately $5 million, plus $11 million of interest expense associated with our convertible debt. The GAAP effective tax rate was 16%, inclusive of $7 million of discrete tax items. Our effective tax rate was higher than a year ago due to the absence of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit. 
Now turning to some key balance sheet items. Early in Q1, we entered into a structured repurchase agreement for $500 million, we received an initial 21 million shares this quarter and we expect to settle the associated remaining repurchase shares in July, with the conclusion of this agreement.
Additionally, we paid $47 million in cash dividends in the first quarter. In the aggregate for the quarter, we executed a total of $547 million towards our first 2015 intended capital return of $1 billion to shareholders.
Cash flows from operating activities was $151 million. Compared to the prior year's Q1, cash flow reflected higher accounts receivable from stronger revenue and inventory for new architecture builds, offset by higher net income resulting from improved gross margin and contained operating expenses. Cash flow from operations was down from Q4 as the fourth quarter included the annual license payment from Intel.
Our DSI of 72 days compares to 77 days in the prior year, as levels reflecting ramping production of our GeForce GTX 750 series. Free cash flow was $121 million in the first quarter. Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to $55 million, capital expenditures were $29 million, lower than our outlook of $45 million.
Now turning to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Following our $1.1 billion first quarter, we expect revenue for the second quarter to be $1.1 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect seasonality in the consumer PC industry, however, we expect the strength of data center, cloud solutions and mobility to provide growth sequentially. Our strategies and transformation into visual computing systems and solutions allows us to realize the continued success in consumer PC and mobile gaming, as well as realize the growth in cloud data centers, supercomputers, professional design and automobiles.
Our GAAP gross margins are expected to be approximately 53.7%, and our non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be approximately 54%, as we expect the volume of Tegra SOCs to be a larger percentage of the total mix of units shipped than last quarter.
GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $457 million, and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $414 million, nearly flat with current expense levels for Q1. The timing of some of our key product roadmap engineering costs is expected to be larger in Q2 than Q1, driving a slight increase quarter-over-quarter. We'll continue to optimize other areas of spend to reach a first half goal of $425 million of non-GAAP operating expenses.
GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the second quarter and annual fiscal 2015 are both expected to be 20%, plus or minus 1%. This estimate excludes any discrete tax events that may occur. 
That completes our finished prepared remarks and I'm going to turn it back over to Chris and the operator so we can move to questions.",1024

One of them is consumer PCs, and then, the other is gaming. The gaming part of it is lower in volume but it's much higher in ASP and much higher in gross margin. And my expectation is that the gaming PC will continue to be vibrant. It's not directly related to seasonality. It's a market that we understand very well that we have a very strong position. And it's a platform, GeForce GTX is a platform where software intensity is quite high. The wealth of software that we bring to the platform is quite significant. And whether it's algorithms that goes into our game works or it's the console that we call GeForce Experience that allows for optimal playable settings automatically, to sharing your best moments with your friends on Twitch, capturing your favorite moments and turning into movies to share on YouTube. So that's our GeForce GTX business for gaming. There's an OEM part of it. The OEM part of it is subject to seasonality. It's subject to market share. But it's much lower in ASP as higher volumes, but substantially lower in ASP, and of course, substantially lower total gross profit contributions to the overall business. So those are the 2 major components and they just have different dynamics.",220

There's the Tesla GPU computing component and there is the GRID virtualization component. Overall, these 2 components, the data center part of our business grew substantially year-over-year and we're expecting the growth to accelerate, in fact. And the reason why it makes sense that they would accelerate is because both of these enterprise virtualization and GPU computing are addressing large market opportunities. In both of these situations, we've been cultivating the ecosystem for some time. In the case of enterprise virtualization, we now have the support of Citrix and VMware. We now address the vast majority of the world's enterprises and every enterprise wants to be virtualized from end-to-end. And GRID allows all of the enterprises to virtualize not just their data centers but all of their applications, as well as PCs. And that has been a really difficult problem, and finally, it's been solved by GRID. GPU computing, you know that our Tesla processor is a massively parallel processor, and the problem that we solved with our platform called CUDA is making it easier, far, far easier for people to take large applications and paralyze it. And we've been promoting this for quite some time, as you know, and the adoption is accelerating. And so we're seeing the number of applications that come to CUDA increasing and accelerating. And so I expect that both of these product -- these 2 platforms, Tesla and GRID, which represents our data center platforms, to continue to grow and in fact accelerate its growth.",263

We've seen 3 consecutive quarters of growth in Tegra and we're going to see quarters of growth coming. However, the reason why the growth is there has to do with the fact that we're focused on the segments where visual computing matters most. There are 3 segments that we focus on. And visual computing are large contributions to all 3 of them. One is automotive. The amount of software and the amount of visual computing contribution we make to the automotive industry is quite significant. And as we know, more and more cars want to be computerized. And more and more of the functionality inside cars want to be computerized, whether it's the infotainment system, which was the first to start, but quite frankly, it's relatively simple for us, but the digital cluster, and now, the automatic driver assistance is much greater contributions from us. And so we've got a foot in the door starting from 10 years ago, and we've been building our automotive computing platform ever since. So this is a business that is addressing a large market that is going through a transition to more computing capability. And I think that we're just -- we were first to this and so we saw it coming from a long time ago and we were prepared for it. So that's one component. The second component is gaming, that we've been investing in bringing gaming to the Android platform. Android is the world's largest operating system platform now. And we believe that, over time, it will also be one of the world's largest gaming platforms. Just as we did with the PC industry before, and bringing and cultivating the PC platform for gaming, we're doing the same for Android, and we believe that our contribution there is quite significant. It's much more than just computer graphics, it's a deep knowledge of what it takes to make great games and all of the software technology that is included in making great games. And the third, we're just narrowly focused on devices where we can make a real contribution. Devices where performance matters, differentiation matters. And we partner with people that are looking for that performance, differentiation, and cool factor. And so those 3 segments are all doing fine and it's contributing to our growth.",388

So Jen-Hsun, I'm wondering what your share now is in gaming GPU versus AMD? And just overall, are you seeing any competitive response from AMD on both the client and the workstation graphics side because they also sound very confident about gaining share. So I'm wondering what kind of response you are seeing? And then, maybe for Colette, the tax rate has consistently been below 20%, is it better to just model, say, at the current rate of 16%? Or do you think there'll be a catch-up quarter later in this fiscal year to get the full year to the 20% that you're guiding to?",113

The gaming segment is, as you know, highly complicated from a perspective of software and architecture and the work that we do with game developers. And people just know that when they buy a GeForce, it's going to work great. And all of the software contribution we put on top of it, whether it's GameWorks or GeForce Experience, is just really significant, we have 30 million subscribers to GeForce Experience and people use it so that they can have the best gaming experience. And so I think that our position in gaming is quite significant. It's a contribution of our performance of our GPUs. We have the best GPUs in the world. It's the most energy-efficient. We have the best software stack in the world, and on top of that, we have GameWorks and GeForce Experience that are deeply differentiated and available from no one in the world but us. And so, I think, our position in gaming is quite good and it's contributed to our continued growth. This isn't a one quarter thing, but you've seen it coming for several years.",200

This quarter, we were a little bit lower just based on discrete tax items that we do not forecast and are generally onetime items. Our forecast of 20% for the full year is associated with the fact that the U.S. R&D tax credit has not been renewed and that's where we're forecasting at this time. Should that change, as we communicated last quarter, that would bring our overall tax rate probably down to about 16%.",92

Thanks for the question. So as you look at what we guided and kind of adding together what we discussed in terms of the revenue guidance, as well as on the gross margin, we are expecting a larger amount of SOCs next quarter, both from a revenue side and the impact of that on the overall gross margin. We talked about the seasonal decline that we expect in the overall PC consumer market between our first quarter and the second quarter, but we do believe we will be able to offset with some of the higher data center grid and other aspects that can contribute to our overall gross margin. So we feel pretty confident about the gross margin outlook that we've provided for Q2. I tend to look at gross margin more on a yearly basis than looking at it from each single individual quarter because we will have seasonality changes in terms of what we are overall shipping, but we feel solid in terms of our focus on gross margins.",173

Most enterprises wouldn't engage in a trial unless they expect to deploy it. And so something along the lines of 6 to 9 months, 9 months for the larger ones and 6 months for the smaller ones. Some of the complexities in the past has to do with the fact that many enterprises had VMware in the data center and Citrix on the client. And we solved that problem recently. We announced with VMware, that VMware ESX was going to support GRID fully integrated. And so now going forward, hopefully, the number of circumstances where there's a hybrid model slowing down trials will disappear. I mean, at this point, we basically support the most important data center virtualization stack, as well as the most important client virtualization stack. And so, hopefully, that results in faster trials. But something along the lines of 6 to 9 months is not unexpected. The overall data center GRID data center growth is arguably accelerating. And I think, because it's such a small part of our business today, the fact that it's accelerating is not unexpected. And so if you take a look at our overall data center business, not only has it become sizable, it's growth has also accelerated. So I'm excited to see that.",234

And there are some pretty fantastic games coming out, Watch Dog is on its way out right now and it's a groundbreaking piece of entertainment and really excited about it, it's amazing how it looks. Titanfall is doing fantastic, it's already sold 1 million units in just a few weeks. And it's, of course, plays -- Titanfall plays on a game console, but we also know that there's just more people on PCs than there are on game consoles, whereas there's only a few million first -- this current-generation game console, there are tens of millions of GeForce GTXs where Titanfall can be enjoyed. And so our expectation is that Titanfall is going to continue to drive adoption, they're going to do well. And you saw some of the results from Electronic Arts, they're doing fantastic with Titanfall.

Tesla is not taking a pause. I think, I was saying that I said several times that our data center business is growing. The combination of Tesla and GRID are growing. Tesla is growing and GRID is growing. And the combination is growing. There's a couple of reasons for that. I think, high-performance computing is really growing. Big data analytics is a big deal and big data analytics running on GPUs is just fantastic. Instead of a few processors, we have thousands of processors. And big data is one of those problems that can be highly paralyzed. CUDA is perfect for it. We have multiple markets now, multiple industries where we're -- that we're exposed to, whether it's supercomputing, which tends to be large installation-driven, there are many supercomputers that are small installations, hundreds of them around the world. But supercomputing is just one segment of our business. We're large in seismic processing, we're large in medical imaging, we're large in higher ed where supercomputing is used a great deal. Internet service providers has become a quite exciting growth opportunity for us as they use our GPUs for big data analytics analyzing images or analyzing consumer preferences, helping you make choices. And so high-performance computing to us is much more than supercomputing, even though supercomputing is growing. And then, on the other hand, the same servers that we've created for Tesla are now used also for GRID. Those GPU servers that we've engineered with all the OEMs perfectly fit GRID with a completely different software stack now makes it possible for their enterprise salespeople to work with the customers on end-to-end enterprise virtualization. And so data center is a really exciting growth opportunity for us and its growth is accelerating.",293

I'm pretty excited about Tegra K1 and we don't have anything to announce today. But hopefully, as we go into the second half, we'll see some pretty exciting products coming out with Tegra K1. TK1, as you know, is the most advanced GPU that's ever been built for mobile devices, and it's taking the world's most advanced GPU, Kepler, and mobilizing it for the very first time. And so the performance is really quite spectacular, and I think your expectation would be that it would be a nice product. In terms of competition, there's lots of competition out there. But our focus with TK1 is automotive, gaming and differentiated products and customers who are looking for differentiated processors that can really bring some excitement to their devices. And my expectation is TK1 is going to do great. You also know that TK1 is the world's first high-performance 64-bit processor, and so I'd expect TK1 to be -- it's 1 chip, 2 versions, as you know, and using exactly the same footprint, it could be a 32-bit or 64-bit.

We -- I guess, maybe the way to think about it is GTX 570 (sic) [GTX 750] is the best $99 gaming processor the world has ever built. And the reviews, when it came out, and the reviews now are just fantastic. And so GTX 570 -- 750 is I think what you meant, 750 is ramping up really, really nicely. It will be the entry-level PC gaming card of choice. The margins are good. The margins for all GTX products are good. As I mentioned earlier, gaming is not only large in revenues, it's growing and the margins are good. And our position there is very, very strong.

And on a quarterly basis, our enterprise GPU business is very large now. Where Tesla starts and ends and where GRID starts and ends is increasingly blurry, and the reason for that is because it's 1 GPU with 2 different software stacks. Tesla has a software stack that's intended for GPU computing and GRID is a GPU stack that is intended for graphics and virtualization or virtualized graphics. But the processor is exactly the same. And so, increasingly, I think it will be hard to discern and that's why I kind of put them together. Most data centers that we're working with include both Tesla and GRID. And they use Tesla for their high-performance computing work where they're doing big data analytics. They'll use GRID for remote graphics, remote SaaS for example, and maybe there's a graphics application that would like to provide a SaaS or maybe there is -- they would like to deliver DaaS, which is desktop as a service, over to cloud, or they would like to provide that within the walls of their enterprise. And so all of these are contributing to our growth. I've been talking about GRID now for about a couple of years and this is an initiative we've been working on for some time. I think, in general, the way to think about it is this, and most of the topics that we've been talking about today centers around 2 different areas, maybe 3. The 2 areas first, is we invented ways for us to extend our reach of computer graphics, our reach of GPUs into mobile and cloud. And mobile is Tegra, and cloud is GRID and Tesla. And both of those initiatives are now starting to grow and grow nicely. And then, probably the third thing, the third commentary that I've made consistently throughout the day is that visual computing is just more important than ever. And so I think that our GPU business in the PC driven by PC gaming is a growth business. Our mobile business has 3 segments. We see mobile as more than phones, it is auto, it's gaming, it's devices, and that's growing, it's been growing for 3 consecutive quarters and we're expecting it to grow continually. We're also expecting it to grow in the foreseeable future. And the third is data centers and cloud. Tesla and GRID are really unique products, very, very software-intensive, addressing very large opportunities. And we're seeing the growth, vibrant and growing.",419

And then, just a follow-up. On the GPU side, I mean, you didn't explicitly break it out, but given the increasing mix, ongoing increasing mix of your higher-end products, I'm wagering ASPs continue to improve. Any feeling as to how long that you continue to see ASP strength? At some point, does that level off as the low-end product mix stabilizes?",62
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 08, 2014",2014-05-08,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3591.0,629624.0,28354644.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,56,"Well, the way to think about it is -- the way to think about that is, if you look at our ASP for GeForce, it is far, far, far lower than the price that most people pay for a game console. And yet, the PC is increasingly becoming your game console. And so if you look at where we are versus where we were, our GPU business is probably the only business that I know in semiconductors where ASPs has increased for 15 years. And I think the reason for that is because it is the defining characteristic of PC use for gaming, it is the defining component, it is the defining technology inside a PC that's used for designing content, designing your car. And it is simply the most important element inside that computer for the applications that we're talking about. And those applications turned out to have been quite large. Video games is a $100 billion industry here in a couple of years. And the production value of video games continue to increase because the competition is so intense. People can't imagine playing the same production value game 3 years in a row. Everybody is looking for more and more and more. And so not only is it a large industry, it's also computationally, technologically intensive. And so it's been driving our ASPs up and my expectation is that it will continue to do so. There's still many countries where video games is underexposed, partly because they just don't have broadband. It's surprising, but there are many, many large markets where broadband is simply not quite available yet. And without broadband, you really can't enjoy the type of video games that we're talking about. But every country will have broadband. And we're seeing fast -- much, much faster than market -- overall market growth rates in many countries, Southeast Asia, India, still very, very, very fast growth. And so my expectation is that GeForce, if we understand the business, which we think we do, is really, really aligned to the gaming market. The gaming market is about to grow to be a much larger market. And the GeForce GPU is the most important component inside the platform that's the most popular today, PCs.",375

I think we're seeing a lot of interest in putting something like Tegra in microservers. But one step at a time. I think the most important thing about microservers and putting TK1 in a server is really the software stack. And the software stack we're building for GRID can very well eventually be used on top of Tegra as well.,64

I mean, does it need to go up a little bit from here or is there opportunity for savings? How should we think of it?",81

And GRID, as you could see, is growing. Tesla, as you can see, is growing. Tegra, as you can see, is growing. We're now -- as a company that had a large footprint in PCs, we now see our footprint growing in mobile platforms, as well as cloud platforms. And very, very soon, I hope that they become a very large part of our business. And I think, maybe your commentary is -- your question is that wouldn't we love to invest more, and I think, when the time comes, we would love to invest more. And the reason for that is because the work that we're doing in visual computing, in cloud particularly, has quite a large potential. But we need to let the opportunities cultivate and I think that we're invested at the right proper level at the moment and we're staying very, very disciplined on it and as soon as we grow into more and more markets, we'll invest more.",183

I understand there's some new secular trends here at PC gaming, but there's also been a lot of talk last few quarters of some pretty significant shortages at your competitor, is this any concern of yours going forward that we get some reversion to the mean here in terms of lower growth rates or do you think that this is sustainable?",94

And so we're going to have to wait and see. But the way to think about it, Mike, is that the use of GPUs, the application of GPUs has now reached far beyond just gaming for consumer platforms. Sure, the #1 application that consumes GPU is games, it's $100 billion industry, it's larger than all of the media industries now. And the growth in China is just enormous. And so, yes, it is a very large consumer of -- but you also need to know that people are making more movies. They're doing a lot more digital photo editing and there's a lot more computational digital media than ever. And more people are using these computers also for developing parallel computing code on CUDA, and so we're seeing -- we're just seeing demand from a lot more applications than ever before. And hopefully, that's what's driving the growth.",171

But we're more and more focused, as you guys know, on segments where visual computing is more important. And automotive is obviously is very important to us that you used to have 1 application processor, and in the future, you'll have maybe 3, 5. And so the number of processors, visual computing-focused processors in a car is growing quite rapidly. We're going to focus on developing the Android gaming market. We can make a real contribution. It's very, very hard. And the work that we did over the last 15, 20 years in the PC industry, we are going to leverage a lot of that capability over to Android. The way to do that is with TK1, and so you're going to see in the second half of the year, hopefully, a lot of exciting things that we've been working on. And then, differentiated devices. And I hope that, over time, that, that becomes less of a focus for us and more of a focus on the 2 things that we've been really, really investing in, which is automotive and gaming. And of course, many of these devices want to have gaming, just like we invested in gaming for PCs, OEMs would like to use GeForce in their PCs, not because that PC is necessarily used for gaming but because it's bought by a gamer. And if your gamer knows that they want to play on GeForce and they know that GeForce helps them build the best PCs, when they buy a laptop, or one of these days, when they buy a tablet or a phone, they might enjoy having a processor built by NVIDIA, the way that it's done for our PC business.",292

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. 
With me on the call today from NVIDIA are: Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the call to a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website and is also being recorded. A replay of the conference call will be available via telephone until August 14, 2014, and the webcast will be available for replay until our conference call to discuss our financial results for our third quarter of fiscal 2015. The content of today's conference call is NVIDIA's property and cannot be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent. Beginning in September, we will start to use our company blog and Twitter to inform investors about our participation in upcoming investor and industry conferences. The next conference for NVIDIA will be the Oppenheimer Conference next week on August 12. 
During the course of the call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our Form 10-Q for the fiscal period ended April 27, 2014, and the reports we may file from time to time on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
All our statements are made as of today, August 7, 2014, based on information available to us as of today, and except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. Unless otherwise noted, all references to market research and market share numbers throughout the call come from Mercury Research or John Peddie Research. During this call, we'll discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our financial release, which is posted on our website. So let's begin. 
Revenue was $1.1 billion, up 13% year-on-year and in line with our outlook. Gross margin was a record 56.1%, and we delivered EPS up 38% year-on-year. The quarter's gross margins and overall profitability were better than we had anticipated, driven by strength in our PC gaming GPUs and in data center and cloud platforms. 
PC gaming continued to deliver year-on-year growth in an expanding industry. GeForce sits at the center of the PC gaming ecosystem, now powering close to 100 million gaming PCs around the world. Our new entry-level GeForce GTX GPU delivers the performance of the latest generation consoles, making the GeForce gaming PC the largest target for developers of latest generation games. There's no better place to look for evidence of the strength of PC gaming than eSports. Last month's DOTA 2 tournament in Seattle was televised on ESPN and carried total prize money of over $10 million, more than the British Open Golf Championship. The number of players playing League of Legends rose to about 67 million per month, and they accumulated over 1 billion hours of playtime. And there's a strong pipeline of AAA games launching on PC this fall, including new versions of Assassin's Creed, Far Cry and Call of Duty. In the workstation market, Adobe continued to push the use of GPUs, with the addition of acceleration to Adobe Illustrator CC. Illustrator have millions of users worldwide. They could get up to 10x performance boost by adding Quadro, making the experience silky smooth. Tesla had a record quarter, and demonstrated continued momentum in big data analytics and machine learning, with some high-volume purchases from consumer web companies for image and voice processing. Tesla sales for high-performance computing also grew, and several OEMs announced they will ship Tesla-based servers, combined with ARM 64 SOCs. ARM 64 server processors were initially targets at micro web servers, but GPUs expand their market opportunity by providing the muscle to tackle HPC workloads. 
Nvidia Tesla GPUs now power the world's 15 most energy efficient supercomputers, as listed in the Green 500 list. Tesla also powers the fastest computer in the U.S., the fastest in Europe and the world's fastest enterprise supercomputer. 
GRID sales continue to ramp in Q2, and also during the quarter, we launched GRID Test Drive to help enterprise IT professionals experience the benefits that GRID can bring to their virtual desktop infrastructures. The service has attracted more than 10,000 users in its first 8 weeks. Companies are realizing quantifiable benefits by adopting GRID to virtualized demand in PC and workstation applications. GRID enabled Turkish Aerospace to rapidly give -- scale its design theme. Roger Williams University is providing students across its vast campus to architecture and engineering -- sorry, providing students access across its vast campus to architecture and engineering applications 24x7. And Daewoo Shipbuilding is doubling the number of engineers who can collaborate live on their cloud-based system. 
Moving now to mobile computing. This quarter, we saw some major developments. We launched the next member of the SHIELD family, the SHIELD tablet. 
Powered by Tegra K1, the SHIELD tablet is the highest performance tablet on the market. From top to bottom, processor, tablet, software and peripherals, the SHIELD tablet is designed to be the ultimate tablet for gamers. 
To understand the market for the SHIELD tablet, consider that Newzoo, a research company, estimates there are 1.6 billion gamers in the world today. Many of them are looking to buy a tablet, an idea supported by the fact that 90% of Google Play revenue is generated by gaming. Press reaction has been great. Gizmodo described it as ""A gaming beast, but so much more."" AnandTech said that ""It's incredibly important to get the controller right for gaming devices, and Nvidia has nailed it."" SlashGear said that ""It's the new high watermark for a well-rounded tablet, full stop.""
There are 400-plus games optimized today for touch and controller on Tegra, and more and more are leveraging the power of Tegra K1. For example, the SHIELD tablet comes with Frozenbyte's Trine 2, a hit game on PlayStation 4. 
And Portal and Half-Life 2, both from Valve Software, have been optimized for Tegra K1. Half-Life 2 is the highest-rated PC game in history, having won over 50 Game of the Year awards, and multiple Game of the Decade awards. 
An interesting new development is cross-platform multiplayer. War Thunder, to be launched on SHIELD this fall, by Gaijin Entertainment, will offer massively multiplayer combat across Tegra, PC and PlayStation 4. As with GeForce on Windows, our strategy with SHIELD is to build the best game platform on Android, now one of the largest gaming platforms in the world. The SHIELD tablet is one more important element of our gaming strategy. 
Google used its annual developer conference, Google I/O, to announce the Android extension package for its next version of its operating system, Android l. it brings, in the company's words, desktop-class gaming to Android, and they leveraged Tegra K1 to demonstrate its capabilities with epic, state-of-the-art Unreal Engine 4. Tegra K1 also runs many other desktop-class engines, including Source, Unity, CryENGINE and Inter-Tech. Supporting these game engines makes it much easier for developers to bring games to Android on Tegra K1. Android TV was also launched at I/O, and Google gave every attendee a development platform based on Tegra. 
Finally, Google used I/O to launch Android Auto, and demonstrated it with the Tegra-powered infotainment system in an Audi S3. Our automotive business grew more than 70% year-on-year. Volkswagen announced that the upcoming Passat will use Tegra to power its infotainment system, following on from the Golf, which is already shipping with Tegra. The new TT, which features 2 Tegra chips, has started production in Europe, and Audi has upgraded the A7's infotainment system to include Tegra, evidence of the fastest cycles possible with the use of our visual computing module. Separately, BMW has started shipping the i3 and announced its i8, both powered by Tegra. Xiaomi's MiPad with the Tegra K1 started shipping in Q2, with the first 50,000 units selling out in 4 minutes. We expect the first Tegra K1 Chromebooks to start shipping this quarter, and IDC expects the Chromebook market to triple over the next 3 years. 
In conclusion, our investments in differentiated platforms are delivering success in gaming, HBC, professional, visualization and design and in automotive markets. We've leveraged our visual computing IP to set the stage for accelerated growth. And with that, I'll hand over to Colette.",1447
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2014",2014-08-07,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3750.0,680815.0,30214705.0,Presenter Speech,Colette Kress,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Chris. Hello, everyone. Let me provide some details on the second quarter of fiscal 2015. 
Revenue of $1.1 billion grew 13% year-over-year. The growth was driven by Tegra processor sales, GeForce GPUs for gaming, Tesla and GRID for data center and cloud workload. Revenue from GeForce GPUs for gaming desktops and notebooks grew 10%, built by continued strength in the gaming market. Including the recent release, GeForce GTX 750 and GTX 750ti Maxwell-based GPUs. Tesla and GRID for data center and high-performance computing increased significantly from DDI deployments and large project wins with cloud service providers, as well as high-end education and government customers. Quadro revenue increased with particularly strong growth in mobile workstation. Tegra processor sales grew 200% from a year ago, led by mobile devices and automobile infotainment systems. Revenue from Tegra processors for automobiles grew 74% year-over-year. 
All key platforms for growth, gaming, data center and cloud, and mobile showed strong growth this quarter. Our transformation into visual computing systems and solutions allows us to realize the continued success in consumer PC and mobile gaming, as well as realize the growth in cloud data centers, supercomputers, professional design and automobiles. GPU business declined 2% sequentially, as we executed well during the seasonal decline of consumer desktop GPUs. We believe we outperformed the market for consumer PCs, led by our overall performance and ecosystem, supporting PC gaming. 
Quadro, Tesla and GRID all grew sequentially as well. 
Moving to gross margins. GAAP gross margin was 56.1%, up 130 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP gross margin was 56.4%, up 130 basis points sequentially. These margins were both a record and better than on our outlook. The increases reflected continued strength in our GPU margins for PC platforms, data center and cloud and partially offset by the increased volume in Tegra processors. Compared to our outlook, the higher gross margin levels were driven by strong absolute average selling prices for consumer GPUs, and aided by our record quarter for Tesla and data center solutions. GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter were $456 million, in line with our outlook and essentially flat from the prior quarter's $453 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $411 million, flat from the prior quarter. 
With continued management of our investments, through alignment to a single unified architecture, we produced a third consecutive quarter of flat operating expenses. 
Operating expenses grew slightly year-over-year due to employee additions, employee compensation increases and related costs, partially offset by lower engineering development cost. GAAP operating income was $163 million, up 55% from the prior year's second quarter, reflecting strong revenue growth from higher margin GPUs and contained operating expenses. GAAP net income was $128 million, up 33% from a year earlier, driven by increased operating profit from strong revenue and margins. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.22 increased 38% from $0.16 per diluted share in the year ago quarter, reflecting net income growth and share repurchases. 
Now turning to some key balance sheet items. During the second quarter, we paid $47 million in cash dividends and received 6.8 million shares under the 500 million structured repurchase agreement we entered into the first quarter. During the first quarter, we had paid $47 million in cash dividends and received 20.6 million shares under the agreement. As a result, during the first half, we have returned $594 million of the $1 billion we intend to return to shareholders in fiscal 2015. 
Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were $470 million, up $74 million from the prior quarter. The increase was primarily due to less linear second quarter shipments, compared to the first quarter. DSO at the quarter end was 39 days, up from 33 days in the prior quarter and flat from the second quarter of fiscal 2014. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $387 million, down $6 million from the prior quarter. The sequential decrease includes the ramping of Tegra processor products and products based on new GPU architectures, which were more than offset by decreases in products based on our previous generation architectures. 
DSI at the quarter end was 73 days, up from 72 days in the prior quarter. Cash flow from operating activities was $96 million, down from $151 million in the prior quarter, and flat from $96 million a year earlier. The sequential decrease was primarily due to higher levels of accounts receivable and lower payables than the prior quarter. Compared to the year ago quarter, the operating cash flow reflected higher net income from improved gross profit and contained operating expenses, offset by lower payables outstanding. 
Free cash flow was $74 million in the second quarter. Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to $56 million. Capital expenditures were $23 million, lower than our outlook of $40 million. 
Now turning to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Following our $1.1 billion in second quarter, we expect revenue for the third quarter to be $1.2 billion, plus or minus 2%. The sequential revenue growth of 9% is reflective of our continued strength in gaming for PC and mobile platforms, data center and cloud solutions and automobiles. We expect our consumer GPU business to be up seasonally in the third quarter. Our Tegra business is also expected to grow sequentially. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 55.2% and 55.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. The gross margin outlook reflects higher expected Tegra processor revenue, which has overall margins -- overall lower margins than our company total, a greater mix of devices versus SOCs with Tegra compared to the second quarter, and expected growth in volumes of consumer GPUs. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $463 million, and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $416 million, nearly flat with expense levels for Q2. 
Our operating expenses in the third quarter will reflect an onset of our annual compensation increases and expenses associated with our higher revenue. We will continue to manage through our fourth consecutive quarter of maintaining operating expense levels. 
GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the third quarter and annual 2015 are both expected to be 19%, plus or minus 1%. This estimate is a percentage point lower than our previous outlook. It is consistent with our tax rate in the second quarter, excluding any discrete tax events. With that, I'm going to turn it back to Chris, and we'll open up for questions.",1071

In terms of where we think the growth will stem from, from a revenue perspective, again, it is usually a seasonally uptick in terms of our overall consumer GPUs that are, therefore, for gaming, as we get ready for the second half of the year on the high-gaming season. So that we do expect to be a significant contributor to our overall revenue growth sequentially at 9%. Additionally, we also expect our overall Tegra business to also grow sequentially, associated with both our SOC's, particularly for auto will increase, and also what we expect for our devices as well.",100

So it's really a nature of the overall mix, overall longer-term period of time, which will influence our growth margins long term. When you think about our overall enterprise businesses, from Tesla, GRID and overall Quadro, which carries slightly higher gross margins than our overall company average, and depending on the seasonality of some of those businesses, as well as large projects that we may complete, you will see our gross margins be very strong. Our overall consumer GPUs, we've done a very solid job in keeping our overall gross margins with solid ASPs, and that should contribute as well in the quarters, which we have strong growth. Then thirdly, when you think about our overall Tegra business, it is a case in terms of volumes, and we do know that these are lower overall gross margins than our company average. So depending on when those volumes hit, it can also affect the overall company's gross margin. But at this time, it is hard to say in precise, every single quarter in terms of what we think that guidance will be, but those are generally the factors that will influence our gross margin ranges going forward.",235

I'm curious, how much of that growth is coming from unit growth versus just stronger ASPs or share gains from AMD?",32
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2014",2014-08-07,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3750.0,680815.0,30214716.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,13,"This is Jen-Hsun. If you take a look at the overall gaming market, it is surely growing. Depending on which one of the analysts you follow, the vast majority of them see that global gaming market is growing about 10%, a little bit over 10%. If you take a look of the largest gaming franchise today, they're mostly associated with massively online, battle arena games, called MOBA games, whether it's League of Legends or DOTA 2. The two combined has nearly 100 million gamers and -- each day, each day, there are some 10 million gamers playing these 2 games. 
The size of the eSports, competitive sports associated with these 2 games is becoming quite a large industry in itself. China's still growing. Southeast Asia is extremely underexposed, and those markets are growing, and so I think that it's fair to say that the gaming market overall is still growing. ASP is increasing, and the reason why ASP is increasing is because the production value of games are increasing. The latest-generation game consoles are now out. The entry-level, GTX, GeForce GTX, with a street price of about $100. It's consistent and is comparable in performance to a next-generation game console. And so, if the market shifts to even that level, our ASP has quite a lot of room to still grow. And so as the production value of games continue to grow, I think we're going to see our ASPs grow. And so I would say that the dynamics of the gaming industry, PC gaming industry, is really quite healthy, both in -- more and more players playing, and ASPs increasing because of production value. Now when you think about it, in terms of our own platform, there's almost -- I would say, there's about 100 million GeForce gamers around the world, they're active gamers around the world. And yet we know there are several hundred million gamers all together, and PC gaming is becoming more and more popular for the reasons that I've mentioned already and others. My sense is that we still have quite a bit of penetration to go. And so these are the dynamics that are helping us.",363

And then as my follow-up, there has been a lot of discussion or concern about the royalty payments from Intel, since they are very important part of your EPS and domestic cash, and I do realize the agreement runs for a few years. But when do you need to start to renegotiate? And do you think the new agreement would be flat, up or down, from what you have right now?",73

NVIDIA invents more in modern computer graphics than just about all of the  world's companies combined. We invented the GPU. We invented GPGPU. We invented the ability for GPUs to be virtualized, so that you can put it in the cloud. And that's one of the reasons why our cloud computing business has grown so fast now. And we're continuing to focus in this one specialized field of computing that's becoming more and more important. I don't know of too many technology companies in the world today who doesn't rely on technologies that we've invented. Technology licensing is an important part of our business. Long before there was Intel licensing our technology, there were other companies licensing our technology. We've had licensing revenues as a component of our business now for 15-plus years. And so my expectation is that licensing revenues will continue to be an important part of our income for quite some time to come. Now there's a second component that's really important, which is -- whereas, we historically, we're able to license to mostly PC companies, we can now license to mobile and cloud companies. And so those are new opportunities for us. And then lastly, we no longer just license IP as in patents, we've productized our design into a core, and that core could be licensed. So that makes it easier for companies who would like to innovate and build their own products, to be able to license our technology. We have now more ways to engage customers in IT licensing. We're serious about this business. We're actively working on these matters. They take time, but I am very confident that licensing will continue to be an important part of our business going forward.",304

Your GPU business in particular that grew double-digits year-over-year in Q1. It took a bit of a pause in Q2, I'm assuming just weaker consumer PCs. Question is, are you looking for the GPU business to return to double-digits year-over-year growth in Q3? And if you are, if you could just highlight some of the drivers?",68

And considering the performance that we had, it was actually quite extraordinary. And our expectation is that Q3 will continue -- will return to its traditional seasonal growth era. There's a couple of other dynamics that's going on now. There's some really big titles coming this fall. I don't remember a time when PC gaming is going to benefit from the huge titles that are coming out this fall at the pace that it is. And partly the reason for that is because, this is the first year, the first major year, first full year of next-generation game consoles. And so these new large franchise titles, like Call of Duty and Assassin's Creed, are going to hit the market. And ultimately, what drives our business, some seasonality, of course, Christmas matters, of course, back to school matters, of course, Chinese New Year matters, but ultimately, what really drives our business are huge games. And this fall, we're going to see some really, really huge titles. Our position in the marketplace is fantastic. GeForce is really the best gaming platform for PCs today. It's not even close anymore. I think that because of technology, we know that Kepler has been a fantastic platform for us. Maxwell is even better than that. But all of the software and all the application technology that we put around GeForce has really changed its profile for gamers. Now not only can you play great games now, you could use our GeForce experience, which has been installed some 40 million times. There are 40 million PCs around the world that now has GeForce experience inside. So that you could record completely in the background, without affecting your gameplay, and stream it to Twitch, which as, you probably know very well at this point, is the largest real-time video platform in the world. And a lot of those gamers are streaming using GeForce and the number of concurrent viewers is really quite amazing. And so GeForce, as a gaming platform, has really reached a level that is pretty substantial. My expectation is at this holiday season, this fall is going to be pretty big.",371

And to look farther, there's continued day-to-day conversations about where those growth opportunities are in the top line, and are we the best positioned at this time with the investments for those. So right now, I just like to get through the rest of the fiscal year, and I think we'll reassess what does that look like, going forward.

You're going to have to ask them for commentary about their channel inventory. In our case, we've been seeing spot shortages around the world. We're really, really super focused on making sure that GeForce is the world's best gaming platform for PCs. It doesn't mean that -- it doesn't mean alone that it has to be -- just being the world's best GPU is not enough, we're surely the best GPU, but being the GPU is just the first bar, if you will, for being a great gaming platform. And for us today, GeForce, all of the technology that we put into game works, all the work that we do with game developers around the world, GeForce Experience, which as I mentioned earlier, has been installed some 40 million times, has really turned GeForce into one of the largest gaming platforms in the world. And if you're a gamer, and you have GeForce in your system, you can be assured you're going to have a great experience. We're incredibly dedicated to the user experience. We're incredibly dedicated to making sure that every single game works perfectly and works marvelously as it can be in your PC. The amount of dedication that we put into this platform, this living, breathing platform that's evolving and changing literally every day is something that we've really mastered and is something that has taken us well over a decade to do. And I think people are starting to recognize that. And as the PC market continues to become the most important gaming platform, because of its open nature. You don't pay royalties to proprietary platforms. The installed base is really quite large now, as you could imagine. And for most people outside of the United States, where disposable income is still rather challenging, a PC is necessary for most of them. Everything else is a luxury. And so the fact that GeForce has extended inside a PC, in a platform that you already know you need, this makes it quite a unique gaming platform. And so I think our comments that we've made over the years, and as you've followed us over the years, we've been consistently dedicated to this game platform, and I think it's starting to pay off now.",377

So it's real hard for us to land that mix perfectly over that. We believe what we've seen right now is extremely stable, if not from year-over-year, overall increases in our overall average ASPs over that period of time.

Just to add to that. One of the things that surely everyone is noticing now is that our business is really moving away from being a components business, to being much more of a platform business that's obviously built on top of a processor. Our ASPs for data centers and for the cloud computing platforms are much, much higher than our ASPs for PCs. Not only because the processors themselves are much more complex, because it has to be shared by many people. It's virtualized. It's designed for data center. This has a robustness for it. The reliability of it, the quality of it, has to be at a level that is able to sustain 24/7 operations. So mostly the reason is because the software stack on top of it is really complex. Most of our data center business, most of our cloud computing business, is really a software business anymore. It's really about GPU virtualization. It's really about high-performance computing. It's really about the ability to serve accelerated cloud computing. And so our ASP profile is going to have to start changing over time. Tracking PC sales and then multiplying that by some ASP, is not a logical way to think about our business anymore, because of cloud computing platforms, because increasingly our business is really a platform business. I hope that's helpful.",229

Pretty interested, it seemed like there was some developments relatively recently around your partnerships with other ARM 64-bit vendors, maybe versus your own internally developed solution. Maybe if you could give us an update about what the strategy is going forward for attacking that market? And is that, I guess, the general purpose compute engine that sits next to your GPU in those applications of paramount importance to you? Or is your GPU where you really drive the value?",116

First of all, I think I've said this before, and I continue to believe it, and more so every day that data center and cloud -- accelerated cloud computing, will likely be the largest opportunity that the company is following today. Our ASPs there are many, many, many times higher than our ASPs in average. The gross margins are obviously a lot higher, primarily because it's a software business. Now the center of that platform strategy is recognizing that data centers, Internet service providers, cloud service providers, even countries who have their own supercomputing interests, have rather different opinions about what kind of CPUs they use. They don't all want exactly the same disruption set or architecture. What we've done with Tesla is, and what we've done with our GPUs, GRID and Tesla, is established a bit of an iso-neutral attitude about what data centers can and cannot use. And we believe the people ought to use whatever instructions and architecture they would like to use, and we've created the ability to support x86. We support Power with our announcements with IBM, a very deep and quite a broad strategic alliance of bringing accelerated computing to the Power platform. And also, ARM. Of course, we care about ARM. ARM is one of the most pervasive CPU ISOs in the world. It is very accessible. It's available to anybody who would like to build CPUs around them. And so, we're -- our first philosophy is focused on building a platform for accelerated cloud computing, accelerated computing. Our second is to be ISO-neutral, so that Tesla could be a platform that any service provider or any data center can build around. And then third, if it makes sense for us to build CPUs for those platforms ourselves, we'll consider doing so. But it kind of goes in that particular order, if that's helpful.",312

And then, as my follow-up, for Colette, there's been some -- a lot of conversation on the call here about the progress on capital returns. You give us -- one question is that an update on the domestic cash balance. And then, I guess, going forward after the $1 billion is completed through the year, maybe you could give an update on your longer-term philosophy about capital returns, relative to that domestic cash position?",79
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2014",2014-08-07,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3750.0,680815.0,30214739.0,Answer,Colette Kress,,Executives,36,"So we've been pretty clear that when you look at our overall cash balance and our overall cash flow, a good percentage of our cash flow extends from our international operations, and the overall revenue that we receive from a good percentage of our business. From time to time, we'll have a little bit of peak in the U.S. in terms of some of the providers that we do business with in the U.S. But I'd say more than the majority or a significant amount of the earnings are earned overseas. So our overall cash balance, about a -- November a year ago, we infused with the overall convertible debt, which added $1.5 billion. So right now outside of the Intel payments as well that come once a year, it's pretty steady if -- and it may grow a little bit from time to time, but I'd say it's just right now at about a steady level. Secondly, when talking about our overall capital return from a long-term perspective, we are really trying to look at our overall growth this year. We've executed strongly to the 1 point billion that we put out for the fiscal year, and we're not -- we're just about halfway through that right now. And so we'll continue to look what is the appropriate levels for a long term. As you know, we're executing to return more than 100% of our free cash flow that you've seen in this quarter and the last quarter. So -- but over the last 3 years, we've probably been executing on average anywhere from about 70% to 80% of our free cash flow. So stay tuned.

So year-over-year, GPU sales grew 2%, but ASPs also rose a fair amount, didn't they? So did your unit shipments for GPUs overall actually decline on a year-over-year basis in June?",54
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2014",2014-08-07,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3750.0,680815.0,30214742.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,39,"I would think so. I would think that it declined a little and the reason, of course, had to do with the fact that the consumer PC market overall declined. You know very well that our consumer PC business is a components business. And those components -- ASPs are rather low, and the margins are lower. And although we care about that business very much, components business and volume business does provide scale, and it leverages our R&D anyhow. And so we surely appreciate the business. But in the final analysis, the consumer PC market was down, and I think that the consumer PC market is expected to be more stable now, and we'll see how it turns out.",119

And my other question, what portion of total Tegra sales is Tegra for automotive at the moment? And did your current level of R&D spending have meaningful spending on Tegra for smartphones and tablets? Or is it -- is your Tegra R&D primarily on automotive products?",48

One is automotive, as you've mentioned. This is a business that has grown to be quite sizable. I think Colette mentioned earlier that has -- it grew 70% year-over-year. We're expecting the growth to continue for the next several years. The pipeline of projects that we know that we're already working on that will go into production is relatively well understood now. The second is gaming. Android is the world's largest computing platform. And gaming we've shortened to computer gaming. And with a great computering platform like Windows, we were able to build a new franchise called GeForce on top of it. Our strategy with SHIELD is exactly the same as that. The leverage, the Android platform, which is now the world's largest computing platform, and build a gaming platform out of it, and we call that SHIELD. The mobile platform is now extended beyond phones, and has gone into tablets as you know, of course, but recently also into television. This fall, I'm looking forward to see some exciting products for Android TVs and hopefully NVIDIA could be part of some of those. Our focus is primarily there, the vast majority of our focus, automotive, consoles, if you will, Android TV consoles, gaming and wherever we can, wherever it makes sense for us, continue to engage with OEMs like Xiaomi and others, who are building exciting devices, where Tegra could be a differentiator for them. And that's basically our strategy and where we're focusing our R&D.",256

I was just kidding. Hey, look, consumer business is still a large part of our business, and GeForce is -- for PC gaming, is a large part of our business, and for the foreseeable future, I expect it to be a large part of our business. The consumer business is important to us, because consumers drives a lot of computing technology today. And obviously the volumes are much, much higher, and it's important to have high-volume business to drive the flywheel of R&D. And so I appreciate the seasonality. GeForce is going to benefit from that in the third and fourth quarter, but increasingly over time, and one of the things you're highlighting here is that our data center business, our cloud computing business, our high-performance computing business are not affected by those kind of seasonality. People buy those platforms when they need those platforms. And the dynamic trends of those businesses are several. One, the more mobile devices in the world, the more pictures people take, the more videos they upload, the more they talk into their phones for search, more and more of those applications -- those consumer applications are going to be accelerated by GPU in the cloud. So those are great opportunities for us. And I think it's pretty clear now the dynamic trends of consumer-generated media as it's sent through the cloud, shared and processed and otherwise is growing I guess, at least exponentially. And I think that, that's one of the major dynamics driving our GPU success in the cloud. And then the second has to do with the fact that more and more of companies are using high-performance computing to drive their business. Some companies call it Big Data analytics, some you hear them refer to machine learning to understand what is happening to the dynamics of their business. High-performance computing is more and more important in enterprise than ever. Those two dynamic trends, and then maybe, if I could just add the last one is enterprise virtualization. Our GPUs on GRID makes it possible for you to virtualize your enterprise beyond the walls of the data center and all the way out to the fringe where the clients are. You could virtualize very, very compute-intensive PC applications for the very first time. And so these three dynamics are really important to the future of our data center and cloud business. And as those continue to grow, our business will become increasingly less seasonal, if you will.",418

And this is my follow-up, to your point about the enterprise and the virtualization that you're seeing there. Your design engagements with GRID are accelerating pretty rapidly, and that appears to continue as enterprises begin to realize the leverage that they can get from cloud-based visual computing. You talked in the past about the installed base being around over 500 million units. Can you talk a little bit about how systematically you're going to be able to kind of convert that installed base to a virtualized platform?",90

The most important partners, number one, starts with the hypervisor companies. The companies that built the core of virtualization. Of course, VMware is a very important part of that. Microsoft is. Citrix is. [indiscernible] -- I think it was at GTC, I guess it's in May, VMware was on stage with me to announce that they were adopting GRID, integrating GRID into ESX, and enabling virtual GPUs for their hypervisor stack. I'm anxiously waiting for them to go to beta, and so let's watch this space. I think the -- [indiscernible] probably the single greatest near-term turbocharger to the GRID business. Beyond that, the ecosystem partners that we'll go to market with are all the OEMs. They're the -- they have the largest sales forces in the world, and they're engaging enterprises from financial services, to government, to education, to industry, and those sales forces are being trained on a constant basis, and enabling OEMs to be able to take GRID to market is a very big part of the overall strategy. We now have every single OEM in the world supporting us. There are some 70, 80 servers that have been certified and qualified for GRID. OEMs from HP and Dell and IBM and Cisco and Hitachi and Fujitsu and just every OEM in every corner of the world has been enthusiastic supporters of GRID, and partnering with VMware and partnering with Citrix and partnering with Microsoft over time, that's how we're going to convert and virtualize all of the enterprises around the world.",258

That's great to hear. If I could, one of the areas that I believe one of your competitors hit a speed bump on was the fact that GPUs were being used for cryptocurrency algorithms. Is this a market that you view as something that NVIDIA should be servicing? Are you targeting your products at it? And is it something that we should bake into our thinking?",67
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2014",2014-08-07,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3750.0,680815.0,30214758.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,55,"Yes, there are several things about that event that's really interesting. First, the fact that you could run an arbitrary and newly developed cryptocurrency algorithm on a GPU says something about the programmability of a GPU now. That's one of the things that, of course, cryptology -- cryptography is very important, of course, encryption and decryption for security long-term will be very important. GPUs will increasingly become important in the development of those algorithms. However, we really didn't benefit very much from people who are doing, I guess, bitcoin mining. And the reason for that is because on a -- if it's just one application, if it's somebody is using that one application, they don't really care about that gaming experience, they didn't buy the platform for gaming, they didn't buy the platform for workstations or design. I would say that NVIDIA GPUs are not the most performance-per-dollar efficient in the market. As a component,  if you will, as a commodity component, we're not the most competitive in that way. And maybe that was a blessing, maybe it wasn't, but I think in the final analysis, I don't think we were particularly the best choice for somebody who would like to bitcoin mine. When they were done, they resold the graphics cards in the marketplace, and I guess in a lot of ways I'm kind of happy that, that didn't happen to us.",233

Is there some sort of a catalyst that makes you, or some level at which you feel you really do need to bring on a second supplier of wafers?",87

So we competitively look at every single opportunity, every single time. We've been fortunate to have partnered with TSMC for very long time. They are a fantastic, fantastic partner.

With that, let's start. Third quarter results were strong with record revenue and improved performance in each of our businesses. Our focus on creating platforms for PC, mobile and data center is paying off. Our PC gaming platform benefited from the enthusiastic reception of our new flagship GeForce GTX gaming processors based on Maxwell.
Our 10th generation GPU architecture, Maxwell, sets new standards for performance and power efficiency, introducing a range of new features for gamers and game developers. Real-time, dynamic, global illumination is a leap forward in replicating the true interaction of light in the gaming environment. Other new technologies render games at higher frequency [ph] with very low power, heat and noise. Both the desktop versions of these processors, the GTX 980 and the GTX 970 and their notebook counterparts have won extraordinary support from reviewers.
Forbes wrote of our new GPUs, ""They are higher performing and more power efficient than the previous generation in design wins abound. That's pretty much a trifecta in the mobile market."" Commenting on the desktop versions, HardwareCanucks, called the GTX 980, ""a market-changing graphics card that is backstopped by an impressive GPU architecture."" We launched Maxwell in a groundbreaking event for the gaming community, called GAME24. This livestream, 24-hour celebration included gaming tournaments, online competitions and celebrity commentators. As it moved across the globe, along the way, we drew more than 1.3 million Twitch viewers in 120 countries.
In the mobile platform space, the SHIELD tablet, the latest extension of our SHIELD family of devices, enjoyed solid demand during the quarter, the ultimate tablet made for gamers. It features the extreme performance of our Tegra K1 mobile processor and the precision control of the SHIELD wireless controller.
SHIELD tablet sales have extended into many worldwide markets. And the 32-gigabyte LTE model has been recently added to the lineup. Very soon, SHIELD tablet will be upgraded to Google's latest OS, Android 5.0 Lollipop. Tegra K1 was also featured in the Google Nexus 9 tablet launched last month in a 64-bit version. Powered by our project, Denver CPU, Tegra K1 is the first ARM processor for Android to take advantage of the Android 5.0 support for 64-bit architectures. Tegra K1 is also now in Chromebooks from Acer and HP.
Tegra technology continues to make strong headway in the Automotive segment as well. Last month's Paris Auto Show, Honda announced that 3 of its popular models will come standard in the European market with a Tegra-based infotainment and navigation system. This marks the first in-vehicle infotainment system to use the Android operating system running on Tegra.
Tegra will enable Honda Connect to deliver a touchscreen experience like the intuitive experience you'd expect from a phone or tablet, with crisp graphics that respond instantly to gestures like pinch, zoom and swipe, but is designed for safe operation in a car. Honda now joins Volkswagen in our stable of mainstream auto brands relying on Tegra, complimenting luxury brands like Audi, BMW, Lamborghini and Tesla Motors.
Our enterprise businesses also had a strong quarter, benefiting from new products and industry trends that fuel demand for them. Our Quadro professional graphics solutions, including processors based on the new Maxwell GPU architecture, are enjoying the fast ramp-up of any Quadro product in our history. They are being shipped by all of our major OEMs and adopted by global enterprise companies. This new lineup provides up to 2x improvement in application performance and data handling capability.
In the data center platform space, NVIDIA GRID graphics virtualization continues to gain momentum. Thousands of companies have come forward worldwide to experience cloud-based GPU-accelerated virtual desktops through our tri-GRID online demonstration. Also, a program we launched in August with VMWare for early customer access to GRID virtualized GPUs is drawing wide global interest. Initial customers include: aircraft maker, Airbus; the international construction group, CH2M HILL; and healthcare provider, MetroHealth. Other early notable GRID customers include Villanova University and Halliburton.
Our Tesla-accelerated data center platform continues to grow as HPC customers and cloud service providers deploy large Tesla-powered systems.
Fueling Tesla growth is the rapid rise of machine learning, particularly among mobile web service companies, like China Baidu, that are standardizing on Tesla as their common platform. As noted in the story in the current issue of Wired, GPUs are exceptionally well-suited for parallel processing tasks like speech recognition, image and natural language processing.
IBM unveiled its first OpenPOWER base system featuring Tesla GPU accelerators, which can significantly enhance Java, big data and technical computing applications. IBM announced plans to accelerate their enterprise applications using Tesla GPUs, including their nearly pervasive IBM DB2 with BLU database software.
We are excited about this month's Supercomputing 2014 Conference in New Orleans, where we will be demonstrating the latest breakthrough in supercomputing and visualization based on our Tesla Accelerated Computing platform.
Now let's take a more detailed look at the financials. Revenue growth year-over-year was driven by strength of GeForce GPUs for gaming related to our launch in Q3 of Maxwell GTX GPUs as well as the strength in data center GPUs in auto infotainment systems. GPU business revenue grew 13% from a year earlier. Revenue from GeForce GPUs for gaming desktops and notebooks grew 36%, fueled by continued strength in PC gaming, including Maxwell.
Within this segment, gaming notebooks performed particularly well, more than doubling from a year-ago levels. Tesla for high-performance computing increased strongly, representing another record quarter of revenue driven by large project wins with cloud service providers and government customers.
Quadro revenue remains strong, with our new product platform launched in August, delivering industry-leading graphics and rendering performance.
Tegra processor sales grew 51% from a year ago, led by auto infotainment systems, mobile devices, embedded systems and the onset of the SHIELD tablet sales. Auto infotainment systems revenue nearly doubled year-over-year. Revenue was up 11% from the second quarter of fiscal 2015.
Moving to gross margins. GAAP gross margins was 55.2%, in line with our outlook for the quarter, down 90 basis points from last quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 55.5%, also in line with our outlook and down 90 basis points sequentially. The gross margin reflected continued strength in our GPU margins for PC platforms, inclusive of the product transition to Maxwell-based GPUs for the desktop, notebook and workstation.
Our margins from the above-mentioned PC platforms and data center and cloud GPUs were partially offset by the impact of Tegra processor margins, which are lower than the company's overall average.
GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter were $463 million, in line with our outlook, and up 2% from Q2. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $415 million, lower than our outlook and inclusive of legal fees associated with our litigation against Samsung and Qualcomm.
The operating expense discipline reflects continued management of our investment in both R&D and capital expenditures to enhance our return on invested capital. GAAP operating income was $213 million, up 51% from the prior year's third quarter, reflecting strong revenue growth from higher margin GPUs and contained operating expenses. GAAP net income was $173 million, up 45% from a year earlier driven by increased operating profit from strong revenue and margins. GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.31 increased 55% from $0.20 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter, reflecting net income growth and share repurchases. 
Now turning to some key balance sheet items. During the third quarter, we paid $46 million in cash dividends and repurchased 16.8 million shares under a structured repurchase agreement entered into during the quarter. During the first 3 quarters of fiscal year '15, we paid $140 million in cash dividends and repurchased 44.2 million shares. As a result, we have returned to shareholders $950 million during the first 3 quarters of fiscal year '15.
Since the restart of our capital return program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we have returned approximately $2.17 billion. This return represents 136% of our cumulative free cash flow for fiscal years 2013, 2014 and 2015 to date and reflects the acceleration of our capital return program from cash generated in prior years.
As we transition into fiscal year '16 as part of our ongoing commitment to deliver shareholder value through capital return, we are pleased to announce our intention to return approximately $600 million to shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases in fiscal year 2016.
Accounts receivable at the end of Q3 were $563 million, up from $470 million in Q2. The sequential increase was primarily due to the mid-quarter launch of our Maxwell-based GPUs and the late-quarter project shipments in our database business compared with last quarter. DSO at quarter end was 42 days, up from 39 days in Q2.
Inventory at the end of Q3 was $408 million, up from $387 million in the prior quarter. The sequential increase included the ramping of Maxwell-based GPUs, coupled with decreases in products based on previous generation architectures. DSI at quarter end was 68 days, down from 73 days at the end of Q2.
Cash flow from operating activities was $216 million, up from $96 million in the prior quarter and from $162 million a year earlier. Our operating cash flow grew 33% year-over-year, reflecting higher net income from revenue growth and contained operating expenses, partially offset by higher accounts receivable.
Free cash flow was $176 million in the third quarter. Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to $55 million. Capital expenditures were $40 million.
Now turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. We expect revenue for the fourth quarter to be $1.2 billion, plus or minus 2%. The year-over-year growth is reflective of our continued strength in gaming, for the PC, the notebook and mobile platforms. Additionally, we expect growth from our enterprise platforms.
Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 55.2% and 55.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. The gross margin outlook is in line with our gross margin results in Q3 as high-end GTX, GPUs and data center results will contribute to the strong gross margins.
GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $470 million, and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $422 million, inclusive of legal fees associated with our litigation against Samsung and Qualcomm. Excluding these legal fees, we expect operating expenses to remain near Q3 levels.
GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 are both expected to be 18%, plus or minus 1%. This estimate is 1 percentage point lower than our previous outlook and is consistent with our tax rates in the third quarter, excluding any discrete tax events.
We are pleased with our record revenue for both the quarter and year-to-date, with strength across all platforms and businesses. Profitability, as measured by earnings per diluted share, increased 55% for the first 9 months of fiscal 2015 compared with the prior year.

Jen-Hsun, could you talk a little bit about how much strength you saw from a seasonal perspective for PC gaming? And how much of it might have been from the new Maxwell product launch?",50

You know that the gaming business is expanding globally. And we're seeing great strength in Asia. We're seeing great strength in developing countries. We're seeing incredible enthusiasm around MOBA, which is an online battle arena gameplay style. It's crossing over from being just video games to now being e-sports. And so the cultural implication of video games is getting greater and greater. There are several factors that drives our gaming business. One is, whenever we see a really exciting new game come to market, games like Assassin's Creed or Batman or some of the amazing Youda soft games that we've been seeing, Battlefield, Call of Duty, these incredible franchises that has millions of followers. And the second factor is, whenever we introduce a new GPU architecture, that is a huge leap from previous generations. Right now one of the most exciting things going on is driving beyond 1080p, 4K monitors are getting more and more cost effective. And without something like Maxwell, it's really hard to enjoy the full fidelity of a 4K display. And so these things all contribute. But I think at the highest level, gaming is just expanding globally. And now with Maxwell and our brand-new architecture that gives us a huge leap from previous generation, we're going to draw people out to upgrade to Maxwell so that they can take their gaming experience to the next level. Now for a shorter -- for a nearer term, Q3, of course, we benefited tremendously from the Maxwell launch. Overall for the year, PC gaming for us was up over 30%. So that gives you a sense of how PC gaming is expanding. Going into Q4, you're going to see some pretty amazing franchise titles coming out, it's the holiday season. And so we're looking forward to quite a good year in PC gaming. But overall, PC gaming is expanding.",319

And for my follow-up, to touch upon the GRID business. You've mentioned the early customer access program for GRID with VMWare. Any thoughts on the timing for how long that qualification cycle might take? And what kind of, I guess, ramp profile we might expect going to next year for GRID and Tesla as a whole?",60
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 06, 2014",2014-11-06,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3543.0,725594.0,31991656.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,6,"Well, our data center business overall had a record quarter. And we're seeing expansion in our data center business of -- in multiple ways. I appreciate you recognizing GRID. We entered into a partnership with VMWare to support early adopters of vSphere, which is supporting our GRID virtual GPU technology. With this VMWare and GRID platform, NVIDIA GRID platform, you can now virtualize all of enterprise all the way out to the clients. And you can make it possible for the most graphics-intensive applications, whether new or legacy PC applications, you can now virtualize it, stream the graphics to any heterogeneous device that your company decides to support. And we're seeing enthusiasm all over the world. In fact, since we announced this collaboration with them to develop the market together, we've seen thousands of companies try GRID. It's easy to try, you might want to try it yourself, just type in try GRID on the web and it will take you to a website and it will download a small client and you can enjoy the GRID experience and see what it's like. We have thousands of interested companies, we've selected many around the world, many of them are very large enterprises, who have several different needs. Some companies because their campus is quite large and so it's hard for IT departments to support all of the various workstations and PCs that are scattered all over campus. Universities are the same way. Sometimes it's because the workforce has large fluctuations, maybe they use a lot of contractors or maybe it's because students graduate every year. And so there's a lot of different reasons why virtualizing the enterprise desktop is incredibly valuable to these companies. As usual, enterprise validation and certification takes some time. And so I don't know -- I can't give you a particular schedule. But I can tell you the trials are going really well, and now because of VMWare, we can now engage 90% of the world's virtualization opportunities. And the size of opportunities that we're now looking at is getting larger and larger.",347

That seems like a big growth rate, is that a global phenomenon? Or is that kind of more regional and what do you think is driving that strength?",49

For the very first time in history, we've been able to get a GPU architecture that is able to do in a notebook-form factor, achieve a level of performance that is on parity, on par with desktop PCs. This is a really, really big deal. In a thin notebook, Maxwell GPU, because it's 2x the performance power factor compared to Kepler, which is already the most energy-efficient GPU we've ever built and the most energy-efficient GPU in the world today, we left by a factor of 2. And as a result, we're able to bring to the notebook form factors a level of performance that's on par with desktop. Now gamers don't have to choose, it's really just a matter of what kind of platform you enjoy. And we know that a lot of people like laptops, it's just that for gamers until now, they've not been able to gain that access to that level of performance without Maxwell. So this is a big deal for us. We're quite excited about the Maxwell brand. And it's just beginning to ramp. My expectation is that we're going to continue to grow the notebook gaming business for some time yet.",202

And then also in the client GPU business, can you talk a little bit about pricing? And it seems like your competitor hasn't had the success you guys have had and sounds like it's being relatively price aggressive. They've talked about that. Can you just talk about the pricing environment? And does that competitive dynamic affect you guys at all?",62
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 06, 2014",2014-11-06,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3543.0,725594.0,31991661.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,11,"Well, it's really related to value, I think. Our strategy with GeForce has really moved away from a component pricing model for several years. And that's -- it's the reason why our -- the value that is received by our gamers and appreciated by our gamers continues to grow. We've really taken much more of a software-rich approach. Even though our GPU architecture is now far and away, the best in the world, it's the most energy-efficient, it's the highest performance, it has amazing technology like VXGI that was just announced recently. Although at the foundational technology level, it is far and away the best. If you look at the software environment where we call the GFE, the GeForce Experience console that's on top, we really think about the GeForce as a GeForce gaming PC platform now. The software intensity of it is quite high. If you have GeForce Experience, your ability to enjoy games at its fullest is really incomparable. And so I think that people don't choose a component A to component B anymore. You really -- over time, we see a lot more return customers and once you get on the GeForce platform, you tend to stay on the GeForce platform. And our goal is to just keep adding more and more value to the GeForce gamers that are to join the GeForce platform and to earn their loyalty over time, and I think we're doing a really good job there. We're really proud of the team for their work here and the results kind of show it.",261

And within that, there are some moving parts. PCs are becoming thinner and lighter, in some cases, and as a result, they tend to not have GPUs attached. In some cases, the GPUs -- the PCs are becoming application-specific PCs like gaming notebooks, in which case the GPU is not only attached, but the GPU becomes quite powerful indeed. On the other hand, workstation notebooks are growing. And so there's a lot of different moving parts. But I would say the mainstream commodity notebook PC, we've been seeing lower and lower GPU attached for quite a long time and it's not a surprise to us.",127

On the data center cloud market, there's a decent market adoption of using FPGA as a co-processor with Intel Xeon processors. Do you see that as a stumbling block towards growing your data center and cloud revenue?",39

But GPU-accelerated data centers is really quite a new phenomenon. And the benefit of a GPU-accelerated data center is that the amount of total computational resource you could bring to bear is really quite amazing. It's not really practical, not really logical that one person or a small team designing an FPGA could achieve the level of computational throughput that the NVIDIA R&D department, with thousands of thousands of engineers refining a singular architecture called CUDA over the years. So it's not logical that, that could happen. And then secondarily, programming CUDA, programming our GPUs is far, far, far easier than programming an FPGA. The R&D cost is a lot lower, the rate of iteration is much higher. And so that's one of the reasons why Tesla has yet another record quarter. The number of platforms that support Tesla is growing all over the world. And I think it's a foregone conclusion that accelerated computing could add a lot of value in many areas of computing.",192

And maybe that's potentially being offset by your PC OEM business? Jen-Hsun, as you mentioned, we just had the big launch of Call of Duty Advance Warfare, we've got Assassin's Creed launch coming up soon, we've got several other blockbuster games in November. So I would assume that your PC gaming is up sequentially in January, but I wanted to get your thoughts.",84

We're expecting our gaming platforms and our enterprise data center platforms to be up quarter-to-quarter. Those are benefiting from both industry adoption of our platforms as well as the fact that we're going into a brand-new product cycle with Maxwell.

And then as you mentioned, continued strength in enterprise, we've got the Grantley server microprocessor ramp going into data centers and HPCs, it was about 10% of the mix for Intel in Q3. One of the first big adopters, like I said, does tend to be HPC and data centers. So the question is, how much of this is contributing to the strength in Tesla and potentially your GRID-based products? Or is it more just sort of, with Tesla and GRID, just para [ph] design wins that are finally starting to ramp, or maybe a combination of both?",104

And they're driven by the fact that the enterprise adoption of our platforms are increasing. But in the grand scheme of things, there's still a small percentage of the world's overall servers. And so my sense is that, that those matters are important, but they're not significant. Most of our adoptions tend to be related to new applications or -- and OEM certifying a new server for GRID, and there is a whole bunch of servers being certified right now, or a cloud data center service, a service provider, was able to deploy their service using a machine learning service or a natural language processing service or a music tagging service or some service that requires our GPUs deployed into production. So those tend to be the large reasons why we grow more so than the microprocessor that it's attached to.",153

First, I was curious with Intel's new Broadwell platform looking to launch kind of in late first half, right at some point in the first half of q -- next year. Are you guys, I guess, concerned about any more pronounced seasonality in Q1 ahead of that product launch? Or would you expect kind of just general typical seasonal trends this year?",69

Most of the platforms that we offer engage specific vertical markets, whether it's gaming or high-performance computing or enterprise virtualization or the cloud services with service providers or the automotive industry. And so these verticals tend to be much more important in how we think about our business. We also see now that our OEMs or our OEM partners go into a new product cycle when we launch a new product. And so when there's a new Maxwell GPU recently, every notebook OEM in the world offered a brand-new gaming notebook, irrespective of the rest of the platform. And the reception of those notebooks have been fantastic. It's been so successful for us in the notebook gaming business that for the very first time, HP and Lenovo both joined our GeForce gaming platform and offered notebook -- gaming notebooks under their own brands. And so we're really excited about the work that we're doing here. We're seeing more and more of this type of dynamic as we continue to transition our company's business model from a component's business attached to other components to a platform model where we engage vertical markets where we serve.",209

I guess, as a follow-up, just turning to the automotive business, obviously, going quite well for you. You highlighted strength in infotainment this past quarter. You --  it sounds like in December, the new Tesla launching is going to support some type of autonomous driving. You guys have mentioned that at your last Analyst Day, I believe, that was one big opportunity for Tegra. I was curious just to whether you thought you were hitting a point where that could be a meaningful driver. I mean, you talked about your auto business doubling in consecutive years, do you see some of these new opportunities, I guess, a continued path for growth beyond that? Just kind of interested in your general thoughts.",125

And the future of the car is going to have computing in not just infotainment, but the entire digital cockpit will be driven by computers, and because of better and better autopilot capabilities, the car will become quite rich in supercomputing capabilities over time. And so this -- just in general, the car industry is quite a rich opportunity for our computing -- for our computing focus, whether it's seeing around the car using visual computing technologies, or presenting information to the driver in all kinds of rich ways, whether it's infotainment or your digital cockpit or heads-up display or other technologies in the future, visual computing is going to play a huge role in the future of cars that we're quite excited about the opportunities there.",153

We're over 1,000 trials around the world, and we're going to focus our energy because we now have OEM partners and virtualization platform partners like VMWare and Citrix, who have all have sales forces that are out there selling the platform now. We're going to focus our energy to continue to evangelize GRID and to help the top customers, the top and the largest engagements adopt GRID and trial -- and doing their trial performance of GRID. And so we're going to continue to track them and the number of opportunities continue to grow. I just mentioned earlier, as we partnered with VMWare to take vSphere around the world, the number of customers who have come out to ask to be early adopters and to be part of the trial program is really quite exciting. And we put a web self-trial service up on the cloud all try GRID, and I encourage you all to try it. Thousands and thousands of companies have come out to try it. And so I think it stands to reason that enterprises around the world would like to virtualize their entire enterprise, it's more secure, it's more cost effective. It allows for a mobile workforce, and in many industries, quite a dynamic workforce. The workforce could ramp up and down pretty dramatically from season to season and because they work with a lot of contractors, they could be on-site and off-site and quite -- change quite rapidly. And so GRID virtualizes all of their workstations and PCs and makes it a lot easier for enterprises to support their dynamic workforce. And so there's a lot of different reasons why GRID is just a really fantastic extension of the entire enterprise virtualization movement. And so it's the reason why all of these OEMs are supportive of GRID and why they're taking it to market.",315

But I'm kind of curious from a Process Technology perspective, does the trouble that Intel's having with 14-nanometer mean anything to you as you work bring FinFET technology to market? Does it make you nervous about your own time lines? Or does it make you more excited that you're going to be in a position to maybe compete with a like-for-like transistor technology in the 2015 time frame?",86

I've been asked in the past about Moore's Law, and I believe in Moore's Law. The Moore's Law is not just about physics. Moore's Law is also about architecture and innovation, and it's really in the final analysis about performance and it's really in the final analysis about clever ideas. And if you take a Look at Maxwell, Maxwell improved on Kepler by a factor of 2x on the performance power factor. I mean, that's really quite substantial. And arguably, unheard of. I mean, that's incredibly -- that's much faster than Moore's Law. And so I believe in continued improvement in that area. And that we have to continue to add value through architecture, through design, through process and the combination of all that through software. All of those are levers for us. We're excited about the next generation of FinFET, the way that we deal with that, you know that we've had quite a few scars in the past as we ramped up new process technology, and we've been better and better and better at it. And the reason why is because we have just an extraordinary team in advanced technology group working deeply with our foundry partners and ensuring through real creation of test chips and rigorous test methodologies and development methodologies that ensure that when we are ready to ramp that the processors are ready for us. And I can tell you that, for the next couple of nodes, I feel pretty good about it because of that work.",263

And you touched on what else I wanted to talk about, Maxwell, in the market right now. I'm wondering, can you give me an example or us an example, I should say, of some of the gaming titles or the evolution of the industry that's starting to take advantage of Maxwell's capabilities right now? And I'm wondering if the clear advantage Maxwell has in the market is leading to any progress on the licensing front.",76

If you're a desktop gamer and you're playing one of the most advanced games out there, you're going to benefit and it's likely that you have a GTX 560 or GTX 660 or 760 or 670 or -- there are 10 million gamers who have GPUs that are -- GeForces that are installed in their systems that can benefit from a Maxwell upgrade. And when they install Maxwell, they're going to get the benefit of that 2x. They're going to either get a better visual quality at the same frame rate or much higher frame rate at an even better visual quality. And so there's a lot of different ways they can enjoy that. If you're a notebook gamer, Maxwell allows you to enjoy desktop level of performance for the very first time in your laptop. And then even if you had a game, and this is what's really cool about Maxwell, even if you have a game that already is running at 60 frames per second on your 1080p monitor, the thing that's really cool about Maxwell is we can now render to effectively a 4K resolution on our chip and we'll display it at 1080p on your monitor. And so all of a sudden, your 1080p monitor improves in fidelity as if you had a 4K monitor. So there's a lot of different ways that you can enjoy it. Our licensing discussions are very active. And we have many in important stages. And I think, at the highest level, the way to think about why we add value to several players in the industry is that the mobile device market is really commoditizing. And by adding NVIDIA GPU to their SOC, it can differentiate head and shoulders above the rest of the industry. And although there's a lot of different ways to differentiate, having the best processor in your mobile device is arguably the first way and arguably the best way of doing it. And so I think Maxwell surely adds value in that process. Tegra K1 adds an enormous amount of value in helping to validate the importance of our GPU and mobile applications, and so all of that helps.",389

On process node migrations off of that Alex question, what's the road map on GPU -- on a GPU side of the equation? Are you going to skip 20 nanometer and go straight to FinFET?",39

We haven't announced our next-generation products yet. And so we've got a lot of great surprises for you guys, and I'm excited about our next-generation GPU. But right now, we're enjoying ramping Maxwell. This is a brand-new product cycle, and I don't remember a product cycle in our company's history where we've had the lead that we have, the richness of applications in the gaming industry that we're ramping into, nor the number of vertical markets that we now serve from gaming to design, to cloud, to high-performance computing that we now serve that we're ramping this architecture into. And so Maxwell is unquestionably, at this point, a home run, and we're just savoring the movement and ramping the living daylights out of it.",135

And then, just as a follow up, Jen-Hsun, the game console guys have had a good year of a new product cycle for them. How do you compare this cycle to them versus PC gaming and Android gaming for that matter?",44

And they'll have the PC, they'll have game consoles. But my sense is that the game console platform is not likely to enjoy the hay days when it was really unambiguously the only and the best game platform to enjoy games. It's just not true anymore, there's just too many other ways to enjoy games. The PC has become the world's largest game platform, like China, the developing countries around the world, a PC is a platform they already own. They can upgrade it 2x or 3x, 4x without having to change the basic platforms. So the total cost of ownership of a gaming PC is quite attractive. And the games are incredible. And so the PC has become unambiguously the largest platform in the world today. Tencent is the largest game company, you could see how they're doing. And then, of course, mobile. How can we ignore the largest operating system in the world, Android, and why it won't become a premier game platform is beyond imagination really. And so I think that there's just too many other ways to enjoy games now for the game console to enjoy the hay days of the past. But we'll see, I think the thing that I do know is this, without any question, is that the PC is continuing to expand the number of titles, great titles that are coming to the PC is continuing to grow and the quality of titles is growing up ever so fast and then mobile gaming is going to be right around the corner.",280

Some of your peers who are participating in the HPC market, they are highlighting some increased visibility. I was just wondering if you could give us any color on your visibility into Tesla. It has proven to be a little bit lumpy in the past, I'm just wondering what kind of visibility you're seeing in this environment today?",64
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 06, 2014",2014-11-06,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3543.0,725594.0,31991694.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,44,"Well, the number of applications that run on Tesla is growing. And that's -- that is a not a lumpy factor and it's continuing to grow. The number of customers of Tesla is growing. The number of industries that Tesla is serving is growing. I think what really is happening is that it is now conventional wisdom that the accelerated computing model that we invented with Tesla is going to be a very important model for computing for as long as we see now. And when we go to Supercomputing this year, and I hope that all of you keep an eye on it, I think Supercomputing is going to help us understand where accelerated computing fits in the psychology of computing around the world. I think it really is at the tipping point of past, if not past. But accelerated computing can play a very important role in whole field of computing. There's some applications where accelerated computing just utterly shines. Of course, imaging is an area that accelerated computing does incredibly well. The number of applications related to understanding images and processing images from satellites, from cameras all over the world, from smartphones from all over the world, understanding images is going to be just, if not the killer app, one of the major killer apps that we're looking at. This is a global phenomenon with all kinds of interesting applications. So high-performance computing, accelerated computing at this point is really quite synonymous. And I think that all the visibility that you see is just confirmation that we are down the right path.",265

In that sense, what is kind of growth profile you have in your own line? How do you see this business growing over the next 2 to 3 years?",47

And that -- and because we're starting from a very small base, it explains why Tesla is one of our largest growth opportunities. And for 2 consecutive quarters, we've now seen record quarters and the number of partners that are supporting Tesla is growing, and the depth of which they support Tesla is increasing. And so I think Tesla is going to be a large business over time. And I would be very surprised if there are important or large data centers in the world that aren't somehow accelerated by GPUs.",102
