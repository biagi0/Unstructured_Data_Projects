It was a record quarter driven by our commercial cloud, which surpassed $16 billion in revenue, up 34% year-over-year. What we are witnessing is the dawn of a second wave of digital transformation sweeping every company and every industry. Digital capability is key to both resilience and growth. It's no longer enough to just adopt technology. Businesses need to build their own technology to compete and grow. Microsoft is powering the shift with the world's largest and most comprehensive cloud platform.
And now I'll briefly highlight how we are innovating across every layer of the modern tech stack, starting with Azure. We're building Azure as the world's computer to support organizations' growing cloud needs. We're investing to bring our cloud services to more customers, announcing 7 new data center regions in Asia, Europe and Latin America and adding support for top-secret classified workloads in the United States.
We've always led in hybrid computing, and we are accelerating our innovation to meet customers where they are. Azure Stack HCI, now broadly available, helps businesses extend the power of the cloud to sovereign workloads. More than 1,000 customers now use Azure Arc to simplify hybrid management and run agile services across on-premises, multi-cloud and at the edge. And with Azure Digital Twins, organizations like Bentley Systems, Honeywell Industries and Johnson Controls can bridge the digital and physical worlds, creating simulations of factories, cities to optimize their operations.
We are seeing momentum in every industry. Deutsche Telekom will rely on Azure to modernize its IT infrastructure through a partnership with Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard as well as Verily, our cloud will be used to help more researchers analyze biomedical data. Cruze and GM chose Azure as their preferred cloud as they work to make autonomous driving mainstream. And just last Friday, we announced an expansion of our partnership with SAP to accelerate the adoption of SAP workloads on Azure. In the past 6 months, we have seen Tier 1 ERP migrations from companies such as Bayer, Carhartt, Coats and Pepsico to Azure.  
At the data layer, Azure is the only cloud with limitless data and analytics capabilities that enable organizations to build the predictive and analytical power required to digitally transform. Azure Synapse brings together big data, data warehousing and data integration all into one powerful solution. Leading companies like FedEx, Grab and P&G are using Synapse to generate immediate insights from massive amounts of structured and unstructured data, and we are seeing strong overall growth in our analytics business as companies accelerate their data initiatives to build competitive advantage.
Data governance is top of mind for every business leader and will grow into an important category on its own as critical as any AI or analytics category today. We are investing to participate in this growth. New Azure Purview provides an end-to-end view of an organization's data estate across on-premise, multi-cloud and SaaS apps that previously was impossible.
In AI, we offer the most comprehensive portfolio of tools, frameworks and infrastructure, enabling businesses to build mission-critical solutions that comprehend speech, understand natural language, make predictions, provide insights and support decision-making. Our Azure Health Bot, for example, is being used by organizations like CDC, Premera Blue Cross and Walgreens to build virtual health care assistance used by more than 80 million people worldwide at a time when expanding access to health care information is more critical than ever.
Now to developers. Developers have been critical to business continuity over the last year, and we are helping them collaborate and scale their impact to drive organizational outcomes. From Github to Visual Studio, we have the most widely used and loved toolchain to help developers rapidly go from idea to code and code to cloud. Use of Github is becoming key to building digital capability in every company across every industry. Today, Github is used by more than 56 million developers as well as 3 million organizations from BuzzFeed and Plaid to Marsh & McLennan, Oracle and Volvo cars.
Now to Power platform. We are empowering domain experts, enabling anyone in any organization to build applications, automate processes, create virtual agents and analyze data. Power platform is the clear leader in low-code, no-code development with more than 11 million monthly active users up 95% year-over-year. Businesses like Nestlé, Humana chose Power BI this quarter to help employees use data to make smarter decisions. In public sector, the city of Kobe in Japan is relying on Power Virtual Agents and Power Automate to keep citizens informed, building intelligent paths to answer frequently asked questions as well as automated workflows to route inquiries.
Vaccine distribution perhaps best exemplifies the critical need for digital capability across the globe, and our Vaccine Registration and Administration Solution built on Power platform enables governments to manage the end-to-end process from screening and scheduling to administration and follow-ups. In Australia, the government of Victoria is relying on our tools to help deliver doses to more than 6 million residents. And here in the United States, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oklahoma are using our capabilities.
Our return to workplace solution in Power platform is also helping organizations keep workers safe and healthy when they go back to the office, and we are adding new capabilities to ensure people have verifiable, secure access to their vaccination records.
Now to Dynamics 365. We are taking share as companies in every industry turn to new business applications to grow. Customer expectations are changing faster than ever before requiring near real-time visibility into trends, behavior and needs. Our customer data platform, customer insights leads its category and has helped customers unify over 2 billion customer profiles, providing a single view of interactions across marketing, sales and e-commerce to deliver more personalized experiences. More companies are turning to our mixed reality solutions to help frontline employees connected even when apart. L'Oréal, for example, is using dynamics 365 Remote Assist and HoloLens 2 to help technicians repair equipment at factories when they cannot travel.
In retail, our applications were front and center at NRF earlier this month. Dynamics 365 Commerce now supports both B2C and B2B e-commerce, enabling retailers like Columbia Sportswear to ship inventory from stores and offer contactless payment options. PromoteIQ continues to scale rapidly with retailers like DICK's Sporting Goods and Home Depot and Kroger using the platform to power their digital vendor marketing programs.
Finally, our new Microsoft Cloud for Retail is bringing together our platform and tools across the shopper journey, accelerating time to value. It builds on the success of the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare, which is being used by organizations, including Providence, to empower clinicians to better serve patients.
Now to LinkedIn, we once again saw record levels of engagement across the platform as LinkedIn's nearly 740 million members use the network to connect, learn and find new opportunities. Sessions increased 30%. Conversations were up 48%, and hours spent on LinkedIn Learning were up 2x compared to a year ago. LinkedIn's advertising business had a record quarter, accounting for more than 1/3 of LinkedIn's total revenue. LinkedIn's Marketing Solutions was up over 50% as advertisers increasingly turn to the platform as the trusted way to reach professionals ready to do business. Finally, we continue to benefit from the secular shift to remote selling. Businesses are using the combination of LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Dynamics 365 to ensure salespeople have the context they need to sell remotely, while new tools help sales organizations use LinkedIn data to identify and size opportunities. 
Now to Microsoft 365. The pandemic has proven the PCs central role in keeping people connected, productive and secure. We added more new devices running Windows 10 this quarter than ever before. At CES, our partners showcased new PCs designed for the new ways we work, learn and play. And our Pluton security processor built by AMD, Intel and Qualcomm will bring chip to cloud security.
Flexible work is here to stay. To empower the digital workforce, organizations will need to -- an organizing layer for all the ways people work, learn and collaborate. That's what Microsoft 365 and Teams uniquely provide. Teams is the only solution with meetings, calls, chat, content collaboration with office and business process workflows in a secure integrated user experience. We're seeing large deployments. 117 organizations have more than 100,000 users of Teams, and over 2,700 organizations have over 10,000. And Teams has nearly 60 million daily active users on mobile alone.
Teams enables people to collaborate both synchronously and asynchronously, retain business context and stay in the flow of work, driving increased usage across Office 365 and Power platform. Power platform monthly average usage on Teams has grown 4x year-over-year. And with Microsoft Dataverse, anyone now can create and deploy custom solutions with Power apps and intelligent bots with Power Virtual Agents directly in Teams.
Teams is rapidly becoming the de facto unified communications platform of choice for every organization. New features like voice-enabled channels create a more powerful and streamlined calling experience and noise suppression, and live captions with speaker attribution make meetings more accessible. At Accenture alone, audio conferencing on Teams has increased to over 1 billion minutes a month as 85,000 employees use Teams to make external calls. And this quarter, Lumen, formerly CenturyLink, rolled out Teams, calling globally to 42,000 employees in just 4 weeks. The pandemic has shown the importance of empowering the 2 billion frontline workers around the world with the right technology. 390,000 associates at Home Depot will use Microsoft 365, including Yammer, to foster connection and engagement across the organization. And more than 500,000 employees of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, including health care workers, use Teams to collaborate.
In education, more than 200 million students and educators worldwide rely on Microsoft education products for remote learning. And leading customers in every industry, including Amgen, AT&T, Daimler, GSK and IKEA are increasingly turning to our premium offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice and analytics capabilities. Microsoft 365 E5 revenue has grown triple digits for the past 4 quarters.
Now to security. The recent SolarWinds attack are a stark reminder of how critical security is to our customers. We are focused on ensuring organizations deploy and maintain a zero-trust architecture. Our end-to-end security capabilities, inclusive of identity, security, compliance and management across all clouds and all client platforms have been key as we help customers strengthen their security posture and mitigate impact.
Beyond our products, our operational security posture and threat intelligence, which analyzes 8 trillion signals each day, help customers defend themselves. Over the past 12 months, our security business revenue has surpassed $10 billion, up more than 40%. This milestone is a testament to the deep trust organizations place in us, and we will continue to invest in new capabilities across all our products and services to protect our customers.
We see strong momentum in usage of our products. In identity, Azure AD has more than 425 million monthly active users. In security, Microsoft Defender blocked nearly 6 billion threats last year alone. In management, we saw triple-digit growth in the number of devices managed by Microsoft Intune; and in compliance, we've seen 90% increase in our customer base year-over-year.
Now on to gaming. We surpassed $5 billion in revenue for the first time in this quarter as we expand our opportunity to reach the world's 3 billion gamers wherever they play. The launch of Xbox Series X and Series S was the most successful in our history, with the most devices ever sold in a launch month. Game developers are benefiting too as they turn to us to reach more players and scale their games using the power of our cloud. We exceeded $2 billion in revenue from third-party titles this quarter for the first time.
We're gaining console share as gamers recognize the value of our broader ecosystem. Xbox Live has more than 100 million monthly active users while Game Pass now has 18 million subscribers. And we are transforming how games are distributed, played and viewed, bringing cloud gaming and Game Pass to iOS devices and Windows PCs over the next few months.
We are pleased with the overall growth in our consumer subscriptions with Game Pass and more than 47 million Microsoft 365 personal and family subscribers, we have a large and growing consumer subscription business. And we see significant opportunity in both of these segments as they move to services and on-demand models.
In closing, I'm energized by our increasing momentum and the expanding opportunity fueled by the structural change brought about by the rapid adoption of digital technology. We're investing to meet these needs in the coming decade, and I'm optimistic about what's ahead.
With that, I'll hand it over to Amy, who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook; and I look forward to rejoining you after for questions.",2147
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2021",2021-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3522.0,2251465.0,87336766.0,Presenter Speech,Amy Hood,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $43.1 billion, up 17% and 15% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.03, increasing 34% and 31% in constant currency. Across our business, results exceeded expectations, driven by strong execution and improving trends across industries, customer segments and geographical markets, resulting in double-digit top and bottom line growth.
In our commercial business, customers prioritized their digital transformation, which drove healthy demand for our hybrid and cloud offerings with material growth in the number of $10 million-plus Azure and Microsoft 365 contracts. We saw stronger Azure consumption as well as higher usage of Teams, Power Platform and our advanced security and compliance offerings. And within our small and medium business customer segment, transactional licensing trends continued to show some improvement.
In our consumer business, the overall PC market was stronger than expected, benefiting our Windows OEM, Office Consumer and Surface businesses. The advertising market continued to show improvement, benefiting our Search and LinkedIn businesses. And in gaming, we saw record engagement and monetization across our platform as well as console demand that significantly exceeded supply following the Xbox Series X and S launches.
Moving to our overall results, even with the declining expiration base and a strong prior year comparable, commercial bookings increased 19% and 11% in constant currency. Strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including the Azure and Microsoft 365 momentum noted earlier, drove a better-than-expected result. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 24% and 22% in constant currency to $112 billion, with a roughly equivalent split between the revenue that will be recognized within and the portion beyond the next 12 months. And our annuity mix increased 4 points year-over-year to 93%.
Commercial cloud revenue was $16.7 billion as growth accelerated to 34% and 32% in constant currency. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage expanded 4 points year-over-year to 71%, driven by the change in accounting estimate for the useful life of server and networking equipment assets. Excluding this impact, commercial cloud gross margin percentage was up slightly.
As a reminder, revenue mix shift to Azure, increased customer usage of our productivity and collaboration solutions and continued strategic investments to support customer success, and the deployment of our solutions will continue to impact gross margin. With the weaker U.S. dollar, FX increased revenue growth by approximately 2 points, about 1 point more favorable than anticipated. FX had no impact on COGS growth and increased operating expense growth by approximately 1 point, both in line with expectations.
Gross margin dollars increased 18% and 16% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage was 67%, up slightly year-over-year with roughly 2 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate noted earlier. Excluding this impact, company gross margin percentage was down driven by the sales mix shift to cloud and gaming.
Operating expense increased 3% and 2% in constant currency, lower than anticipated, driven by greater-than-expected COVID-related savings, reductions in retail store expenses and investments that shifted to future quarters. Overall, company headcount grew more than 10% year-over-year with our focused investment in key areas such as customer success, cloud engineering and sales.
Operating income increased 29% and 26% in constant currency, and operating margins expanded 4 points year-over-year to 42%, including roughly 2 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate and nearly 1 point of favorable impact from COVID-related savings.
Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $13.4 billion, increasing 13% and 11% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by Office Commercial and LinkedIn. On a strong prior year comparable that included roughly 3 points of benefit primarily from transactional strength in Japan, Office Commercial revenue grew 11% and 9% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue grew 21% and 20% in constant currency. Results were driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments as well as higher ARPU.
The strong demand for Microsoft 365 noted earlier, particularly for our security, compliance and voice components, drove E5 revenue growth acceleration again this quarter. Paid Office 365 Commercial seats increased 15% year-over-year with strong conversion of our free trial offers. We also saw a steep growth improvement in our small and medium business and first-line worker offerings.
Office Consumer revenue grew 7% and 6% in constant currency on a strong comparable that included roughly 7 points of benefit from transactional strength in Japan. Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions grew to 47.5 million, up 28% year-over-year. Dynamics revenue grew 21% and 18% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 39% and 37% in constant currency. The number of customers adopting multiple Dynamics 365 workloads accelerated again this quarter.
LinkedIn revenue increased 23% and 22% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations. Growth in our marketing solutions business accelerated to 53%, benefiting from the stronger advertising market noted earlier. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 11% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year-over-year with roughly 2 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Operating expense increased 4% and 3% in constant currency, and operating income increased 19% and 17% in constant currency, including 5 points due to the change in accounting estimate.
Next, the intelligent cloud segment. Revenue was $14.6 billion, ahead of expectations, increasing 23% and 22% in constant currency. Server products and cloud services revenue increased 26% and 24% in constant currency. Azure revenue grew 50% and 48% in constant currency driven by strong growth in our consumption-based business that benefited from improvement across industries and customer segments noted earlier. Our per-user results were also better than expected driven by accelerated growth in our enterprise mobility and security installed base, up 29% to over 163 million seats. And on a strong prior year comparable that included roughly 4 points of benefit from the end of support for Windows Server 2008, our on-premises server business increased 4% and 3% in constant currency with strong annuity performance driven by continued demand for our hybrid and premium offerings.
Enterprise services revenue grew 5% and 4% in constant currency, again driven by premier support services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 29% and 27% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased 3 points year-over-year, with roughly 3 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Operating expense increased 12% and 11% in constant currency, and operating income grew 43% and 41% in constant currency, with roughly [ 10 point ] favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate.
Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $15.1 billion, increasing 14% and 13% in constant currency and better-than-expected performance across all businesses. In Windows, the stronger PC market resulted in overall OEM revenue growth of 1% despite a strong prior year comparable in OEM Pro from the end of support for Windows 7. OEM non-Pro revenue grew 24%, and OEM Pro revenue declined 9%. Inventory levels ended the quarter in the normal range.
Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 10% and 8% in constant currency driven by continued demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions. In Surface, revenue grew 3% and 1% in constant currency. Search revenue ex TAC increased 2% and 1% in constant currency, benefiting from the improved advertising market noted earlier. And in gaming, revenue increased 51% and 50% in constant currency. Xbox hardware revenue grew 86% driven by the new console launch as well as the benefit from lower price promotions on our prior generation consoles. Xbox content and services revenue grew 40% and 38% in constant currency with strong growth in third-party transactions, Game Pass subscribers and first-party titles.
Segment gross margin dollars increased 11% and 9% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased 2 points year-over-year driven by sales mix shift to gaming. Operating expense decreased 10%, and operating income grew 25% and 22% in constant currency.
Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $5.4 billion, up 20% year-over-year to support growing global demand and customer usage of our cloud services. Cash paid for PP&E was $4.2 billion. Cash flow from operations was $12.5 billion and increased 17% year-over-year as strong cloud billings and collections were partially offset by payments related to a tax audit settlement. Free cash flow was $8.3 billion, up 17%.
Excluding the impact of these tax payments, cash flow from operations and free cash flow grew 33% and 41%, respectively. Other income and expense was $440 million, higher than anticipated, primarily driven by net gains on investments, including mark-to-market gains on our equity portfolio as well as net gains on foreign currency remeasurement. Our effective tax rate was approximately 16%, in line with expectations. And finally, we returned $10 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, an increase of 18% year-over-year.
Now let's move to our outlook. My commentary for both the next quarter and any remarks for the full year does not include any impact from the ZeniMax acquisition, which we still expect to close by the end of the fiscal year. In our Commercial business, consistent execution, focus on customer success and a compelling solution portfolio in high-growth markets should drive another strong quarter. In our Consumer business, we expect to see healthy demand for PCs and productivity tools continue, though growth rates will again be impacted by the end of support for Windows 7 last year. In gaming, we expect continued strong engagement on the Xbox platform and significant demand for the Xbox Series X and S that will still be constrained by supply. And our Search and LinkedIn businesses should benefit from the improving advertising market.
In Commercial bookings, we have a growing Q3 expiry base and a low prior year comparable, so strong execution across our core annuity sales motions and increased commitment to our cloud platform should drive healthy growth. As a reminder, an increasing mix of large long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive quarterly volatility in the growth rates.
Commercial cloud gross margin percentage to increase by approximately 3.0 over year, again driven by the change in accounting estimate. Excluding this impact, continued improvement in Azure, IaaS and PaaS gross margin will be offset by revenue mix shift to Azure and continued investments to support our customers' success. We expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis to our capital expenditures as we continue to invest to meet growing global demand for our cloud services.
Now to FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total company revenue, COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 2 points. Within the segments, FX should increase Productivity and Business Processes revenue growth by approximately 3 points and Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing revenue growth by approximately 2 points.
Now to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $13.35 billion and $13.6 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365, with continued upsell opportunity to E5. In our on-premise business, though we anticipate continued improvement in transactional purchasing trends, we expect revenue to decline in the mid- to high teens range, consistent with the ongoing customer shift to the cloud.
In Office Consumer, on a strong prior year comparable, revenue growth should be similar to last quarter with continued growth in Microsoft 365 subscription revenue. In LinkedIn, we expect continued strong engagement on the platform to drive revenue growth in the low 20% range. And in Dynamics, continued momentum will drive revenue growth similar to last quarter.
For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $14.7 billion and $14.95 billion. In Azure, revenue will again be driven by strong growth in our consumption-based business. And in our per-user business, we expect continued benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum. In our on-premise server business, we expect revenue growth to be in the low to mid-single digits driven by continued demand for our hybrid and premium annuity offerings on a strong prior year comparable that included the benefit from the end of support for Windows Server 2008. In enterprise services, revenue growth should be roughly in line with last quarter.  
In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $12.3 billion and $12.7 billion. In Windows, overall OEM revenue growth should be in the low single digits on a strong comparable mentioned earlier. Windows commercial products and cloud services growth should be in the low to mid-teens, driven by continued demand for Microsoft 365 and  our advanced security solutions. And in Surface, good demand against the low prior year comparable should drive growth in the mid- to high teens range.  In Search ex TAC, growth should be driven by improvements in the advertising market. And in gaming, we expect revenue growth of approximately 40%, driven by next-generation console sales as well as Xbox content and services revenue in the mid-20% range.  
Now back to the company guidance. We expect COGS of $13.1 billion to $13.3 billion and operating expense of $11.9 billion to $12 billion. In other income and expense, interest income and expense should offset each other. We expect our Q3 tax rate to be approximately 15%, slightly lower than our full year rate of approximately 16%.
And finally, for FY '21, with our strong performance in the first half of the fiscal year and our outlook for Q3, we expect to deliver another full year of double-digit revenue and operating income growth as well as healthy operating margin expansion, even after excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate and COVID-related savings.
In closing, we have executed well in the first half of our fiscal year in a challenging and changing environment. Investments made over quarters and often years, coupled with focused execution by our teams, are the drivers behind a compelling portfolio that is delivering value today for our customers and creating optimism in our road map for tomorrow.
Satya discussed our unique, comprehensive and integrated set of products earlier on the call, products and services that span large growth markets, and we will continue to invest broadly and boldly against the significant opportunities ahead of us.

Maybe I'll start, and Amy, you can add to it.

So as a tech company with that comprehensive differentiated portfolio, all the way from business applications, industry solutions to infrastructure, I think we benefit from that and that's what you saw this quarter.

Could you just talk to what you're seeing in terms of the breadth and maybe the size of the transaction? And anything else that you think is important to highlight why you're seeing this reacceleration in the business?,45

Maybe again I'll start. Amy, you can add. I would say, again, with Azure, some of the core differentiation we have, whether it comes to our hybrid leadership, some of the new data products that are highly differentiated and competitive in the marketplace as well as the integration with every other layer of our stack, whether it's the dev layer with Power Platform or GitHub or with Teams to Power Apps to Azure DB, the industry solutions we now have in health care and in retail are all leading to that time to value, the price differentiation and cost advantage to customers and most importantly, agility in that -- in their ability to build their own digital capability. So that's what you see in the acceleration around Azure. But when we think about Microsoft Cloud, we think about all the parts coming together to deliver value and differentiation to our customers.",153

And you obviously saw we had a good quarter in bookings, which is far more reflective of future commitment.
In quarter, what we saw is really fundamental consumption growth and some reacceleration of growth curves, particularly in maybe industries that had been more hard hit in Q4 and Q1. And so I would describe it a little bit that way and including, frankly, even some mid-market and some segment-based recovery on that front. So as I look forward, obviously, it's about what Satya talked about, which is you -- there's differentiation. There's usage. There's looking forward to making sure that we continue to have great bookings numbers; but in the quarter itself, it was usage growth, not the contracting that made a difference.",164

It was comfortably above where everybody, I think, is modeling. And in particular, I wanted to ask you about Office 365. Of all the businesses, the larger ones in Microsoft, most saw upside in this recent quarter except perhaps for Office 365, where, despite the migration to E5 and despite the free-to-paid seat conversion, we really didn't see an acceleration in Office 365. I'm wondering if you could perhaps unpack that and describe why.
And part 2 to the question is your guide for that segment is so good in the March quarter that one would infer that the Office 365 growth is likely to accelerate in March. I'm wondering if you could confirm whether that's a reasonable assumption.",137
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2021",2021-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3522.0,2251465.0,87336778.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,15,"There's a couple of things, Karl, in the PBP guide, and let me break them down a little bit. As you heard, actually, almost all the components in Q3 have sort of consistent to slightly better execution, right? So there's upside that we saw in LinkedIn. There's upside in Office Commercial. There's upside that's reflected in the stronger subscriptions number we saw in Consumer. And there's good execution in Dynamics. So for me, it's a bit more. And then we'll come back and talk about Microsoft 365 all up in a second.
Each of those pieces, there's really consistent performance into Q3, which is good. And so when you think about Office 365, interestingly, what we're seeing is a lot of the things we have seen before, but remember, we had a pretty tough comp a year ago in Office Commercial. And so for me, I look and say, gosh, we did great execution. We saw some improving trends in seat growth in the frontline; improving trends in SMB that won't yet be reflected, of course, in revenue; seeing good trial conversion, which again, speaks to forward revenue more than in-quarter revenue given that's all subscription. And we saw -- so you see better seat growth, good conversion and good E5 selling. So I actually feel pretty good leaving Q2 and entering Q3 in terms of value that customers are getting out of the subscriptions that they've got and the conversions that we're seeing in market.",247

I mean just one quick thing I would add is when you look at Microsoft 365, I think one of the things that -- one of the best things I've seen recently is when a customer talked about all the things that they're using compared to even just last year to now, that is new value from Office 365 and the usage depth and increase. That's, I think, really the real power of that franchise going forward. And so I hope you, as shareholders, look at what's the depth and breadth of the offering and the usage -- and the usage depth by account, which I think is what at least we are investing and tracking closely.",118

And that's kind of Teams working as a framework across all of your solutions and sort of connecting more and more people into the Microsoft framework. I was doing some calls this quarter and asking about a competitor's acquisition of a Teams competitor, and a lot of people in the channel talk to me about how Teams was pulling through Dynamics CRM, right? And they understood that acquisition as a defense against that. And I was surprised to hear that, that there would be a linkage between the 2.
Can you help us, one, kind of understand the -- how Teams pulls in additional products behind it, number one? And number two, the connection between kind of Teams and how they get a broader base of frontline workers into the story for Microsoft? Because I think most people think about Microsoft as like an information worker story, but frontline workers is another huge kind of area for you guys to go after.",178

That is absolutely right. And I think I've commented on this earlier as well in our calls, which is we built Teams as essentially this tool that brings together multiple capabilities. It brings together chat. It brings together meetings, collaboration that is office collaboration as well as business process workflow all into one scaffolding. That's the biggest breakthrough of teams.
In the past, obviously, we had suites of tools, but this is the first product, more so than Outlook was even, in terms of being able to integrate communications, collaboration and business process. And that's what you see. When we talked about it in my comments, that's why one of the things I stressed was what was happening with just line of business applications.
Before any SaaS application, ours or others, the reality is the most usage in any enterprise is line of business applications that were built custom by their enterprise and their IT organizations for all the departments, whether it's HR or finance or operations. That is really one of the bigger drivers of Teams usage as a platform capability, right?
So you -- you brought up first line. There's some shift scheduling application, some inventory counting application that the frontline person is using on a mobile phone with Teams, but the inventory management app was just a power app built using Power Apps. So that is what you're seeing. And then, of course, the integrations into Dynamics, integrations into all SaaS applications, whether it's Workday or whether it's SAP or whether it is ServiceNow and even Salesforce, all of these applications are getting integrated into Teams very rapidly. And so that's the power of Teams as a platform capability that we are seeing.
And you're absolutely right that this is no longer about just knowledge workers collaborating. In fact, if anything, it's about knowledge workers collaborating and enabling frontline workers with more of these work to participate with digital tools in the workflow versus being disconnected.",336

Amy, do you see a sustainably different post-COVID expense profile for Microsoft as it relates to real estate footprint and T&E levels or -- and maybe, Satya, you could perhaps comment on this as well. Are you expecting a fuller return to the office and fuller resumption of business travel over time such that, that expense profile wouldn't look very different?",68
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2021",2021-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3522.0,2251465.0,87336785.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,22,"Maybe I'll just talk about broadly how I think both at Microsoft as well as what we are seeing as this return to work. I think the key thing, Mark, we just think about is there will be more flexibility in terms of time, where they work, even the sites people work because I think the expectations have changed. We obviously are not going to have the same constraints going forward, so I'm not at all assuming that we just remain as is all the way going forward. But at the same time, there's no return to January of 2020.
But -- so therefore, what I think is key for us is to really maintain flexibility. And that's why even going back to the conversation around Teams, it's not like the work only happens in online meetings, right? Work happens before meetings, during meetings, after meetings, and especially in hybrid work, you need that sophisticated set of tools that really track workflow irrespective of who is where. And so that's what we are focused on.
And in our own policies, we have laid out our policies, which give more flexibility, and it'll be different by function, different by geography, different in time. So that's how we expect essentially work to evolve. I don't know, Amy, if you want to add a little more on the expense side.",228

I think what I would add is maybe to take a step back from the narrowness, in some ways, of the question, Mark, and expand it to say the overall expense logic that we have going forward and in many ways, that's why I talked about we've seen headcount growth of over 10% in the past year as we invest in the significant opportunities we see and having customers be successful.
And that's at a time when, frankly, we're coming upon the anniversary across many spots of the world of where we've been working remotely for close to a year. And so it's about continuing to invest in those places, looking and learning about the types of flexibility that we're able to provide our own employees, what travel patterns need to look like. And of course, we'll do what it takes to deliver success to customer, which should be the driving force behind how we invest in that segment.
And finally, there's obviously lots of opportunity for us to continue to be flexible in how we work specifically, which is where Satya talked about. But this is a pretty broad conversation and, in many ways, I think, talks to a broader rethink of what productivity means across every industry and every role, which I actually think is a very exciting time, both for Microsoft 365 and lots of the tools we're developing.",233

Your market share in that area is fairly low in aggregate. You've got Dynamics that's performing really well and sounds like is accelerating. Just wondering how you're looking at that market more broadly as an opportunity for the company.,54
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2021",2021-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3522.0,2251465.0,87336789.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,26,"Yes. We are very, very focused on what we think is modern business process applications, Walter. The way I look at it is there's a complete rethink on, even if you take the previous conversation around what are the workflows that need to get integrated into a communications tool such that there's real continuity between frontline to knowledge worker to business process. I think that opens up even a ton of opportunity.
I mean take something like even digital twins and the level of automation that one can bring even into manufacturing. So the combination of an Azure PaaS service to SaaS capabilities in Dynamics 365 can be very transformative to digital manufacturing, which is probably going to be one of the bigger trends going forward. Same thing in supply chain.
So it's a pretty important area. For us, business process and business applications participation, if you will, will be both on the Azure side, on the data side, on the AI side and the biz apps side as well as Power Apps. So it's not one narrow category because I think most people, the way you measure business applications and the categories of business and applications is pretty narrow. But business process is much broader than that. And so that's, I think, at least what we are building towards.",220

Just I think, for us, one of the exciting parts about Dynamics and for shareholders is the expansiveness of that redefinition by industry. And even the terms and categorization today that define biz apps, I think we'll see, are quite large and will be addressed not just with our Dynamics product portfolio but partially with our LinkedIn portfolio, with our Power Platform portfolio, with Microsoft 365 as well as Azure. And I think that -- and thinking about it holistically is why it's so important for us and why we keep coming back to the commercial cloud as our frame. It's how customers see the solution. It's how we sell. It's how solutions are actually implemented for business process change.",130

Maybe I'll start. Amy, you can add to this. On xCloud, it's very early days, but we are very excited about, fundamentally, the expansion opportunity it provides. So the service today really allows us to take our catalog and not be limited to any of the traditional end points, in particular, the console and the PC and expand beyond that.
And so as you can imagine, that, I think from a reach perspective, is very exciting to us. And the fact that we now have a technology solution to do so, we are in the very early innings of it while at the same time, ensuring that we are doing a fantastic job for all our console gamers and PC gamers, is going to be how we'll approach the value of our subscriptions.",134

In general, Brad, it's a very good question because the things you tend to watch that can move it quarter-to-quarter are things like you mentioned, whether it's the settlement this quarter, whether it's for free cash flow, the timing of cash capital expenditures versus on an accrual basis.
But overall, it really should move in line with operating income generally and really reflect the fundamentals of our business execution. We've -- it's been something we focused on.

It was a record quarter powered by our continued strength of our commercial cloud. Over a year into the pandemic, digital adoption curves aren't slowing down. In fact, they're accelerating and it's just the beginning. Digital technology will be the foundation for resilience and growth over the next decade. We are innovating and building the cloud stack to accelerate the digital capability of every organization on the planet. 
Now I'll highlight our growing opportunity and momentum, starting with Azure. As the world's COGS become more digital, computing will become more ubiquitous and decentralized. We are building Azure to address organizations' needs in a multi-cloud, multi-edge world. We have more data center regions than any other provider, including new regions in China, Indonesia, Malaysia as well as United States. 
Azure has always been hybrid by design, and we are accelerating our innovation to meet customers where they are. Azure Arc extends the Azure control plane across on-premise, multi-cloud and the edge and going further with Arc-enabled machine learning and Arc-enabled Kubernetes. Companies like Fujitsu and KPMG are using Arc to simplify hybrid management and run Azure data services anywhere. 
Our differentiation across the cloud and the edge is driving deeper and more strategic partnerships with leading companies in every industry from Total and Repsol and Energy to Kaiser Permanente in healthcare and Amadeus in travel. 
Now to data and analytics. Core to the competitiveness of every company going forward will be their ability to turn data into predictive and analytical power. The next-generation analytics service, Azure Synapse accelerates time to insight by bringing together data integration, enterprise data warehousing and big data analytics into one unified service. No other provider offers the limitless scale, price performance and deep integrations of Synapse.  
With Spark integration, for example, organizations can handle large-scale data processing workloads. With Azure machine learning, they can build advanced AI models. With Power BI, anyone in the organization can access insights. 
We are seeing adoption from thousands of customers, including AB InBev, Dentsu and Swiss Re. Queries performed using Synapse have increased 105% over the last quarter alone. We are leading in hyperscale SQL and non-SQL databases to support the increasing volume, variety and velocity of data. Customers continue to choose Azure for their relational database workloads with SQL Server on Azure VMs use up 129% year-over-year. And Cosmos DB is the database of choice for cloud-native app development at any scale. Transaction volume increased 170% year-over-year. 
Now on to developers. As every organization looks to build its own digital capability, they will need to modernize existing apps, build new apps and have a standard way of doing both. We offer the most popular tools to help developers rapidly grow from idea to code and code to cloud. 
Visual Studio has more than 25 million monthly active users and GitHub is home to nearly 65 million developers. Over the past 12 months, the number of monthly active organizations using GitHub increased 70%. In fact, some of the most groundbreaking technological achievements of the past year, including critical COVID-19 vaccine trials as well as the first powered flight on Mars were only possible because of the contributions of the open-source communities on GitHub. 
At the PaaS layer, we are innovating to help developers infuse AI into the solutions they build. Large-scale AI models are becoming platforms, and we've seen dramatic advances in research and development by OpenAI whose models are trained and hosted exclusively on Azure. 
GPT-3 is generating 4.5 billion words per day on average with hundreds of apps in production across a range of industries. With Azure Cognitive Services, organizations can build applications that see, hear, speak, search, understand and accelerate decision-making. 
New capabilities enable developers to add semantic search to their apps and help companies like AT&T, Duolingo, and Progressive build custom neural voices for their products. And we're doing -- going further with Azure Percept, a complete platform from silicon to service, which simplifies the process of developing, training and deploying AI at the edge. 
As the virtual and physical worlds converge, the metaverse comprised of digital twins, simulated environments and mixed reality is emerging as a first-class platform. We are leading and seeing traction across public and private sector. 
Bentley Systems is building a digital twin of the city of Dublin to reimagine urban planning, used our Azure Digital Twins as well as Azure IoT. PepsiCo is simulating its manufacturing processes to improve product consistency using our autonomous systems platform. And from Airbus and Toyota to L'Oreal and Intel customers in every industry are transcending space and addressing complex challenges using mixed reality. 
The U.S. Army, for example, will use HoloLens based headset augmented with our cloud services. The new Microsoft Mesh builds on this momentum, allowing for holographic interactions with true presence in a natural way on any device. We've already seen early adoption by Accenture, which is using mesh to build immersive virtual office experiences. 
Power Platform is becoming the next-generation business process automation and productivity suite for domain experts in all functions. We have taken a unique approach to what is an expansive and high-growth TAM, bringing together robotic process automation, low-code, no-code tools, virtual agents and business intelligence. Using power platform and domain -- any domain experts can automate a workflow, create an app, build a virtual agent or analyze data rapidly driving productivity gains across the organization through smart automation. 
Just like Office revolutionized productivity gains for knowledge workers, Power Platform will do the same for domain experts. All up, Power Platform is being used by nearly 16 million monthly active users, up 97% year-over-year. Revenue increased 84% year-over-year. Telstra, T-Mobile, Toyota North America and Unilever have all built centers of excellence for Power Platform with thousands of workers who are using those low-code, no-code tools to build apps and workflows for everything from COVID-19 screening to product quality control. 
In robotic process automation, Coca-Cola saved months of development time by integrating Power Automate with legacy systems to automate shipment verification, payroll processing and much more. And in analytics, Daimler chose Power BI to surface insights across the organization, while maintaining the highest levels of security.  
Now on to business applications. Dynamics 365 had a breakthrough quarter as companies turn to intelligent business applications to adapt and grow. Revenue increased 45% as we continue to take share from competition. We are adding capabilities across Dynamics 365 to address organization's most pressing challenges. 
New integrations with Teams make it simple to meet, chat, call and collaborate directly within Dynamics 365. A new Dynamics 365 Intelligent Order Management helps companies support omnichannel fulfillment. We are seeing increased adoption of Dynamics 365 across every industry from ABN AMRO in Financial Services to BMW in automotive. 
More broadly across the Microsoft Cloud, we are leading with industry and cross-industry solutions and expanding our investments to help organizations use our complete tech stack along with industry-specific customizations to improve time to value, increase agility and lower costs. This quarter, we introduced new industry clouds for financial services, manufacturing and nonprofits, building on the momentum of existing clouds for health care and retail. And our pending acquisition of Nuance will bring our solutions directly into the physician patient loop, which is central to health care delivery. 
Now on to LinkedIn.  We once again saw record engagement as LinkedIn's 756 million members use the network to connect, learn, create content and find jobs. Conversations increased 43%, content share was up 29%, and the hours on LinkedIn increased by 80%. We are helping creators use LinkedIn to expand their economic opportunity, thousands of expert instructors are monetizing their content on LinkedIn Learning. Freelancers can now attract clients with dedicated pages. And with the creator mode, members can build a following and engaged communities. 
In a world facing a growing skills gap, we are helping employers create feedback loops between skills, learning, credentials and jobs. 60% of the Fortune 500 use LinkedIn Learning to skill and upskill their employees. Nationwide Insurance, for example, is using LinkedIn Learning to provide personalized curriculum to 26,000 associates. And new tools bring together courses with skills assessments, helping companies like BlackRock, Gap and TaskRabbit source job candidates based on proven proficiencies. 
Businesses continue to turn to LinkedIn as the trusted way to reach professionals ready to do business. LinkedIn Marketing Solutions revenue was up more than 60% year-over-year. Over the past 12 months, revenue has surpassed $3 billion and is growing nearly 3x faster than the B2B digital advertising market. 
Now on to Microsoft 365 and Teams. Hybrid work will require a new operating model. That's why we built Teams as the organizing layer for all the way people work, learn and collaborate. Teams now has over 145 million daily active users, almost double the number a year ago. In markets where employees have returned to the workplace, including Australia, China, New Zealand, South Korea and Taiwan, we have seen usage continue to grow. And the number of organizations with more than 1,000 users, integrating their third-party and line of business applications with Teams has increased nearly 3x year-over-year. 
We're accelerating our innovation, adding more than 300 features over the past year, including more than 100 new capabilities so far in 2021. New inclusive meeting experience for hybrid work, including custom gallery views, enable anyone to be seen, heard and participate, whether they are at home, in a meeting room, at an office or on a factory floor. And customers like GM and Sanofi are using Teams for unified communications, including for voice. Teams is extending beyond communications, creating an entirely new category of modern collaborative applications as organizations use Power Platform to build custom apps, bots and workflows within teams. 
American Airlines, for example, highlighted in their earnings call, the cost savings, it's driving by using a Power app within Teams to help their frontline workers manage critical data operations. Teams is transforming not only internal collaboration, but companies how they do business. We added support for shared workspaces with people outside the organization, and we are seeing Teams used for everything from virtual retail showrooms and personal shopping to interactive webinars. 
We introduced Microsoft Viva this quarter, creating a new market category for employee experience. Viva brings together knowledge, learning, communication and insights in an integrated experience directly within Teams and Microsoft 365. 
Companies like Coca-Cola and Unilever will use Viva to help their employees thrive in a new era of hybrid work. All up Microsoft 365 users generated more than 38 billion collaboration minutes in a single day this quarter. Office 365 now has nearly 300 million paid seats. And organizations across the private and public sector like the City of Helsinki, Bausch Health, Stryker are increasingly choosing our premium offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice and analytics. People are turning to Windows PCs more than ever to stay connected, productive and secure. Windows 10 now has more than 1.3 billion monthly active devices, and Microsoft 365 consumer surpassed 50 million subscribers for the first time. 
Now on to security. The threat landscape has never been more complex or challenging and security has never been more critical to our customers. This is driving increased demand for our end-to-end capabilities across identity, security, compliance and management backed by cloud-scale AI and human expertise encompassing all clouds and all platforms. 
What differentiates us and drives customer value is the interconnection between identity, endpoint, apps, cloud, data and infrastructure across our cloud-native XDR and SIEM. All informed by our operational security posture, which analyzes more than 8 trillion signals each day. 
Our approach enables organizations to adopt a Zero Trust architecture while also reducing the complexity, cost and risk created by stitching together point solutions. That's why more than 400,000 customers use our offerings, including many of the world's most established firms like Boston Consulting Group, HCA Healthcare, Lowe's and UBS. And Signal is using Azure Confidential Computing to protect the data and use for its millions of customers. 
We are going further to help protect organizations. We are delivering on our ambition to eliminate passwords introducing password-less sign-in to Azure AD. Our Azure AD paid customer base has more than doubled year-over-year to over 300,000, new capabilities in Microsoft 365 Defender help organizations better understand, prevent and mitigate active threats. Defender has blocked 30 billion threats on e-mail and nearly 7 billion on endpoints over the past 12 months alone. And our compliance manager now offers more than 300 out-of-the-box assessments for regulations such as GDPR. 
Now on to gaming. We're expanding our opportunity as we help both gamers and creators play, connect and build across communities on any device. People are turning to Xbox more than ever to play and chat with friends, and we saw record engagement this quarter, led by the strength on and off console. 
With Game Pass, we are redefining how games are distributed, played and viewed. Just last week, we added cloud gaming via the browser expanding our reach across PC and mobile. Content is the flywheel behind the services growth. And upon the closing of our acquisition of ZeniMax Media this quarter, we made 20 of the world's most iconic and beloved games accessible via Game Pass with more to come. 
As games evolve into metaverse economies, we are building new tools to help anyone sell creations on our platform. Minecraft is nearly 140 million monthly active users, up 30% year-over-year, making it one of the leading platforms in the creator economy. Creators have generated over $350 million from more than 1 billion downloads of mods, add-ons and other experiences in Minecraft. This is not counting and including activity outside of our marketplace. We are also seeing a vibrant marketplace emerge in Flight Simulator with partners now able to sell content directly within the game. 
In closing, we're innovating across the entire tech stack as we differentiate and lead in areas that will be critical to the success of every customer going forward. I'm optimistic about our opportunity ahead. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Amy, who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining you for questions.",2366
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3557.0,2259950.0,87633312.0,Presenter Speech,Amy Hood,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today reflect the impact of the ZeniMax acquisition for approximately 3 weeks this quarter as well as our outlook. There is no impact from the Nuance acquisition that is expected to close by the end of the calendar year. Our third quarter revenue was $41.7 billion, up 19% and 16% in constant currency, and earnings per share was $1.95, and increased 39% and 34% in constant currency when adjusted for the tax benefit related to the recent India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes. 
Many trends across industries, customer segments and geographical markets continued to improve, which, coupled with strong execution by our sales and partner teams, drove another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth. In our Commercial business, accelerating digital transformation enabled by our unique Microsoft Cloud value, drove healthy demand for our hybrid and cloud offerings. Strong Azure consumption, increased platform commitments and higher usage of Teams, Power Platform and our security offerings were key beneficiaries. 
Within our small and medium business customer segment, continued improvement in cloud purchasing trends more than offset transactional licensing weakness. And in LinkedIn's Talent Solutions business, annual contracts and job postings improved with the job market. 
In our consumer business, Windows OEM and Microsoft 365 consumer subscriptions benefited from a much stronger-than-expected PC market despite significant ongoing constraints in the supply chain. 
Improvement in the advertising market again benefited our Search and LinkedIn businesses. And in gaming, we continue to see record engagement and strong monetization across our platform as well as demand that significantly exceeded supply for Xbox Series X and S consoles. 
Moving to our overall results. Commercial bookings growth was ahead of expectations, increasing 39% and 38% in constant currency on a growing expiration base and low prior year comparable. Growth was driven by consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions and an increase in the number of larger long-term Azure contracts. As a result, commercial remaining performance obligation increased 31% and 32% in constant currency to $117 billion, with a roughly equivalent split between the revenue that will be recognized within and the portion beyond the next 12 months. And our annuity mix increased 2 points year-over-year to 94%. 
Commercial cloud revenue also better than expected, grew 33% and 29% in constant currency to $17.7 billion. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage expanded 3 points year-over-year to 70%, driven by the change in accounting estimate for the useful life of server and network equipment assets. Excluding this impact, Commercial cloud gross margin percentage was up slightly with improvement in Azure gross margin, mostly offset by sales mix shift to Azure. 
With a weaker U.S. dollar, FX increased revenue growth by approximately 3 points, about 1 point more favorable than anticipated. FX increased COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 2 points, both in line with expectations. Gross margin dollars increased 19% and 16% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage was 69%, relatively unchanged year-over-year with roughly 1 point of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate noted earlier. 
Excluding this impact, company gross margin percentage was down, driven by strong revenue growth in cloud and gaming that resulted in sales mix shift. Operating expense increased 5% and 3% in constant currency, lower than anticipated, primarily driven by investments that shifted to future quarters. Overall, company headcount grew again this quarter, up 12% year-over-year, reflecting our focused investments across key areas like cloud engineering, sales and customer deployment. 
Year-over-year growth in operating expense includes roughly 2 points of impact from continued COVID-related savings. Operating income increased 31% and 27% in constant currency, and operating margins expanded 4 points year-over-year to 41%, including nearly 2 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate and roughly 1 point of favorable impact from COVID-related savings. 
Now to our segment results. Revenue from productivity and business processes was $13.6 billion and grew 15% and 12% in constant currency, primarily driven by Office 365 and LinkedIn. Office Commercial revenue grew 14% and 10% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue grew 22% and 19% in constant currency, again driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments as well as higher ARPU. 
Demand for our high-value security, compliance and voice offerings drove strong momentum in E5 again this quarter. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 15% year-over-year to nearly $300 million, with acceleration to the cloud in our small and medium business segment and a recovery in growth in our first-line worker offerings. The accelerated cloud adoption negatively impacted Office Commercial licensing, which declined 25% and 27% in constant currency, a bit below expectations. 
In Office Consumer, revenue grew 5% and 2% in constant currency, slightly below expectations, primarily due to transactional weakness in Japan. Microsoft 365 consumer subscriptions grew to $50.2 million, up 27% year-over-year. Dynamics revenue grew 26% and 22% in constant currency, better than expected, driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth accelerating to 45% and 40% in constant currency, with particular strength in Power apps in our finance and operations offering. 
LinkedIn revenue increased 25% and 23% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Our Marketing Solutions business accelerated again this quarter to 64% revenue growth. Segment gross margin dollars increased 15% and 12% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year-over-year with nearly 2 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. 
Operating expense increased 4% and 2% in constant currency, and operating income increased 26% and 20% in constant currency, including 4 points due to the change in accounting estimate. 
Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $15.1 billion, ahead of expectations, increasing 23% and 20% in constant currency. Server products and cloud services revenue increased 26% and 23% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Azure revenue grew 50% and 46% in constant currency, better than anticipated, driven by continued strength in our consumption-based business. 
And in our per user business, growth in our Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base accelerated again this quarter, up 30% to over 174 million seats. And on a strong prior year comparable, that benefited from the end of support for Windows Server 2008, our on-premise's server business increased 3% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency, with strong annuity performance, driven by continued customer preference for our hybrid and premium offerings. 
Enterprise Services revenue grew 10% and 8% in constant currency with better-than-expected performance in Microsoft Consulting Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 27% to 24% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased 2 points year-over-year with roughly 2 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. 
Operating expense increased 12% and 10% in constant currency and operating income grew 41% and 36% in constant currency with roughly 7 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. 
Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13 billion, increasing 19% and 16% in constant currency with better-than-expected performance in gaming, Windows OEM and Search. 
In Windows, the stronger PC market resulted in overall OEM revenue growth of 10%, driven by continued customer demand. OEM non-Pro revenue grew 44% and OEM Pro revenue declined 2% on a prior year comparable that included the end of support for Windows 7. Windows commercial products and cloud services grew 10% and 7% in constant currency with a lower-than-expected mix of in-quarter recognition from multiyear agreements. 
In Surface, revenue grew 12% and 7% in constant currency, lower than expected, primarily due to execution challenges in the commercial segment. Search revenue ex TAC increased 17% and 14% in constant currency, benefiting from the improved advertising market noted earlier. 
And in gaming, revenue increased 50% and 48% in constant currency. Xbox hardware revenue grew 232% and 223% in constant currency, driven by our new consoles. Xbox content and services revenue, which now includes ZeniMax grew 34% and 32% in constant currency with better-than-expected performance of first-party titles, particularly Minecraft. 
Segment gross margin dollars increased 14% and 11% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage decreased 2 points year-over-year, driven by sales mix shift to gaming. Operating expense decreased 3% and 4% in constant currency and operating income grew 27% and 22% in constant currency. 
Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $6 billion, in line with expectations, driven by ongoing investment to support growing global demand from increased customer usage of our cloud services. Cash paid for P, P and E was $5.1 billion. Cash flow from operations was $22.2 billion and increased 27% year-over-year, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. 
Free cash flow was $17.1 billion, up 24%. Other income and expense was $188 million, higher than anticipated, primarily driven by net gains on investments. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was approximately 14%. And finally, we returned $10 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Now let's move to the outlook. As a reminder, in Q4, we begin to see growth rates that reflect the first full quarter impact of COVID-19 a year ago, both across revenue and operating expenses. Last year, across Windows OEM, Gaming and Surface, we saw surges in purchasing and usage that will negatively impact Q4 growth rates. In our Search and LinkedIn businesses, Q4 growth rates will be positively impacted given the advertising and job markets a year ago. 
And in our transactional business, the slowdown in purchasing in Office and Server last year will benefit Q4 growth rates, particularly in our small and medium business segment. Next, in our largest quarter of the year, we expect the accelerating trends Satya discussed, our differentiated market position and continued solid execution to results in another strong quarter. 
Growth in commercial bookings should again be healthy, but impacted by a declining expiry base. As always, an increasing mix of larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing can drive quarterly volatility in bookings. 
Commercial cloud gross margin percentage should increase roughly 4 points year-over-year with less than 2 points from the change in accounting estimate. As a reminder, the favorable impact continues to lessen over time. Excluding the accounting change, Q4 gross margin percentage will also benefit a bit from investments we made a year ago to support increased usage needs in remote work scenarios. 
Longer term, commercial cloud gross margin percentage will continue to be impacted by revenue mix shift to Azure, increased usage of our productivity and collab solutions and ongoing strategic investments to support our customers' success. 
In capital expenditures, we expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis as we continue to invest to meet growing global demand for our cloud services. 
Now to FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total company Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud revenue growth by approximately 3 points, More Personal Computing revenue and total operating expense growth by approximately 2 points and COGS growth by approximately 1 point. 
Next, to our segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $13.8 billion and $14.05 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with healthy seat growth and upsell opportunity to E5. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the high teens, consistent with the ongoing customer shift to the cloud. 
In Office consumer, we expect mid- to high teens revenue growth, driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 consumer subscriptions against the low prior year comparable impacted by the transactional purchasing weakness noted earlier. 
In LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid-30% range, driven by continued strong engagement on the platform and improvements in the advertising and job markets. And in Dynamics, continued momentum in Dynamics 365 will drive revenue growth similar to last quarter. 
For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $16.2 billion and $16.45 billion. In Azure, revenue will again be driven by strong growth in our consumption-based business. And our per user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect some moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base. 
In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits, driven by continued demand for our hybrid and premium annuity offerings against a low prior year comparable and the transactional purchasing noted earlier. And in Enterprise Services, revenue growth should be roughly in line with last quarter. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $13.6 billion and $14 billion. 
In Windows, overall revenue should grow mid-single digits driven by Windows Commercial products and cloud services growth and continued demand for PCs, partially offset by ongoing supply chain impacts and the comparable noted earlier. In Surface on a strong prior year comparable, we expect revenue to decline in the mid-teens as we work through the supply chain and executing challenges noted earlier. 
In Search ex TAC, we expect revenue growth in the mid-40s driven by improvements in the advertising market. In Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits. Significant demand for the Xbox Series X and S will continue to be constrained by supply. And on the strong prior year comparable, we expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the mid- to high single digits. 
Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of $13.7 billion to $13.9 billion and operating expense of $13.1 billion to $13.2 billion. As a reminder, in operating expense in Q4, we will benefit from continued COVID-related savings as well as the prior year comparable, which included roughly 4 points of impact from a $450 million charge related to the realignment of our retail store strategy. In other income and expense, interest income and expense should offset each other. And finally, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 16%. 
Now I'd like to share some closing thoughts as we look to next fiscal year. Overall, we have performed well through 3 quarters of our fiscal year in a challenging environment, and we fully expect a strong Q4 to lay the foundation for FY '22. We will, of course, continue to focus on delivering strong revenue growth in the short term. But even more importantly, this year has reinforced the critical importance of investing boldly to capture the significant list of opportunities ahead of us. Excellence in daily execution, coupled with a thoughtful vision for the future that creates value as well as opportunity for our customers globally will lead to long-term revenue and profit growth. 
With that, Brett, let's go to Q&A.",2437

I guess this is a question both for Satya and Amy. We're seeing these really great commercial bookings results come through, 39% growth in the current quarter. And Satya, you've been talking to us a lot about these more strategic deals and the acceleration of digital transformation. Can you give us a little bit of color of what comes in these more strategic deals? How does it change the dynamics of what types of solutions people are using for Microsoft, the scope of sort of how deeply you're getting into these customers and sort of how much of the IT budget you're getting. 
And then maybe talk to us a little bit about the time frame for which this comes into revenues. What should our expectation be when you get one of these big strategic deals? How long does it take to really ramp up this customer onto the broader Microsoft platform?",155
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3557.0,2259950.0,87633316.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,7,"Thank you, Keith, for the question. I think we feel very good, both, I would say, of consumption and usage today as well as, as you mentioned, the bookings because both of those at any given point in time is what we look at. The overall approach to the Microsoft Cloud, if you look at the breadth of what any customer may be doing with us, they may be doing hybrid cloud infrastructure with us. They may be for the first time, doing Tier 1 workloads on the cloud with us, right, whether it's in core financials or in retail or in health care. 
Also, they could be deploying their centers of excellence around Power Platform. And Power Platform sits at the intersection of pretty much Dynamics, Azure and Teams, for example. And of course, we're seeing the growth of Teams, and Teams as I've always maintained is not just about one thing. It's not about just meetings or it's not about just chat. But most importantly, it's a platform that drives, in fact, line of business and business application termination inside of a collaboration workflow. 
And so that's what we're seeing. And then the other thing I would say that we are now seeing is also that industry level differentiation of the all-up Microsoft cloud. So whether it's in retail, whether it's in health care or in financial services, we feel that we now can bring the power of the entire cloud together in a much more strategic way.",250
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3557.0,2259950.0,87633317.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,8,"And maybe just to build on what Satya was saying, Keith, If you think about bookings or the remaining performance obligation, what I tend to think of is when you hear those words, I think often we pivot toward these Azure contracts we talk a lot about because they create some volatility. 
But really, the foundation for these long-term strategic contracts is the Microsoft Cloud holistically. So what you'll see is not just Office 365, but the suite of Microsoft 365. You'll see higher-level additions of security or compliance workloads. You'll see Dynamics 365 as a pillar with Power Platform. Because they're spanning end-to-end industry solutions to combine it back to what Satya is saying. 
So you see it add a good bookings number, which is fundamentally about do you renew what's up for renewal, do you add workloads, do you add users, and do you -- and does it have a component of an Azure commitment. All of those things together are what creates this change. And if you look at remaining performance obligation, you see there a good bit of it that's going to be recognized in the next 12 months and another equally balanced portion that's beyond that. 
So it's not all long term. This transition happens quickly, usage builds, it's both per user, it's also for workload and it's consumptive based. So it's really a more holistic view that I would have people take as opposed to thinking about an Azure contract as long dated.",249

21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3557.0,2259950.0,87633321.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,12,"Sure, Brent. Thanks for the question. When I look at the industry cloud opportunities, we think of health care is a very critical opportunity for us and a huge and expansive addressable market. If you think about as a percentage of GDP, obviously, health care is significant. And fundamentally, when I think about the provider market, in particular, digital tech is going to play a huge role for every provider to do the things that they care the most about, which is improve the patient outcomes and reduce cost and reduce the burden on the physicians. 
So that's where the Nuance acquisition is a great fit for us. We've been partnered with them. It also enhances our  platform approach, Brent. What we have always done has gone into an industry with a platform and an ecosystem approach. For example, with Nuance, they've done a fantastic job of taking what's perhaps the most defining technology of our times, which is AI and applying it to health care, which is the most important application space. And they've done that again by really partnering, partnering deeply with EMR systems and the rest of the health care ecosystem, ultimately to benefit the providers. 
And so we're really looking forward to that acquisition closing, and we're already partnered with them in our cloud. But this allows us to take that and integrate more deeply with what we're doing with Teams and some of our AI capabilities even more deeply, and we think we can add a significant amount of value, both to our partners in the health care ecosystem as well as most importantly, to the providers.",272

I'd like to change gear a little bit and drill in a bit on the Dynamics 365 business. Frankly, were this part of any other company or even a stand-alone business, it would be such a center of enthusiasm by investors given how fast it's grown. 
Satya, when you said Dynamics 365 is taking share from competitors, are you talking about ERP or CRM or is it both? Or is it something different? And what are the key drivers of that strength and growth? And how sustainable do you believe that is?",105
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3557.0,2259950.0,87633325.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,16,"Thanks so much for the question, Mark. And first of all, we're very, very excited about what's happening again with Dynamics 365. And when you ask where is the share coming and where is the growth coming? It's coming from all those categories. But the most interesting thing is, as somebody wants to deploy even an omnichannel solution, for example, in a world where what's physical and what is digital need to come together unlike anything before because the pandemic is bringing about such structural change. You need both that federated inventory management distributed inventory management system I referenced in my remarks, and you need the customer insights product that is probably one of the fastest-growing modules, which is that 360-degree view on customers and customer engagement, and then including the supply chain. 
So bottom line is that every customer is looking to digitize and bring together the data silos, in fact, silos of CRM and ERP systems. And that's probably one of the most interesting things we have observed is it's not about replacing even an existing ERP or an existing CRM, it's not buying Dynamics and helping them bridge even some of the disparate CRM and ERP systems they may have. 
So we do see this as a huge opportunity as the world modernizes and puts in a complete next-generation, more proactive versus reactive business systems, and that's what Dynamics has been architected for. So I feel like coming out of this pandemic and the architecture and all the hard work that team has done over the multiple years now positions us very well.",266

Amy, the OpEx growth has been extraordinarily low the last several quarters. The growth rate looks like it's going to inch up a little bit in the June quarter. But you mentioned the investments are shifting to future quarters. You probably don't want to give too much on fiscal '22. But I'm just wondering whether we should extrapolate that into thinking that OpEx growth in fiscal '22 should get back to the pre-COVID levels of plus 10%. And if you don't want to be that specific, maybe you could just help us outline some of the variables we should keep in mind as we model that line item post COVID recovery in fiscal '22?",119
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3557.0,2259950.0,87633329.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,20,"Thanks, Karl. And I do think in Q4, and it's why I specifically called out the 4 points of impact from a year ago because it does start to get to a more normalized rate in Q4. And I say that because our headcount growth, which I noted earlier, has been 12%. 
And so overall, you would expect OpEx growth to at least marry your headcount growth over any period of time, and we've certainly benefited through the year from COVID-related savings. We'll continue to have that in Q4. And as we get to '22, I would expect to see a little less of that as people get back to the workplace at some level and resume some other normal levels of activity. And so I do think you're heading in the right direction on that. 
And  listen, I think that type of growth with the type of opportunity we're seeing, the number of TAM expansive opportunities really Satya went through in his comments, where we feel like we've got a unique position and opportunity to take share. I feel pretty confident in being able to certainly land that OpEx growth number.",192

So when we think about OpEx, it's not about adding OpEx to the stuff that we had in the past. It's -- there's leverage there. In fact, it's OpEx going into new TAMs.",85

But just the kind of feedback you're getting on that product? And how do you see that sort of fitting in? There seem to be some nice adjacencies with Dynamics, with Office 365. So I was just kind of curious if you could give us a little bit of a hand on how it's going and sort of your excitement level about it over the next quarter, next couple of years?",97

It's a lot. It's very much a great example of what I was saying in terms of creating a new category, right. When I look back multiple years now, we started talking about Power Platform. And as I said, even in my script today, we now have a full suite of tools that essentially created this next-generation business process automation and productivity suite in Power Platform that set scale and growing at scale. 
Similarly, we think of the experience cloud as a distinct cloud opportunity for us. It brings together even today, what have been disparate tools, whether it's the knowledge mining and management systems in an enterprise, connecting it to learnings and ultimately the employee experience and communication system. So we -- it obviously is a very massive adjacencies to what we're doing with Microsoft 365 and Office 365, in particular, Teams. 
But also, to your point, connects up with line of business systems, HRM systems and all of the other things we do in Dynamics as well as other third-party SaaS applications. So It's very early days. And so we'll take the same approach we have taken, whether it's in Security, whether it's in Power Platform, whether it's Dynamics, and many other places where you've seen us grow substantial new businesses essentially as part of Microsoft Cloud. But we're very excited about what this opportunity represents.",235

Satya, I know you've said that you expect tech as a percentage of GDP, to track about 5% or roughly double over the next 10 years or so. How should we think about Microsoft's share in that context? Is it going to be steady? Or do you see that expanding? And if it is going to expand, what are the key products and markets that will drive your relative share growth as you outperform tech and as tech outperforms GDP.",84
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3557.0,2259950.0,87633338.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,29,"No, thanks, Kash, for the question. I think that first of all, we are big believers in two things. One is we need to be competitive in each layer, and then the coming together of each layer into a cohesive, coherent architecture of the full stack or the Microsoft cloud creates that differentiation. And that will define what we think is going to be increasing share for us as tech itself as a percentage of GDP doubles. 
So if you look at it -- whether it's on the hybrid infrastructure or the multi-cloud, multi-edge world, which, I believe, is going to be the world 10 years from now, we are very well positioned. We have led in it, we currently lead in it, and we plan to continue that. 
When it comes to data, when I look at even what we've been able to do with Synapse even in the just last year and what that can do both at the cloud and the edge. When it comes to AI, what we are doing with OpenAI and our cognitive services or what we're doing with Power Platform. 
Developer SaaS, one of the most exciting things, again, that I believe is the next 10 years is going to be about developers and the digital capability in every enterprise, and we are the leaders there. When you think about VS Code as well as GitHub. And then, of course, all of the things that we're doing with Microsoft 365 and Dynamics on the industry side. 
So ultimately, we don't take anything for granted. But that said, We're well positioned for what is expansive TAM and with competitive differentiation both in the individual layers of the stack as well as the cohesiveness of the stack itself.",293

And are there other verticals that may make sense to more actively pursue over time as well?",53
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3557.0,2259950.0,87633343.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,34,"Thank you for the question. We absolutely think that ultimately, customers are looking to increase their time to value, lower cost and improve agility. So being able to customize these workflows, to come up with industry schemers. Because when you think about increased digitization and workflow automation, it does take that next level of schematization of what is perhaps today not digital inside an industry. And so therefore, what we do by stitching together, coming together of even Microsoft 365, Teams, Power Platform with certain workflows with data inside of Azure as well as Dynamics, that absolutely improves the ability for any customer in any one of these industries to improve their time to value. 
So yes, it is going to both help us with adoption rates increase, the speed with which it increases and it also differentiates us. And we'll continue to look. And one of the other things that we're doing, this is not just one industry at a time, it's also the cross-industry workflows. So we absolutely believe that that we already talk about not just any individual part of our cloud, we talk about only one thing, it's called the Microsoft Cloud. And now we're increasingly talking about Microsoft Cloud by industry and cross industry.",209

Can you talk a little bit about what you see in terms of customers realizing the broadened offering from Microsoft and how the cloud is playing a changing role there?",69
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3557.0,2259950.0,87633347.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,38,"No. Thank you for the question. Obviously, security is a super important topic for every customer, every board, every executive team. And the fundamental approach we have is how do we ensure that every customer has implemented a Zero Trust architecture. But that's the name of the game, which is how can Microsoft through our participation in the security industry, accelerate essentially the cyber defense of the entire digital sector and beyond. 
And so to me, what we have done is taken a pretty unique approach of bringing identity, endpoint application, infrastructure all together with XDR and SIEM, which is cloud native. That's pretty unique because we really don't let the SIEMs get in the way. We'll make sure that any customer who is able to sort of deploy these systems together has most defense in depth, but also the aggregate data to be able to detect and respond to any intrusion because that's sort of the key posture. 
And then you couple that with our operational security posture when you're processing 8 trillion events and using that to continuously help our customers is increasing to your point, the cloud adoption rate. So if you look at some of the challenges like the HAFNIUM, cloud was not impacted. And when we did sort of a lot of work to make sure that the patches were out even for servers that were out of support for multiple years. 
And so -- but at the same time, any business that was -- had moved already to the cloud had none of those issues. So therefore, I think we are going to see increased cloud adoption. We're going to see increased usage of end-to-end security suites like what we offer. And most importantly, great hygiene and great operational security posture all the time with Zero Trust architecture.",304

On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Alice Jolla, Chief Accounting Officer; and Keith Dolliver, Deputy General Counsel. 
On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to the non-GAAP metrics on the call. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's fourth quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. 
All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where the growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only. 
We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website. 
During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.

We had a very strong close to our fiscal year. Our commercial cloud surpassed $69 billion in annual revenue, up 34%. We're seeing revenue growth across industries, customer segments and geographies, with over 50% of sales coming from outside the United States. We continue to grow new franchises for Microsoft in large and growing markets. In the past 3 years alone, gaming, security and now LinkedIn have all surpassed $10 billion in annual revenue. 
Now I'll highlight our innovation and our expanding opportunity across the tech stack, starting with infrastructure. Moving forward, every organization will need more ubiquitous and decentralized computing. We're the only cloud provider with the capabilities to support every organization's multi-cloud hybrid and edge needs. Over the past year, we have added new data center regions in 15 countries across 5 continents, delivering faster access to cloud services and addressing data residency requirements. And now we're taking cloud compute to the edge with 5G deployments. Our new Azure Edge services help operators and enterprises deliver ultra-low latency compute fabric. And we're also helping operators run their networks in the cloud. AT&T chose Azure to power its 5G core network, making it the first Tier 1 operator to move its existing customer traffic to the public cloud. 
We're also expanding our opportunity in hybrid. Today, over 75% of the Fortune 500 use our hybrid offerings. Azure Arc extends the Azure control plane across on-premise, multi-cloud and the edge. With Arc, customers like EY and Telstra can manage their Kubernetes deployments anywhere and deploy Azure SQL databases and run Azure application services on any infrastructure. As the digital and physical worlds converge, we are leading in a new layer of the infrastructure stack, the enterprise metaverse. 
AB InBev is using our solutions, including Azure Digital Twins and Azure IoT, to optimize operations from the barley field to the warehouse to distribution. Customers also continue to choose our infrastructure to run mission-critical SAP solutions. Thousands of enterprises have migrated their ERP workloads to Azure, including Campbell Soup, L'Oreal, Mondelez International, ServiceNow and even SAP. All this innovation is driving larger and more strategic Azure commitments from industry leaders, including Maz in consumer goods, Morgan Stanley in financial services and NEC in IT. 
Now on to data. Data is the most strategic asset for every business. We're the only cloud provider that helps organizations build sovereignty over their data by bringing together hyperscale, OLTP, analytics and governance workloads. Cosmos DB has become the go-to database, powering the world's most demanding mission-critical workloads. New capabilities help organizations like Albertsons, ASOS, DHL, LaLiga, Maersk, Swiss Re optimize cost and boost performance. Walmart is using Cosmos DB to handle billions of online requests daily and to ensure millions of customers receive the items they want when they need them. 
Azure Synapse brings together data integration, big data and data warehouses into a single service. From ABN AMRO in finance and AmerisourceBergen in pharma to Walgreens in retail and WPP in advertising, organizations are using Synapse to generate insights from massive amounts of structured and unstructured data. Queries performed using Synapse increased 146% over the last quarter alone. 
Now on to developers. GitHub is used by 72% of the Fortune 50 to build, ship and maintain software. Organizations like Ford, NASA and Shopify are using new project planning capabilities to help developers better manage projects directly within their workflow. And Epic Games, Motorola Solutions and Volkswagen Software Group all chose GitHub Advanced Security this quarter to help secure their code.
We're also leading in enterprise AI. Our new Azure Applied AI Services help organizations like Dow, Lufthansa and Samsung apply AI to common business scenarios. And live captions in Twitter Spaces are being powered by our speech services. Finally, we are bringing the power of our partnership with OpenAI to both professional developers and domain experts. With GitHub Copilot, professional developers can write code faster with less work and using the world's most powerful language model, GPT-3, domain experts can build apps using natural language with Power Platform. 
Power Platform has become the leading business process automation and productivity suite for domain experts across all functions. Power BI is the leader in business intelligence in the cloud. Organizations in every industry, including Bayer, Cerner, Rolls-Royce are choosing the platform to foster a data-driven culture. The number of organizations using Power Apps has more than doubled year-over-year. BASF chose Power Apps to give 122,000 employees the capability to build low-code/no-code apps. And the Toyota Fusion teams of pro developers and domain experts are using Power Apps and Azure Pass services to improve quality control. All up, Power Platform revenue increased 83% over the past year. 
And now on to Dynamics 365. Every business function, including marketing, sales, customer support and supply chain will need to be reimagined for an AI-first and collaboration-first world. And the silos between communications, collaboration and business process have to be broken down. With Dynamics 365, we are building a new generation of business applications to help organizations adapt to this new reality. We continue to gain share. Dynamics 365 revenue accelerated for the third consecutive quarter, up 49% year-over-year. We are helping businesses to become digitally sovereign over their customer interactions with our Customer Insights product with organizations like Columbia Sportswear, GNC and LA Clippers all choosing to unify customer profiles and deliver more personalized experiences. 
We are empowering employees for hybrid work by creating a new category of collaborative applications, bringing business process directly into the flow of work. New integrations between Dynamics 365 and Teams enable anyone in an organization to seamlessly view and collaborate on customer records within Teams without having to purchase multiple licenses. Customers want this and no other vendor is doing this today. And we are helping organizations reimagine their core business process with new apps built for an age of omnichannel communications. With Dynamics 365, customer service organizations like Coca-Cola, Renault and Xiaomi have a single comprehensive solution to deliver consistent and personalized support across all channels. 
Now on to industry solutions. Over the past year, we have introduced industry clouds for financial services, health care, manufacturing, nonprofits and retail. And this quarter, we announced our new Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability, bringing together capabilities across our stack to create an entirely new business process category to help every organization address this very urgent need. 
Now on to LinkedIn. LinkedIn's revenue surpassed $10 billion for the first time this fiscal year, up 27%, a testament to how mission-critical the platform has become to help people connect, learn, grow and get hired over the course of their careers. In the past 5 years since our acquisition, revenue has nearly tripled and growth has accelerated. LinkedIn has become a leader across multiple secular growth areas spanning B2B advertising, professional hiring, corporate learning and sales intelligence. 
And from LinkedIn Profiles within Office to LinkedIn Learning courses within Microsoft Viva and LinkedIn Sales Navigator leads within Microsoft Dynamics 365, we have brought together the power of LinkedIn and Microsoft to transform how people learn, sell and connect. LinkedIn has more than 774 million members who are more engaged than ever. Sessions were up 30% this quarter compared to a year ago. And LinkedIn's advertising business surpassed $1 billion in revenue this quarter for the first time, up 97% year-over-year, growing 3x faster than the category. 
Now to Microsoft 365 and Teams. Hybrid work represents the biggest change to the way we work in a generation and will require a new operating model spanning people, places and processes. We're the only cloud that supports everything an organization needs to successfully make the shift. Microsoft Teams is the new front end. It's where people meet, chat, call, collaborate and automate business processes all within the flow of work. 
Teams usage has never been higher. We are nearly 250 million monthly active users as people use Teams each day to communicate, collaborate and call out their content across work, life and learning. We are leading in the new and growing enterprise phone category. Just like video meetings, chat and business processes happen in Teams, calls happen in Teams, creating a huge new opportunity. We have nearly 80 million monthly active Teams phone users, with total calls surpassing 1 billion in a single month this quarter and we're just getting started. 
Teams is also at the center of orchestrating collaboration across the entire SaaS estate, from HR to marketing to finance. Leading third-party SaaS vendors, including Adobe, Atlassian, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow and Workday have now built apps that deeply integrate with Teams, bringing every business process and function directly into the flow of work. And we are bringing Teams to consumers so people can connect and collaborate with family and friends across desktop, mobile and the web. 
All this innovation is driving growth. 124 organizations now have more than 100,000 users of Teams, and nearly 3,000 have more than 10,000 users. More broadly, across Microsoft 365, we are seeing double-digit year-over-year seat growth in every segment, from frontline and small business to enterprise. Leading companies like Bayer, Siemens, Vodafone all chose our premium [ EFI ] offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice and analytics. 
Now on to employee experience cloud. Having a digital employee experience platform is critical for every organization. With Microsoft Viva, we are creating an entirely new category, bringing together communications, learning, well-being and knowledge directly into the flow of work. New capabilities empower leaders to build human capital, nurture well-being and focus on employee results. We are seeing strong interest and early adoption in every industry from American Express and Barclays to AT&T and Mars. Humana chose Viva to help 26,000 employees make the shift to hybrid work, gaining insights on everything from collaboration trends to manager effectiveness. 
Now on to Windows. Windows 11 is the biggest update to our operating system in a decade. We are reimagining everything from the Windows platform to the Store to help people and organizations be more productive and secure and build a more open ecosystem for developers and creators. We are delighted by early feedback. More people have downloaded our early builds than any other Windows release or update in the history of our Insider Program. And along with our OEM ecosystem, we are excited to bring Windows 11 to new PCs beginning this holiday. 
And with Windows 365, we are creating a new category, the Cloud PC. Just like applications move to the cloud with SaaS, we are now bringing the operating system to the cloud, enabling organizations to stream the full Windows experience to any employee's personal or corporate device. 
Now on to security. With the cybersecurity landscape more complex than ever, it's never been clearer that every organization will need to deploy and maintain a zero trust security architecture. This is driving accelerated demand for our integrated end-to-end solutions spanning identity, security, compliance and device management across all clouds and all platforms. 
No other vendor is recognized by analysts as the leader in as many categories. This is reflected in our share gains with nearly 600,000 organizations, including FedEx, Nestlé, NTT and Volkswagen using our security offerings across Azure and Microsoft 365. We saw a 70% increase in the number of small and medium business customers. And it's reflected in our sales growth, with annual revenue continuing to increase 40% year-over-year. We're going further to protect organizations and our recent acquisitions of CloudKnox, ReFirm Labs and RiskIQ bolster our security capabilities in key areas, including identity management, IoT and threat intelligence. 
Now on to gaming. Gaming is the largest category in the entertainment industry, and we are expanding our opportunity to reach the world's 3 billion gamers wherever and whenever they play. We are all in on games. At E3 last month, we unveiled our biggest games lineup ever, announcing 27 new titles which will all be available to Game Pass subscribers. Game Pass is growing rapidly and it's transforming how people discover, connect and play games. Subscribers play approximately 40% more games and spend 50% more than nonmembers. 
We continue to lead in the fast-growing cloud gaming market with last month -- just last month, we made Xbox Cloud Gaming available on PCs as well as Apple phones and tablets via the browser in 22 countries with more to come. Millions have already streamed games to their desktops, tablets and phones. And the Xbox Series S and X are our fastest-selling consoles ever, with more consoles sold live to date than any previous generation. 
Finally, we continue to grow our opportunity in the creator economy, adding new ways for players to build and monetize their creations in many of our most popular games, including Flight Simulator and Minecraft. Creators earned more than double what they did a year ago across our titles. 
In closing, going forward, every person and every organization will require more digital technology to be more resilient and to transform. We are innovating across the entire tech stack to ensure our customers succeed in this new era. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Amy.",2183
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3626.0,2357429.0,90106858.0,Presenter Speech,Amy Hood,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $46.2 billion, up 21% and 17% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.17, increasing 49% and 42% in constant currency. In our largest quarter of the year, focused execution by our sales and partner teams, along with broad-based strength across geographical markets and customer segments, drove another very strong quarter of tough and bottom line growth. 
In our Commercial business, healthy demand for our differentiated hybrid and cloud offerings as well as increased long-term commitments to our platform drove significant growth in the number of $10 million-plus Azure and Microsoft 365 contracts. Customer reliance on the Microsoft Cloud drove sequential increases in usage across Teams, Power Platform and our Advanced Security and identity offerings, which are empowering organizations to shift to hybrid work and modernize business processes. 
And in LinkedIn's Talent Solutions business, an improving job market drove strength in annual contracts and job postings. In our on-premises business, strong annuity performance across Office, Server and Windows also benefited from a greater mix of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition under ASC 606. 
In our Consumer business, Windows OEM and Surface were impacted by the ongoing constraints in the supply chain. Search and LinkedIn benefited from an improved advertising market. And in Gaming, we again saw strong engagement across our platform while demand for Xbox Series X and S consoles continued to exceed supply.
As a reminder, Q4 was the first full quarter impacted by COVID-19 a year ago across revenue and operating expense. This quarter, even with a declining exploration base, Commercial bookings grew 30% and 25% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions and an increase in the number of larger long-term Azure contracts. As a result, Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 32% and 31% in constant currency to $141 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 25% year-over-year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 38% year-over-year, highlighting the growing long-term commitment to our Microsoft Cloud. And our annuity mix increased 1 point year-over-year to 95%. 
Commercial cloud revenue, also better than expected, was $19.5 billion as growth accelerated to 36% and 31% in constant currency. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage expanded 4 points year-over-year to 70%, with roughly 1 point from the change in accounting estimate for the useful life of server and network equipment assets. Excluding this impact, commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased despite revenue mix shift to Azure driven by improvement across all our cloud services on a prior year comparable impacted by strategic investments we made to support significant customer engagement and usage in remote work scenarios, including free trials, flexible financing options and capacity for cloud infrastructure usage. 
With the weaker U.S. dollar, FX increased growth by approximately 4 points, about 1 point more favorable than anticipated. FX increased COGS growth by approximately 1 point and operating expense growth by approximately 2 points, both in line with expectations. Gross margin dollars increased 25% and 20% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage was 70%, up 2 points year-over-year, with roughly 1 point of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Excluding this impact, company gross margin percentage increased despite sales mix shift to the cloud driven by commercial cloud gross margin percentage improvement noted earlier. 
Operating expense grew 6% and 4% in constant currency, in line with expectations on a prior year comparable that included roughly 4 points of impact from the realignment of our retail store strategy and 2 points of impact from an increase in bad debt expense. Overall, company headcount grew again this quarter, up 12% year-over-year as we continue to invest across key areas like cloud engineering, sales and customer deployment. 
Operating income increased 42% and 35% in constant currency, and operating margins expanded 6 points year-over-year to 41%, including roughly 2 points of impact from the retail stores charge and increase in bad debt expense in the prior year and nearly 1 point of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. 
Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $14.7 billion and grew 25% and 21% in constant currency with better-than-expected performance across all businesses. Office Commercial revenue grew 20% and 15% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue grew 25% and 20% in constant currency, again driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments as well as higher ARPU. Paid Office 365 Commercial seats increased 17% year-over-year, with continued recovery driving acceleration in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. 
Demand for Microsoft 365, particularly for security, compliance and voice drove strong E5 momentum again this quarter. E5 now accounts for 8% of our Office 365 Commercial installed base. And on a low prior year comparable impacted by a slowdown in transactional purchasing, Office Commercial licensing was ahead of expectations, down 8% and 11% in constant currency, also benefiting from higher in-period revenue recognition noted earlier. 
In Office Consumer, revenue grew 18% and 15% in constant currency driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew to 51.9 million, up 22% year-over-year. Dynamics revenue grew 33% and 26% in constant currency, better than expected. Dynamics 365 revenue growth was 49% and 42% in constant currency with strong momentum in Power Apps and Power Automate, reflecting growing demand for our modern solutions to build apps and automate workflows. Dynamics 365 now accounts for over 70% of total Dynamics revenue. 
LinkedIn revenue increased 46% and 42% in constant currency, ahead of expectations against the comparable impacted by the advertising and job markets of a year ago. Segment gross margin dollars increased 33% and 27% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage was up 5 points year-over-year, primarily driven by improvement in our cloud services against a low prior year comparable impacted mostly by increased usage. The change in accounting estimate drove roughly 1 point of favorable impact. Operating expense increased 8% and 6% in constant currency, and operating income increased 62% and 53% in constant currency, including 4 points due to the change in accounting estimate. 
Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $17.4 billion, increasing 30% and 26% in constant currency. We exceeded expectations across our consumption and per-user Azure businesses as well as in our on-premises server products business. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 34% and 29% in constant currency. Azure revenue grew 51% and 45% in constant currency driven by strong performance across our core and premium consumption-based services. 
In our per user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base increased 29% to over 190 million seats. Our on-premise server business increased 16% and 12% in constant currency driven by strong annuity performance and benefiting roughly 4 points from the higher in-period revenue recognition noted earlier, particularly in some of our largest deals in the quarter. 
Enterprise Services revenue grew 12% and 9% in constant currency, driven by growth in premier support services and Microsoft consulting services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 32% and 27% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased 1 point year-over-year with roughly 1 point of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Operating expense increased 14% and 12% in constant currency, and operating income grew 46% and 39% in constant currency, including 3 points due to the change in accounting estimate. 
Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.1 billion, increasing 9% and 6% in constant currency, with better-than-expected performance in Windows Commercial, Gaming and Search offsetting OEM and Surface weakness from supply chain constraints. OEM revenue declined 3% and Surface declined 20% and 23% in constant currency as both were impacted by the significant supply chain constraints noted earlier in a good demand environment. 
Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 20% and 14% in constant currency driven by demand for Microsoft 365, with some benefit from the higher in-period revenue recognition noted earlier. Search revenue ex TAC increased 53% and 49% in constant currency, benefiting from the improved advertising market. And in Gaming, revenue increased 11% and 7% in constant currency. Xbox hardware revenue grew 172% and 163% in constant currency driven by demand for our new consoles. 
Xbox content and services revenue declined 4% and 7% in constant currency against a high prior year comparable. Segment gross margin dollars increased 8% and 4% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point year-over-year driven by sales mix shift to gaming hardware. Operating expense decreased 6% and 7% in constant currency, including approximately 13 points of impact from the retail stores charge in the prior year. And operating income grew 19% and 13% in constant currency. 
Now back to our total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $7.3 billion, in line with expectations, driven by ongoing investment to support growing global demand and usage of our cloud services. Cash paid for PP&E was $6.5 billion. Cash flow from operations was $22.7 billion, increasing 22% year-over-year, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. 
Free cash flow was $16.3 billion, up 17%, reflecting higher capital expenditures in support of our growing cloud business. For FY '21, we generated over $76 billion in operating cash flow, up 26% year-over-year, and over $56 billion in free cash flow, up 24% year-over-year. This quarter, other income and expense was $310 million, higher than anticipated, primarily driven by net gains on investments. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio. Our effective tax rate was approximately 15%. And finally, we returned $10.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, bringing our total cash returned to shareholders to over $39 billion for the full fiscal year. 
Now before we turn to our outlook, I'd like to provide a few reminders for next fiscal year. Revenue growth rates across all segments will reflect the impact from COVID-19 a year ago, though the impacts do shift as we move through the year. Also, our FY '21 operating income and margin benefited from 2 factors that will be headwinds in FY '22. First, the change in accounting estimate for the useful life of server and network equipment resulted in $2.7 billion of depreciation expense, shifting from FY '21 to future periods. And second, we saved nearly $1.2 billion in operating expense from COVID-19-related restrictions, which will also moderate in FY '22 as geographies reopen globally. 
With those reminders in place, let's move to our next quarter outlook. Accelerating digital transformation and consistent strong execution should drive another quarter of growing commitment to our Microsoft Cloud. In Commercial bookings, our core annuity sales motions should drive healthy growth on a growing expiry base even against a strong prior year comparable. As always, quarterly volatility in bookings can be driven by an increasing mix of larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing. 
Commercial cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 1 point year-over-year, with roughly 4 points of negative impact from the change in accounting estimate previously discussed. Excluding the accounting change, Q1 gross margin percentage will increase despite revenue mix shift to Azure driven by continued improvement across our cloud services on a prior year comparable impacted by the strategic investments we mentioned earlier. Longer term, which excludes the impact of the accounting change, Commercial cloud gross margin percentage will continue to be impacted by the same 3 things we often discuss: revenue mix shift to Azure, increased usage of our cloud services and ongoing strategic investments to support our customers' success. In capital expenditures, we expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis as we continue to invest to meet global demand for our cloud services. 
Now to FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase revenue growth of the total company and all individual segment levels by approximately 2 points and total operating expense and COGS growth by approximately 1 point. 
Now to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $14.5 billion and $14.75 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with healthy seat growth across segments and continued momentum in E5. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline approximately 20%, consistent with the ongoing customer shift to the cloud. In Office Consumer, against a strong prior year comparable, we expect high single-digit revenue growth with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 consumer subscriptions. 
For LinkedIn, continued strong engagement on the platform and improvements in the advertising and job markets should drive revenue growth in the high-30% range. And in Dynamics, we expect continued strength in Dynamics 365, which includes our significant momentum in Power Apps to drive revenue growth in the high 20s. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $16.4 billion and $16.65 billion. 
In Azure, revenue will be driven by continued strong growth in our consumption-based business. And our per user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect some moderation in growth rate given the size of the installed base. Therefore, in constant currency, Azure revenue growth should remain relatively stable on a sequential basis. 
In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits driven by continued demand for our hybrid and premium annuity offerings against a low prior year comparable. And in Enterprise Services, we expect revenue to be in the high single digits. In More Personal Computing, we have estimated the Q1 impact of the required Windows 11 revenue deferral that will shift to Q2 to be approximately $300 million. Therefore, our segment revenue outlook is $12.4 billion to $12.8 billion. Given the 10-point estimated negative impact from the deferral, OEM revenue should decline mid- to high single digits in Q1. 
In Surface, on a strong prior year comparable, we expect revenue to decline in the low teens as we continue to work through the supply chain challenges. In Windows Commercial products and cloud services, continued demand for Microsoft 365 and our Advanced Security solutions should drive healthy double-digit growth. In Search ex TAC, we expect revenue growth in the high 30s driven by improvements in the advertising market. In Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the low double digits. Console growth will again be constrained by supply. And on a strong prior year comparable, Xbox content and services revenue should grow low single digits. 
Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of $13.55 billion to $13.75 billion and operating expense of $11.6 billion to $11.7 billion. In other income and expense, interest income and expense should offset each other. And finally, we expect our Q1 tax rate to be approximately 16%, lower than our expected full year rate given the volume of equity vest in our first quarter. 
In closing, we remain focused on driving revenue growth as we invest boldly against the strategic high-growth opportunities ahead that will deliver significant value to our customers worldwide. Our outlook for FY '22 reflects this: with healthy double-digit revenue and operating income growth. Together, that results in expanded operating margins in FY '22 after excluding the headwinds from the useful life change noted earlier. Together with our customers and partners, we look forward to FY '22.

Satya, last year at this time, you made a comment that, I think, really defined the conversation in software over the past year. When you're talking about an acceleration in digital transformation you saw coming out of COVID, and I think that's evident in the results that we see here with 25% growth in your Commercial bookings growth, what I want to ask you is the durability of that growth on a going-forward basis. Was that acceleration a pull forward of demand and, at some point, we're going to have that hard comp? Or do you see durability in this acceleration on a go-forward basis? Is there a lot more to come? 
And then, Amy, to you, a similar kind of question but more on sort of the margin side of the equation. I think your entire tenure at Microsoft has really been defined by good operational controls and ability to grow gross profit dollars well ahead of OpEx. Is that durable longer term? Is there still enough sort of efficiency gains at Microsoft to be able to keep that up over the medium term, if you will?",202

I mean the way we see the results today reflect that but, more importantly, on a secular basis, as I think about -- I always go back to that number, which is 5% of the world GDP is tech spend, it's projected to double. I think that doubling will happen in a more accelerated pace. And we feel well positioned because of the innovation across the stack because, if you think about it, what's going to happen is every business, whether you're a retailer or a manufacturer, in the service sector, public sector or private sector, digital adoption is the way you're going to be both resilient as well as transform the core business processes. 
And the strength we have is that entirety of the Microsoft cloud stack, right? So it's not just about infrastructure or any application, it's the entirety of what we do. And so I think it is durable. Quarter-to-quarter, depending on what happened during the pandemic, depending on the segments that were impacted, for example, the consumer segments that were impacted that are coming back and then they'll normalize whereas, in our case, we do -- in fact, one of the things I love about sort of our exposure is both it's a worldwide exposure and it has got the right balance between the consumer segments and the enterprise business-to-business segment. So it's a very durable long-term growth prospect that we have tough competition, we need to keep innovating, which is what we'll stay focused on.",257

And while I am obviously proud of the work we've done, Keith, that you referenced as a team on margins and returns, I would say, in general, our focus remains, and has been for the duration of really Satya and I's work together along with the rest of the SLT, on consistently moving our resources and talent to our highest growth and most differentiated places. When you do that in expansive total addressable markets in the way that I believe we're focused on as an organization, you do see the type of operating leverage that you're referring to in margins. And that along, as you see sort of mathematically, with a shift in our revenue to higher overall gross margin segments, you do get the results we've seen. So I feel very good about the work we've done. And as you heard, I'm quite optimistic about the opportunities we have to invest leading into FY '22 as well.",165

And Amy, thanks for the detail and color, especially in the guidance. So I want to ask about seasonality in Azure. Traditionally, we've seen seasonality in the Azure numbers in Q4. And obviously, last year, we didn't see it because of COVID, but we also didn't see it this year. Has something changed that has changed the seasonality of the business? And does that continue going forward? And then as a follow-up question, Keith asked about OpEx efficiency overall, but I'd like to ask specifically on the cloud. Is there any reason that cloud OpEx shouldn't continue to grow slower than revenue, obviously, on an annual basis, not a quarterly basis?",118
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3626.0,2357429.0,90106866.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,11,"Thanks, Mark, for the question. Let me cover your first one, which is the seasonality in the Azure business. In some ways, Mark, some of that seasonality, frankly, was because Azure has 2 fundamental components. It's got a consumption model as well as a per-user model. The per-user model which, as you well know, is far more aligned to our sort of end of year and can be a lot more aligned to our end-of-year rhythms, it also can have more quarterly volatility in terms of accounting, in terms of revenue recognition, the same topic we often talk about when it comes to Microsoft 365 in terms of more in-quarter recognition, what you've seen is that did historically represent a larger component of Azure, so added volatility to Q4. 
As we've seen our consumption businesses grow and grow consistently, and thus far becoming a larger percentage of Azure, you do have more stability, Mark. And so you start seeing less of that volatility that we've historically seen from Q3 to Q4. We still have some of it, as we talked about, but I think it's an interesting observation and it's a very good question. In terms of your comment on cloud revenue and OpEx, yes, I do believe that's durable. We get a lot of focus. We'll continue to invest. There's lots of opportunity there, but the market certainly warrants it.",231

I'm curious if you think there is the ceiling in the near term on margins. Or do you feel that you've got an elevated flight level, if you will, and we shouldn't have to be worrying about that level of margins? Can you just give us any more color as it relates to how you're thinking about that?",65

But what sits behind that, Keith -- I mean, sorry, Brent -- is this focus on the first thing I said, which is with every operating expense dollar we invest, are we continuing to invest in the highest growth places? If you continue to invest in high-growth places with differentiation that customers care about and you add value, you continue to see improvements in this area. 
From time to time, I'm sure there'll be quarters where that isn't the case, if we have some mix shift in hardware, et cetera. But in general, over a longer period of time, you've seen us focus on this. And so if you remove a little of the noise and some of the useful life changes and look back a few years, I do think you'd see the biggest needle-mover being where we invest the dollars as opposed to the overall amount of them, which should grow based on the opportunity.",196

That's very helpful. So if Azure is going to remain stable in constant currency, I guess at 45%, and you had indicated that EMS growth should moderate, effectively, you're saying that the consumption piece of Azure might accelerate in the September quarter. So I'm wondering if you could unpack that a little bit. Is this as simple as prior period commitments ramping at an accelerated pace? I'd love to hear your thoughts.",85

I think in general, you've got the right trajectory. And I do think it's both things. You've heard me say, it's both some of our core as well as premium SKUs. We've seen some nice execution. And I think Satya mentioned some of these differentiated places in the Azure stack where I think we also can see some growth. Data services is a very good point where I feel like we've made a lot of progress, have a real differentiation, have seen some acceleration in the past couple of quarters.",92

I'm wondering what developments are you seeing that inform your viewpoint. And Amy, do you sense uplift in some of those intelligent edge products, such as Azure Stack or others, contributing to the improvement in server products growth that we saw this quarter?",61
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3626.0,2357429.0,90106875.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,20,"Thanks so much for that question. A couple of things that are happening. One is that all up, even what we consider the cloud infrastructure, is getting increasingly distributed. If you think about the approach we took to our data center architecture, the fact that we have more regions, is to meet, I would say, both the real-world needs for the computing architecture side but also the regulatory and data residency requirements. So we feel we picked the right approach, and that's paying dividends today just even in terms of our geographic coverage, our coverage of all of the regulatory requirements. 
Then the second piece, of course, is distributed computing will remain distributed. And what we are seeing with edge is going to be the case where we will see more of both the old workloads with hybrid benefits and hybrid deployments as well as new workloads, right? So if you take the AB InBev Digital Twin meets IoT type of scenario, that's going to require a lot more compute close to their factories. And so to me, those new scenarios -- or 5G, I mean, think about what AT&T is planning to do, which is a hybrid deployment in a completely new space where there is going to be compute that's located to be able to take core network traffic and use cloud economics. So that's what we think of going forward, which is really compute will remain distributed, both because of their needs across geographies, regulation and the very nature of compute architecture.",255

This is one where I would focus on the overall server products and cloud services number, which I think, Mark, was at the heart of your question because through our purchasing vehicles, the most effective way to purchase for flexibility across the edge in the cloud is sometimes some of the on-prem licensing with hybrid, right? So you do see that both in our Azure results but also depending on how it's purchased and server KPI.",100

You called out momentum this quarter and last quarter. My question is around the drivers of these larger enterprise commitments. Is this driven by just the larger scope of deals? Or are you seeing kind of broader attach rate across the whole breadth of Microsoft cloud products?,56
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3626.0,2357429.0,90106879.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,24,"Thanks, Brent. Maybe, Satya, I'll take this one first and if you want to add anything. Brent, unfortunately, I'm going to answer it's everything. And let me talk about why I say that. When you see the size of the contracts increase, it's about the entire scope of what's offered under the Microsoft cloud. We're seeing both really strong renewals of our core contracts, really strong additions across Dynamics, Power Apps, Power Automate, M365, premium SKUs, security, compliance, voice, which, of course, increases those commitment sizes. And you're seeing the addition of Azure commitments, which we often talk about as these multiyear, longer-term contracts. And so then you do, of course, see them just have longer duration on, especially in the case of Azure. So in many ways, what we focus on are the components that make up the larger contracts is each component being additive to selling the value that's present across all of our pieces of the Microsoft cloud. 
This was a good execution quarter for us. You see it in the bookings number even more. When you have a declining expiry base and then bookings growth that's that high, you have to do all those things well. And that's, I think, really what's reflected ultimately and transactionally, meaning those larger $10 million-plus contracts being done.",218

Is that driving -- given the acceleration you're seeing in Dynamics, can you talk to the fact, is that driving larger deals, new bites at the apple? Or how is that changing the landscape? And how do you think about that versus what your competitors are doing?",90
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3626.0,2357429.0,90106882.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,27,"Yes, that's a great question. Thanks for that. Multiple things happening. And both -- some of them are independent secular growth trends and they do reinforce each other. Let's just take Dynamics. Probably one of the most exciting things we are seeing is that coming out of this pandemic, there is an absolute new chapter for a complete new suite all the way from whether it's sales, to customer service, to marketing, to supply chain or digital manufacturing, that's all going to be reimplemented. So there's going to be a complete new cycle of business process automation that is going to be AI-first and collaboration-first. And that second part is where that intersection between Teams and Business Process or Dynamics comes through because you do not want to have a system of record for anything, whether it is a customer or a part or a forecast that you don't want to collaborate on, that you don't want to communicate on. And by the way, the communications and the collaboration artifacts are part of the record. And that's what I think that this new generation of software will enable. 
And so you see it in 2 fronts. One is Teams has become a platform not just for Dynamics, even for Salesforce, for SAP, for Adobe, for ServiceNow, they're all building great integrations into Teams and we'll foster that. And Dynamics itself, of course, will integrate deeply with Teams and embed Teams or Azure Communication Services. So when you think about our omnichannel customer service module, it doesn't look like anything from 2 years ago. It's a completely rebuilt omnichannel customer service system, which has all the communication functionality built in. So it's a pretty exciting space. And it also speaks to a lot of the questions around where is the margin, how is it going to sort of evolve. I think tracking what's happening with Power Platform, Dynamics and Teams, I think, probably -- and its intersection to even some of our data layers in Azure is perhaps the best indication of some of our competitive differentiation at scale already.",349

Is there any comments or color that you could provide? I know you said you focused on the operating margin side, but on the trends that you anticipate this year in '22 around gross margins with or without the depreciation schedules. Part B is on the last quarter call, you indicated that operating expenses might grow kind of mid-teens -- or low teens, I should say, in '22. I was wondering if you would want to update the comments on how we should be thinking about operating expense trends as we look at FY '22.",111

When I think about your operating expense comments, no, I don't have any update to that. I think if you think about our headcount growth at 12%, plus through the year, continuing to invest in some of the places where we saw savings through the year on COVID, I would expect that, that is still a good placeholder for people as we work through the year. I mean with the opportunity we see in the market, I think it supports that level. And given our execution, when we do invest, which leads me to margin, I feel very good about that. 
At the gross margin level, we'll continue to focus really on the same things we've always focused on, which is continuing across our cloud services to see improving margins. You'll continue to see a mix shift to Azure given the growth we expect there. And we'll continue to see gross margin improvements across individual services that make up many of our components across the company. So in general, I feel like the gross margin trends are quite healthy heading into '22.",184

We're off to a fast start in fiscal 2022 with Microsoft Cloud quarterly revenue surpassing $20 billion for the first time, up 36% year-over-year. The case for digital transformation has never been more urgent or more clear. Digital technology is a deflationary force in an inflationary economy. Businesses, small and large, can improve productivity and the affordability of their products and services by building tech intensity. The Microsoft Cloud delivers the end-to-end platforms and tools organizations need to navigate this time of transition and change.
Now I'll highlight examples of our innovation and momentum, starting with Azure. Every organization will need a distributed computing fabric across the cloud and the edge to rapidly build, manage and deploy applications anywhere. We are building Azure as the world's computer, with more data center regions than any other provider, delivering fast access to cloud services, while addressing critical data residency requirements. And we are partnering with mobile operators, from AT&T and Verizon in the United States, to TelefÃ³nica and BT in Europe, Telstra and Singtel in Asia Pacific, as they embrace new business models and bring ultra-low latency compute power and storage to the network and the enterprise edge.
78% of the Fortune 500 use our hybrid offerings. And with Azure Arc, customers like Nokia, Royal Bank of Canada and SKF can deploy and run applications at the edge or in multi-cloud environments. Organizations also prefer our cloud to power the mission-critical apps they rely on every day. GE Healthcare and Procter & Gamble migrated critical workloads to Azure this quarter, and leading companies in every industry, including Bertelsmann, Kimberly-Clark, the NBA, SoftBank, thyssenkrupp, all chose Azure for their SAP workloads.
Now on to data. The leading indicator of digital transformation success in an organization is the organization's ability to turn data into analytical and predictive power. Azure Synapse brings together data integration, enterprise data warehousing and big data analytics into a comprehensive solution. With Synapse Link for Dataverse, organizations can analyze data from business applications, like Power Platform and Dynamics 365 with just a few clicks. With Synapse Link for Cosmos DB, they can run real-time no-ETL analytics over their operational data. And with Power BI, anyone in the organization can access these insights. Thousands of active Power BI customers are using Synapse today. 
More than ever, every business needs a holistic understanding of its data estate. And Azure Purview now generally available is helping organizations, such as FedEx, manage and govern on-premise, multi-cloud and SaaS data. Now on to developers. As every company becomes a digital company, they will need standardized tools to modernize existing apps and build new ones. From GitHub to Visual Studio, we have the most used and loved developer tools to build any app on any platform. GitHub is now home to 73 million developers, up 2x since our acquisition 3 years ago. More and more businesses are choosing GitHub Enterprise to provide their developer teams the most advanced platform to build, ship and maintain software.
This quarter alone, we introduced more than 70 enterprise features, 84% of the Fortune 100 use GitHub, and we are seeing growing usage from digital-native companies and the world's most established firms, from Pinterest to Procter & Gamble, from Stripe to Societe Generale. We are rapidly innovating in AI, and our large-scale models are powering everything, from meeting recaps in Teams, to helping developers code in GitHub, to the next best action in Dynamics 365. And as machine learning continues to mature, managing the life cycle of models or MLOps has become more prevalent, and Azure ML is now the go-to tool for data science teams. And large organizations, from Ecolab to Providence health care are relying on Azure AI to better meet customer needs.
Now to Power Platform. With Power Platform, we are helping domain experts drive productivity gains with low-code/no-code tools, robotic process automation, virtual agents and business intelligence. All up, Power Platform now has nearly 20 million monthly active users, up 76% year-over-year. Power Apps is the undisputed market leader in low-code/no-code tools, now with 10 million monthly active users. 91% of the Fortune 500 use the service to build applications, and 129 organizations have more than 10,000 users, including 3M, EY, GSK, Marks & Spencer, Sony and ZF Group.
Now on to Dynamics 365. Going forward, every business process will be collaborative, powered by data and AI, and will bridge the digital and physical worlds. Dynamics 365 ushers in this hyper-connected business process era. We continue to gain share with Dynamics 365 and Teams. We are creating a complete new category of collaborative applications that help businesses like Rockwell Automation, Willis Towers Watson surface data and insights across the entire organization. Dynamics 365 Customer Insights leads its category. Customers like Meijer are using it to create a 360-degree view of customers in order to deliver more personalized experiences. All up, the number of customer profiles increased 174% year-over-year.
Now on to industry. Our industry clouds bring together capabilities across the entire Microsoft Cloud along with industry-specific customizations to improve time-to-value, increase agility and lower costs. We are seeing strong customer adoption of our new industry cloud for health care, and our clouds for financial services and manufacturing will become more broadly available next week.
Sustainability is an existential priority for our society and for every business today. And when we think about our approach to sustainability, it's more than just the carbon footprint of our own data centers. With our Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability, we are creating an entirely new business process category to help organizations monitor their carbon footprint across their operations. The world's largest baking company, Grupo Bimbo, for example, is using our tools to report, record and reduce its emissions in every country where it operates.
Now on to LinkedIn. We are experiencing a great reshuffle across the global labor market as people are rethinking not only where and how they work, but why. And as more people change jobs than ever before, we saw record engagement as they increasingly turn to LinkedIn to connect, learn, grow and get hired. LinkedIn now has nearly 800 million members. Confirmed hires on the platform increased more than 160% year-over-year. And this quarter, we launched new ways to help job seekers discover roles that align with how they want to work.
In a rapidly evolving labor market, companies are increasingly turning to LinkedIn Learning to upskill and reskill their employees. We now have over 15,000 enterprise customers of LinkedIn Learning, and we are expanding our opportunity in the creator economy, including offering new ways for LinkedIn Learning instructors to build their audiences and connect with learners live. Businesses continue to choose LinkedIn as the trusted way to reach professionals. LinkedIn advertising revenue was up 61% year-over-year.
Now on to Microsoft 365 and Teams. Flexibility and productivity are not mutually exclusive. We are innovating to empower people to have impact from home, in the office and anywhere in between. Microsoft Teams is the only solution that supports all the ways people work. Usage has never been higher. 138 organizations now have more than 100,000 users of Teams, and more than 3,000 have more than 10,000 users. Updates to Teams Rooms, including new AI pod cameras and spatial audio, ensure every meeting attendee is always a first-class participant.
The rise of hybrid work is transforming the enterprise phone market, and we are taking share across PSTN and VoIP. Calls originating from Teams chats increased 50% this quarter compared to a year ago. Operator Connect enables organizations to bring their existing service directly into Teams. And leaders in every industry, including Schlumberger, Westpac, ZF Group, REI and SAP, chose Teams Phone this quarter to meet all their internal and external calling needs. Moving forward, organizations will need a digital fabric that spans organizational boundaries to address key challenges, like customer service swarming and supply chain resilience. With Teams Connect, employees across multiple companies can chat and collaborate as one extended team without switching tenants.
In private preview, we are already seeing strong interest and usage from companies like LVMH and WPP. Teams by itself has become a first-class platform for application development. For example, employees at Levi Strauss and NTT DATA are using ServiceNow applications right within Teams to access critical info within the flow of work. Organizations are also using Power Platform to build their own rich, collaborative apps within Teams for everything, from curbside pickup, to care team coordination. All up, the number of organizations with more than 10,000 users, integrating their third-party and line of business applications with Teams, increased 82% year-over-year.
We are creating a complete new category with Microsoft Viva, which brings together communications, knowledge, learning, resources and insights. Our acquisition of Ally.io, a leader in the fast-growing objectives and key results category, adds new tools to help employees drive outcomes, not just output in hybrid work. Avanade, Old Mutual, PayPal and Toyota North America all chose Viva to help strengthen connections between employees and their mission, between employees and managers and drive individual empowerment.
Across Microsoft 365, we are seeing growth in all segments, including triple-digit year-over-year usage growth of Teams in frontline. Coles, one of Australia's largest retailers, chose Teams to bring 2-way communications to more than 120,000 frontline employees. And Chevron, H&M, Lumen and St. Jude all turned to our premium Microsoft 365 E5 offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice and analytics.
Now on to Windows. Earlier this month, we launched Windows 11, the biggest update to our operating system in a decade. When I step back and reflect on the future of how we work, connect and play, one thing is clear. The PC will be more critical than ever. There has been a structural shift in PC demand emerging from this pandemic, and we're delighted with the early response to Windows 11. With every new generation of Windows, we also unlock the next generation of hardware innovation across our ecosystem.
And together with our OEM partners, we're excited to offer the widest choice of Windows 11 devices at every price point in every form factor this holiday. We are providing people and organizations everywhere with the most differentiated devices for productivity, learning and gaming and also have massive opportunity to create a new class of applications that take advantage of the edge and AI capabilities in Windows, coupled with cloud.
And Windows 11 is also the most open platform. It's pioneering new store commerce models and policies, with both Amazon and Epic Games are bringing their marketplaces to the Microsoft Store. Now on to security. Cybersecurity is the #1 threat facing businesses today. Our goal is to help every organization strengthen its defense through the Zero Trust architecture built on end-to-end solutions that span all clouds and all platforms. We analyze over 24 trillion signals across e-mail, endpoints and identities each day and translate this intelligence into innovative features to protect our customers.
We have prevented more than 70 billion attacks over the past year alone. We now have nearly 650,000 customers using our security solutions, up 50% year-over-year. And businesses like HCA Healthcare and Siemens switched to our security solutions to protect their endpoints. In identity, Azure Active Directory now has more than 500 million monthly active users, and we have seen usage of third-party apps increase 1.5x year-over-year. And the future of security is passwordless. Nearly 240 million users have adopted passwordless login to date, and consumers can now completely remove passwords from their personal Microsoft accounts. And we're not stopping there. Over the next 5 years, we'll invest $20 billion to advance our security solutions and protect customers.
Now on to gaming. We continue to attract new gamers and retain those we have gained over the past 1.5 years. We saw record first quarter monetization and engagement. This holiday season will bring our biggest lineup of content and exclusive games ever, with 3 new AAA titles, including Halo Infinite, available via Game Pass subscription service, which continues to offer the best value in gaming.
We're also bringing xCloud gaming to the console for the first time, enabling Xbox users to discover the stream and stream more than 100 games with just a click. Cloud gaming is now available in 26 countries, including, as of this quarter, in Australia, Brazil, Mexico and Japan. We are expanding our opportunity with independent creators as well as top studios. Updates to Azure PlayFab make it easier for developers to integrate, to create a marketplace in games they built. And leading publishers, from Bungie to Krafton, are all relying on our cloud to scale and operate their games.
In closing, we have the most diversified set of digital businesses, and we are innovating to expand our opportunity across the entire portfolio to help our customers in this new era. Next week, we'll hold our flagship Ignite Conference, where we will share the next chapter of Microsoft Cloud from the Metaverse, to large-scale AI, from hybrid work, to hybrid infrastructure. I couldn't be more optimistic about the opportunities ahead.
With that, I'll hand it over to Amy.",2187
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3672.0,2444512.0,92842900.0,Presenter Speech,Amy Hood,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter revenue was $45.3 billion, up 22% and 20% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.27 and increased 25% and 23% in constant currency when adjusted for a net tax benefit of $3.3 billion related to the transfer of intangible properties this quarter.
Our sales teams and partners delivered a strong start to the fiscal year. In our commercial business, customers continued to choose the Microsoft Cloud. We again saw healthy growth in our Azure consumption-based business and increased usage across products, such as Teams and Power Platform, as Satya reflected in his comments. In our on-premises business, annuity performance in Office and Server benefited from a greater-than-expected mix of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition. And in LinkedIn, the Talent Solutions business continued to benefit from an improved job market.
In our consumer business, Windows OEM performance was better than expected in a growing PC market despite ongoing supply chain constraints. We also saw positive demand signals for Windows 11 ahead of launch, with nearly all devices built this quarter eligible for upgrade. Microsoft 365 subscription growth drove Office Consumer results. Advertising market growth drove another strong quarter in LinkedIn as well as search and news advertising. And in gaming, we were able to ship more Xbox Series X and S consoles than expected even as demand continues to exceed supply.
Let's move to our overall results. Against a strong prior year comparable, commercial bookings grew 11% and 14% in constant currency driven by a consistent execution across new, add-on and renewal sales motions. This quarter, growth was impacted by fewer large long-term Azure contracts, which were unpredictable in their timing. As a result, commercial remaining performance obligation increased 28% and 29% in constant currency to $137 billion, with a roughly equivalent split between revenue that will be recognized within and the portion beyond the next 12 months. And our annuity mix increased 2 points year-over-year to 95%.
Microsoft Cloud revenue grew 36% and 34% in constant currency to $20.7 billion, ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 71%. Excluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate for the useful life of server and network equipment assets, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 4 points driven by improvement in our cloud services, particularly in Azure and Office 365, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure.
With the weaker U.S. dollar, FX increased total company, Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud revenue growth by 2 points, in line with expectations. More Personal Computing revenue growth was increased by 1 point from FX, less favorable than expected. FX increased COGS by 1 point, in line with expectations, and had no impact to operating expense, slightly more favorable than expected. Gross margin dollars increased 21% and 19% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage was 70%, down slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate discussed earlier, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point driven by improvements in cloud services noted earlier, partially offset by sales mix shift to cloud.
Operating expense increased 11%, lower than expected, primarily driven by investments that shifted to future quarters. At a total company level, head count grew 14% year-over-year as we continue to invest in key areas, such as cloud engineering, sales, customer deployment and gaming. Operating income increased 27% and 24% in constant currency, and operating margins expanded 2 points year-over-year to 45%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins expanded roughly 4 points year-over-year.
Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $15 billion and grew 22% and 20% in constant currency, with better-than-expected performance in Office Commercial and LinkedIn. Office Commercial revenue grew 18% and 16% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue grew 23% and 21% in constant currency driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and all customer segments as well as higher ARPU. Demand for our advanced security, compliance and voice offerings drove continued momentum in E5 revenue this quarter.
Paid Office 365 Commercial seats increased 17% year-over-year driven by another strong quarter of growth in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. Office Commercial licensing decreased 13% and 14% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, benefiting from the higher in-period revenue recognition noted earlier. Office Consumer revenue grew 10% and 8% in constant currency on a strong prior year comparable, with better-than-expected growth in Microsoft 365 subscriptions. Over the past 2 years, our Microsoft 365 subscriber base has grown over 50%, reaching 54.1 million this quarter.
Dynamics revenue grew 31% and 29% constant currency. Dynamics 365 revenue growth was 48% and 45% in constant currency, with continued strong demand for Power Apps, which grew 202% and 197% in constant currency. And in LinkedIn, revenue increased 42% and 39% in constant currency, with continued strength in marketing solutions and better-than-expected performance in Talent Solutions from the improved job market noted earlier.
Segment gross margin dollars increased 22% and 20% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased slightly. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points driven by improvement across all cloud services. Operating expense increased 7%, and operating income increased 33% and 29% in constant currency.
Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $17 billion, increasing 31% and 29% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by continued customer demand for our differentiated hybrid and cloud offerings. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 35% and 33% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services grew 50% and 48% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by our consumption-based services.
In our per user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 30% to over 196 million seats. In our on-premises business, on a low prior year comparable, revenue increased 14% and 13% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Strength in our annuity business was driven by healthy demand for our hybrid offerings that include Windows Server and SQL Server running in multi-cloud environments and higher in-period revenue recognition, including benefit from annuity purchasing ahead of the Windows Server 2022 launch.
Enterprise Services revenue grew 9% and 8% in constant currency driven by growth in Microsoft Consulting Services and enterprise support services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 28% and 26% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points driven by improvements in Azure, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. Operating expense increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, and operating income grew 39% and 37% in constant currency.
Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.3 billion, increasing 12% and 11% in constant currency, with better-than-expected performance in Windows OEM and gaming. Windows OEM revenue increased 10% driven by a stronger-than-expected PC market, particularly in the commercial segment, which has higher revenue per license. These results include roughly 7 points of impact from the $210 million revenue deferral related to Windows 11 licenses sold to OEMs prior to general availability. The deferral was lower-than-expected OEMs' prioritized upgrade-eligible device builds early in the quarter.
Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 12% and 10% in constant currency driven by demand for Microsoft 365. Surface revenue declined 17% and 19% in constant currency on a strong prior year comparable. Search and news advertising revenue, ex TAC, increased 40% and 39% in constant currency, in line with expectations, benefiting from the advertising market noted earlier. And in gaming, revenue increased 16% and 14% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Better-than-expected console supply and continued strong demand resulted in Xbox hardware revenue growth of 166% and 162% in constant currency. Xbox content services revenue increased 2% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency against a strong prior year comparable.
Segment gross margin dollars increased 10% and 8% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point year-over-year driven by sales mix shift to gaming hardware. Operating expenses increased 15% driven by the ZeniMax acquisition as well as Windows 11 marketing. Operating income grew 7% and 5% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $7.4 billion, in line with expectations, and cash paid for PP&E was $5.8 billion. Our capital investments, including both new data center regions and expansion in existing regions, continue to be based on significant customer demand and usage signals.
Cash flow from operations was $24.5 billion, increasing 27% year-over-year driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $18.7 billion, up 30% year-over-year. This quarter, other income and expense was $286 million, higher than anticipated, primarily driven by net gains on investments. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was approximately 16%. And finally, we returned $10.9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Now before we turn to our outlook, I would like to provide a couple of reminders. First, the outlook we give, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. Second, my remarks for the next quarter do not include the impact from the Nuance acquisition, which we now expect to close by the end of Q2 or early Q3. With that, let's move to our second quarter outlook.
In our commercial business, our differentiated market position, compelling solution portfolio and consistent execution should drive another strong quarter. Commercial bookings growth should again be healthy, but impacted by modest growth in the Q2 expiry base and the normal quarterly volatility from large long-term Azure contracts previously discussed.
Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 2 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate previously discussed, Q2 gross margin percentage will increase roughly 2 points driven by continued improvement across our cloud services despite revenue mix shift to Azure. Longer term, we expect the Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage to be impacted by revenue mix shift to Azure, increased usage of our Microsoft Cloud services and ongoing strategic investments to support our customers' success. And on a dollar basis, we expect capital expenditures to be roughly in line with last quarter as we continue to invest to support growing demand.
Now to FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase revenue at the total company and all individual segment levels by approximately 1 point and have no impact on total COGS or operating expense growth. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $15.7 billion and $15.95 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365, with healthy seat growth, growth across customer segments and continued momentum in E5.
In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the high teens, consistent with the ongoing customer shift to the cloud. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue to grow in the mid-teens, with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 consumer subscriptions. For LinkedIn, a strong job market and continued engagement on the platform should drive revenue growth in the mid-30% range. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth similar to Q1 driven by strength in Dynamics 365, including continued momentum in Power Apps.
For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $18.1 billion and $18.35 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability, primarily from our per user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Q2, we expect healthy broad-based growth in our Azure consumption business, consistent with recent trends. In our per user business, while continuing to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, we should see a moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base.
In our on-premises server business, on a higher prior year comparable, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits driven by continued demand for our hybrid solutions. In Enterprise Services, we expect revenue growth to be in the high single digits. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $16.35 billion and $16.75 billion. Despite ongoing supply chain constraints, OEM revenue should grow low to mid-teens, including 6 points of impact from the $210 million Windows 11 deferral that shifted revenue from Q1 to Q2.
In Windows Commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive low double-digit growth. In Surface, we expect revenue to decline in single digits as we continue to work through supply chain uncertainty, particularly in our premium devices. In search and news advertising, ex TAC, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-20s. If supply chain uncertainty reduces advertising budgets, our results would be negatively impacted.
And in gaming, on a high prior year comparable that included the launch of our new consoles and strength across Xbox content and services, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits. Console sales will continue to be impacted by supply chain uncertainty. And at Xbox content services, we expect revenue growth in the mid-teens, with strong engagement on the Xbox platform in a holiday quarter that will include several AAA title launches.
Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of $17 billion to $17.2 billion and operating expense of $12.7 billion to $12.8 billion. In other income and expense, interest income and expense should offset each other. And finally, we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be approximately 17%.
In closing, we are off to a strong start in FY '22, with tremendous opportunity to drive sustained long-term revenue growth. We remain focused on growing high-value usage across our differentiated Microsoft Cloud offerings and delivering exciting new consumer experiences with Windows 11, Surface and our Xbox gaming platform as we enter the holiday season. Our consistent approach to investing for these and other future opportunities while continuing to deliver solid operating performance will drive strong results throughout FY '22 and beyond.

Satya, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the edge computing opportunity, something that you started off your remarks with and also something that we're hearing a lot of chatter about within the investor community and within the technology community. Can you talk to us about how you think about sizing that opportunity in terms of the programmable edge? And maybe help us understand the Microsoft architectural approach versus perhaps some of the competitors coming into the marketplace from the CDN perspective, who are talking about the competitive differentiation by having a more of a last-mile solution. Can you help us kind of understand the differentiation in those approaches?",117

And a great question because we've always, as you know, Keith, architected Azure for the distributed computing fabric to remain distributed. In other words, when we talked about hybrid computing even 5 years ago, the idea was always that we will always have a cloud, and then we will have a distributed cloud infrastructure for application deployment. So that when we think about cloud plus edge, we even put even the multi-cloud control plane in there, right? So whether it is what's happening with, say, 5G and how naturally compute will go to where data is getting generated, with low-latency access to a factory floor, to a hospital, to cities where you want to play xCloud gaming, that's sort of one phenomena.
The other is just literally treating every cloud, whether it's the on-premise data center or it's the other public cloud and our public cloud and being able to use Azure Arc and its control plane to ease the deployment across all clouds. That's another thing that we are seeing. So when I think about what is going to be key in such a distributed world, is having that full suite of application infrastructure, right, all the way from the management and security control plane, something like Azure Active Directory managing the security principles and identities or -- and to management control planes like Azure Arc. And so we feel well positioned for it. And I think that the multi-cloud, multi-edge world is sort of really how we build Azure in the first place. And I think we're still very early in all of that playing out, but we feel well positioned.",278

Yes. I think the important thing, when you think about bookings performance, is to talk about what happened before you get to those volatiles from the large Azure commitments that create some of the tough comparables that we're talking about. And that's really the opportunity to execute against selling the Microsoft [Cloud] day-to-day, right, which is Dynamics, Microsoft Cloud, GitHub and the broader universe. Our execution on that was actually quite good. Very good renewals, very good recapture rates, very good add-ons, meaning you sell outside of the normal pattern, and so I feel very good. It's very consistent execution, to your point, Brent, this quarter versus others on that front.
And then, to your point, it's sort of important not to time some of these larger, long-dated Azure contracts. That's where the volatility is. The day-to-day execution of Azure commitments, actually, was very consistent. The volatility comes with some of the bigger things. And with a lot of them in Q4, less on a comparable basis in Q1, and that happens from time to time.",178

And your guidance for the Windows OEM business in December was also, I think, way above what people are modeling. So I guess, in essence, how did you dodge that bullet? Amy, maybe you could unpack that OEM performance for us and your view into the second half of the fiscal year.",101

I want to start by saying and repeating something that Satya, I think, was careful to include in his remarks. And it is the central nature of the PC, to really the nature of both hybrid work and fundamentally about getting jobs done. And I think the central role it's played, we've talked about, I think, now for a number of quarters. And I think the reality of that continues to exist and I think become more real for people as we talk about what hybrid's going to look like and continue to learn what hybrid is going to look like. And to that end, PCs -- the market grew this quarter, and it was constrained by supply. 
I believe Q2 will also be a strong demand quarter that is constrained by supply. But even with that, we see a growing market. And then particularly, in both Q1 and Q2, we see a strong demand in the commercial segment. And I think that ties directly back to some of Satya's comments about the central nature of the device. Then, of course, we do get some benefit, Karl, because revenue per license is higher in commercial than it is in the broad market. Those things together, which is a growing market, strong Windows performance within that market, in commercial in particular, and then the resulting higher revenue per license results in I think a very strong position in Q1 and Q2.",242

With inflation, at least in the U.S., increasing and likely to further accelerate due to government spending, Amy, how do you think this increasing inflation will impact your customers and your business? And Satya, in your remarks, you discussed how digital is deflationary in an inflationary world. Can you give more color on how the shift to cloud and digital will offset inflationary pressure beyond purely pricing?",75
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3672.0,2444512.0,92842915.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,18,"Yes. Maybe I'll just start and then, Amy, you can add to it. I mean in an inflationary environment, the first place any business should go to is how to really ensure that they're able to get productivity gains and even dealing with constraints. For example, if you have supply chain constraints, one of the things you want to do is run your factories at the efficient frontier. That means things like digital-twin simulation are the ones where you're going to make sure that every production run has the least amount of wastage.
So I think any which way you look, whether it's in the knowledge worker, first-line worker, whether it's actually digital twins and simulation, all of those things are going to be the best way for any company to deal with inflationary pressure so that they can, in fact, have the best productivity and thereby the best ability to be able to meet aggregate demand out there. So that's why we are very, very excited about sort of making sure our software products are available to our business customers all around to be able to manage through this inflationary environment. And I'll let Amy add to that.",199

Thanks, Satya. And I think, really, Satya got to the heart, Mark, of where I tend to go when you think about -- when you see the intensity of customers across industries and across geographies wanting to adopt digital technology for many of the reasons Satya just explained, and there's numerous scenarios across, I think, most industries. That acceleration, of course, regardless, frankly, of the overall environment, is a place where we feel like we offer the best portfolio at the Microsoft Cloud and with our industry clouds to make that doable with a very fast time-to-value. 
And so our ability to execute against that, regardless of the spend environment, means we've got the right portfolio and a high value to customer that's deployable quickly, that can get them results when they need it. And I think that's reflected in most of the surveys that really point to preference for our cloud to help customers do that. So while -- of course, it's hard to predict what any quarter or second half will do, the things I believe to be sustainable are a push to digital, a push to clouds that help customers get value quickly and us being a trusted adviser and partner to help that happen.",209

And also, a, little bit more of a deeper perspective on supply chain and how does Microsoft get visibility? Considering that you're growing your cloud business and your CapEx commitments seem to be quite impressive. How much visibility do you have into component availability and your ability to ramp up your CapEx?",85

So on the labor market, maybe I'll start. Amy, you can add to this. All up, the first place where we are very, very focused on is to making sure that, with LinkedIn, we are doing everything to help everyone find their best economic opportunity. And when Ryan Roslansky, who's the CEO of LinkedIn, talks about the great reshuffle, I think along with the hybrid work change, there is a real question everybody is asking, not only where and how they work, but why they work. And so to be able to make sure that we can help them find the opportunity that they are looking for is, I think, the most critical work that we can be doing.
The second side to this though is also to take the productivity of the people, whether they're on the front lines and the first-line workers or the knowledge workers or even software developers, and making sure that they have the best tools, whether it's the GitHub, Harness and Visual Studio Code for people who are developers, or whether it is Power Apps or whether it is the Office 365 and then Microsoft 365 tooling to help them be most productive. That's, I think, the thing that we are very, very focused on because key to dealing with labor shortages is productivity gains. And that, plus the work we're doing in LinkedIn, is where we are focused on. So with that, Amy, I'll hand it over to you.",251

And Kash, as you probably noted, I did talk about, this quarter, we did add a year-over-year 14% head count growth. And I think that's important because when you talk about how, what and why, we do remain focused on being a great employer, to have people achieve those goals and be able to achieve them here.
Secondly, you asked some good questions about the supply chain impact and specifically around data center given our spend this quarter, and my guidance is it should be similar next. A lot of that, Kash, is long lead time. So we do have good understanding of lead times required to meet the capacity and signals that we're seeing. I think we did a good job managing that. It's not to say we're not impacted. Multiple suppliers are important to be able to manage through that. And I feel the team has done a very good job.
In terms of specific impacts, I noted it in some of my remarks. I do think demand will exceed supply in PCs and Surface for us this quarter, particularly in premium devices and consoles for Xbox. And another bit of -- another challenge I noted will just be we'll just need to watch the advertising market through the quarter because, obviously, their willingness to spend is entirely connected to their supply as well.",228

What are you seeing on the client side about that dynamic in terms of people moving to the cloud and kind of workloads migrating over there and hence, there's less Server & Tools versus actually kind of that being a net benefit for you? It seems like the pendulum is swinging in the other direction for you. Some help there would be helpful.",98

Let's take the most, I would say, the classic model of lift, shift and modernize motions, which is, I think, at the core of hybrid cloud. That's still in -- still early innings. Every day, I wake up to talk to customers who are planning out that motion and making sure that they're able to modernize their entire application portfolio in various ways. So that's obviously still very, very strong.
The interesting thing for us, even in that context, is even in the height of our success in the client server era, we really were never a Tier 1 company, whereas now, we are in the sense that you take all the SAP workloads that are running on Azure, which I talked about, or other Tier 1 workloads that are migrating, whether it's HPC or transactional database workloads. So that's the other thing which is happening is real production workloads moving over.
And then on the data estate, that's the place where perhaps we're seeing significant traction. And I referenced that in some of my remarks, all the way from what's happening with, say, operational data stores like Cosmos DB with Synapse Link to Synapse, or Power BI to Synapse or in fact, Dynamics 365 Dataverse to Synapse. So there's tons and tons of coming together of the data estate with, for example, regulatory requirements. Now there, you need to have real governance on data. That's where Azure Purview becomes, again, a pretty big driver of that data gravity to the cloud from a governance perspective.
The other side of this is what's happening with dev tools, right, when you start having your CI/CD to your cloud, then modern new applications and the agility with which you build, so with GitHub, VS Code becoming essentially default for any modern dev shop in the enterprise or otherwise, that's the other thing that we see. But perhaps more than anything else, the interesting circuit for us is what happens with Teams, right? With Teams, you suddenly now have a new platform in which applications get hosted, whether it's developed by the enterprise or by a third party, and I referenced that in my remarks.
And those applications, in many cases, get built on our cloud, use things like Azure DB, use things like Power Platform. And so the reinforcing and compounding side of Teams, to Power Apps, to Dynamics, to Azure is probably one of the most unique things we are seeing in terms of new applications getting built. And then there is the cloud plus edge, which I referenced in the answer to the first question, which is in a multi-cloud, multi-edge world, you still need a control plane that manages all that complexity. And that's where something like Azure Arc and GitHub become the 2 standards. You develop in one place, you deploy in one place, and then you propagate to every cloud that you want to deploy in.",502

And it really points to hybrid strength. That's the way I tend to think about it. And whether that's the fact that people are committed to Windows and SQL Server when they run that in Azure or whether they run it in a multi-cloud environment, it's a commitment to the platform. And so I just wanted to make that probably more clear as one of the drivers of our server products and cloud KPI execution this quarter.",107

And clearly, your results sort of speak to that. But as we look going forward, have you seen any early indications that customers are potentially having to slow down the pace with which they move to your commercial cloud?",60

As far as we are sort of looking at, is the demand across the entire stack is pretty robust. And obviously, what happens in the labor market, whether it's in the tech labor market or any other labor market, will ultimately be something that we will all be subject to.
But the thing at least about the software businesses are, in order to deal with a lot of other constraints, whether they are labor shortages or supply shortages, deploying digital tech is one way to sort of really overcome them. So that's sort of what we see. Clearly, I think in the tech sector today, there is more structural demand than perhaps supply all around. But we like that position because at some level, we just want to make sure that we have the most competitive products out there. And as long as we continue to do so, I think we'll be fine.",168

And I do think, frankly, Brad, just the signals we're seeing on consumption and usage, I would say, customers are doing a good job of figuring out the priority list that delivers value to them as Satya's saying. I do know, obviously, that the labor market has a real impact. And I think that's also why you're seeing investments being made by us in particular into training and skilling, making deployment easier, making time-to-value faster, really having a documentation that makes getting started and trials far more accessible. And so when you talk about adding productivity, it's also an investment we at Microsoft need to make into making our products easier and really terrific to get going on so that you're not constrained in the ways that you're talking about.",131

Satya, I wanted to ask about comments you made earlier in the call around investments coming and new releases coming for some of the industry clouds, financial services, manufacturing. How do we -- how should we view this? Should we think of the Azure business results kind of driven increasingly by these industry cloud-type solutions away from horizontal-type projects like ERP, database? That's obviously been there, but is this an incremental opportunity that's coming that we should be thinking about?",87

Thank you for the question. Absolutely. We think of the Microsoft Cloud, which includes Azure, it includes Dynamics 365, it includes Microsoft 365, it includes things like Power Platform, it includes even GitHub and VS Code. So that's why we keep stressing the full modern tech stack that makes up Microsoft Cloud. And then with the industry cloud, we add value on top of that, which is specific, whether it's in retail, whether it's manufacturing, obviously, in health care. And our pending Nuance acquisition will even add further to that.
So obviously, we are very, very focused on, first of all, not any just one piece, which we -- each one of those has to be competitive on their own. It's the coming together of the Microsoft Cloud. And then the industry cloud adds further value on top of it. So yes, I think ultimately, our competitiveness comes because of all of those layers integrated and delivering that time-to-value for our customers while maintaining openness in each layer and competitiveness in each layer.",174
