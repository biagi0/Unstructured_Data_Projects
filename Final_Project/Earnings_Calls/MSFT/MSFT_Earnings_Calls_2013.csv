I'm pleased to welcome Chris as the new head of Investor Relations. Chris has been with Microsoft for over 16 years and has been in diverse finance roles, which gives him a good background for this role. I also want to thank Bill for all he has accomplished over the past 4 years and congratulate him with his new role as the CFO of the Skype division. 
This quarter, we had record revenue of $22 billion and record earnings per share of $0.81. It has been an exciting quarter with the launch of Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8. In enterprise, we continue to see solid demand for our business products and services with particularly strong growth in multiyear licensing. Multiyear licensing revenues benefited from healthy renewals of enterprise agreements as customers continued to make long-term commitments to the Microsoft platform. 
Our robust portfolio of enterprise products and services enable CIOs to build efficient infrastructure, unlock business insight, improve productivity and support bring-your-own-device. In the data center, recent releases of Windows Server 2012 and System Center 2012 are driving customer wins and strong renewals. Our Cloud OS road map uniquely positions us to support the hybrid infrastructure needs of CIOs by providing one consistent platform that can span their own data center, a partner's data center or Windows Azure with ultimate flexibility, portability and scale. 
On the data platform, we are growing our revenue share as enterprises continue to move mission-critical workloads to SQL Server and deploy it for their business intelligence solutions. In productivity, we are excited about the upcoming launch of the new Office and how it redefines user experience with mobility, social and cloud features. The new Office features a fast, fluid design that takes full advantage of the new Windows interface. With Skype and Yammer integration, it unlocks new experiences for communication and collaboration and brings social directly into productivity scenarios. 
With Windows 8, businesses will now be able to give their employees thin and light devices without compromising on security or manageability. Windows 7 momentum in the enterprise continues. And today, over 60% of enterprise desktops worldwide are in Windows 7. 
We've talked about Windows 8 as Windows reimagined, from the chipset to the user experience. As we undergo this transformation, it is important for us to bring the entire ecosystem along with us. With the launch in October, we collectively took the first of many steps in changing the way people use technology at work and in play. Since then, the number of Windows 8-certified systems has nearly doubled. The number of apps in the Windows Store has quadrupled, and Windows users have downloaded over 100 million apps. To date, we have sold over 60 million licenses of Windows 8. 
Our partners, including OEM hardware manufacturers, app developers and retailers, have worked hard to get us to where we are today. It's early days, and an ambitious endeavor like this takes time. Together with our partners, we remain focused on fully delivering the promise of Windows 8. 
As part of our work to advance the ecosystem, we launched Surface Windows RT last quarter. Surface is one part of the overall Windows 8 story. With tight integration across hardware and software, Surface highlights the unique innovations enabled by Windows 8. We launched it exclusively in our stores and in select geographies and are expanding our retail and geographic footprint. 
As we look forward, we strive to deliver seamless experiences across hardware, software and services. Windows 8, Windows Phone 8 and Xbox 360 provide a similar look and feel to users. This consistency, complemented with our cloud services like Bing, SkyDrive, Xbox LIVE and SmartGlass, unifies the consumer experience. 
In the enterprise, we continue to design and deliver world-class cloud solutions that allow our customers to move to the cloud on their own terms. Compelling experiences we deliver across our devices and services, as well as our large partner and customer base, uniquely positions us for sustained future growth. 
In summary, this quarter, the strength of our product portfolio delivered record revenue and earnings per share. As we enter calendar year 2013, there's tremendous opportunity for our partners, developers and customers to leverage the capabilities and scenarios our significant product releases have enabled. With that, I'm going to hand it back to Chris to provide more details on our results.",729
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2013",2013-01-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,2513.0,405648.0,19143692.0,Presenter Speech,Chris Suh,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Peter. First, I'm going to review our overall results and then I'll move on to the details by business segment. Revenue for the quarter was up 5% to $22 billion. Operating income was $8.3 billion, up 4%, and earnings per share was $0.81, also up 4%. Foreign exchange had a $200 million or 1 percentage point negative impact to revenue this quarter and a $154 million or 2 percentage point negative impact to net income. From a geographic perspective, we saw growth return in developed markets and saw mid-teens growth in emerging markets. 
Bookings were strong, growing 11% as we continued to see customers making long-term commitments to our products. You see the results in the following metrics: multiyear licensing revenue grew 15%; unearned revenue grew 13% to $17.4 billion; and our contracted not build balance was over $21 billion. 
Moving to Windows. This quarter, total revenue grew 11%. Within that, OEM revenue outperformed the underlying x86 PC market, reflecting increased demand in our distribution channel. While inventory levels ended the quarter at slightly higher levels than the prior year, we believe them to be in a healthy range given the recent launch. Non-OEM revenue grew over 40% driven by Windows 8 upgrades, sales of Surface and double-digit growth in volume licensing. 
Within the x86 PC market, we saw similar trends to prior quarters with emerging markets outperforming developed markets and business outperforming consumer. The consumer segment was the most impacted by the ecosystem transition as demand exceeded the limited assortment of touch devices available. 
Next, I'll walk through our Server & Tools Business, which posted another solid quarter with 9% revenue growth. Product revenue grew 9%, and within that, multiyear licensing revenue grew at 17%. On the strength of both new and existing customers, bookings grew a solid 15%. 
For the modern data center, we continue to be on the forefront of innovation with our Cloud OS road map, which provides a flexible platform for CIOs to manage their infrastructure, applications and data. With the launch of Windows Server 2012 in September, we delivered a cloud-optimized operating system and have continued to gain share in virtualization. 
To further strengthen our cloud OS platform, we have introduced a steady stream of innovation in Windows Azure, including virtual machine, media services, website services and mobile services. Our management product, System Center, continues its momentum and delivered 18% revenue growth. 
In our Data Platform business, SQL Server revenue grew 16% driven by strength in SQL Server Premium. Revenue growth continues to outpace the market as customers increasingly use SQL Server for their mission-critical application and business intelligence needs, making it the most pervasive data platform. 
On the BI side, we're delivering on our strategy to enable analysis of all types of data while also accelerating time to insight. We're empowering organizations to realize the power of big data as Hadoop is now compatible on Windows Server and Windows Azure. With SQL Server 2012, we took the next step forward in advancing in-memory capabilities and see tremendous opportunities ahead. 
Now I'll move on to the Microsoft Business Division where revenue grew 3%. Consumer revenue declined 2% with x86 PC market dynamics being partially offset by gains in attach. 
Businesses are choosing Microsoft as their productivity platform for the future. This is evidenced by the healthy 18% bookings growth and near-historical high renewal rates for Office. Business revenue grew 4%, and within that, multiyear licensing revenue grew 10%. 
Our productivity server offerings continued to perform well, and again this quarter, Exchange, SharePoint and Lync collectively grew double digits. Lync revenue grew at an impressive rate of 35% as customers continued to be drawn to both the enhanced productivity that it enables and also the economic benefits of our solution. 
Next, I'll move on to the Online Services Division where revenue grew 11%. Online advertising revenue was up 15% driven by significant search rate improvements, offset in part by a decline in display revenue. With revenue growth and ongoing expense management, we delivered another quarter of operating performance improvement. 
In the Entertainment & Devices Division, revenue declined 2%. In the important holiday season, Xbox continued its leadership position in the U.S. console market. Halo 4 launched in November and has already become the best-selling title of the critically-acclaimed gaming franchise. We did defer $380 million this quarter for games where the buyer has rights to receive content in the future. The video game deferral was included in the Q2 guidance, and we expect it to be recognized in Q3. We also continued to expand the content available in Xbox LIVE, further solidifying Xbox LIVE as the premier entertainment service in the family room. 
Windows Phone saw strong growth both in phone and patent licensing revenue. In November, we launched Windows Phone 8 with our strongest lineup of both carriers and devices. Windows Phone sales were over 4x higher than they were last year. And at CES this year, more partners were announced as the Windows Phone ecosystem continues to grow. 
Skype had 138 billion minutes of calls on its network this quarter, which was up 59%. 
Now I'll cover the rest -- remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 1% due to the full quarter of Nokia platform payments, Surface and growth in cloud infrastructure, partially offset by declines in Xbox console. Operating expenses grew 10% to $8 billion, primarily related to marketing for product launches. This quarter, our tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we returned $3.5 billion to shareholders in buyback and dividends. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Peter for our outlook.",937

For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2013. 
Looking ahead with Windows, we know that our growth depends on our ability to give customers the exciting hardware they want at the price points they demand and a wider range of apps and services to meet their diverse needs. We are hard at work with our partners to meet these goals. 
One of our biggest partners, Intel, not only delivered the Clover Trail chip this year, they said they will deliver their next-generation chip, Haswell in 2013, which will enable even more advances in the device market. This is just one example of the innovation we are seeing from our chip partners. 
We also need to continue to work with our hardware partners as they create thin and lightweight devices on both x86 and ARM chipsets that offer compelling touch experiences that bring Windows 8 to life. We started to see the next wave of Windows devices at CES. And collectively, we will work to ensure that we have the most compelling devices and the right mix of devices in the marketplace. 
During the quarter, we launched the first device in our Surface family of products. We recently increased production and expanded distribution to third-party retail partners. Next month, we will make Surface Windows RT available in 14 additional countries. At the same time, we will also launch Surface Windows 8 Pro, which provides the power and performance of a laptop in a tablet package. With the broadening of the Surface lineup, we will continue to highlight the power of Windows 8 tightly integrated with fantastic hardware. 
On the app front, we are deepening our engagement with developers. While the number of apps in the Windows Store has quadrupled since launch, we clearly have more work to do. We need more rich, immersive [ph] apps that give users access to content that informs, entertains and inspires. 
While there is a lot of work ahead of us, we are incredibly excited by the opportunities to both broaden and enrich the Windows ecosystem. With the launch of Windows 8 and Windows RT, we are positioned for growth across a massive addressable market, from tablets to laptops and Ultrabooks to all-in-ones. We will continue to work closely with our partners through this transformation as we collectively reimagine Windows. 
As you update your models, remember that the Windows Upgrade Offer expires at the end of February. At that time, we will recognize $1.1 billion, which is all of the remaining deferred revenue related to the upgrade offer. 
Within Server & Tools, product revenue, including transactional and multiyear licensing, is about 80% of the division's total revenues, and Enterprise Services is the remaining 20%. We expect product revenue to grow low teens for the third quarter and low double digits for the full fiscal year. And we expect Enterprise Services to grow mid-teens in the third quarter and the full fiscal year. 
In the Microsoft Business Division, multiyear licensing revenue, which is approximately 60% of the division's total, should grow low double digits for both the third quarter and full fiscal year. Excluding the Office deferral, transactional revenue, which is the remaining revenue in the division, should outperform the x86 PC market in the third quarter and for the full fiscal year. 
As a reminder, when updating your Q3 models, we expect to recognize between $250 million and $300 million of revenue related to pre-sales into the channel and the Office Offer. We expect most of the remainder of the deferral to be recognized at the expiration of the program in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. 
In the Online Services Division, we look to build upon improvements in share and search monetization. Through the third quarter and full fiscal year, we expect revenue growth to be consistent with the dynamics seen in the second quarter, with Search revenue growth partially offset by lower display revenue. 
Moving on to the Entertainment & Devices Division. In the third quarter, we expect to recognize $380 million related to the video game deferral. Excluding recognition of deferrals, we expect revenue to grow high teens in the third quarter and low single digits for the full fiscal year. 
Switching to overall cost of goods sold for the company. COGS growth will continue to be impacted by the change in mix of revenue, as we have seen in the past few quarters. As we look forward, excluding Surface, we expect COGS to grow high single digits for the full fiscal year. 
We are reaffirming our full fiscal year guidance for operating expenses of $30.3 billion to $30.9 billion. Other income and expense includes dividend and interest income, offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. In the current low interest rate environment, we expect these items to generally offset one another for the remainder of the year. 
We expect our effective tax rate to be 17% to 20% for the full fiscal year, and we expect capital expenditures to be about $3.5 billion for the full fiscal year. 
Through the third quarter, excluding the impact of deferrals, unearned revenue should roughly follow historical seasonal patterns. 
In summary, we delivered solid financial results for the second quarter. We have good product momentum in the market and are excited about the opportunity to help our customers take advantage of the advancing trends in technology. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris and we'll take some questions.",921

Certainly this quarter, it was a contributing factor to the revenue growth in the Windows business. And what it does is it sort of highlights some interesting innovation that can happen to sort of demonstrate the power of Windows 8 when tightly integrated with hardware and software and some new categories of devices and we're -- obviously had some limited distribution this quarter in our stores. And as you know, we're excited about expanding that. And so our goal is to continue to build that business, to highlight the incredible power of Windows 8 in an interesting set of devices. We're going to expand geographically. We're going to expand the product lineup. We're going to expand retail distribution and capacity. So we look forward to sort of continuing the growth of that business.",151

Windows devices are much higher. And I'm wondering if you could just talk about what you've learned here in the first 3 or 4 months of the Windows launch, how important price is to the customer base in terms of driving units, and what do you think the outlook is in terms of getting price points down on the devices in aggregate in order to potentially drive some demand.",105

We learned a lot this quarter. We learned a lot about the types of experiences with scenarios and, to some extent, the price points customers are looking for from their devices. We saw some really great demand for some of the touch devices that we brought to market. In some cases, we didn't have the supply that we needed to satisfy that demand. I think from a price point, we learned I think what we've always suspected, which is there's segmentation and differentiation. There's -- one of the powers in the Windows ecosystem, obviously, is the variety of devices and form factors and experiences at a variety of price points, and I think we learned that, that continues to be important. And as I said, we're working very closely with both our chip partners as well as the OEMs to bring the right mix of devices, which means, to your point, the right set of touch devices at the right price point depending on the unique needs of the individual. I think we learned a lot about that, and one of the things you'll see is a greater variety of devices at a bigger variety of price points that kind of meet the sort of differentiated needs of our consumers.",214

It looks like it's more instead of business transactional, it's more like multiyear licensing.

We've seen big increases in multiyear annuity business. Bookings growth was very strong. And so you are seeing a transition to sort of a long-term commitment to the business.

My question is about cash flow and I guess 2 factors around cash flow. But could you just drill in a little bit into the delta between bookings growth and billings growth in the quarter? And then could you also just touch on in the inventory in the quarter? It looked like it was a little above what it normally is.,67
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2013",2013-01-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,2513.0,405648.0,19143708.0,Answer,Peter Klein,,Executives,19,"Well, as always, the sort of difference between bookings growth and billings growth is going to be a function of the mix of long-term agreements, right, because our multiyear licensing agreements are 3-year agreements. And so bookings will include all of the revenue from those agreements. And then typically, those are billed a year at a time so the billings growth will be sort of that one year of billings. And so to the extent we see this sort of growth in the multiyear licensing business, you're going to see a buildup of bookings growth that's going to be fast. You're going to see a buildup of the deferred revenue, and that will then sort of enter billings and then the recognitions in the income statement over time. So to the extent that we continue to see this transition to long-term commitments, you'll expect to see that trend to continue. Your second question is on inventory. When you say inventory, you mean on balance sheet?",165

I had a question about Peter, you mentioned the renewal rates in MBD can be -- I guess they are at a record and continue to move higher. I'm just wondering if you could share with us what's driving the increase in the renewal rates and how much runway do you have left there. And then actually, I had a follow-up on Adam's question about inventory because it usually goes down in the December quarter. Obviously, you have Surface now, so it jumped up. But did we see the traditional Xbox's work-down of inventory that we normally see? So should we be looking at the fact that the delta between the drawdown that you normally see and the fact that I think it went up or was roughly flat this quarter was the result of Surface?",137

Yes, I think it's a combination of things. Heather, as you know, over time, we've been broadening the notion of how we think about productivity. And so I think it's a combination of a couple of things. One is just the product set. Lync is a big driver, SharePoint, Exchange. So the connection between the collaboration and communications technology and the enhancements to just the productivity applications themselves. I think Office 365 and the road map to the cloud is really exciting to customers. And part of the reason they're making a long-term commitment to MBD and to the Office and related products is because they really -- the -- our road map to the cloud really resonates with them and how they get there over time and how that works. And I think also, our road map from a capability perspective and what's coming in the new Office with the social, again, well, advances in the cloud is really driving sort of a road map that's compelling to customers. And so that's why they're making the long-term commitments to the platform. So that's great to see. And in inventory, yes, you're thinking about it right. I think we saw the normal sort of drawdown from the Xbox business, and any offsetting increase there was related to Surface.",220

It's happened every cycle. And I guess we had some competition from tablets. We didn't quite see that kind of ""whiz"" bang effect with a typical Windows launch. I'm curious to get your take on what is it that the media and the industry seems to have gotten it wrong? What are the misperceptions about Windows 8? And how do you think the year is going to play out as far as Windows 8 receptivity in the consumer market and business market?",107

Windows 8, I talked about Windows 8 is a sort of big, bold reimagining of Windows across the whole ecosystem. And I think this was the start of that process. I think we all collectively learned a lot about from the user interface to the touch devices. And as I tried to give context on the call, there's a lot of things we're working on with our partners that I think could continue to drive this process forward over the next several quarters, whether it's the chipset, whether it's with developers or the kinds of applications that people want and certainly for the kinds of touch devices at the right price points that consumers want. I think all of that is continuously improving, we're continuously learning and happens over time. But this is a big, ambitious reimagining of Windows, and this quarter was the first step in that process.",152

And so at any point in time, it's really going to depend on that mix of revenue, which is just going to cycle over time.

And your comments imply some Windows inventory build in the channel, which I believe you normally see during a quarter. With a Windows launch, OEMs build inventory in preparation for launch. Would it be accurate to assume that the Windows out-performance was primarily -- I mean, relative to the PC market was primarily due to the inventory build? Or was there something else there happening? Was there anything else -- you used to give us that bridge, which you haven't for a while now, but I just wonder if any of those other factors had a big influence?",109

To your point, there was some tailwind from inventory, which was normally, as you highlight, kind of what we see in a launch quarter. And as Chris said, it's within sort of the healthy range that we typically see, but that was some tailwind. But the 3 big impacts all up in Windows revenue were the retail upgrades, sale of Surface and the enterprise annuity business, which continues to grow double digits.",114

But certainly, as we highlighted, the dynamics on revenue will be relatively consistent to what you see this quarter. In terms of the monetization, it's what we've been very focused on. It's partly just the work we've done with our partnership with Yahoo!, and part of it is the quality of the searches that we've been doing. It's sort of the realization of all the work we've been doing on both the search engine as well as the ad platform to make sure it's finally tuned to deliver the best economic results. And that's what we've been -- and we've been talking about this for, gosh, 1.5, 2 years. We've been really focused on that with our best talent.

And in terms of the use cases, there's a couple of things that sort of fall into that -- those buckets, the mission-critical and BI. In terms of mission-critical, we're seeing large enterprise customers sort of re-platforming on SQL for any number of things, underneath their ERP, underneath what other kind of major sort of LOB apps they have that sort of drive their business. And that's really an emerging trend with 2012 in what that does, and that's really advanced. And I would add that, that's been one of the drivers of our transition to multiyear licensing because now we're seeing customers commit more and more to SQL as part of their multiyear enterprise agreements as well. On the BI side, the combination of SQL as well as SharePoint and Excel is really compelling to customers in terms of the business insights they can generate from their line of business application systems. And I think really, the combination of the types of what you see front end on Excel on top of the SQL database has really been a powerful driver for both businesses, frankly. And that's a lot of what's driving the multiyear licensing business up for both MBD and STB.",217

And so I expect to see sort of a steady drumbeat between now and the end-of-life XP support in April 2014 for that to continue because the incentive is there and the expressed desire to do that has been expressed by our customers.

They like the ability to get thin, lightweight devices with the kind of security and manageability that they're used to, to manage their businesses.

Before I get into my comments about the quarter, let me say a few words about the CFO transition we announced today. As we all do throughout our careers at various times, we assess our personal and professional goals and priorities. Sometimes we change jobs, sometimes we change companies and sometimes we step back and focus on family and other personal goals. As we approach the end of our fiscal year, for me personally, it's a good time to refocus my priorities and spend time with family in a way I haven't previously had the chance. I feel great that the company is on a path to an exciting future in devices and services, and I couldn't be more proud of and confident in the finance organization. I look forward to working with my successor on the transition, including getting out and meeting with many of you. I have truly enjoyed working with all of you. 
And now on to the quarter. I'm pleased to report we drove revenue and earnings per share growth of 8% even as we navigate an evolving device market. Our results reflect our diversified portfolio, as well as the investments we have made in key strategic areas. During the quarter, we launched a new Office, our enterprise cloud services continued to gain traction and we continued to take market share in the Data Platform. 
Before I dive into more details on our progress in these areas, I want to address what's top on mind for many of you, which is our Windows business. There is no doubt the device market is evolving. Consumers and businesses are increasingly shifting their focus to touch and mobility. And as a result, they want touch-enabled computing devices that are ultrathin, lightweight and have long battery life. While Windows revenue has been impacted by the transition from the traditional PC to a new era of computing devices, the overall addressable markets are growing, and we are excited by the opportunities ahead of us. 
We built Windows 8 with touch and mobility at the center of the experience, which positions us well in this new era. However, the transition is complicated, given the size of our hardware and software ecosystem. We still have an immense amount of work to do, yet we feel good about the foundation we have laid and are optimistic about the long-term success of Windows. 
I want to take some time now to be clear about where we are in this journey and what we are doing to help drive this change. With Windows 8, we are setting a new accelerated pace for updates and innovations as we focus on making the Windows experience richer and better. Since launch, we have delivered several important updates to improve our mail, storage, search, music and video services. 
During the quarter, we also added to the Surface family of devices the Surface Pro, which combines the performance capabilities of a PC with a modern tablet design. Looking ahead, we will release the next version of Windows, code-named Windows Blue, which further advances the vision of Windows 8, as well as response to customer feedback. 
The assortment of touch-enabled devices that are built for Windows 8 by our OEM partners is also improving. Over the last couple of months, we started seeing devices that take full advantage of Windows 8, and we expect to see more devices across more attractive price points over the coming months. 
As part of this, we are also working closely with OEMs on a new suite of small touch devices powered by Windows. These devices will have competitive price points, partly enabled by our latest OEM offerings designed specifically for these smaller devices and will be available in the coming months. 
In the upcoming back-to-school selling season, we expect to see devices that incorporate advances from throughout the supply chain, including chipsets. As well, Intel's fourth-generation core processor will help enable new devices that combine performance benefits with power savings. Later in the year, we expect to see devices based on Intel's upcoming Bay Trail Atom processor, which promises to deliver tablets and hybrid PCs with extended battery life at competitive prices. 
Today in the Windows Store, there are 6x as many apps since launch, and we expect more to be added as we gain traction with Windows 8 adoption. In June, we will host Build, our developer conference, where we will provide more tools and information for developers to build great Windows 8 apps. 
In retail, we are working to improve the consumer purchasing experience. Our initiatives include focused efforts to further educate and incentivize retail sales professionals and to have better in-store product differentiation. 
In summary, Windows is transforming to the new era of computing. As I said on our last earnings call, growth in Windows depends on our ability to give customers the exciting hardware they want at the price points they demand and a wider range of apps and services to meet their diverse needs. We are hard at work with our partners to meet these goals, and we're confident we are moving in the right direction. 
Now switching gears to productivity. This quarter, we launched the latest version of Office, which brings mobility, social and cloud features to the world's most popular productivity apps. Importantly, the new Office represents a fundamental shift in our model. Now both businesses and consumers can Access Office through subscription. With this shift, we expect to grow our customer base, increase customer satisfaction via continuous updates and reduce piracy. 
As our enterprise customers modernize their productivity infrastructures, we are confident they will continue to deploy Office 365. We also expect our transactional customers to increasingly transition to the cloud with Office 365. It's been a while now that we've been talking about our investments in the cloud, and I'm pleased to share that we are starting to realize the benefits of those investments in a meaningful way. Office 365 lights up with this latest release as evidenced by our growing customer adoption. This quarter was our strongest ever, with net seat additions up 5x over the prior year. 1 in 4 of our enterprise customers now has Office 365, and the business is on a $1 billion annual revenue run rate. 
Our Server & Tools Business continues its momentum with yet another solid quarter of revenue growth. Within the Data Platform, we continue to take share with our strength in mission-critical and business intelligence workloads. Enterprise has recognized the power of SQL Server to unlock business insight. And as a result, we continue to significantly outpace the market and are seeing new deployments and very healthy renewals. 
In enterprise cloud, just in the last week, we launched our Windows Azure Active Directory and Infrastructure as a service offering on Windows Azure. This innovation across platform and infrastructure services uniquely positions Microsoft as the only cloud provider who can offer customers a comprehensive hybrid cloud solution that integrates existing IT infrastructure with all the benefits of the public cloud. 
Xbox continues to be at the center of our living room strategy, having evolved from gaming to an entertainment platform. Whether they are playing games, being social or watching movies, consumers continue to be drawn to Xbox LIVE. Xbox LIVE now has over 46 million members, up 18% from the prior year. Clearly, there's a lot of momentum. And with E3 only a couple of months away, we look forward to sharing more shortly. 
In summary, our diversified portfolio drove solid revenue and earnings per share growth. We are hard at work here at Microsoft and with our partners to drive Windows 8 adoption forward. At the same time, we have strong momentum in our enterprise businesses, including our cloud services. Combined with our unique consumer assets like Xbox LIVE and Skype, we are well positioned to deliver on our devices and services strategy. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Chris to discuss our quarterly results in more detail. I'll then come back to discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter and beyond.",1353
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2013 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2013",2013-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,2310.0,444429.0,20790287.0,Presenter Speech,Chris Suh,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Peter. First, I'm going to review our overall results, and then I'll move on to the details by business segment. 
Our diversified portfolio helped us deliver solid financial growth this quarter. Revenue was up 8% to $18.8 billion, and operating income increased 5% to $6.7 billion. Earnings per share grew 8% to $0.65. 
Foreign Exchange had a $180 million or 1 percentage point negative impact to revenue this quarter and a $99 million or 2 percentage point negative impact to net income. From a geographic perspective, we saw similar growth rates across both developed and emerging markets. Multiyear licensing revenue continued to be strong, growing 16%. Additionally, unearned revenue grew 13% to $17.1 billion, and our contracted not build balance was over $21 billion. 
In the Windows Division, revenue was flat this quarter. Within that, OEM revenue performance was in line with the underlying x86 PC market, which continues to be challenged as the PC market evolves beyond the traditional PC to touch and mobile devices. 
This quarter, inventory levels were drawn down as the channel awaits new Windows 8 devices. Non-OEM revenue grew 40% this quarter, driven by sales of Surface and continued double-digit growth in volume licensing. Businesses continue to value the Windows platform. Volume licensing of Windows is on track to deliver almost $4 billion in revenue this year and nearly 3/4 of enterprise agreements that we signed this year include Windows. Additionally, this quarter, we saw continued progress in the transition of Windows XP to Windows 7, and now 2/3 of enterprise desktops are running Windows 7. 
Next, I'll move on to our Server & Tools business, where we continue to have good momentum. Revenue grew 11%, highlighted by multiyear licensing revenue, which grew 20%. The strength in multiyear licensing reflects the commitment and confidence that our customers have in our products and road map. 
In the Data Center, the premium version of Windows Server, which targets Tier 1 application workloads, saw significant revenue growth again this quarter. Companies, such as Domino's Pizza and Xerox, continue to look to Hyper-V System Center to deliver their critical business application. Revenue for System Center grew 22% and Hyper-V, our virtualization product, have gained 4 points of market share over the past year. 
Our momentum in public cloud continues with more innovation, greater customer adoption and a comprehensive suite of offerings. Enterprise customers, like NBC Sports and 3M, continue to choose Windows Azure for their cloud platform needs. Recently, we launched Windows Azure Active Directory, which is an identity and access management solution designed to support cloud-based line of business applications. Today, over 2.9 million businesses, government bodies and schools are already enjoying the benefits of Windows Azure Active Directory, using it to manage access to Office 365, Dynamics CRM Online, Windows Intune and Windows Azure. 
In our Data Platform business, SQL Server revenue grew 16% and again outpaced the broader market. The usage of SQL Server for Tier 1 applications continues to grow based on functionality, reliability and value. In addition to our efforts in big data, we are developing in-memory VI technologies built right into SQL Server that achieve breakthrough improvements in transaction processes. 
Now I'll move on to the Microsoft Business Division, where revenue grew 5%. Within that, business revenue grew 10%, driven by 16% growth in multiyear licensing. In January, we launched the new Office for consumers. The new Office introduces touch, social and mobile scenarios, as well as tight integration of SkyDrive, enabling access to documents from any device. The new Office is also available as a subscription, which benefits customers as they are always using the most modern version of Office. 
As Peter stated, we expect this shift to grow our customer base, and we saw strong adoption -- strong early adoption of the subscription service. I would like to remind you that with subscription, the revenues are earned ratably over the length of the subscription rather than at initial purchase. All up, consumer revenue was roughly in line with the consumer PC market, influenced by this shift to subscription and strong attach gain. 
In terms of our productivity server offering, we continue to see strength with Exchange, SharePoint and Lync, each growing double digits. Specifically, Lync revenue grew over 30% again this quarter, with excitement around the platform continuing to grow. 90 of the Fortune 100 companies are now using Lync, and there are more than 5 million seats with enterprise voice deployed. 
At our Lync 2013 Conference in February, we announced that Lync and Skype connectivity for presence, instant messaging and voice will be available to all Lync users by the end of June. Connecting these audiences is a key milestone as we deliver on the promise of truly unified communications. 
Next I'll move on to the Online Services Division, where revenue grew 18%. Online advertising revenue was up 22%, driven by another quarter of significant search rate improvement. Operating performance improved 45% this quarter, driven by revenue growth and continued expense management. 
In the Entertainment & Devices Division, revenue grew 33%. Xbox sold 1.3 million consoles and maintained its share position in the soft console market. Xbox LIVE continued its strong momentum, and we continuously look for ways to further extend the value of Xbox LIVE for both our members and content partners. As evidence of the expanding benefits, we saw transactional revenue grow roughly twice as fast as member growth this quarter. 
Momentum with Windows Phone continues to build. The device is now available at a broad range of price points, are receiving great reviews and carrier support, continues to grow. We now have over 10% share in several countries but realize there is still a lot of work ahead to break through in some key markets. With growing awareness of Windows Phone and sustained innovation from our hardware partners, we feel well positioned to continue our momentum. 
Now I'll cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 21%, principally driven by Surface, growth in cloud infrastructure and royalties on Xbox LIVE content and video games. Operating expenses grew 4%, primarily related to product launch marketing. This quarter, our effective tax rate was approximately 19%. And finally, we returned $2.9 billion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Peter for our outlook.",1055

For the remainder of the call, I will discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter and share some thoughts on fiscal year 2014. 
Let me start with the fourth quarter. In the Windows Division, similar to this quarter, revenue will continue to reflect sales of Surface and strong volume licensing, while OEM revenue will be impacted by the declining traditional PC market as we work to increase our share in tablets. 
Within Server & Tools, product revenue, including transactional and multiyear licensing, is about 80% of the division's total revenue. Enterprise Services is the remaining 20%. We expect both product and Enterprise Services revenue to grow low double digits. 
In the Microsoft Business Division, multiyear licensing revenue, which is approximately 60% of the division's total, should grow low double digits. Excluding the recognition of revenue from the Office Upgrade Offer, transactional revenue, which is the remaining 40% of the division's total, should be in line with the x86 PC market. As a reminder, when updating your Q4 model, we expect to recognize approximately $780 million of revenue related to the Office Upgrade Offer. 
In the Online Services Division, we expect revenue to grow low double digits, reflecting growth in search revenue, partially offset by lower display revenue. 
Moving on to the Entertainment & Devices Division. We expect revenue to grow mid-teens. For the fourth quarter, we expect COGS to grow mid-teens, including Surface. Other income and expense includes dividend and interest income, offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. In the current low interest rate environment, we expect these items to generally offset. We are reducing our full fiscal year guidance for our operating expenses to $30.2 billion to $30.5 billion. This range excludes the impact of the European Commission fine of $733 million. 
For the full fiscal year, we expect our effective tax rate, excluding the expense related to the European Commission fine, to be 17% to 20%. And we continue to expect the capital expenditures to be about $3.5 billion. Excluding the impact of the Office Upgrade Offer, unearned revenue should roughly follow historical seasonal patterns. 
Now turning to fiscal 2014. We expect fiscal 2014 operating expenses to be $31.6 billion to $32.2 billion, which represents growth of 4% to 6% on the midpoint of our updated fiscal 2013 guidance. We will continue to prioritize our spending while investing in the significant opportunity that is ahead of us. 
As we look towards the future, we have a solid foundation of products and services in market, and our leadership team is collectively focused on advancing every one of our businesses. You could expect to hear more about the specific actions we are taking over the next few months. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris, and we'll take some questions.",469

We've been looking for a lot of this, so it's very helpful. Let me ask, I guess, 2 related parts to that. Can you give us a sense on the growth metrics in terms of Office 365, which is what you're starting to give here in terms of revenue, users, customers, something that we can think about there? And the second half of it, can you give us a sense in terms of the percentage of Office 365 customers that are net new to Exchange? I know you've given a little bit of data on SMB and new SMB customers, but any sense there would be appreciated.",113

Thanks, Mark. On Office 365, the metric that we gave was net seat additions are up 5x over the prior year, so that gives you some growth metric in addition to the revenue number. To your point on Exchange or more broadly, I would say, about other workloads, we're seeing exactly that dynamic. So not only are we addressing and reaching new customer segments like SMB, but many of them have never had a productivity server workload before, not just Exchange but others as well. And even those that had Exchange are now using other workloads. And so we're seeing most of our customers having more than one workload. So across every dimension in terms of new revenue streams from the service, new customer segments and new workloads, there's a lot of new and that's what's driving the growth and the opportunities that we've been looking for.",150

As I said, we are expanding both the product set and distribution, and that is broadly all devices inclusive of Surface. We are expanding distribution of Surface. We're now in 22 countries, 70 retailers. And we'll continue to look to expand -- not only just expanding, but improving the experience. And that's true not just for Surface but for broadly our Windows 8 devices.

I'm just wondering first if you could weigh in on that using the past, given some sort of range. And then related to that is if you look at the second half, I'm wondering how you should -- we should set our expectations around this kind of mid- to high-end Haswell release from Intel in terms of impact that they have on the PC market versus the later in year, more holiday time lower-end Atom release and how those 2 chip releases may have an impact on what you're expecting from the device market and overall impact on Windows?",145

On the PC market, I would look to some of the third parties, IDC and Gartner, they're sort of in the 12, 13, 14  down range this quarter. And in terms of the chipset, we've always felt that with Windows 8, there is a process of the ecosystem really innovating across the board and really starting to see there on the chips. And we're very encouraged by both Haswell and some of the Atom processors to really improve the overall user experience that Windows 8 delivers. And over the coming selling season, I think that's very encouraging, and we're optimistic about that.",105

I think it was last night. You obviously mentioned it. I guess I'm just wondering what can you guys do to specifically help grow your tablet share, given you are reliant x the Surface products on OEM partners to really hit the broad segment of the market. And I'm thinking in general, given the OEM partners don't have much wiggle room on the margin side, what can you do to help kind of stimulate your market share of -- in particular, in the mobility and then the tablet side? And good luck in the future, we're going to miss you.",124

You know I've enjoyed working with you. I think broadly in improving our position in tablets and just generally in devices, there's 5 or 6 dimensions, ranging from what we're doing with OEMs on the devices and the range of devices and how we're taking -- have a range of price points, what we're doing -- what the chips can do because I think that's a part of it, both first-party and third-party applications, and we've seen improvements across the board there, the user interface and how we're innovating across the user experience and then distribution. So if you start sort of from the bottom up all the way to when you buy the products, we're working across all those dimensions. And on the device side, we are working closely with the OEMs to help them take Windows 8 and show it off in all its glory across different form factors I talked about, new smaller form factors and how Windows 8 can innovate to improve that experience. And so I think the biggest thing we're doing is helping them develop new and improved user experiences across the board, across size, across price points to deliver a really compelling Windows 8 experience. And it's not just the devices. Like I said, it's chips. it's the apps, it's the buying experience, it's the user interface. So really focus on all 5 or 6 of those dimensions going forward.",238

You mentioned on the call that going through subscription revenues does have a near-term impact on revenues.

Yes, we are seeing that, particularly on our transactional business in MBD as people move from what may have been a transactional perpetual license, where the revenues recognized up front, to a subscription service, where it's recognized ratably. So you're basically deferring the rest of the term of the subscription. So in the short term, you'll be deferring revenue that if were bought not into subscription would have been recognized immediately. Over -- and as the subscription business is growing, you'll see that impact growing. But over time, what you'll get is more it looks like an annuity revenue stream that's more predictable and has higher customer satisfaction and probably higher retention rates going forward. But in the short term, that will impact mostly in the transactional side of the MBD business.",137

And so depending on where you are in the quarter, the biggest driver of what your gross margin is going to be is mix. So if you have a big hardware quarter that has low gross margin, that will impact it. The biggest things that are going to impact the mix are going to be hardware, cloud services and enterprise services or people services. It is a fact that we are starting to get scale in our cloud services, and so the growth that we're seeing in Office 365 is really coming at an improved margin as we scale that out. So within each, we make progress. And then overall, in a given quarter for the company, it's going to be a function of mix. So obviously in a -- being a holiday quarter where you sell a bunch of hardware, that will have an impact on gross margin. But I think one of the main takeaways for me is -- particularly some of our cloud services, we're really starting to get scale. Bing, it continues to improve their margin. And Office 365 is really starting to get to scale. So those things are really encouraging.",211

With infrastructure as a service, we now have the most complete end-to-end offering through platform and software, identity and access. But having the infrastructure is a key enabler and, I think, a real accelerator for the Windows Azure strategy and really, more broadly the cloud OS strategy. We now have a complete end-to-end story through the Data Center from private to hosted to public through -- from the infrastructure to the platform. So I think it's, again, a key enabler of that all-up strategy and accelerator.",113

I think you were talking about PC inventory. But with the Windows business, can you give us your assessment of what Windows inventory is at OEMs, especially given the disappointing PC shipment data this quarter?",75

So in recent periods, we've seen your MBD growth significantly outpace PC unit growth, although we now have a dynamic where your Office subscriptions is really resonating with customers. So the question is, just looking at this on a directional basis, is MBD revenue out-performance relative to PC unit, something that you think is sustainable going forward?",68

It's certainly an offset between attach gains we're making against the market, the offset against some deferral as revenue moves to a subscription. And so it will kind of depend each quarter. Long term, it's a great trend because we're building up a banked book of business on the subscription side, which will become less and less connected to the PC market.",69

I mean, clearly, there are tough spots in the economy. I think enterprises and CIOs are looking for what they've always been looking for, which is how do they get the best value for their dollar to move their businesses forward. And I think we have a very good story in terms of the value that enterprises and small and medium businesses get from the capabilities that they can get from us, particularly in the Data Center with SQL. And as you compare SQL Server to competing products, the performance that you get relative to the price is a really compelling value proposition, and that's what's been enabling us to take share, same on virtualization as well. And so I think for us, it's a combination of having the most complete road map for getting to the cloud, as well as the best collection of products that have price performance characteristics that are attractive to CIOs, that are allowing us to have growth in our enterprise business and particularly in Server & Tools.",190

On your first question, there wasn't anything sort of abnormal in terms of the trends during the quarter. On your second question, I think the upgrade cycle, particularly for businesses, will be interesting over the next year. I think over the longer term, what's more interesting is the long-term evolution we're seeing in the device market, which I think is actually going to be more of a driver than any sort of temporal upgrade cycle. I think people are looking to innovations happening faster. People are getting new experiences in new form factors. I think that's what Windows 8 was designed to take advantage of. So I think about the opportunity more about the new capabilities and the new sets of services and the experiences people can get on their devices and different kinds of devices than it is about an upgrade cycle that's driven by something else.",150

Thanks for joining us today. In many ways, our fourth quarter results reflect the trends we saw developing throughout the fiscal year. The consumer x86 PC market declined as users continued to prioritize devices to touch and mobility. At the same time, we saw continued strength in our enterprise products and cloud solutions and increased adoption of our consumer services. 
This quarter, our Windows business declined as the device market continued to evolve beyond the traditional PC. We are working to transition the business into this modern era of computing, taking advantage of the new scenarios enabled by Windows 8. As we've said before, given the complexity of the ecosystem, this journey will take time, but we continue to make incremental progress. 
In June, we released the public preview of Windows 8.1. It blends the desktop and modern experience and has new features and improvements in areas such as personalization, search, built-in apps and cloud connectivity. Windows 8.1 will be a free update to existing Windows 8 users and will be made available to OEMs in August, less than 1 year since launch. 
To increase and improve retail distribution, we entered into a strategic partnership with Best Buy to create a Windows store in over 600 Best Buy locations. These store-within-a-store locations provide a large-scale, hands-on consumer experience that showcases Microsoft devices and services. 
The percentage and breadth of touch devices available at retail continues to improve. The first 8-inch Windows tablet came available at retail a few weeks ago. It has legacy application compatibility, includes Microsoft Office and retails for less than $400. We expect additional compelling small-screen devices to be available in the coming months. 
Less than a year ago, we launched Surface RT and Surface Pro, each with a unique value proposition. Surface is one part of our journey to bring innovative, compelling Windows devices to market in the modern era of computing. With each step, we analyze our progress and fine-tune our action plan as needed. 
Here's what we did this quarter. We reduced the price of Surface RT by $150 to $349 per device. As a result of this price change, as well as inventory adjustments for related parts and accessories, we recorded a $900 million charge to our income statement. While this resulted in a negative $0.07 impact on earnings, we believe this pricing adjustment will accelerate Surface RT adoption and position us better for long-term success. 
We also increased retail distribution in the quarter. Surface is now available in 29 markets and 10,000 retail locations. We expanded availability of Surface to our business and institutional customers. Through our new channel expansion program, commercial customers are able to purchase Surface devices from authorized resellers in the U.S. Over the next few months, we will authorize commercial distributors and resellers in more countries. 
So in summary on Windows, we are working hard with our partners to gain share in the evolving and growing device market. I want to be very clear, we know we have to do better, and that's one reason we made the strategic and organizational changes we made last week. With over 1.5 billion Windows users around the world, a transition of this magnitude takes time. We are confident we are moving in the right direction. 
Now on to our Enterprise business, which continues to be strong. We closed out the year with record unearned revenue of $22.4 billion as businesses continue to make long-term commitments to the Microsoft platform. 
Within our Server & Tools Business, we continue to make significant improvements in performance, reliability and scalability with SQL Server. As a result, customers are increasingly moving mission-critical and BI workloads to the platform. 
While SQL Server has been the unit share leader in the market for some time, it has consistently outgrown the market over the past 12 months and is now the second largest database in revenue share. We recently announced the next versions of Windows Server and System Center, which will continue to deliver on our Cloud OS vision. With new features and enhancements in virtualization, storage and networking, we are empowering our customers to more efficiently manage their application services and their private, hosted and public cloud infrastructures. 
In Windows Azure, we continue to innovate and broaden our cloud platform offering. We recently announced an important enterprise partnership with Oracle that will enable customers to run Oracle software on Hyper-V and in Windows Azure. 
In June, we announced the public preview of Windows Azure in China, operated by 21Vianet, making Microsoft the first multinational organization to offer public cloud services in China. As a result of the greater choice and flexibility, we are seeing increased customer traction, both in terms of an increase in enterprise customers, but also the average deal size. 
Our productivity solutions continue to be a top priority for CIOs. As enterprise customers look to modernize their productivity infrastructures, they are increasingly turning to Office 365. 
We recently announced the expansion of commercial availability into several new markets, making Office 365 available in over 125 markets worldwide. I'm pleased to share that momentum is accelerating, and Office 365 is now on a $1.5 billion annual revenue run rate. 
During the quarter, we saw ongoing momentum for our consumer services, such as Office 365 Home Premium, SkyDrive, Xbox LIVE, Skype and Outlook.com. By giving consumers rich, high-value experiences across productivity, communications and entertainment, these services can help give our products and our overall ecosystem a strategic advantage in today's marketplace, where the line between home and work is blurring for many customers. 
Our unified communication offering of Skype and Lync are great examples of what customer enterprise products can be mutually reinforcing and create more opportunity for Microsoft. 
In summary, the fourth quarter continued many of the trends we saw developing throughout the fiscal year. We continued to make important strides toward our strategy, to create a family of devices and services for individuals and businesses, to empower them for the activities they value the most. 
Some of our investments are already paying off, while others reinforce the foundation that positions us for future growth and profitability. With that, I'll hand it over to Chris to give more details about this quarter, before I come back to share thoughts on the first quarter of fiscal 2014.",1056
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2013",2013-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,2383.0,485324.0,22407300.0,Presenter Speech,Chris Suh,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Amy. First, I'm going to review our overall results and then I'll move on to the details by business segment. Revenue was up 3% to $19.2 billion, and operating income declined 11% to $6.2 billion. Earnings per share declined 19% to $0.59. Foreign exchange had a $257 million or 1 percentage point negative impact to revenue this quarter and a $177 million or 3 percentage point negative impact to net income. 
From a geographic perspective, revenue in the U.S. was strong relative to other regions. Annuity revenue continued to be strong, growing 13%. We had record unearned revenue of $22.4 billion and our contracted not billed balance was approximately $21 billion. 
Now to the results for the Windows Division, where revenue declined 5% this quarter. The x86 PC market continued to decline. While business PC showed modest growth, we estimate consumer PCs declined more than 20%. As a result, OEM revenue declined 15%. OEM revenue lagged the PC market, primarily due to market dynamics in China and lower ASPs, reflecting the introduction of our small-screen touch offering and current period incentive program. 
Non-OEM revenue grew 22%, driven by sales of Surface and continued double-digit growth in volume licensing, as businesses across all areas and segments continued to value the Windows platform. 
This quarter, we saw continued progress in the transition from Windows XP. And today, almost 3/4 of enterprise desktops are running Windows 7. Volume licensing of Windows delivered more than $4 billion in revenue this year. 
Next I'll walk through our Server & Tools business, which posted another solid quarter with 9% revenue growth and double-digit bookings growth. Product revenue grew 9%, driven primarily by growth in premium versions of Windows Server and SQL Server. 
Our cloud momentum continues with strong customer adoption, upsell to higher-level services and increased innovation. We released a number of Azure services, including mobility, media and website services, and a growing number of customers are already using multiple services for their cloud platform needs. We added 25% more enterprise customers this quarter, and now over 50% of the Fortune 500 are using Windows Azure. 
In the Data Center, System Center revenue grew 14%, and the premium version of Windows Server continued to see significant revenue growth. Hyper-V, our virtualization product, continued to gain market share over the past year. Companies such as Aston Martin and Grant Thornton continue to look to Hyper-V and System Center to deliver their critical business applications. 
In the Data Platform business, SQL Server revenue grew 16% and again outpaced the broader market. Last month, we announced SQL Server 2014, the next version of our Data Platform, which has in-memory capabilities built right into the core database. We also announced Power BI for Office 365, a cloud-based BI solution that combines the power of SQL Server with the familiarity of Office. 
Now I'll move on to the Microsoft Business Division, where revenue grew 2%. Within that, business revenue grew 7%, driven by 10% growth in annuity revenue. Consumer revenue declined 27%. Results in our consumer business were driven by declines in the consumer x86 PC market and the shift to subscription, offset in part by attached games. 
As our customers transition to this new subscription model, there's a short-term impact to revenue due to the changes in the timing of revenue recognition. But over time, we expect our revenue to grow and become more recurring and predictable. 
With the subscription model, we are providing greater value to our customers, through frequent product updates, new cloud services and attractive pricing. We saw strong early adoption of the subscription offering and now have more than 1 million Office 365 Home Premium subscribers. It's been a big year for Office 365, and as Amy said, it's now on a $1.5 billion annual revenue run rate. This was our strongest quarter ever with more net seat adds in the quarter than all of fiscal 2012. 
We're seeing strong upsell, with 1 and 3 Office 365 seats now running premium workloads. 
In terms of our productivity offerings, we continued to see strength with Exchange, SharePoint and Lync, each growing double digits. Lync revenue grew over 30%, driving our enterprise communication business to deliver more than $1 billion revenue this fiscal year. Additionally, we met a key milestone in the Lync and Skype integration, and users can now seamlessly communicate in voice and IM across the 2 services. 
Next, I'll move on to the Online Services Division, where revenue grew 9% and operating performance improved by $107 million or 22%. Online advertising revenue was up 11%, driven by both rate and volume improvements in our Search business. 
In the Entertainment and Devices Division, revenue grew 8%. Xbox LIVE transaction revenue grew nearly 20% and is providing economic opportunities for publishers in the soft console market. This quarter, we announced our next generation gaming and entertainment console, Xbox One, and at E3, we showcased an impressive line of games that will be coming to the new platform. 
Progress with Windows Phone continues as our partners, including Nokia, Samsung, Huawei and HTC, are delivering new phones at a broader range of price points. Telefonica also recently announced an enhanced marketing effort to promote Windows Phone 8 devices. And with the recent Sprint announcement, Windows Phone 8 devices will now be available on all major U.S. operators. 
Now I'll cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 14%, principally driven by Surface and growth in cloud infrastructure. Operating expenses grew 9%, primarily related to sales and marketing for Surface and Windows 8. 
This quarter, our CapEx increased as we continue to invest in our cloud infrastructure and expand our geographic footprint to support the growth in our online businesses. And finally, we returned $2.9 billion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Amy for our outlook.",978

Before I discuss our expectations for the first quarter, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing last week's announcement on One Microsoft. If you haven't already done so, I encourage you to read our strategy memo and Steve Ballmer's email to employees. 
Microsoft is rallying behind a single strategy. As a part of this, we implemented a new organizational structure that will allow us to advance our strategy more quickly and more efficiently. We are currently in the process of determining what changes, if any, will be made to our reporting segment. 
In late September, we will host an analyst event here in Redmond, at which point we will discuss our strategy, our new organizational structure and any changes to our reporting segment. We will also give more thoughts on our full year outlook at that time. Please look for additional details from Chris over the coming weeks. 
Now moving on to our expectations for the first quarter. In Windows, we expect revenue to continue to be negatively impacted by the decline in the consumer x86 PC market. Excluding the impact of the Windows Upgrade Offer in the prior year, OEM revenue should account for approximately 65% of the division's revenue and should decline mid-teens. 
Non-OEM revenue should account for approximately 35% of the division's revenue, primarily reflecting revenue from volume licensing and Surface, including Surface RT at new price points. When updating your models, please keep in mind that in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, prior to the launch of Surface, OEM accounted for 75% of the division's total revenue. 
Within Server & Tools, product revenue, including transactional and multiyear licensing, is about 80% of the division's total, while Enterprise Services is the remaining 20%. We expect both product and Enterprise Services revenue to grow high single-digits. 
In the Microsoft Business Division, we expect business revenue to account for approximately 85% of the division's total, while consumer revenue should account for the remaining 15%. Business revenue should grow mid-single-digits, reflecting low double-digit growth in annuity and the shift from transaction licensing to cloud services. 
With the ongoing shift to subscription, consumer revenue will lag the x86 consumer PC market by approximately 5 percentage points, even as attach continues to grow. This excludes the impact of the Office Upgrade Offer in the prior year. As a reminder, business revenue accounted for 80% of total revenue in the prior year. 
In the Online Services Division, we expect revenue to grow low double-digits, reflecting growth in service revenue, partially offset by lower display revenue. 
With the Entertainment and Devices Division, we expect revenue to decline low single-digits as the industry awaits the next-generation consoles. 
For the first quarter, cost of goods sold will reflect Surface, as well as the impact of the capital expenditures we made in fiscal 2013. As a result, COGS should grow over 20%. 
Other income and expense includes dividends and interest income, offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. In the current low interest rate environment, we expect these items to generally offset. 
For the first quarter, regarding CapEx, we expect continued growth in our investments in our global data centers. Excluding the impact of the Windows and Office Upgrade Offers, unearned revenue should roughly follow historical seasonal patterns. 
Now turning briefly to the full fiscal year. We are reducing our operating expense guidance. We now expect fiscal year 2014 operating expenses to be $31.3 billion to $31.9 billion, with growth in the low teens for the first quarter. We expect our tax rate to be between 18% and 21% for the full fiscal year. 
In summary, as we look back on the year, fiscal 2013 was a pivotal time for Microsoft. With Windows 8, we increased our addressable market. Our OEM partners have started capitalizing on the new opportunities, delivering a wide range of new Windows hardware, from phones to tablets to new PCs. 
We extended our first-party devices through Surface and the announcement of Xbox One. We modernized productivity with Office 365, changing our business model. For the first time, both businesses and consumers can now access Office through subscription. 
We took share from key competitors in key enterprise markets. We added several new features, including Infrastructure-as-a-Service capabilities for Windows Azure. With Azure, we are fundamentally changing the way businesses manage their IT infrastructure, and we continued the expansion of our data center footprint, which enables us to deliver high-value services and experiences globally. 
As we look to fiscal 2014, we're focused on a single strategy. With our new organizational structure, we believe we'll be able to execute more quickly and more efficiently, driving long-term growth, profitability and shareholder value. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Chris, and we'll take some questions.",794

It is primarily in MBD, where we had a higher percentage of our revenue, but that was accounted for transactionally, both on the business side and in the consumer side. So I think that's why you've seen us in our outlook for Q1 try to start to explain that transition to consumer by saying that we expect it to lag the PC market by approximately 5 percentage points while attach increases [ph].",77

First, Amy, obviously, when you go to a subscription model, you have less upfront kind of lower billings that first year versus license. I wonder if you could give us sort of a backfill where dollar of cloud or Office 365 revenue would have been -- in that first year would've been $3 relative to license just so we can try to back fill and help with that transition. And also actually to Walter's question about Xbox COGS. Maybe you can give us a sense for if this cycle really should be any different than previous cycles when you thought about pricing relative to the cost of the console itself?",120

Let me take the second one because it's the most recent in my mind. I would not think about this console cycle as being any different from prior cycles. So let me go back to the first question, which is can I give an example, I believe, of how to think about the transition from how we used to recognize revenue when we bought something upfront transactionally versus buying a subscription from us. I'll give an example. If you used to buy a license from us as a consumer and paid us, for example, $100, for ease of math. We recognized the $100 in the period in which it was purchased. Now if that same person went and bought Office 365 Home Premium and once it's activated, we will recognize the revenue over the period of the purchase, which is 12 months and recognize it ratably.",154

That's a good question. As we transition to a device and services company, that is a multiyear commitment to evolve our business. And you should expect the CapEx will continue to grow as we ramp that business. With the expansion of Azure service offerings and the continued momentum in Office 365, as well as our consumer services, investing in this global footprint to meet customer demand is incredibly important and quite strategic. And really, the question is our ability to scale smartly and that will create an advantage for us that we can pass along to our customers.

I know that you had an impairment charge for the inventory clearance. But even if I back -- if I add that back in, it looks like the operating margins in the Windows business were sequentially lower, quite materially. I just wanted to get some insights into what drove that from the March quarter into the June quarter? And as you look further out into the operating margins for the Windows business, given that you're going to be focusing on Surface, how should we think about the margin structure? I guess you have a volume threshold to clear before you can start to make a margin, given that it's more of a product. But really 2 parts to that question, would love to get your insights.",138

Let me address what I think were the 2 components. The first component, so like a general question about margins this quarter for Windows. As you said, they were impacted by Surface, and the second one is by the marketing investment we continue to make in the ecosystem to move it forward. Overall, I think as you think about the Windows Division as we report it, obviously, since there's a mix between hardware and software, you should continue to expect margins to reflect that mix.",87

And it's a lot higher for the Server & Tools business, which is obviously going through a transition towards more subscription arrangements than it -- a lot higher there than in the MBD segment. And I'm just wondering if you could compare and contrast why that might be. I understand the consumer piece in MBD. But is the other piece of this just that there are more sort of traditional licensing arrangements in MBD with enterprise customers, and so the impact from the transition is all the greater and that's why you see that more subdued billings growth rate in MBD?",117

These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
Before I hand the call over to Amy, I'd like to remind you that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year. Also, please keep in mind that with our new segment-reporting structure, adjustments for items such as upgrade offers, tech guarantees and presales are consolidated into Corporate/Other to provide better comparison of operating results. 
Unless specified otherwise, all impacted numbers for the current quarter have been adjusted for the cumulative effect of last year's revenue deferrals related to the Windows Upgrade Offer, Windows 8 presale, the Office Offer and a $113 million revenue deferral in the current quarter, primarily related to Windows 8.1 presale. You can find details of the adjustments and reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in our financial summary slide deck. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Amy.",370

By now, you've had a chance to look at our press release, earnings slide deck, key performance indicators and our 10-Q. Our results have been reported using the new reporting framework I first discussed at our Financial Analyst Meeting in September. 
Since this is a new way to think about our business, I'm sure you'll have a lot of questions. So after our prepared remarks, we'll allow a little more time than usual for Q&A. And with that, let me dive right in. This quarter, we delivered record first quarter revenue. We did it while working through a significant transformation of our organization and while making significant moves to implement our new strategy. Our company is focused and delivering. 
Our Enterprise business remains strong despite a macro environment that some would characterize as tough. We are driving our business forward with industry-leading solutions in key areas like collaboration, unified communications and cloud services, and high customer satisfaction is driving high Enterprise agreement renewal rates. 
At the same time, we are making meaningful progress in our Consumer business. We saw growing engagement and adoption across our major Consumer services, including Office 365 Home Premium, Skype, Bing and SkyDrive. And with the new Windows, we're building high-value experiences for our consumers that allow people to use our devices and services all day long, whether at work or at home. 
From a geographic perspective, we saw broad-based revenue growth. Overall, both developed and emerging markets showed strength. The U.S. and parts of Western Europe were particularly strong, while China was weak. 
Now let me share some quick thoughts on the PC market, which turned out better than we had expected. We're seeing signs of stabilization in the business segment, with 2 consecutive quarters of growth and a relatively stable outlook for the next couple of quarters. While the consumer segment is more volatile, with increasing competition for share of wallet, it also performed better than expected, particularly in developed markets. 
With that backdrop, let's move on to Windows. We're seeing favorable reviews and customer enthusiasm for Windows 8.1, which became available last week. Windows 8.1 delivers on Microsoft's promise of a quick innovation cadence, launching less than 1 year after Windows 8. Based on extensive customer feedback, we added more customization capabilities, made the UI simpler and easier to use, added new and smart ways to search, improved power management and allowed multitasking, even on a tablet. 
Combined with the progress our OEM partners are making, we are collectively increasing the selection of compelling Windows devices available to meet the dynamic needs of all segments of the market. This holiday, we'll see competitive opening price points on tablets and laptops, such as the Dell Inspiron 15 for less than $300. We'll also see exciting mobile devices from 6-inch phones to 10-inch tablets, many with Microsoft Office. 
In the 6-inch category, we're incredibly excited by the Nokia Lumia 1520 tablet announced this past Tuesday. For 8-inch tablets, Toshiba, Dell and Lenovo will have devices available for less than $300; and for 10-inch tablets, we, of course, like the Nokia Lumia 2520 with LTE. 
In addition to third-party devices, we're also excited about our first-party lineup. With Surface, we are making progress with better in-market execution. As a result, we more than doubled the number of units we sold over the prior quarter. In terms of mix, Surface RT did better than expected. With Surface Pro, we saw some customers delay purchase in anticipation of Surface Pro 2, which delivers significantly improved battery and processor performance.
Moving on to the Enterprise, where demand for our solutions continues to be strong. Earlier this month, we announced our fall wave of Enterprise products and services, which touches nearly every aspect of IT. We're seeing solid growth, we're outperforming our competitors, and we are taking share in areas like virtualization and the data platform. 
Our hybrid infrastructure and management offerings continue to be top choices for CIOs, with Windows Server Premium and System Center growing double digits again this quarter. The latest versions of Windows Server, System Center and Windows Intune deliver enhancements in networking, storage and device management for Windows and alternative platforms. These enhancements will help customers realize the promise of hybrid cloud computing across their data centers, hosted clouds and Windows Azure. 
In the data platform, SQL Server continues to outpace the market. The next version, SQL Server 2014, will offer new in-memory and cloud capabilities that will increase performance and unlock new hybrid scenarios. Later this month, we will make Windows Azure HDInsight, our Hadoop-based big data solution, generally available. 
We continue to bring additional value to the Windows Azure platform. This quarter, we delivered a number of updates that enable faster connectivity, improved security and integrate access and identity across on-premise and cloud applications. With all of the innovation we're delivering to our Enterprise customers, we continue to be uniquely positioned to capture more and more of the addressable market. 
Before handing it off to Chris, I'd like to say a couple of additional things. As part of our new reporting framework, we disclosed segment gross margin. The segment breakout is important in understanding our performance because each of our businesses are impacted by different dynamics and has different margin profile. 
In Devices and Consumer, the sequential change in gross margin dollars reflects the progress we are making towards our strategy of delivering a compelling family of devices and services. While we feel good about the increased traction we saw with Surface this quarter, we know there is more to do. 
We are intensely focused on improving our capabilities in key areas like demand planning and supply chain management and on achieving scale as quickly as possible. And in Commercial, we're already seeing the benefits of the investments we've made to transform our business model from perpetual software licensing to services. 
In our Commercial Cloud business, which includes Office 365, Azure and other Microsoft services, we saw year-over-year gross margin expansion. With regards to our pending acquisition of substantially all of Nokia's devices and services business, we still expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of calendar 2014. We'll provide an update to the EPS impact, if any, post closing. 
So in summary, we are executing better, getting our customers what they want and making meaningful progress through the early stages of our transformation. And we've accomplished all of this while also working through the One Microsoft realignment and several significant announcements. 
We're committed to executing and delivering, and so far, that's what we've done. With that backdrop for the quarter, I'll hand it over to Chris to give more details about our performance before I come back and share thoughts on the outlook.",1132

First, I'll review our overall results, and then I'll move on to the details by business segments. Total revenue was up 7% to $18.6 billion and came in about $700 million better than our expectation. And without the impact from foreign exchange, revenue would have been $200 million or 1 percentage point better. 
Annuity revenue was particularly strong and grew 11%, driven by commercial performance. Cost of goods sold increased 23%, which was in line with our expectation of over 20% growth. This increase was primarily due to Surface costs and also higher depreciation related to the CapEx investments we've made to support our cloud services strategy. As a result, gross margin grew 3% to $13.5 billion, reflecting the changing mix of our revenue. 
All -- operating expenses grew 8%, which was generally in line with our expectation, with the exception of G&A, which declined due to lower legal expenses. We continue to be thoughtful and diligent in how and where we focus our resources. In advertising, the team has embraced One Microsoft, and the benefits are already accruing with improved messaging and results. And in R&D, we're continuing to focus our resources while accelerating our cadence. 
Operating income and earnings per share both declined 3% to $6.4 billion and $0.63, respectively. Unearned revenue grew a healthy 14% to $20.1 billion, and our contracted not billed balance grew to over $21 billion, driven by commercial strength. 
Our inventory balance sequentially increased by $675 million, mostly due to builds of Xbox 360 and Xbox One. Ahead of the holiday selling season, Xbox represents over half of our inventory balance. Inventory for Surface products declined sequentially, even as we built levels ahead of this week's Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2 launches. 
This quarter, we announced a 22% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.28 per share and also announced $40 billion share repurchase program. We returned $3.8 billion of cash to shareholders, our highest quarterly amount since the second quarter of fiscal 2011. 
I'm now going to talk about the performance in each of our reporting segments. Our Devices and Consumer licensing segment is comprised principally of Windows OEM, Consumer Office and Windows Phone, including related patent licensing. 
Our Windows OEM business performed better than expected, declining 7% versus our expectation of a mid-teens decline. As Amy noted, we believe we are seeing stabilization in business PCs, which grew again this quarter and drove Pro revenue growth of 6%. We also saw better-than-expected performance in the consumer part of our business. Non-Pro revenue declined 22% but with several points better than expected. Excluding the impact of China, which continues to have a different dynamic than other emerging markets, non-Pro revenue declined 17%. 
Together with our OEM and retail partners, we brought an incredible breadth of Windows devices to market. We've also made meaningful improvements to our advertising campaigns, which now clearly highlights the value proposition of our devices. As we head into holiday, we're excited by the opportunities to bring the new Windows experience to even more users around the globe. 
Consumer Office licensing revenue declined this quarter. The financial impact of the shift to Office 365 Home Premium was generally in line with our expectation. Office 365 subscribers benefit from the natural integration of services, such as SkyDrive and Skype, and have the flexibility to access the service from numerous endpoints. 
Whether via traditional licensing or subscription, customers continue to see the value in Office as overall attach of Office increased this quarter. The Windows Phone ecosystem is seeing sustained growth. While we have work to do, our share is growing in many geographies, the device portfolio is expanding, and the number of apps available in the marketplace is increasing. 
I'll now move on to our Devices and Consumer hardware segment, where revenue grew $401 million, driven almost entirely by Surface. With improved sales and marketing efforts, combined with pricing and promotional activities, we saw Surface units and revenue grow sequentially from Q4, with a mix of sales shifting towards 32-gigabyte RT device. Demand increased for this device, both the retail and in education. 
From a gross margin perspective, in addition to product costs, which grew as a result of increased Surface sale, we also incurred non-product expenses as we readied inventory line for the new Surface lineup in the holiday sales cycle. 
Moving to Devices and Consumer Other. As a reminder, this segment includes our online marketplaces, advertising, Xbox Studios, Office 365 Home Premium and other consumer products and services. This quarter, revenue growth in this segment was driven by both an increase in advertising revenue and also volumes in our online marketplaces. 
Search advertising revenue grew 47%, driven by continued revenue per search improvement and query volume growth. Bing has now grown its share of search queries in the U.S. to 18%. Gross margin declined slightly due to higher royalty costs and also infrastructure cost growth, as we expand the geographic footprint of our services. 
Turning now to our Commercial business, where all of Commercial revenue across on-prem and cloud services grew 10% this quarter. Notably, even as we invest for growth, we saw gross margin expansion in our Commercial Cloud business. Across our Commercial portfolio, we saw healthy renewal, a continued shift to premium products and strong adoption of our cloud services. 
Our Enterprise cloud strategy is resonating with customers and server product revenue grew 12%. SQL Server revenue grew double digits, with SQL Server Premium revenue growing over 30%. Our Commercial Office products also remained strong and grew 11%. Within this, SharePoint, Exchange and Lync collectively grew double digits, with Lync growing nearly 30%. 
Helping to drive this demand for our Server and Office products is deployment of hybrid cloud solution. This quarter, revenue for our Commercial Cloud services grew over 100% as services such as Office 365 are integrated with Azure services for comprehensive cloud solution. Importantly, we're seeing strong customer adoption with Office 365 seats and Azure customers both growing triple digits. 
Dynamics CRM Online is also expanding its base, with 2/3 of new Dynamics CRM customers opting for the cloud. 
With that overview of our Commercial business, let me share the financial performance of each of our Commercial reporting segments. Revenue in the Commercial Licensing segment grew 7%, and in our Commercial Other segment, revenue grew 28% to $1.6 billion.
As a reminder, Corporate and Other is where we consolidate adjustments for tech guarantees, presales and the like. In the comparable quarter of last year, we had aggregate deferrals of $1.4 billion for Windows and Office; and this quarter, we deferred $113 million, primarily related to Windows 8.1 presale. 
Having now talked to our results for the past quarter, let me turn it over to Amy to discuss our forward-looking guidance.",1130
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2013",2013-10-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3348.0,533470.0,24431554.0,Presenter Speech,Amy Hood,,Executives,4,"Thanks, Chris. As we look towards the second quarter, we are assuming the macro environment will remain generally the same. With this, we expect many of the dynamics we saw in the first quarter to continue, with strong performance in our Commercial business and ongoing improvement in our Consumer business. 
Importantly, we're set up for a terrific holiday season. We have a wide variety of Windows-based devices in market. Earlier this week, we launched Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2. And in November, we'll launch our next-generation console, Xbox One. Building on the performance and unique experiences that gamers love, it will also deliver an innovative entertainment experience by bringing movies, music, sports and live TV together in one place. 
With that, let's get into the outlook, starting with Devices and Consumer. In licensing, we expect revenue to be $5.2 billion to $5.4 billion. This range reflects similar dynamics to what we saw in the first quarter. As I noted earlier, we expect the business PC market to be stable. However, the consumer PC market is subject to more volatility. 
In hardware, we expect revenue to grow 35% to 45% to $3.8 billion to $4.1 billion, reflecting the expanded Surface lineup and the much-anticipated Xbox One launch. The 10-percentage-point range reflects variability in device unit volumes. In the consumer hardware business, such variability is not uncommon, especially during launches and the holiday season. 
And in Devices and Consumer Other, we expect revenue to be $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. Search revenues should continue to grow, reflecting improved revenue per search and query volume. As a reminder, in Q2 of the prior year, we launched Halo 4, which contributed $380 million of revenue to this segment. 
Now moving on to Commercial. We expect revenue to grow 9% to 11%, in line with the first quarter. As we think about this part of the business, we're confident in our ability to continue to add value to our products while providing low total cost of ownership for our customers. 
In Commercial Licensing, we expect revenue to be $10.7 billion to $10.9 billion, with similar dynamics to what we saw in the first quarter. This includes healthy renewals and strong annuity revenue growth from volume licensing with software assurance. 
In Commercial Other, we expect revenue to be $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, reflecting ongoing momentum in our Commercial Cloud business and Enterprise Services. As CIOs increasingly look to capitalize on the opportunities of cloud computing, we're confident they will continue to look to Microsoft for their IT solutions. 
Moving on to cost of revenue, which we expect to be $7.9 billion to $8.3 billion next quarter. This range primarily relates to the unit variability assumed in the hardware revenue. In Surface, we are still in the early stages of a life cycle. As you know, there are many things that go into bringing hardware to market, including those variable and fixed costs. We are intensely focused on building volumes and achieving scale to cover these costs and get to profitability. 
As you think about the economic model for Xbox, you should keep in mind that console margins are just one aspect of the overall platform's financial performance. A cache of games, accessories, Xbox LIVE services also contribute to the economic model. We expect the launch of Xbox One to be the biggest in Xbox history, and we feel great about our ability to continue our leadership position in the living room. 
Moving on to operating expenses. We expect OpEx to grow 6% to 8% to $8.5 billion to $8.6 billion. We also reaffirm our full year guidance of $31.3 billion to $31.9 billion. We continue to invest in innovative experiences for our customers while remaining focused on expense. 
We still expect full year capital expenditures to be about $6.5 billion, even though we only spent $1.2 billion in the first quarter. Given the nature of the investments, there is variability from quarter-to-quarter due to our success-based approach, as well as the timing of delivery and completion. We expect our tax rate for the full year to be between 18% and 20%, depending on our geographical mix of earnings. 
When adjusting for tech guarantees and product deferrals, we expect unearned revenue to be roughly in line with historical trends. 
So in summary, I'm really pleased with our results this quarter. It was a great start to the fiscal year as we executed and delivered across all of our businesses. We are on track with implementing the transformation of the company around the One Microsoft strategy, and at the same time, are not missing a beat in executing faster. 
And as we look forward to the second quarter, our Enterprise business will remain strong. And we're also set up for a fantastic holiday season with Surface, Xbox One and a host of devices from our partners, which will allow us to reach new customers and drive increased engagement. 
With that, I'll turn it to Chris and then we'll take your questions.",835

I do think -- when I think about the Commercial business and focus on our unearned revenue growth at 14% plus our bookings growth, which was quite strong as well, 6%, I think about the roadmap. The strength of the commitments the customers are making is really for the forward-looking. It's a 3-year commitment to the Microsoft platform, both to our cloud and on-prem solutions, the breadth and strength of that roadmap in our offerings. And I think, in many ways, that's what gives us the confidence that we're outperforming our peers. And also I think it speaks a lot to the innovation and the roadmap we've shown. Whether it's for Azure, Office 365 or our broader server portfolio, I do feel quite good about both our competitive position and our ability to execute.

Amy, I wonder if you can give us maybe some color on how it performed this quarter. But in particular, as you look into the December quarter here, obviously, you gave that gross margin guidance. But I was wondering if you could talk sort of high level about how you're approaching just the Xbox One launch say versus Xbox 360 from a perspective of how you're pricing it relative to COGS and just sort of how the build of Xbox One looks versus sort of 360?",96

Let me -- I think it's a great question that gives me the opportunity to talk about the breadth of the portfolio that we'll have to offer at holiday and then talk a little bit about the gross margin profile and philosophy we have about those products. We are excited that we'll have a great value offer at holiday with Xbox 360. And we'll also have a great choice with our innovative Xbox One platform to really give us a good breadth rolling into holiday of selections across price points. We did with Xbox One make a decision to really enable a first-class experience out of the box. There's Kinect, there's the headset and there's the console; and depending on where you are on the globe, there may be a game included as part of bundles for geographic interest. As I said, the best way always to think about the life value of the Xbox plan is over its life cycle. I'm excited about the increased opportunity that Xbox One allows us to attach more and different services beyond what we've historically thought of as simply a gaming platform. And when I think about the opportunity going forward, it is important in Q2 to realize that will impact our gross margin in the short term. But winning the platform at holiday and our positioning to do that allows us to grow profitability in a far different way over the life cycle. So hopefully, that helps.",247

And so I'm just curious, did you end up recognizing a greater portion of revenue upfront this quarter than you normally would? Because like I've realized, given how you recognize revenue, I guess the question could be said, was the transactional portion of the revenue in like the Commercial segment greater than it is typically this quarter?",87

I'm going to jump in a little bit and I'll let Amy add on. I think the way to think about -- the way we think about it is we did see growth across annuity and non-annuity in the business, but also the changing dynamic is the mix of the dollars that are going into unearned revenue. As we bill more contracts in some of our subscription offerings, that also changes the nature of the term. If you think about 1-year subscription offerings and things like this, that has a little bit of effect on the unearned revenue balance as well.",105

And we also saw very good non-annuity performance within the quarter, particularly in Office and in SQL, which, I think, are very good signs, we believe, for both the -- to see the strength broad-based. As you know, the annuity portion tends to be related to large customers making long-term commitments. Some of the non-annuity is exciting because it tends to be smaller customers who decided to go ahead and upgrade to the most recent version of Office, which is also encouraging.",127

Business was better than we expected. So actually, ASPs were probably higher than many people had modeled and then we had expected due to mix. Growing 6% in the Pro segment was both better than we expected and probably better than many people had considered. In the Consumer segment, the minus 22%, taking out China to minus 17%, I think it's generally overall, when you take those 2 numbers, probably in line with most of the device-level estimates for PC we've seen across the industry and from some of our peers reporting in the system. I do think we were impacted, like some inventory levels did come down a bit actually this quarter as well. So I think, overall, we do think that things are probably more stable in the business segment and encouraging; and in consumer and developed markets particularly, we're better than we have seen.",172

I also think underlying that are some real technical improvements we've made within the search engine. The algos are better and the investments we're making are really allowing us to monetize at a higher level. We also saw some strength in a few other geos, which helped increase the performance there. So I do believe that, that trend, we expect to continue into Q2.",87

Let me talk about, first, the importance of the breadth of the offers that we're putting into market. With Windows 8.1, one of the focus we had was to expand both the opportunity for screen sizes and to reach new price points and to cover really from the smallest to the largest with touch and non-touch. And I think our ability to work with partners and some of the sales execution we've seen in the field has led to have a broad opportunity at retail for holiday for devices. It is important. I do hope, in some ways, this is a question that's a bit awkward. You always want to say ASPs -- it's good to have ASPs go up. Transparently going forward, as we make more progress, especially in the smaller screen sizes, we should expect units to go up and be very excited about that in terms of share. But ASPs would trend down. I don't think that we'll have a material -- our guidance does not assume a material impact to ASPs in Q2. But over the long term, I actually do understand the question and would expect ASPs to be on that trend line, assuming we are successful in those lower-end device sizes.",210

You'd said that the Consumer Office last quarter was going to be down roughly 5% due -- lower than the PCs due to the move to subscription. You said the attach was higher this quarter. Should we think that the dip was roughly in line with that?,53

Let me try to clarify the numbers just so we're all on the same page. So we did say Consumer Office did decline this quarter. Last quarter, you're right, we said about 5 points of impact. And so the impact indeed was about what we expected, but with the increase in attach, they sort of tended to offset each other in the end. And so the numbers came in pretty much as expected, so I think that's the right way to think about it.",92

Mark, I do think it's important for us to continue to reiterate the importance of the success of the Office 365 Home Premium SKU from a strategic standpoint. We have done a very good job, and I would say, as a mix percentage of the SKU, it continues to do even a little better than we had hoped in terms of execution at the endpoint in driving value. And while that does have an impact on the initial ASP of the SKU, the long-term lifetime value of that product, in my belief, given the always up-to-date, first-to-see innovation, used across multi endpoints, inclusion of Skype, inclusion of SkyDrive, really does allow for a higher lifetime value and ultimately a happy customer. And so I really am encouraged by our progress and our execution there.",153

21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2013",2013-10-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3348.0,533470.0,24431580.0,Answer,Chris Suh,,Executives,30,"No. The best way to think about that, Mark, is if you look at -- it's not an exact offset but when I talked about the Commercial business all up, I gave the construct around products like Commercial Office, Commercial Server as all up across both prem -- on-prem and commercial, so we talked about Office growing 11% across both Commercial Licensing and Commercial Other in aggregate. If you look at the specific segment, you'll see that Office in the Consumer, the Commercial Licensing segment actually grew 6%. So you can see that we're having outsized growth in the Commercial Other segment, which is Office 365. So that maybe helped at least dimensionalize the size of the growth in relative terms.",121

I believe there was a slide at FAM that showed about $150 million of negative impact in the quarter from the move to the cloud, which, in and of itself, is about 1% of revenues so it's -- this is kind of not a very big deal. And I think most of that was from Office versus Server & Tools. So -- and if you say it's about as expected -- I guess I'm just looking for some clarification here, is the really only impact we're seeing in the Office segment versus Server & Tools? Or was there much impact in that part of the business from the move to subscription?",119
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2013",2013-10-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3348.0,533470.0,24431583.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,33,"Rick, let me clarify. The $150 million, you're right, was actually just related to the Consumer Office segment and had no broader connotation beyond that. So that $150 million in a quarter on Consumer Office actually does have a meaningful impact to the growth of that, especially versus PC. So that being said, obviously, as we talked about the momentum in our broad Office 365 revenue, it is a bigger impact across not just Office. Because I think that's actually not the way we're thinking about Office 365 impact. There, it's really around Exchange, Lync, SharePoint and the broad server impact there is actually more meaningful than its impact on maybe Office clients on the commercial side.",117

Just first on the Device and Consumer Licensing business, your forecast for Q2 suggests a moderating decline and I was curious as to whether on the corporate OEM side, if you will, that's just a reflection of the ongoing stabilization trend. Or do you also expect to see improvement on the consumer OEM side? And related to that, how do you think about the impact of the end of life of XP on the corporate OEM side? Do you think that the improvement is completely unrelated to that end-of-life forthcoming? Or do you think there could be some impact related to that?",106

Let me divide that question, I think, as you said, 2 parts. Our Q2 guidance for devices and consumer licensing really says that the trends we saw in Q1 on both sides continue in Q2, so I think that's an important distinction as you noted and ask for clarification on. So I hope that's helpful on that component. And when it comes to end of life of XP, I tend to think about that more as on the VL side as well and the strength there, which will be in the commercial reporting segments. We continue to make progress on the XP install base and now a little over 75% of the PCs are running 7. And so I do think, as we continue to get to end of life of XP, you'll see the impact more on the VL side of the business than you would in the Device and Consumer Licensing segment.",155

But let me take the second half of that question. Our performance in both Office 365 and Azure have actually been quite good, both in the U.S., to your question, and outside the U.S. Part of the reason that you've seen us investing on the capital expense side is to continue to build out the opportunity set because we are seeing good demand outside the U.S., and I do think our ability to be competitive there is just as high as it is here so we've already seen that growth.",104

I think overall for holiday, given our guidance, we clearly do expect a healthy holiday performance across the portfolio. I say that because we do have offerings that provide great value from having Surface v1, RT still in market, Surface 2, Surface 2 Pro plus Xbox 360 plus Xbox One, really does provide both a value portfolio. And those who want the latest and greatest experience have something covered. The guidance does include good performance across all of those product lines. I -- we did see -- I think it's -- Chris and I both talked about a lot of progress in sales execution on Surface in particular this quarter, and that does give us more confidence about our ability to execute again well in Q2. In particular, as you noted, RT did do quite well this quarter, and I look forward to seeing that continue with the Surface 2 device as well at holiday.",157

Maybe I'm doing -- I'm hoping that I did something wrong here. But if that's the case, I get about 29% op margin relative to the 33% or so that you did last year. So can you just walk us through what are the items that you're assuming in your cost structure, which effectively makes the op income flat, although you are getting good revenue growth rate. I just wonder if there are any onetime items or if it's just emblematic of a shift in your business model to Devices and Consumer, especially with Nokia going forward. I wonder if we should not be thinking about op margins but really op income growth rate.",178

I think the one thing I would urge you to do as you think about the guidance we gave is looking specifically at the D&C Hardware guidance, as well as making sure you're mapping the COGS very specifically to whatever assumption you're making in D&C Hardware. Given the business model of Xbox, that can and will have an impact in Q2 to the overall gross margin structure. So as you think through that, I think that's probably one of the assumptions that it may sound like using the midpoint could lead you a bit off of where I would have expected.",103

Let me take the second one first because it's the easiest. We still do expect the transaction to close in the first calendar quarter of 2014. And post closing, if there are any EPS impact changes to what we said before, we'll give them post closing. So now back to your original question on SQL, that's a terrific one to get to talk about. Our growth there is, as you said, both share growth and revenue growth. It's happened, I think, generally both in BI, which we've seen a lot of traction with. I don't know if you've had a chance to see some of our Power View announcements recently. Our ability to sort of span from the end user to the hardest big data problem really has resonated both in the market analyst -- industry analysts, who take an, I think, a strong position that we're the real market leader there.

I do expect our annuity growth in the guidance we gave still does assume double-digit annuity growth going forward. And I think our performance this quarter gives me confidence that the guidance in Q2 is the right one, given our strengths and our competitive position. Secondly on cloud revenue, this -- your question gives me an opportunity to talk about the importance of our hybrid cloud. Within especially our server business, our ability to power the cloud, whether you want to run it, you want a service provider to run it or you want to use ours, is really an incredibly powerful story. And I think in some ways, whether or not it's cannibalizing becomes somewhat difficult. What we've generally found right now is that it has been often additive. And if you look at our server growth all up, which we try to provide to help give some parameters around that, to give some confidence that we're both growing the base and providing additive opportunity, I think that's the number I would probably look to, to see the impact there.",184

And then secondly, as a follow-up to Gregg's question on Server, within Azure, how much of the uptick in Azure is coming from sort of existing Microsoft logos versus bringing on net new logos onto the platform?",92

Thanks, Kirk. Let me talk about 2 things. I do think it's interesting -- maybe the best example of how to think about us moving beyond our traditional market is the fact that we were the first to commit to a data center in China, a market that we've historically had challenges monetizing at a high level. We went there. We're going there with Office 365 and Azure. We look forward to being able to make progress. We're investing both headcount and capital dollars because we do believe this provides an interesting opportunity for us to begin monetizing in markets that have been harder for us to grow in maybe with a more traditional business model. Secondly, with Azure, I think we'll be seeing both. But the thing I would say is what's been really helpful is that as we make it easier to attach Azure services to our normal rhythm in the field through our Enterprise agreements and through volume licensing, it provides a really helpful way for -- and a really easy selling motion to provide customers flexibility. We add it in the normal rhythm of a sales motion. We allow people to try, use and buy, and that has served us well in terms of being able to expose Azure to more and more customers in a normal selling cycle. So I think that's probably one of the better ways. It's the same actual selling rhythm we've used with Office 365 so successfully. 
And with that, I wanted to say thank you. I know that this quarter, we changed reporting segments and that requires a lot of work. So thank you for all the work put in to understand our transition that we're trying to make as a company. And so let me turn it back to Chris to say his final words.",307
