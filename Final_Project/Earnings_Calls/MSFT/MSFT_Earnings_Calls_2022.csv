21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2022",2022-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3759.0,2477196.0,93879326.0,Presenter Speech,Satya Nadella,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Brett. It was a record quarter, driven by continued strength of the Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $22 billion in revenue, up 32% year-over-year. We are living through a generational shift in our economy and society. Digital technology is the most malleable resource at the world's disposal to overcome constraints and reimagine everyday work and life. We're innovating and expanding our entire portfolio across consumer and commercial segments to help people and organizations thrive in this new era.  
Now I'll highlight examples, starting with Azure. As every company becomes a digital company, they will need a distributed computing fabric to build, manage, secure and deploy applications anywhere. We have more data center regions than any other provider, delivering fast access to cloud services while meeting data resiliency requirements. We're extending our infrastructure to the 5G network edge, helping operators and enterprises create new business models and deliver ultra-low latency services closer to the end user. AT&T, for example, is bringing together its 5G network with our cloud services to help General Motors deliver next-generation connected vehicle solutions to drivers. 
Our Azure Arc customer base has tripled year-over-year. We are now helping thousands of organizations, from BP to Rabobank, unify their on-premise, hybrid and multi-cloud infrastructure. And as the digital and physical worlds come together, we're seeing real enterprise metaverse usage. From smart factories to smart buildings to smart cities, we are helping organizations use the combination of Azure IoT, Digital Twins and Mesh to help digitize people, places and things in order to visualize, simulate and analyze any business process. Ecolab, for example, is using these tools to build its own platform to model and optimize water management. Across Azure, we are seeing growing adoption across every sector. CVS Health, Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices, Kyndryl and Wells Fargo all chose our cloud as their preferred provider this quarter.  
Now on to data. From best-in-class databases and analytics to AI and data governance, we have the most comprehensive data stack to help every organization turn its data into predictive and analytical power. Cosmos DB is the database of choice for cloud-native app development at any scale. Data volumes and transactions increased over 100% year-over-year. With Azure Synapse, we're removing traditional barriers between enterprise data warehousing and big data analytics so anyone can collaborate, build and manage analytics solutions. Data governance is emerging as an important and growing category. And Azure Purview is leading here, helping thousands of organizations achieve a more complete understanding of their data estate.  
In AI, we have one of the most powerful supercomputers in the cloud, and we're using it not only to train new models but to deliver them as platforms to our customers. Our new Azure OpenAI Service is in preview, and that brings together advanced language models with the enterprise capabilities of Azure. GitHub Copilot is using this capability to help developers write better code. More broadly, we continue to see strong usage across our Cognitive Services with over 30 million hours of speech transcribed last quarter, up nearly 2x compared to a year ago.  
Now to developers. From GitHub to Visual Studio to Azure PaaS services, we have the most popular tools to help every developer going from idea to code and code to cloud. As companies prioritize embedding security into their developers' workflow, we're investing across GitHub to secure open source. Increasingly, every DevSecOps workflow will start with GitHub Advanced Security, and we are seeing strong demand from both digital natives like Afterpay and Mercari as well as established companies like 3M and Bosch. And organizations are increasingly turning to both Visual Studio and our PaaS services like Container Apps and Chaos Studio to streamline development and build modern, more resilient cloud-native applications.  
Now to Power Platform. Low-code/no-code tools are rapidly becoming a priority for every organization's digital capability building. We're innovating to help organizations like Airbus, Centrica and Johnson Controls rapidly scale their use of Power Platform using end-to-end suite to automate workflows, create applications, build virtual agents and analyze data. At H&M, more than 30,000 employees have used Power Platform to drive productivity gains. We have created more than 1,500 applications, flows and dashboards to date for everything from managing office capacity to tracking team goals. And at Kroger, more than 420,000 associates are using our return to workplace solution, which is built on Power Platform to verify their health and vaccination status.  
Now on to Dynamics 365. To counter demand shocks and supply constraints in this economy, every business will need to become a hyperconnected business, unifying data, process and teams across the organization. Across Dynamics 365, we continue to take share as companies turn to our expanding portfolio of business applications to address these and other challenges. For Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces, we are creating a new software category to help organizations manage physical operations across diverse industries from real estate to retail to factories and construction. Companies like Chipotle and Home Depot are relying on our new customer experience platform to take control of their data, connecting customer touch points to deliver more personalized experiences. Daimler Trucks North America is using Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights to preempt supply chain issues. And just yesterday, we announced a new logistics-as-a-service offering with FedEx, combining data and insights from the company's network with Dynamics 365 to help brands better fulfill, ship and service customer orders.  
Now on to industry solutions. Just over a year ago, we introduced our first industry cloud offering, bringing together our industry-specific customizations with our entire stack to help customers improve time to value, increase agility and lower costs. We now have 6 industry clouds, and they are driving significant increases in usage across the Microsoft Cloud. Our Cloud for Retail was front and center at NRF, and retailers from Ahold Delhaize and GNC are sharing how they're using our solutions to deliver seamless customer experiences. Our Cloud for Sustainability unifies data to help customers record, report and reduce their carbon emissions. Industry leaders, including Nissan Motor, are turning to the offering to help meet sustainability goals.  
Now on to LinkedIn. We are experiencing a great reshuffle across the labor market as more people in more places than ever rethink how, where and why they work. In this new economy, LinkedIn has become mission-critical to connect creators with their communities, job seekers with employers, learners with skills, and sellers with buyers. Last quarter, we once again saw record engagement, and LinkedIn has become one of the world's largest platform for professional events with more than 24,000 events created and 1.5 million RSVPs each week. Confirmed hires were up 110% year-over-year, and we've added tools to make it easier to discover open roles that align with how and where people want to work. With entrepreneurship on the rise, our new Service Marketplace has helped nearly 3 million freelancers and small businesses discover new clients. We also saw strong growth in LinkedIn Sales Solutions, which surpassed $1 billion in revenue over the past 12 months for the first time. Our sales, talent, marketing and premium subscriptions lines of business have all now reached this milestone.  
Now on to Microsoft 365 and Teams. Every organization today needs a digital fabric to connect and empower everyone inside and outside the organization, from knowledge and frontline workers to customers and partners. At the center of this digital fabric is Teams, which surpassed 270 million monthly active users this quarter. Organizations are using Teams to run their business with collaborative applications that bring business process data right into the flow of work. Monthly usage of third-party applications and custom-built solutions has grown 10x in the last 2 years, with new and updated apps this quarter from Atlassian, monday.com, SAP and Workday. United Airlines is using bots within Teams to create tighter connections between operations and flight crews. And Marks & Spencer uses Power Apps and Teams to streamline internal help desk requests. 
As hybrid work becomes the norm, every organization will need to rethink their approach to space. With Teams Rooms, we are bringing Teams to a growing ecosystem of devices to help people stay connected and participate fully in meetings from anywhere. The number of active Teams Room devices more than doubled year-over-year. And with Mesh for Teams, we're bringing the metaverse for Teams, helping employees at organizations like Accenture access a shared immersive experience where they can have water-cooler-type conversations and even whiteboarding sessions. Teams is rapidly becoming the standard for unified communications. Over 90% of Fortune 500 companies used Teams from this quarter, and we continue to take share across PSTN and VoIP as organizations like Bank of Montreal, Chevron, General Motors, LVMH and NetApp turn to Teams to meet their internal and external collaboration needs.  
All up, we are seeing Teams growth in every segment from frontline worker usage up 2x year-over-year. Zebra Technologies will bring Teams walkie-talkie communications to devices used by millions of employees on retail floors. And Walmart chose Teams for their more than 2 million frontline workers this quarter. And we are expanding our opportunity with Teams Essentials, the first stand-alone Teams offering specifically designed to meet the needs of small businesses. It's early days but we are very encouraged by the strong demand.  
With Microsoft Viva, we are creating a new employee experience category, combining communications, knowledge, learning resources and insights to help people feel connected to the company's mission and culture. Now broadly available, Viva is being used by more than 1,000 paid customers, including Blum, Nationwide and REI, to help address challenges like employee burnout and retention. All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365. From Heineken to Hilton to Zurich Insurance, organizations continue to choose our premium E5 offering for advanced security, compliance, voice and analytics.  
Now on to Windows. We've seen a structural shift in PC demand. More than ever, people are turning to PCs to exercise their agency and unleash their creativity, whether it's meeting in virtual reality or for remote work, writing code or collaborating in documents, livestreaming video or playing games or for graphic design and engineering design. As new use cases are born every day and existing ones see a resurgence, we are experiencing a PC renaissance with increase in time spent on PCs and PCs per household.  
Three months in, we're delighted by the response to Windows 11. We are seeing more usage intensity and higher quality than previous versions of our operating system. And Windows took share this quarter. We are delivering Windows in new ways to meet evolving customer needs. This quarter, we introduced Windows 11 SE, our cloud-first operating system purpose-built for schools. And with Windows 365, we are bringing the operating system to the cloud, helping businesses like Coats North America and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals stream the full Windows experience to any employee device. 
There are now more than 1.4 billion monthly active devices running Windows 10 or Windows 11, and they are a powerful on-ramp for both our first-party and third-party services. Windows 11 users engage with the Windows app store at nearly 3x the rate of Windows 10. And across Bing and Edge, we are creating differentiated high-value experiences for consumers and advertisers in key verticals, including shopping. Just 1 year since the launch of coupon and price comparison features in Edge, we already have surfaced more than $800 million in savings.  
More broadly, we are expanding our opportunity in advertising. Over the past 12 months, our total advertising revenue, inclusive of LinkedIn, surpassed $10 billion ex TAC. And with our acquisition of Xandr, we will bring to market new advertising solutions that combine our deep audience understanding and customer base with Xandr's large-scale data-driven platforms.  
Now on to security. Cybercrime is the #1 threat facing every business today. Our aim is to help organizations implement a comprehensive zero-trust architecture that protects people, devices, applications and data holistically across the heterogeneous cloud and client environments. We protect our customers in 2 interconnected ways: first, we incorporate security by design into every product we build; and second, we deliver advanced end-to-end, cross-cloud, cross-platform security solutions, which integrate more than 50 different categories across security, compliance, identity, device management and privacy, informed by more than 24 trillion threat signals we see each day. 
Among analysts, we are a leader in more than -- more security categories now, 19 than any other provider. Our multi-cloud, multi-platform innovation is driving growth. Across commercial and consumer, more than 1 billion monthly active users now rely on Microsoft account to securely access their favorite app products and services with just one log-in. More than 15,000 customers now use our cloud-native SIEM, Microsoft Sentinel, to stop threats before they happen, up over 70% year-over-year. And all up, the number of customers that use our advanced security solutions accelerated this quarter to over 715,000. More than half have 4 or more workloads up 75% year-over-year, underscoring our end-to-end differentiation. On average, customers save 60% compared to multi-vendor solutions. As a result of our customers' trust, our security business revenue surpassed $15 billion over the past 12 months, up nearly 45% year-over-year.  
Now on to gaming. The big bets we have made across content, community and cloud over the past few years are paying off. We saw record engagement as well as revenue this quarter. Game Pass has more than 25 million subscribers across PC and console. Our differentiated content is driving the services growth, and we released new AAA titles this holiday to rave reviews and record usage. 18 million have played Forza Horizon 5 to date, and more than 20 million have played Halo Infinite, making it the biggest Halo launch in history. And with our planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard announced last week, we're investing to make it easier for people to play great games wherever, whenever and however they want and also shape what comes next for gaming as platforms like the metaverse develop. 
In closing, as digital technology as a percentage of global GDP continues to increase, we are innovating and investing across a diverse and growing TAM with common underlying technology stack and an operating model that reinforces a common strategy, culture and sense of purpose. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Amy, who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining you for questions.",2397
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2022",2022-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3759.0,2477196.0,93879327.0,Presenter Speech,Amy Hood,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $51.7 billion, up 20% year-over-year. Earnings per share was $2.48, increasing 22%. The U.S. dollar strengthened during the quarter, and as a result, FX had no impact on total company and segment revenue growth, which was a 1-point headwind compared to expectations. Despite this, we delivered another quarter of strong double-digit revenue growth in each of our business segments, reflecting our unique and differentiated market position across a connected portfolio of diverse businesses. 
In our commercial business, strong execution by our sales teams and partners, combined with continued demand for our Microsoft Cloud offerings, drove significant growth in large long-term Azure contracts as well as increased usage of Teams and our advanced security and identity offerings. And LinkedIn Talent Solutions benefited from a strong job market again this quarter. 
In our consumer business, increased PC demand and usage, as Satya highlighted, benefited our Windows OEM business. Continued advertising market growth drove another strong quarter in LinkedIn Marketing Solutions as well as Search and news advertising. And in a strong holiday quarter for gaming, we saw record revenue and engagement on the platform, with significant growth in Game Pass subscribers and first-party titles as well as continued demand for Xbox Series X and S consoles. 
Now to our overall results. Commercial bookings grew 32% and 37% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by the large long-term Azure contracts noted earlier and strong execution across our core annuity sales motions. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 31% and 32% in constant currency to $147 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 26% year-over-year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 37% year-over-year, highlighting the long-term commitment customers are making to the Microsoft Cloud. And our annuity mix increased 1 point year-over-year to 94%. 
Microsoft Cloud revenue grew 32% to $22.1 billion, again ahead of our expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 70%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for the useful life of server and network equipment assets, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points, driven by improvement across our cloud services, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. 
As noted earlier, with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar through the quarter, FX had no company or segment revenue growth impact and minimal impact on COGS and operating expense growth. Gross margin dollars increased 20%. Gross margin percentage was 67%, relatively unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, driven primarily by the improvement in our cloud services noted earlier. 
Operating expense increased 14%, lower than expected, primarily driven by investment that shifted to future quarters. At a total company level, head count grew 16% year-over-year as we continue to invest in key areas, such as cloud engineering, sales, customer deployment, gaming and LinkedIn. Operating income increased 24% and operating margins expanded 1 point year-over-year to 43%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins expanded roughly 3 points year-over-year. 
Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $15.9 billion and grew 19% year-over-year, which included a 1-point FX headwind relative to expectations. Excluding this headwind, revenue exceeded expectations, driven by LinkedIn. 
Office Commercial revenue grew 14%. Office 365 Commercial revenue growth of 19% was driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments as well as higher ARPU. Demand for our advanced security, compliance and voice offerings drove continued momentum in E5 revenue this quarter. Paid Office 365 Commercial seats increased 16% year-over-year, driven by another strong quarter of growth in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. Office Commercial licensing decreased 17% in line with expectations and consistent with the ongoing customer shift to the cloud. 
Office Consumer revenue grew 15%, driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 19% to 56.4 million. Dynamics revenue grew 29% year-over-year, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 45% and 44% in constant currency. Continued demand for our modern low-code app development solutions drove another strong quarter with 161% revenue growth in Power Apps. LinkedIn revenue increased 37% and 36% in constant currency with continued strength in Marketing Solutions, which grew 43% year-over-year, as well as better-than-expected performance in Talent Solutions from the strong job market noted earlier. 
Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 19% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, driven by improvement across all cloud services. Operating expense increased 13%, and operating income increased 24%. 
Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $18.3 billion, increasing 26% year-over-year, which included a 1-point FX headwind relative to expectations. Excluding this headwind, revenue grew ahead of expectations, driven by continued customer demand for our differentiated hybrid and cloud offerings. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 29% year-over-year. Azure and other cloud services growth of 46% was driven by continued strength in our consumption-based services. In our per-user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 28% to over 209 million seats. In our on-premises business, revenue increased 6%, in line with expectations, driven by healthy demand for our hybrid offerings that include Windows Server and SQL Server running in multi-cloud environments. Enterprise Services revenue grew 8% and 7% in constant currency, driven by growth in Enterprise Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services. 
Segment gross margin dollars increased 21% and 22% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 2 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly with improvements in Azure, partially offset by the sales mix shift to Azure. Operating expense increased 14%, and operating income grew 26%. 
Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $17.5 billion, increasing 15% year-over-year, with better-than-expected performance in Windows OEM, Surface and Search and news advertising. Revenue growth included a 1-point FX headwind relative to expectations. Windows OEM revenue increased 25%, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by the strong PC market noted earlier particularly in the commercial segment, which has higher revenue per license. 
As a reminder, these results include roughly 6 points of positive impact from the $210 million revenue deferral related to Windows 11, which shifted revenue from Q1 to Q2. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 13% and 14% in constant currency, driven by demand for Microsoft 365. Surface revenue grew 8% year-over-year, ahead of expectations, as we were able to ship more devices than anticipated into a strong demand environment. Search and news advertising revenue, ex TAC, increased 32%, better than expected, benefiting from strong advertising market noted earlier. And we saw share gains in our Edge browser on Windows 10 and 11 devices. 
And in gaming, revenue increased 8%, in line with expectations. Xbox hardware revenue grew 4% and 3% in constant currency, driven by continued strong demand and better-than-expected console supply on strong prior year comparable that included the launch of the Xbox Series X and S. Xbox content and service revenue increased 10%, lower than expected as strong growth in first-party titles and Game Pass subscriptions was partially offset by weaker third-party title performance. 
Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% year-over-year. Gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, driven by sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses and improvement in Search and news advertising. Operating expenses increased 17%, driven by investments in gaming, particularly ZeniMax, Search and news advertising and Windows marketing. Operating income grew 22% and 21% in constant currency. 
Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $6.8 billion, up 25% year-over-year, lower than expected, primarily due to quarterly spend volatility in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out. Cash paid for PP&E was $5.9 billion. Our capital investments, including both new data center regions and expansion in existing regions, continue to be based on significant customer demand and usage signals. 
Cash flow from operations was $14.5 billion, increasing 16% year-over-year as strong cloud billings and collections were partially offset by higher supplier payments related to hardware inventory builds. Free cash flow was $8.6 billion, up 3% year-over-year, reflecting higher capital expenditures in support of our growing cloud business. 
This quarter, other income expense was $268 million, higher than anticipated, primarily driven by net gains on investments. Our effective tax rate was approximately 17%. And finally, we returned $10.9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Now before we turn to our outlook, I'd like to provide a couple of reminders. First, my remarks for the next quarter do not include the impact from the Nuance acquisition although we do expect it to close during Q3. Second, the outlook we give, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. With that, let's move to the third quarter outlook. 
First, FX. With the stronger U.S. dollar and based on current rates, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately 2 points and to decrease total COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly 2 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and 1 point in More Personal Computing. 
Next, we expect our differentiated market position, customer demand for our high-value hybrid and cloud offerings and consistent execution to drive another strong quarter of revenue growth. In commercial bookings, growth should be healthy, but we will be impacted by the strong prior year comparable as well as low growth in the expiry base. As a reminder, the growing mix of larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. 
Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly flat year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, Q3 gross margin percentage will increase roughly 2 points, driven by continued improvement across all cloud services despite revenue mix shift to Azure. And on a dollar basis, we expect capital expenditures to be slightly down sequentially, with normal quarterly variability in the timing of the cloud infrastructure build-out. 
Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $15.6 billion and $15.85 billion. In Office 365, healthy revenue growth will be driven by the same factors as Q2, with similar seat growth across customer segments and continued momentum in E5. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the high teens, with continued customer shift to the cloud. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue to grow in the high single digits, with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 consumer subscriptions. For LinkedIn, a strong job market and healthy engagement on the platform should drive revenue growth in the low 30% range. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid-20% range, driven by strength in Dynamics 365, including continued momentum in Power Apps. 
For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $18.75 billion and $19 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect revenue growth to be up sequentially in constant currency, driven by our Azure consumption business with strong growth on a significant base. And our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum though we expect some moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, continued demand for our differentiated hybrid offerings should drive revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits. And in Enterprise Services, we expect revenue growth to be in the low to mid-single digits. 
In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $14.15 billion and $14.45 billion. Continued strength in PC shipments, particularly in the commercial segment, should benefit Windows OEM despite ongoing supply chain constraints. We expect Windows OEM revenue growth in the high single digits. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive growth in the low double digits. In Surface, revenue should grow in the mid-teens with strength from our premium devices. In Search and news advertising ex TAC, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high teens against a strong prior year comparable that was driven by a recovery in the advertising market. 
And in gaming, on a prior year comparable that included significant strength in hardware from our consoles as well as across the Xbox content and services, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits. Console sales will continue to be impacted by supply chain uncertainty. And in Xbox content and services, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits with strong engagement and continued momentum across the platform. 
Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of $15.5 billion to $15.7 billion and operating expense of $13.4 billion to $13.5 billion, driven by head count investments in high-growth strategic areas to drive continued long-term revenue growth. In other income and expense, interest income and expense should offset each other. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio. And we expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%, slightly higher than our full year expected tax rate of approximately 17%. And finally, for FY '22, given our strong performance in the first half of the fiscal year and our current H2 outlook, full year operating margins should be slightly up year-over-year even with the impact of changes in accounting estimates noted earlier and the significant strategic investments we are making to capture the tremendous opportunities ahead of us. 
In closing, digital technologies are increasingly essential to empowering every person and organization on the planet to achieve more, and we are well positioned with innovative, high-value products. Our diverse yet connected portfolio of solutions spans end markets, customer sizes and business models, uniquely enabling us to deliver long-term revenue and profit growth.

I wanted to ask you as a high-level question about the overall demand environment and whether we've seen any changes given sort of the disruptions we've seen from Omicron and a lot of what's going on in the environment. There's been a narrative among software investors, and a lot of times, the asset prices seem to lead the narrative. So I wanted to check in with you guys on how do you feel about the overall demand environment particularly around digital transformation and how durable is that going to be into calendar year '22. Do you still see a lot of wood to chop, if you will, a lot of activity taking place in that direction?",122

I'll take that, and maybe you can add on to it. Overall, what we see is pretty strong demand signal. And quite frankly, going into the pandemic, we saw demand increase because of the constraints the pandemic put on corporations and the increased consumer activity. And then coming out of the pandemic, we are seeing actually a lot of constraints in the economy. And the only resources I said in my remarks that can help drive productivity while keeping cost down is digital tech. So when I think -- take something like Power Apps, it's just a great example of something that's right in the middle of our stack, really helps drive that next level of productivity in the labor force for any company in any industry. 
And so the demand signals we see across the stack from security to our cloud infrastructure to business applications and solutions like Teams is very strong. And the other area, obviously, we're seeing strength is in gaming. That's where we have doubled down in terms of our consumer category creation. And we see the intensity of usage and the business model diversity around games that increasingly, the economics of gaming franchises is also radically becoming much more software-like. So we sort of overall see good demand signal across the stack.",220

And to be clear, the constraints that you talk about for the broader economy, head count constraints and the like, it doesn't sound like that's constraining your opportunity. You're not kind of running short on people to sell or implement your solutions or not having a hard time finding the people you need to make the investments behind the product. Is that the right read-through?",67

And you see it even in our OpEx projections that Amy shared. We are growing our head count because we see the opportunity. We're not immune from what happens overall in the labor market, but I think we have a good brand and an attractive brand to both get people and to retain people with everything that we are doing. So there -- but at the same time, we do want to make sure that in our channel and our ecosystem remain healthy, and all the signals at least we are getting is that there are no constraints per se other than at the end of the day, all businesses are going to be subject to the laws of economic growth in the overall economy.",143

Satya, given all the commentary on the metaverse, what are the key components of the metaverse or the multiple metaverses that you're seeing? What does Microsoft have today that they're positioned to be able to deliver to meet those requirements? And what do you believe you might be lacking? Does the partner ecosystem meet those requirements? 
And to Amy, with the hype cycle underway and increased industry interest in the metaverse, are you changing your investments to meet the potential opportunity?",94
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2022",2022-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3759.0,2477196.0,93879336.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,12,"Thank you for the question. So the way we see this is as an opportunity in a very classic Microsoft sense both at the platform infrastructure level and in the application level. So that's why I think even in my remarks, I tried to reference all the places where we're investing today and seeing customer use cases really develop. 
At the first place where we see this is the increasing digitization of people, places and things to be able to really help businesses automate processes to the next level. And so today, between Azure IoT, Digital Twins and Mesh, we have many examples where customers are engaged with us. So that's where we'll show up in Azure, and we're investing significantly there. 
Up the stack, I would say Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces, that's a solution that's in preview today. That's about really being able to take a retail space or a connected factory or a building and essentially create a complete new software category, which is about managing physical processes. Just like CRM and ERP and supply chain management, we now have a suite which is all driven by Connected Spaces, which is going to automate physical processes. Teams is going to have Mesh meetings. So these immersive meetings, which will start, first of all, on 2D screens, whether it's PCs or phones and then lead up to even immersive experiences if you wear your VR or AR goggles. So that's one of the place. 
And then, of course, gaming. That will be a natural place for us. And today, if you think about the activity when I talked about the Forza numbers, right, I mean that's a place where you could say already, people are investing in their avatars. People are building Minecraft worlds. And so very naturally, you can see us extend gaming as the metaverse evolves. 
On the devices side, one of the things we are very excited to be doing is what we're doing with HoloLens and all the experience we're gaining on the optics on the silicon side and all the way to the cloud in terms of some of the foundational services driven by all the HoloLens use cases in the enterprise. 
So that's the broad portfolio. We're going to invest across the entire tech stack. The demand will come in different forms for different categories, but we feel very well positioned to be able to catch what I think is essentially the next wave of the Internet, right? Just like the first wave of the Internet allowed everybody to build a website, I think the next wave of the Internet will be a more open world where people can build their own metaverse world, whether they're organizations or game developers or anyone else.",460

And it's because I think of the transition Satya just talked about. If it's that -- if it's at the platform layer and it applies to all the components, it's better to do that frankly across the teams where they can apply it in the right way. And I think that's how I would point to the investment showing itself.",127

Many are asking where you're seeing the strength into your Azure comment for next quarter, obviously the acceleration. What's giving you the confidence?",35
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2022",2022-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3759.0,2477196.0,93879340.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,16,"Thanks, Brent. Interestingly, I would not say that there is one location, and I would tie that back to the answer actually Satya gave to Keith's first question, which is if the underlying driver is digitization and our belief that it impacts every industry, every end market, then you'd expect it and the nature of the commitments to show themselves on a global basis and across end markets. And that is, in fact, what we saw in Q2. I continually point out these can be a little volatile because we really focus on getting the right deal done that matches the customer goals. And while we've got a lot of those done in Q2, it can move around a little bit, as I talked about in Q1. But the execution was very good, by the sales team this quarter, but I would not characterize any geo or an industry as being different or distinct from others. 
And for a second, let me then connect that, as you asked, into how to think about the guide for Azure on a constant dollar basis being up sequentially into Q3. I sort of continually remark that these can move around a few points here and there and yet have the consistent sign of consumption be steady. And we saw that again frankly. Q1, Q2, Q3, consumption growth by end market, by industry, by customer size has remained quite steady. And so while you'll see some volatility in that number, increased data usage, the data products have really been a strong performer. I think Satya mentioned some of those in his comments. So I do think in some ways, they're connected, but I tend to put bookings execution on the Azure side into a long-term commitment bucket where customers are picking a partner to help them change the cost structure or the outcome structure that Satya talked about. And I tend to put these trend lines on Azure into a bucket called, ""Are we getting projects and successful projects set up at customers around the world?"" And both of those things were very good by the sales teams.",354

And 2 quarters in, you're now guiding to up margins. Even with presumably some reversal of work from home related T&E savings, even with what I'm assuming is an uptick in labor cost, can you unpack that a little bit? Is it sales mix where some of the high-margin businesses like Windows have outperformed? I'd love to hear a little color.",78
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2022",2022-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3759.0,2477196.0,93879343.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,19,"Thanks, Karl. I think it's really a combination of things as it is when you go through a fiscal year. Really, I believe that our execution in a very good demand environment has given confidence. Revenue performance has been quite consistent to your point. We have seen some continued upside in OEM. We've seen strength in gaming. We've seen strength in our Microsoft Cloud products. We've seen good consistency out of Dynamics. I mean at some level, if you really wanted to look at the trend lines, you'd say this has been a very consistent execution by the team across really both the business units. 
And so if you think about then what goes into confidences, when you start to add head count and you add head count with goals of ROI and you look at that accountability, I feel like the teams have done a nice job. Where we've added heads, they've been into strong markets. They've executed well. Sales teams have done the same. And then on top of that, Karl, I would say there's been good execution on the gross margin numbers. I tend to be an operating margin-focused communicator with you all and inside the company, but gross margins have also been quite good. The teams have executed well on cost per goals through the year.",220

I just wanted to focus in on Office 365 Commercial. Obviously, another strong quarter there both in terms of revenue but also seat growth. And Amy, in your commentary, you highlighted SMB seat performance as well as frontline workers, and Satya mentioned a doubling of the frontline workers year-over-year, which is impressive. But you also commented on revenue per user going up. I wonder if you could help us kind of walk through the growth algorithm here, call it the P times Q, because there are different trends going on both the P and the Q and just sort of how that might be changing going forward versus what you have seen.",117
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2022",2022-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3759.0,2477196.0,93879346.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,22,"Sure. Let me take a shot at that one, Phil. This is one where we do have -- it is a P times Q that I think we try to disclose, but there's a couple of currents running through that, maybe take a second to walk you through those. Absolutely on seat growth, I think we are encouraged as we focus on more products that are more specific to the unique scenarios that face small businesses and frontline workers and really bringing the value of Microsoft 365 to that. I think you're even seeing that in offers like Teams Essentials, right? It's a concerted effort to realize the challenges can be different in that part of the market and improving our execution. You're seeing that in continued seat growth over -- I would say I feel good about those numbers over the past probably 6 quarters with continued good execution on those. 
Now however, those do often come at lower revenue per month that we would see in our enterprise businesses buying the full suite of products. So in some ways, this very strong seat growth at the frontline worker and small business units do mask some of the progress that we've been making. In particular, I'm thinking offers in the enterprise, value props that are really resonating and E5, and Satya may bring up some other ones. He mentioned quite a few in his comments, security, compliance and increasingly voice as a value prop. And so sometimes, to your point, increasing seats at lower average price points can mask a bit of progress that we're making on ARPUs in the enterprise.",272

Satya, there's a massive skills gap within the IT industry, and it's particularly acute in cybersecurity, where I noticed Microsoft's campaign that kicked off in Q2 to help scale and recruit 250,000 cyber jobs by 2025, which is quite a bold undertaking. Can you comment on the extent to which the gap is filled by people versus products in automation and also the extent to which Microsoft sees cybersecurity as its responsibility versus it being a commercial opportunity that you can continue to monetize?",89
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2022",2022-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3759.0,2477196.0,93879349.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,25,"Great set of questions. On the first one, I think it's -- first and foremost, we absolutely need the skills and the people. And for the people to be sort of more evenly distributed in the broader economy, public sector, private sector, people who are working on behalf of small businesses because absolutely, as digital tech becomes more pervasive across IT as well as OT across the economy, I think the cyber threat is just going to be more pervasive. And so therefore, we need the people and the skills. And we will do everything there in our power to sort of make sure that, that happens in terms of democratizing even how one acquires these skills. That's kind of where not that -- we have to take a broader definition of what these skills are and how one can acquire the certifications. And this is where -- what we're doing even with LinkedIn, I'm very, very bullish on. 
On the product side as well, like something like Sentinel, I do believe, for example, we are now doing very large-scale AI on all of those signals that go into our cloud-native SIEM. And that, I think, is going to help sift through signal from noise and help the productivity of the cyber professionals in any organization. So we are excited about how that workflow gets more efficient. 
To your point, one of the fundamental responsibilities for us as a platform company is through -- by design. It's all about shifting left on security and building it into the products. And if anything, when we think about our monetization, our monetization is about really recognizing that the real world is not some homogeneous Microsoft infrastructure world. It is a multi-cloud, multi-platform world. And we will definitely monetize those aspects that we have best-of-breed solutions and suites and offerings. And by the way, as I said in my remarks, the people who are adopting the Microsoft solutions are saving 60%. And so to some degree, there is real time to value and cost savings for anybody who's using our solution. So we're going to be very, very mindful of our responsibility, as you said. At the same time, we think we have a security opportunity in being able to secure the entire heterogeneous digital estate of our customers.",386

Nice to see continued strength in the business. Maybe I wanted to ask a little bit philosophically, Satya. So the pandemic clearly accelerated everyone's time line to migrate to the cloud even if there wasn't necessarily a big pull forward there. As we think about a post-Omicron world, where there is some level of office reopenings and visibility into that, how should we think about the potential to see maybe another wave or another acceleration of those cloud migrations with that ability to have in-office and have hybrid work? Maybe walk us through that.",95

I mean the -- as I said, some of the contours of demand will change. For example, one of the solutions I highlighted is coming out of the pandemic, we built in Dynamics a Supply Chain Insights module. We were seeing significant demand for what was a Customer Insights module going into the pandemic because everybody needed to deploy essentially their online presence and use customer data to be able to reach customers, and that's how commerce happened during the pandemic. Coming out of the pandemic, we were hit with supply chain issues. So Supply Chain Insights became the most important thing. So that's where the demand picked up. 
So as I look at our portfolio, we are seeing a slightly different set of solutions. Same thing with Power Platform, right? When you are sort of saying we have a labor force shortage and we need to do more with less, guess what, you turn to more automation tools. And that's where something like Power Platform, especially given you can even train your first-line workers to be able to be app builders and automate workflows, that's proving to be a productivity driver. 
So we are seeing differences in demand. I think the stable state here would be the structural shift that's happened because of the pandemic combined with even some of these constraints, whether there's supply shocks or others, will hopefully go away. But the one thing that isn't going to go away is the need for increasing levels of digitization both in terms of tools that people use to improve the productivity of your OpEx, and the COGS you have in your enterprise will probably now have a digital component to it because that's where the leverage of cost will come. So that's what we are betting on. As a -- I always go back to that simple formula. As a percentage of GDP, what is IT spend broadly defined and what is it going to be a year from now, 2 years from now, 5 years from now, 10 years from now? It's just going to be more. And we've got to do a good job of seeing the trends before they're conventional wisdom and gaining share. And so that's where we will remain focused.",378

It was a record third quarter, driven by the continued strength of the Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $23 billion in revenue, up 32% year-over-year. Going forward, digital technology will be the key input that powers the world's economic output. Across the tech stack, we are expanding our opportunity and taking share as we help customers differentiate, build resilience and do more with less. 
Now I'll highlight examples starting with Azure. We're building a distributed computing fabric across the cloud and the edge to help every organization build, run and manage mission-critical workloads anywhere. This quarter, we helped more customers than ever, simplifying and accelerating their cloud migrations. And it's still early days. We're winning Tier 1 infrastructure workloads. Leaders in every industry from BlackRock to Bridgestone to Lufthansa are all moving mission-critical workloads to Azure. 
And we are the market leader for customers' SAP workloads in the cloud. Atos, Chevron, Fujitsu and Woolworths all migrated their SAP applications to Azure in recent months. Overall, we are seeing larger, more strategic Azure commitments from industry leaders, including Boeing, Kraft Heinz, U.S. Bank and Westpac, who all chose our cloud to accelerate their digital transformations. The number of $100 million-plus Azure deals more than doubled year-over-year, and we are seeing consumption growth across every industry, customer segment and geography.  
Now to data and AI. Our data stack is unique in bringing best-in-class operational databases, analytics and governance into one integrated data fabric. Cosmos DB transactions and data volume increased over 100% year-over-year for the third quarter in a row. Synapse data volume more than doubled year-over-year, and we are seeing strong adoption of Purview as we help organizations govern, protect and manage their data estate across platforms and clouds. From Deutsche Borse to EY, customers in every industry are using our end-to-end data platform.  
In AI, we continue to see strong usage of Azure machine learning. The number of monthly inference requests increased 86% year-over-year, with companies like PepsiCo using the service to predict which products are most likely to sell. And our Azure OpenAI Service brings together advanced language models with the enterprise capabilities of Azure, helping companies like CarMax turn customer reviews into customized content for shoppers.  
Now to developer tools. From Azure DevOps and GitHub to Visual Studio, we have the most comprehensive and loved developer SaaS service. Increasingly, every new developer project starts with our tools. Visual Studio has more than 31 million monthly active users, including most of the Fortune 500. And GitHub usage is increasing among both independent developers and startups as well as the world's most established enterprises. 
90% of the Fortune 100 use GitHub. In fact, Mercedes-Benz, for example, is using GitHub Enterprise to provide a unified development platform for more than 20,000 employees to build, ship and maintain software. 
Now on to Power Platform. Power Platform has become the leading business process automation and productivity suite for domain experts in every industry. Power Platform surpassed $2 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, up 72% year-over-year, making it one of the fastest-growing businesses at scale. Power Apps is the market leader in low-code, no-code app development, and Power BI has more than 200,000 customers. And our acquisition of Minit adds new process mining capabilities, helping organizations identify bottlenecks and opportunities for operational efficiency.  
Now to Dynamics 365. Dynamics 365 is growing faster than the business applications market overall. For example, in a world of supply chain constraints, we are helping companies like Cracker Barrel and Unilever predict disruptions before they happen. Businesses like Heineken and Siemens are turning to Dynamics 365 to drive and deliver more consistent and personalized customer engagement and service. We are leading innovation in new industrial metaverse to help companies optimize their operations using technologies such as IoT, digital twins, connected spaces and mixed reality applications.  
And we are further differentiating the Microsoft Cloud by bringing together Dynamics 365, Teams and Synapse to usher in a new era of collaborative applications that transform every business function and process. 
When it comes to industry, our 6 industry clouds are helping customers speed time to value. Our Cloud for Healthcare was front and center at HIMSS last month, where we introduced Azure Health Data Services to unify disparate clinical imaging and med tech data. Cleveland Clinic will use the solution to normalize data from different systems and integrate insights into the clinician workflow. And with our acquisition of Nuance, I'm excited about our opportunity to apply the company's deep enterprise AI expertise to accelerate the growth of both Nuance's business and our industry clouds.  
Now on to LinkedIn. We once again saw record engagement as more than 830 million professionals use the platform to connect, learn, grow and get hired. Amid the great reshuffle, we are seeing a skills-first labor market emerge. The number of companies using skills filters on LinkedIn to fill open roles has doubled year-over-year. In this dynamic labor market, hires on LinkedIn has increased 88%. Talent Solutions revenue was up 43%, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. 
Our Marketing Solutions business continues to thrive as we offer advertisers high reach and ROI. And creators are increasingly turning to the platform to establish their voices and grow their communities using tools like Newsletter to share content they are passionate about. 28 million members now subscribe to at least 1 newsletter on LinkedIn, up 51% over the past quarter alone.  
Now on to Microsoft 365 and Teams. The last 2 years have proven that every organization needs a digital fabric that connects the entire organization from the boardroom to the front line to customers and partners. No company is better positioned to meet this need than Microsoft with Microsoft 365 and Teams. Teams is the most used and the most advanced platform for work and the only solution with meetings, calls, chat, collaboration and business process automation. And organizations from enterprises to SMBs are relying on Teams to run their business.  
Our comprehensive approach reduces complexity and costs. Microsoft 365 customers can save as much as 60% compared to a patchwork of single-point identity, productivity, collaboration and meeting solutions. Teams usage has never been higher. We are seeing growth in every segment, including very small businesses with Teams Essentials. 
Teams is the leading platform for collaborative apps. From Asana to Zendesk, there are over 1,000 third-party apps available in the Teams App Store. And companies in every industry, including CBRE, CVS Health and the National Health Service in the United Kingdom have built custom line of business apps within Teams, bringing business process directly into flow of work.  
And we are adding new growth engines to meet the demands of hybrid work with Teams Rooms, Teams Phone and Microsoft Viva. Teams Rooms is bridging the gap between people working remotely and those in the office with innovations like Front Row. Teams Phone with Operator Connect enables organizations to easily bring their existing calling service to Teams. Total Operator Connect minutes increased 8x quarter-over-quarter. And Viva has more than 10 million monthly active users at companies like Bloom, Cerner, Marks & Spencer.  
This quarter, we added LinkedIn's Glint employee engagement tool to Viva, ensuring leaders can more easily solicit employee feedback and receive actionable insights. All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365. Organizations across private and public sector, including American Family Insurance, the Queensland government and Telefonica are increasingly choosing our premium E5 offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice and analytics.  
Now on to Windows. The PC has never been more relevant to work, life and play. The number of use cases is increasing as is the amount of time spent on PCs. More than 100 million PCs have shipped in each of the last 8 quarters and Windows continues to take share. With Windows 11, we continue to see the highest quality scores of any version of the operating system. The enterprises are adopting Windows 11 at a faster pace than any previous release.  
With Windows 365, we are bringing the power of Azure computing to Windows computers, enabling businesses like Lands' End, SES and Xerox to stream the full Windows experience to any employee device. New integrations between Windows 11 and Windows 365 will make it possible to switch between cloud PC and the local PC with a single click. And we continue to help organizations like AIG, Grant Thornton and Sage shift their on-premise virtualization services to the cloud with Azure Virtual Desktop. 
In consumer, Windows is key to curating our content and services to help every person with their everyday tasks from browsing and searching to learning and gaming and shopping, all with security and privacy built in. We are seeing strong engagement with nearly 500 million monthly active users of our personalized content feed, Microsoft Start. As usage continues to grow, we are seeing a flywheel emerge between content consumption and commerce as we generate new opportunities for content creators as well as advertisers. And our browser, Microsoft Edge, continues to gain share as we help people save money and shop securely. 
Now to security. Security is a top priority for every organization undergoing a digital transformation. To keep our customers secure, we build security by design into every product we sell. And we deliver end-to-end solutions spanning security, compliance, identity, device management and privacy across clouds and platforms informed by 24 trillion threat signals each day. This comprehensive capability has been critical during the recent world events, and we continue to disrupt cyberattacks and share threat intelligence with the Ukrainian government as well as other public sector agencies.  
Multi-cloud, multi-platform support is central to our approach. In security, we're the only cloud provider with native multi-cloud protection for the industry's top 3 cloud platforms. In identity, we now provide permissions management across all clouds. Azure Active Directory is the undisputed market leader with more than 550 million monthly active users. In management, the number of Windows, Android and iOS devices protected by Intune grew over 60% year-over-year. And we are expanding to new market segments with Microsoft Defender for Business, which will help keep small businesses secure.  
This innovation and differentiation is driving our overall growth. All of the number of customers who trust our security solutions grew nearly 50% year-over-year to 785,000, including Citrix, Domino's Pizza, Fujitsu, Heineken, PETRONAS, who rely on us to protect their multi-cloud infrastructure. And we have over 15,000 partners in our security ecosystem, more than anyone else in the industry.  
Now on to gaming. Our ambition is to power gamers to play when and how and where they want. With our Xbox Series S and X consoles, we have taken share globally for 2 quarters in a row, and we are the market leader this quarter among the next-gen consoles in the United States, Canada, U.K. and Western Europe. And with Xbox Cloud Gaming, we are redefining how games are distributed, played and viewed. To date, more than 10 million people have streamed games. Many of our most popular titles, including Flight Simulator, are now accessible on phones, tablets, low-spec PCs for the first time.  
Our Game Pass library now includes hundreds of titles across PC and console, including more games from third-party publishers than ever before. Billions of hours have been played by subscribers over the past 12 months, up 45%. And with Azure, we are building the best cloud for game studios of all sizes to build, host and grow their games. New capabilities, speed, time to development and to help connect players across platforms. Azure gaming revenue, fiscal year-to-date, increased 66%.  
In closing, we are entering a new era where every company will become a digital company. Our portfolio of durable digital businesses and diverse business models built on a common tech stack position us well to capture the massive opportunities ahead. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Amy.",1983
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2022",2022-04-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3827.0,2547643.0,96348141.0,Presenter Speech,Amy Hood,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Satya. And good afternoon, everyone. 
This quarter, revenue was $49.4 billion, up 18% and 21% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.22 and increased 14% and 18% in constant currency when adjusted for the tax benefit from the third quarter of fiscal year '21.  
Several items impacted our financial performance that were not included in the guidance provided on our January earnings call. First, Nuance. My comments today across Q3 results and Q4 outlook include the impact from the Nuance acquisition, which closed on March 4. Our results include $111 million in revenue and a negative $0.01 impact to earnings per share, including purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related expenses. Within our results, unless specifically noted otherwise, Nuance was not a material driver of growth rates. We continue to expect the Nuance acquisition will be minimally dilutive in FY '22 and accretive in FY '23 to non-GAAP EPS.  
Second, FX. The U.S. dollar strengthened throughout the quarter and created an incremental 1 point FX headwind to total company revenue compared to expectations. As a result, revenue and EPS were negatively impacted by $302 million and $0.03 per share, respectively. 
Finally, the war in Ukraine. We suspended all new sales of our products and services in Russia. Revenue generated in Russia represents less than 1% of total company revenue, and we expect that it will decline significantly. The impact to operating income this quarter was roughly $130 million split evenly between lower revenue and higher bad debt expense, resulting in a negative $0.01 impact to EPS.  
Our results for the quarter are better than we expected across revenue, operating income and EPS as we again delivered another strong quarter of top and bottom line growth. 
In our Commercial business, healthy demand for our differentiated hybrid and cloud offerings, together with excellent execution by our sales teams and partners, drove increased commitment to our platform as well as higher usage of our services that Satya mentioned earlier.  
Commercial bookings increased 28% and 35% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions. We also saw better-than-expected growth in large long-term Azure contracts against a very strong prior year comparable. Nuance benefited bookings by roughly 5 points.  
Our on-premises transactional licensing revenue across both the Office and Server businesses was more negatively impacted than expected due to the transition from our open licensing program to our Cloud Solution Provider program. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 32% and 34% constant currency to $155 billion, with a roughly equivalent split between the revenue that we'll recognize within and the portion beyond the next 12 months. And our annuity mix increased 2 points year-over-year to 96%.  
Commercial Cloud revenue was $23.4 billion and grew 32% and 35% in constant currency, again ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 70%. Excluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, the Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points, driven by improvement across the cloud services, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. In our Consumer business, as you heard from Satya, we saw market share gains across PCs, gaming consoles and our Edge browser. 
Now back to the company level. As noted earlier, U.S. dollar strengthened throughout the quarter. FX decreased total company revenue by 3 points, 1 point unfavorable to expectations; decreased COGS by 1 point, in line with expectations; and decreased operating expense growth by 2 points, 1 point favorable to expectations. Gross margin dollars increased 18% and 21% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 68%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased approximately 1 point, driven primarily by improvement in our cloud services noted earlier. 
Operating expense increased 15% and 17% in constant currency, slightly lower than expected as investments that shifted to future quarters were partially offset by the inclusion of Nuance. At a total company level, headcount grew 20% year-over-year as we continue to invest in key areas such as cloud engineering, customer deployment, LinkedIn and sales, and included approximately 4 points of growth from the addition of Nuance. Operating income increased 19% and 23% in constant currency, and operating margins increased slightly year-over-year to 41%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins expanded roughly 2 points year-over-year. 
Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $15.8 billion and grew 17% and 19% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Better-than-expected results across Office 365, LinkedIn and Office Consumer were offset by impacts from incremental FX, the open licensing transition, Russia as well as lower-than-expected results in Dynamics. Office Commercial revenue grew 12% and 14% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue increased 17% and 20% in constant currency, driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments as well as higher ARPU from continued momentum in E5 revenue. 
Paid Office 365 Commercial seats grew 16% year-over-year to nearly $345 million, with continued growth in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. And nearly 45% of our Office 365 Commercial seats were purchased through Microsoft 365. Office Commercial licensing was lower than expected, about 28% and 25% in constant currency, driven by the factors discussed earlier and a lower mix of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition. Office Consumer revenue grew 11% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 16% to 58.4 million. 
Dynamics revenue grew 22% and 25% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365. This grew 35% and 38% in constant currency, substantially faster than the market, although a bit lower than expected as we focus on stronger execution on our recent investments. LinkedIn revenue increased 34% and 35% in constant currency, with better-than-expected performance in Talent Solutions as well as continued strength in Marketing Solutions and record levels of engagement on the platform. 
Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 19% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, driven by improvement across all cloud services. Operating expense increased 13% and 14% in constant currency, and operating income increased 19% and 23% in constant currency. 
Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes approximately 4 weeks of results from Nuance. Revenue was $19.1 billion, increasing 26% and 29% in constant currency. Excluding the impact of Nuance and the approximately $150 million greater FX than expected, revenue results were ahead of expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 29% and 32% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services grew 46% and 49% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by continued strength in our consumption-based services. The inclusion of Nuance cloud services did not change the Azure constant currency growth rate. 
In our per-user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 25% to over 218 million seats. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 5% and 7% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by healthy demand for our hybrid offerings, partially offset by the open licensing transition mentioned earlier. The inclusion of Nuance on-premises offerings did not change the server constant currency growth rate. 
Enterprise Services revenue grew 5% and 6% in constant currency, driven by growth in enterprise support services. The inclusion of Nuance professional services impacted the constant currency growth rate by 1 point. Segment gross margin dollars increased 24% and 27% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point with improvements in Azure, partially offset by the sales mix shift to Azure. Operating expense increased 17% and 19% in constant currency, and operating income grew 29% and 33% in constant currency. 
Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.5 billion, increasing 11% and 13% in constant currency, above expectations, driven by better-than-expected performance in Search and Windows, offset by Surface. FX decreased segment revenue approximately $100 million greater than expected. Windows OEM revenue increased 11%, with continued strength in the commercial PC market, which has higher revenue per license. Windows commercial, products and cloud services revenue grew 14% and 19% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by demand for Microsoft 365, with some benefit from a greater mix of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition. 
Surface revenue grew 13% and 18% constant currency, lower than expected, driven by consumer channel, partially offset by strength in Commercial. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 23% and 25% in constant currency, better than expected, benefiting from an increase in search volumes even as we saw headwinds during March from the impact of the war in Ukraine. 
And in gaming. On a high prior year comparable, revenue increased 6% and 8% in constant currency. Xbox hardware revenue was better than expected as increased supply of consoles in quarter drove growth of 14% and 16% in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue grew 4% and 6% in constant currency, below expectations, driven by lower engagement across the platform, even as it remains above pre-pandemic levels. Segment gross margin dollars increased 10% and 13% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly. Operating expenses increased 17% and 18% in constant currency, and operating income grew 7% and 10% in constant currency. 
Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $6.3 billion, in line with expectations. Cash paid for PP&E was $5.3 billion. Cash flow from operations was $25.4 billion, increasing 14% as strong cloud billings and collections were partially offset by higher supplier payments related to hardware inventory builds as we manage continued uncertainty in the supply chain. Free cash flow was $20 billion, up 17%. 
This quarter, other income and expense was negative $174 million, lower than anticipated, driven by net losses on investments, including mark-to-market losses on our equity portfolio and net losses on foreign currency remeasurement. Equity market declines drove net investment losses this quarter compared to net investment gains last year, a negative 2-point impact on year-over-year EPS growth. Our effective tax rate was approximately 17%. And finally, we returned $12.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Now before we turn to our outlook, a few reminders. First, FX. With the stronger U.S. dollar and based on current rates, we now expect FX to decrease total company revenue growth by approximately 2 points and to decrease total COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly 3 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes and 2 points in Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing. 
Second, my remarks for the next quarter include a full quarter of impact from the Nuance acquisition. Third, we anticipate the war in Ukraine to continue to impact our business in Q4 with a roughly $110 million impact on revenue and minimal impact on operating expenses. Next, we have taken into account the current impact of shutdowns in China in our outlook. However, extended production shutdowns that reach into May would further negatively impact our outlook across Windows OEM, Surface and Xbox hardware. Finally, the outlook we give, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a USD basis. 
With that context in place, let's turn to our Q4 outlook. In our largest quarter of the year, we expect our differentiated market position, customer demand across the solution portfolio and consistent execution to drive another strong quarter of revenue growth. In Commercial bookings, a growing Q4 expiry base, strong execution across our core annuity sales motions and increased commitment to our platform should drive healthy growth against a strong prior year comparable. 
As a reminder, the growing mix of larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, always drives increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be down roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, Q4 gross margin percentage will increase roughly 1 point, driven by continued improvement across our cloud services, partially offset by a revenue mix shift to Azure. Capital expenditures, we expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis as we continue to invest to meet growing global demand for our cloud services. 
Next is segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $16.65 billion and $16.9 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with healthy seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be sequentially lower by 1 point or 2 on a constant currency basis. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline similar to last quarter. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue to grow in the high single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. 
For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the high 20s, driven by strong job market and healthy engagement on the platform. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth similar to last quarter. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $21.1 billion and $21.35 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability, primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. 
We expect Azure revenue growth to be sequentially lower by roughly 2 points on a constant currency basis, with a bit more FX impact on U.S. dollar growth than at the segment level. Azure revenue will continue to be driven by strong growth in our consumption business. And our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect moderation in growth rates, given the size of the installed base. 
In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits as demand for our hybrid offerings will be more than offset by the strong prior year comparable, which included 4 points of benefits, a benefit from contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition as well as continued transactional weakness from the licensing program transition noted earlier. And in Enterprise Services, we expect revenue growth to be in the high single digits. 
In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $14.65 billion and $14.95 billion. As mentioned earlier, our guidance reflects the current constraints from the shutdowns in China, which had negatively impacted Q4 supply for OEM, Surface and Xbox consoles. In Windows OEM, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits, driven by the continued shift to a commercial-led PC market, where revenue per license is higher. 
In Windows Commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive growth in the low double digits. In Surface, revenue should grow in the low double digits. In Search and news advertising ex TAC, we expect revenue growth of approximately 20%. And in Gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the mid- to high single digits, driven by lower engagement hours year-over-year as well as constrained console supply. We expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline mid-single digits, though engagement hours are expected to remain higher than pre-pandemic levels. 
Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of $16.6 billion to $16.8 billion and operating expense of $14.8 billion to $14.9 billion, resulting in another quarter of operating margin expansion, excluding the change in useful life. We expect other income and expense to be negative $50 million, reflecting FX remeasurement impact based on market conditions in April. 
Similar to the rest of our guidance, further equity and FX movements through Q4 are not reflected in this number. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility. And we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%. 
We expect to close FY '22, even in a more complex macro environment, with the same consistency we have delivered throughout the year, with strong revenue growth, share gains and improved operating margins as we invest in the areas that are key to sustaining that growth. As we look towards FY '23, our track record of delivering high value to our customers across many diverse and durable growth markets gives us confidence that we will drive continued healthy double-digit revenue and operating income growth. 
Now Brett, let's go to Q&A.",2762

Really impressive results. And what we see is a pretty difficult climate out there, definitely from a stock market perspective. But if we think about interest rates, we think about inflation, there's a conflict going on in Europe right now, it does seem to be a tough backdrop. You guys are operating super well. I mean, the acceleration in Azure at that scale is truly awesome. And if I'm not mistaken, Office 365 Commercial accelerated as well in the quarter. So really impressive results.
But I think the question that most investors are going to have is where do you garner the confidence in the durability of this growth, given how volatile this macro backdrop is? Is it conversations you're having with customers? Is it what you see in the backlog? Maybe if you could give us some kind of insight into what gives you guys the confidence to put out that guide, to put out those healthy comments for FY '23. What are you seeing that can maybe help us give us and give investors a little bit more confidence in the durability of this growth in this environment?",191
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2022",2022-04-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3827.0,2547643.0,96348145.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,7,"Yes. Maybe I'll start. Maybe 3 levels, Keith. One is just the competitiveness of our tech stack, all up sort of from infrastructure all the way to the SaaS applications when it comes to the Commercial Cloud and as well as how we're able to monetize, for example, the installed base of our consumer franchises as well. So both of these places, we feel we are competitive and increasingly so, coming out of the pandemic, to gain share. 
I'd also say that in many of these places, we have price leadership. I mean, take the one point I made, which is if there is any macro headwind where you have more value for less price means you win. And in our case, when it comes to our Commercial Cloud offerings, we have significant advantages on that across the stack. 
The second thing is in the conversations we are having with our customers, the interesting thing I find from perhaps even past challenges, whether macro or micro, is I don't hear of businesses looking to their IT budgets or digital transformation projects as the place for cuts. If anything, some of these projects are the way they're going to accelerate their transformation or, for that matter, automation, for example. I have not seen this level of demand for automation technology to improve productivity because in an inflationary environment, the only deflationary force is software. So that's the second micro thing, the tone thing that's different. 
At the end of the day though, I mean, none of us here are trying to forecast macro. So all we think of is the TAMs that we are competing in are large. As a percentage of GDP, tech spend is, on a secular basis, by the end of the decade, going to double. We just want to keep driving usage, driving share and be competitive. So that's kind of how we view what we are doing, and that's where our confidence comes from in terms of our outlays, whether it's OpEx or CapEx. 
So I don't know, Amy, if you want to add to that.",350
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2022",2022-04-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3827.0,2547643.0,96348146.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,8,"I think the only thing, Satya, I might add is, I think we've always, and I think we've used this language quite frequently, focused on the long-term opportunity. You talked about it as the TAM that we're focused on. I would say also, there's still a lot of that TAM left to go after. And it is quite early still in the transitions you're talking about from a digital transformation perspective, from an automation perspective, from type of value and real productivity enhancements that can be made.
And so I think the continuity of the execution has certainly been very good from the sales and partner side. But I would also say, to your point, we're investing for a long-term opportunity. And our confidence that, that long-term outcome is right is where -- is I think the basis for where you and I are talking, giving this answer from.",149

I'd generally follow the same principle I try to follow, which is I give you my best knowledge as of today. I did note and tried to do that with a lot of clarity that were the production shutdowns to extend into May, there would be further negative impact on those from a supply constraint position. 
As you know, on the OEM business, that revenue is recognized at the point of production. And then for Xbox consoles as well as Surface, it's at sell-in. So production delays even earlier in May can obviously have a big impact on the quarter. So we're watching it, and I tried to make that transparent in the guidance. Outside of that, my guidance is reasonably consistent with how I like to do it.",161

I think it's going to not just help the stock but hopefully help a little bit more across into the industry. 
I'd like to look at Office, which had strength probably more than people expected. Where are we in the upsell opportunity from E3 to E5? And can you give us any sense of the sizing of how much of the growth not just now but going forward? Do you think it's going to come from frontline users?",87
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2022",2022-04-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3827.0,2547643.0,96348153.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,15,"Maybe I'll start answering that question, and Satya, if you want to add anything. Very specifically, Mark, I would say this quarter was quite similar in nature to what you saw in the past few. Seat growth, while across all segments, was especially good in frontline worker and SMB. That did mask a little bit, as it often does, the ARPU improvement, given those tend to be lower-priced SKUs, the ARPU improvement that we're seeing from the transitions into E5. 
The transition from E3 to E5 still has opportunity. I would say we're in the earlier transitions of that. So in terms, as I think about going forward, there's certainly still room for both seat growth, specifically in frontline worker as you noted as well as SMB and then ARPU expansion through the E5 transition. 
The thing I would add that Satya mentioned in his comments and again in his first answer, is really the value that is available to customers in E5, whether that is security, whether it's compliance, whether it's phone, whether it's analytics, the value of that suite, and if you think even more broadly, the value of Microsoft 365, which adds in more components around Windows, I think we are offering high value, and that tends to give us some optimism that we can continue to execute well in that segment. 
I don't know, Satya, if there's anything you would add to that.",238

I mean, I think the fundamentals are pretty strong here still, whether it's E5 growth, SMB growth, frontline worker. I'd also add emerging markets. I mean, this is the first time I feel that we have products that fit just emerging markets like Teams Essentials, where we can even really penetrate markets that we've never sold anything in the past.
And then the new growth engines that you talked about, Teams Phones, Teams Rooms, Viva and even Windows 365 are all things that we can again drive growth from. And the point about sort of our value is probably very, very strong in a time like this, in particular. And we see it, like the one thing also I'd say, is the usage data that we are seeing is peak everywhere. And so that's the other thing is we definitely will optimize for driving usage and deployment, and that's going to be our priority.",160

Is that something that you would characterize as Microsoft-specific? As you described in your comments, you're transitioning customers off your open license program. Or do you feel like that's a broader issue where maybe we're starting to see a little bit of a tilt from on-prem to cloud even faster than we've seen before?",91
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2022",2022-04-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3827.0,2547643.0,96348157.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,19,"Thanks, Karl. That's a very good question. I would say it does not feel like the tilt from on-prem to cloud felt any different in a way that would have impacted the quarter any more so than it normally does in terms of the normal transitions that we've seen, to your point, on Office or, frankly, even in Server as we have people move those workloads and migrate those workloads to the cloud. 
This really was a very significant -- think of it as where partners transact, and we have such a broad and valuable and really needed partner community that is very vast. And we put this and had planned for this change for January 1. And we executed the change on January 1 as planned, and it's just taking us a little longer to onboard all of this community to make sure that they can transact the way they want to in the program. 
So I do think it's going to take us longer than we thought. We're going to continue to see that impact in Q4. And I know the teams are working hard to make sure that partners get comfortable with the new system, which is important to us.",203

And so I'm curious what, in your view, is allowing your Azure trajectory to show better resilience? And do you, in fact, see some of the newer products kicking in, such as Azure Arc or Synapse, Cognitive Services, OpenAI and perhaps contributing to the strength in health and resiliency of that Azure number?",74
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2022",2022-04-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3827.0,2547643.0,96348161.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,23,"Yes. I mean, what I'd say, Karl (sic) [ Mark ] is that what we are seeing is a classic what happens with consumption meters, right, which is they grow and then they get optimized and they grow again, both existing and new. And so it sort of will always have some amount of volatility that even Amy referenced quarter-over-quarter. 
But if I walk up this -- one thing that we look at is growth coming from all segments, right? So small business and enterprise. Is it coming from all regions? And it is. We also look at the type of workloads it's coming from. And so it looks healthy in all of those. And if you walk up the stack to your point, on the infrastructure side, the Tier 1 workloads is where I think we are seeing some big Tier 1 workloads, and I had many comments on SAP and other workloads moving. 
The second thing I would say is on the PaaS services and our dev SaaS, that's another area where we have differentiated value, so we see good growth there. Data and AI for sure. I mean, the thing that I find really to be something that I think in the long run is going to probably be one of the bigger drivers of our growth and differentiation is our data fabric. Because we're the only guys who have a complete data fabric from the operational store that's fully integrated into an analytics engine, that's fully integrated into governance. 
And that increasingly is going to become more and more important, right? I mean, you can be dealing with this -- a new regulation coming on privacy and governance on one end and your operational store being divorced from that. So we have a very differentiated offer, and I talked about some of the growth numbers there. The AI inference is also finally kicking. They're very small today. But even when I look at the total -- that's just essentially a compute meter, there's growth there. 
So overall, I think we will see quarter-over-quarter some cyclicality depending on which customers. In fact, we pay people at Microsoft to reduce customer bills and which we should. So given that we may see cyclicality in terms of how optimizations happen, but overall, we're still very early on as the world sort of migrates to the cloud and uses essentially cloud infrastructure and compute as sort of to drive their operational efficiencies and product.",414

Satya, very clearly on your comments, and particularly, you talked about tech as a percentage of GDP doubling over the next 7, 8 years or so. Nobody could have really predicted, maybe besides yourself, that Azure would be this big and growing this fast at this point in time relative to, say, 5, 6 years back. 
So as you look forward, what part of the Microsoft tech stack do you think is underrepresented in the digital world and has, therefore, more opportunity to gain as you build out your thesis on tech as a percent of GDP doubling?",103
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2022",2022-04-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3827.0,2547643.0,96348164.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,26,"I mean, the thing that I always go back, Kash, is that all enterprise value, at least as far as I can tell, gets created at 3 layers of the tech stack. What happens with the infrastructure, whenever something can be 10x better. So for example, when we talk about the next generation of multi-edge, multi-cloud infrastructure remaining one of the leaders, that's going to be a massive EV creation, as a percentage of GDP, tech spend doubles. So that's where everything from Azure, Azure Arc, our database, all of that is super important.
The other one is -- and this is sort of age of AI. In other words, the core business logic is not being written. It's being written by software. So when I look at -- when I use GitHub Copilot, that's there -- therein lies the future of what -- how all business logic gets written. 
And so to me, the AI layer, both the training supercomputers as well as the inference layer, that's a place where you'll see us integrate what, today, you all consider to be 2 different businesses, whether it's Azure and Windows. They're just one business to me because to me, where training happens, where inference happens will be written once by developers and then it will light up across this distributed fabric. So that's another place where I think there's tons of enterprise value that will get created over time. 
And then, of course, the UI layer always is the biggest one and the next inflection point, whether it's what happens with metaverse or what happens with even on the industrial side with IoT and digital twins. Those are all things that I think will be the ones that we will be focused on. So these 3 things translated into workloads and what we call our customer solution areas are the ways that at least we are investing in.",318

Azure growth in commercial bookings strength stand out. You mentioned a step-down expected in Azure growth in Q4 but it still suggests very impressive growth at that scale. Can you expand on the large deal commentary, the longer-term strategic deals you've referenced a few times over the past couple of quarters? How those impact visibility or maybe the approach to framing targets there? And anything you can add just around how the addition of Nuance helps the cloud business and the industry cloud approach as well is fairly appreciated.",94

Just a couple of quick things. One is on the strategic commitments that are being made, we are sort of working at them workload at a time. And so we feel very, very good about both the type of workloads. In fact, there is a migration of a bunch of workloads that we may have won in the client server ahead that are migrating. But the most exciting thing is the type of Tier 1 workloads that we have never seen run on any Microsoft infrastructure that's running on Azure today and being optimized on Azure. So that's the thing that we see as we win these large strategic deals. 
On Nuance, for me, the thing that's exciting is Nuance is a platform layer for these AI-driven applications that are getting deployed, whether it's in health care or even in the enterprise contact center. So we are very excited about Nuance now being part of the Microsoft family. You'll see us pretty aggressively go innovate there and grow the impact of these solutions in both what is sort of the large percentages of our GDP, like health care, where I think things like tackling issues like physician burdens with new innovative solutions is much needed, and we are really looking forward to exercising that.",216

But really, I think the way we think about them maybe outside of this phone call is that it's the beginning of the commitment between us and a customer to start to work together to deliver value.
And so we go workload by workload, opportunity by opportunity. And I think that's what you were inferring a bit is that it's almost the top of the funnel to create value for the customer. We call it delivering success to make sure they're spending the dollars the most effective way, making sure we're tackling the hardest problems that they need solved. And with that comes our investments that we've made in deployment resources and usage resources specifically in Azure to make that possible with customers. 
And so you're right to say, I do talk about them in terms of volatility they create. What it creates inside the company is the beginning of a commitment to make sure we're tackling the workloads and the solutions that the customers want to make happen across all of the workloads, frankly, that Satya has talked about today.",218

And really, the more important related part is, given the outlook that you may have for the PC market, how are you thinking about the durability of the Windows side of your business? In particular, if you'd comment on the fundamentals related to the PC market but also the opportunities to keep mixing up, so to speak, helped by Microsoft 365.",117

So I think on the Commercial side, I think it's well understood is that Windows is the socket for Microsoft 365. We have tremendous value. Amy referenced this earlier. In fact, we just launched Windows 11 and pro value with Windows 365. That's resonating super well. The customer sat, adoption rates when it comes, whether it's security, whether it's productivity, we feel good about the Commercial business. So we'll stay focused on it, on the Commercial side. 
And on the consumer side, the -- coming out of, again, the pandemic, the intensity of the usage has gone up. So one of the areas of focus for us is some of the stuff that I talked about in my remarks is just the usage, right? So when you think about 500 million users engaging with Microsoft Start, that's not the type of engagement we had. And so with the large install base now, we have significant room there. The browser share growth, we have significant room there. 
And then, of course, the subscription attaches, whether it's gaming or whether it's productivity or suites. So that's kind of how I look at what we're going to do at least in the immediate future. PC remains a very important category in, I think, people's lives is what we've discovered during the pandemic. And if anything, the intensity of usage has increased. And there will be cyclical demand that we'll go through, but the number of use cases has definitely, I think, structurally increased.",251

I think the one thing I would add on your demand side, we have seen the transition from, I would say, in the middle of the pandemic, definitely a consumer-driven demand cycle. We've transitioned that to be a commercial part of the demand side. And so I do expect that to be the case. Obviously, I think this is the second quarter in a row we've seen that transition. Expect Q4 to be even more of that, and then we'll wait and see how the second half of the year shapes up.",93

Amid this macroeconomic environment, the Microsoft Cloud surpassed $25 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time, up 28% and 33% in constant currency. When I talk with customers, it's clear there is a real opportunity to help organizations in every industry use digital technology to overcome today's challenges and emerge stronger. 
In this environment, we are focused on 3 things: first, no company is better positioned than Microsoft to help organizations deliver on their digital imperative so that they can do more with less. From infrastructure and data to business applications and hybrid work, we provide unique differentiated value to our customers. Second, we will invest to take share and build new businesses and categories where we have long-term structural advantage. Lastly, we will manage through this period with an intense focus on prioritization and executional excellence in our own operations to drive operational leverage.  
With that, let me highlight our progress, starting with Azure. Organizations in every industry continue to choose our cloud to align their IT investments with demand. We are seeing larger and longer-term commitments and won a record number of $100 million-plus and $1 billion-plus deals this quarter. We have more data center regions than any other provider, and we will launch 10 regions over the next year.  
Our new Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty helps public sector customers meet urgent compliance, security and privacy requirements. With Azure Arc, we are meeting customers where they are enabling companies like GM, Gregg, UBS and Uniper to run applications across on-prem edge and multi-cloud environments. We are seeing more customers move their mission-critical workloads to Azure.  
American Airlines, for example, chose our cloud to run its key operational workloads, including its data warehouse. And Telstra will move its internal IT workloads to Azure. And we are the platform of choice for SAP apps on the cloud. Leaders in every industry, including Kraft Heinz, Fujitsu and Unilever have migrated ERP workloads to Azure. Just last week, we announced a new service to accelerate adoption of Oracle workloads on Azure. We are the only public cloud with simplified direct access to Oracle databases running in the Oracle Cloud.  
Now on to data and AI. With our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform, we provide a complete data fabric spanning operational databases, analytics and governance, helping customers focus on creating value instead of integrating fragmented data estate. More than 65% of the Fortune 1000 use 3 or more of our data solutions, and we are growing faster than the market. We are seeing leaders in every industry from LaLiga and Lenovo to Swiss Re and Walgreens unify their data using our tools. Cosmos DB is the go-to database powering the world's most demanding mission-critical workloads at any scale. Transactions in data volume increased over 100% year-over-year for the fourth quarter in a row.  
When it comes to AI, we are seeing a paradigm shift as the world's large AI models become powerful platforms themselves. With our Azure OpenAI service, a diverse set of customers from HSBC, PwC and RTL Group to Shell and Wipro are applying language models to advanced scenarios like content and code generation.  
Now on to developer tools. We have the most popular developer tools across any cloud and any platform. Leaders in every industry from Ahold Delhaize to KPMG to Philips are all choosing GitHub to build software. GitHub Copilot is the first-of-its-kind AI pair programmer, which helps developers write better code faster. More than 400,000 people have subscribed since we made it generally available a month ago.  
And with our expanding portfolio of container services, organizations like H&M can build modern, more resilient cloud-native applications. All up, revenue from Azure container services increased by triple digits.  
Now on to Power Platform. With Power Platform, we are helping domain experts rapidly drive productivity gains at a time when it's never been more important. We now have nearly 25 million monthly active users, and we are innovating to make it even easier for teams of pro and citizen developers to build end-to-end business solutions together. AB InBev, ARM, Equinor, Toyota, Vodafone and Zurich Insurance have all built centers of excellence to train employees at scale on how to use Power Platform. PG&E, for example, expects to save at least 720,000 hours by eliminating redundant and manual processes across employee workflows.  
Now on to Dynamics 365. We are helping organizations digitize their customer experience, service, finance and supply chain functions as we continue to outgrow the market in every category. Our new Microsoft Digital Contact Center Platform brings together Dynamics 365, Microsoft Teams as well as enterprise AI capabilities from Nuance to help customers like HP deliver omnichannel customer engagement.  
And new integrations between Dynamics 365 and Intelligent Order Management and Teams help people collaborate in the flow of work to overcome supply chain disruptions. We are winning customers as we help organizations address their most pressing challenges. Peet's Coffee is modernizing its supply chain with our business applications. Carlsberg is standardizing its field service and customer service operations. And Visa switched to Dynamics 365 for both its sales and call center organizations.  
When it comes to our industry and cross-industry clouds, we are seeing strong adoption as we take a platform-driven approach to help organizations deliver on their digital imperative. For example, Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare, inclusive of Nuance, is becoming the platform of choice for companies across the health care value chain, looking to drive meaningful clinical and financial outcomes. Whether it's a provider modernizing care delivery, a health plan transforming the member experience or a retailer expanding into health services, having a technology partner that is truly dedicated to empowering their success is a significant differentiator for us. Intermountain Healthcare, for example, chose the Cloud for Healthcare as well as Nuance's DAX Ambient Intelligence solution as the pillar of its new digital strategy.  
Now on to Microsoft 365 and Teams. In this economic environment, every organization is looking to support employee flexibility and improve productivity. Hybrid work is now just work, and it's imperative that organizations reconnect and reengage the workforce at home, in the office and everywhere in between. To do this, companies need a digital fabric that connects employees as well as customers and partners wherever and whenever they work while reducing cost and complexity.  
We are all in on Teams. Over the past year, we've introduced more than 450 capabilities to empower frontline and knowledge workers to collaborate synchronously and asynchronously as well as remote and in-person. Teams is taking share across every category from collaboration to chat to meetings to calling and seeing higher usage intensity as companies turn to the platform to accelerate their digital transformation and orchestrate all their business process in the flow of work. 
ISVs from Adobe to Workday have built deep integrations with Teams. And more than 100,000 companies, including Johnson & Johnson, Lumen Technologies and Progressive Insurance have deployed custom line of business applications in Teams. All up, the number of third-party and LOB apps with active usage increased by 40% year-over-year.  
Teams Phone is the market leader in cloud calling across VoIP and PSTN. We now have over 12 million PSTN users, nearly double the number a year ago. And Teams Rooms bridges the gap between people working remotely and those in the office with innovations like AI-powered cameras. More than 60% of the Fortune 500 have chosen Teams Rooms to connect employees across the hybrid workplace.  
We're also building a completely new suite with Microsoft Viva, as we create a new employee experience category. This is both a priority for our customers and an expansive and high-growth TAM for us. 25% of the Fortune 500 already use Viva as organizations increasingly recognize that employee experience and well-being are essential to their productivity. We have seen broad adoption across segments and industries from Commonwealth Bank, Fidelity Investments and Mastercard to AstraZeneca and Schlumberger. And this innovation is driving revenue growth across Microsoft 365. Asahi, Expedia Group and Qualcomm all chose our premium offerings to transform how employees work. E5 seats increased more than 60% year-over-year.  
Now on to Windows. With Windows, we are putting people at the center to help them securely work, connect and play. Despite a changing market for PCs during the quarter, we continue to see more PCs shipped than pre pandemic and are taking share. And we are seeing higher monthly usage of Windows 11 applications with increased time spent across creative work, collaboration, gaming, media and writing code as people rely on the PC for its unique productivity capabilities, rich interactive experiences and to stay connected.  
We are transforming how Windows is experienced and managed with Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365. Azure Virtual Desktop monthly active usage increased nearly 60% year-over-year. One year in, we are seeing strong adoption of Windows 365 from organizations in every industry from Hamburg Commercial Bank and Kyndryl to LEGO Group and Schroders as they use cloud PCs to rapidly onboard new and temporary employees and speed M&A integration while reducing IT costs.  
Now on to security. As the rate and pace of threats continue to accelerate, security is the top priority for every organization. We provide comprehensive solutions that integrate more than 50 categories informed by more than 43 trillion signals each day, reducing cost and complexity. We're taking share across all major categories we serve. All up, our security revenue increased 40%. We are the only cloud provider with protection for the top 3 cloud platforms, and we are seeing more and more customers turn to us to protect their multi-cloud, multi-platform infrastructure. Pearson VUE and Vodafone both chose our security stack to protect their digital estate across clouds.  
And we're going further to help protect organizations. Our new Entra product family includes tools for permissions management, identity governance and identity verification. And we now offer managed threat detection and response with Microsoft Security Experts, the world's largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, for example, will use the service to supplement its own security operations.  
Now on to LinkedIn. We once again saw record engagement among the more than 850 million members, a testament to how mission-critical the platform is to connect job seekers with jobs, learners with skills and marketeers with buyers. We are seeing job candidates and employers alike prioritize skills to more efficiently find and source work. More than 40% of the companies on LinkedIn now rely on skills filters to identify candidates.  
LinkedIn Talent Solutions surpassed $6 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, up 39% year-over-year. And LinkedIn Marketing Solutions surpassed $5 billion in annual revenue for the first time. We are a leader in B2B digital advertising, and we continue to see customers choose us for higher reach and ROI. More broadly, despite the current headwinds in the ad market, we are expanding our opportunity in advertising as we look towards the long term.  
We are creating a new monetization engine for the web, an alternative that offers marketeers and publishers more long-term viable ad solutions and supports consumer privacy and strong data governance. It starts with our first-party Internet experiences. We are focused on increasing our share and engagement across Edge, Bing and our personalized content feed, Microsoft Start. Daily content consumption across Start in categories like news, weather, finance and sports increased 80% since we launched the service 1 year ago.  
And Edge continues to gain share as consumers use it to save money with our built-in coupon and price comparison features. Our approach extends to our third-party ad network. We closed our acquisition of Xandr last month and now power one of the world's largest marketplaces for premium advertising. With Microsoft advertising, every media and consumer Internet company now has a trusted platform for their own ad innovation and monetization.  
Just 2 weeks ago, Netflix chose us as its exclusive technology and sales partner for its first ad-supported subscription offering, a validation of the differentiated value we provide to any publisher looking for a flexible partner willing to build and innovate with them. And with PromoteIQ, we are providing a platform for retailers like Home Depot, Kohl's and Kroger to build their own digital commerce and marketing channels. This quarter, Sephora chose our solution to help build a new advertising revenue stream while maintaining ownership of their own data and customer relationships.  
Now on to gaming. We offer the best value in the gaming industry. Our Xbox Game Pass subscription service includes access to hundreds of games, and Xbox Series S is the most affordable next-generation console. We sold more consoles live to date than any previous generation of Xbox and have been the market leader in North America for 3 quarters in a row amongst next-gen consoles. And with Xbox Cloud Gaming, we are bringing games to new endpoints. Players now can stream Xbox games on Samsung Smart TVs. And we partnered with Epic Games to make Fortnite available for free via the browser. Over 4 million people have streamed the game to date, including over 1 million who were new to our ecosystem.  
In closing, we are investing in sharpening our focus to help our customers during this critical moment and to capture the massive technological shifts underway. Our portfolio of best-of-category products and best-of-suite solutions, along with our durable business models and intense focus on prioritization and executional excellence, make me confident about our opportunity ahead in the coming year. With that, I'll hand it over to Amy.",2249
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2022",2022-07-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3766.0,2604788.0,98242200.0,Presenter Speech,Amy Hood,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $51.9 billion, up 12% and 16% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.23 and increased 3% and 8% in constant currency. I'd like to start by discussing the impact of the macroeconomic environment on our results this quarter. 
First, FX. The U.S. dollar strengthened throughout the quarter, creating an additional headwind beyond what we shared mid-quarter. As a result, for the full quarter, revenue and EPS were negatively impacted by $595 million and $0.04 per share, beyond our expectations shared in April.  
Next, extended production shutdowns in China that continued through May and a deteriorating PC market in June contributed to a negative Windows OEM revenue impact of more than $300 million. And finally, reductions in advertising spend impacted LinkedIn Marketing Solutions and search and news advertising revenue by more than $100 million. In our consumer business, despite those macro challenges, we drove another quarter of share gains for Windows in the PC market and for Edge in browsers.  
In our commercial business, Q4 was the largest quarter ever for long-term commitments to our platform. And as you heard from Satya, we saw share gains in areas such as Data and AI, Dynamics, Teams and Security. Against a strong prior year comparable, commercial bookings increased 25% and 35% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations. Our record commitment quarter was driven by increases in the number of $100 million-plus Azure and $10 million-plus Microsoft 365 contracts as well as consistent strong execution across our core annuity sales motions.  
Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 34% and 37% in constant currency to $189 billion, roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 28% year-over-year. The remaining portion which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 39% year-over-year, and our acuity mix increased 1 point year-over-year to 96%. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $25 billion and grew 28% and 33% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 69%. Excluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by improvement across our cloud services, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure.  
Now back to total company level. As noted earlier, FX decreased total company revenue by 4 points, 2 points unfavorable to expectations. Additionally, FX decreased COGS and operating expense growth by 2 points, 1 point favorable to expectations. Gross margin dollars increased 10% and 15% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased year-over-year to 68%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate and FX, gross margin percentage increased slightly as the improvement in cloud services noted earlier was partially offset by sales mix shift to cloud.  
Operating expense increased 14% and 16% in constant currency, driven by increased investments in cloud engineering, LinkedIn and Nuance. OpEx growth included roughly 2 points from the decision to scale down operations in Russia, employee severance and the impact from the Xandr acquisition, which closed in June. At a total company level, headcount grew 22% year-over-year as we continued to invest in key areas such as cloud engineering, LinkedIn, sales and customer deployment, and included roughly 6 points of growth from the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions.  
Operating income increased 8% and 14% in constant currency, and operating margins decreased year-over-year to 40%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate and FX, operating margins were relatively unchanged as the improvement in cloud services noted earlier and sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses were offset by the impact of the Nuance acquisition.   
Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $16.6 billion and grew 13% and 17% in constant currency. FX decreased segment revenue $159 million more than expected. When adjusting for the additional FX headwind, overall segment results were in line with expectations. Office commercial revenue grew 9% and 13% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 15% and 19% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments as well as higher ARPU from continued momentum in E5. 
Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 14% year-over-year, driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although growth was impacted by some moderation in new deal volume outside of E5, particularly in the small and medium business customer segment. Demand for security, compliance and voice value in Microsoft 365 drove strong E5 momentum again this quarter. E5 now accounts for 12% of our Office 365 commercial installed base. 
Office commercial licensing was down 32% and 28% in constant currency, lower than expected, driven primarily by a lower mix of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition. Office consumer revenue grew 9% and 12% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 15% to 59.7 million. 
Dynamics revenue grew 19% and 24% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 31% and 36% in constant currency, slightly below expectations due to lower-than-expected growth in new business even as our cloud growth continues to outpace the market. LinkedIn revenue increased 26% and 29% in constant currency, lower than expected as Marketing Solutions was impacted by the slowdown of advertising spend noted earlier. And Talent Solutions was impacted by weaker online job posts late in the quarter. 
Segment gross margin dollars increased 12% and 17% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by improvement across all cloud services. Operating expense increased 12% and 14% in constant currency, and operating income increased 12% and 19% in constant currency. 
Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $20.9 billion, increasing 20% and 25% in constant currency. FX decreased segment revenue $309 million, more than expected. Excluding the additional FX headwind, segment results were in line with expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 22% and 26% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 40% and 46% in constant currency, about 1 point lower than expected, driven by a slight moderation in Azure consumption growth across customer segments. 
In our per user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 21% to over 230 million seats, with some impact from the small and medium business deal moderation noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 2% and increased 1% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by a greater-than-expected number of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition. 
Enterprise Services revenue grew 5% and 8% in constant currency, lower than expected, driven by declines in Microsoft Consulting Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 15% and 19% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 3 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage declined roughly 2 points, driven by sales mix shift to Azure, partially offset by improvements in Azure margins. Operating expenses increased 20% and 22% in constant currency, including roughly 7 points of impact from Nuance. And operating income grew 11% and 18% in constant currency. 
Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.4 billion, increasing 2% and 5% in constant currency. FX decreased segment revenue $127 million more than expected. Excluding the additional FX headwind, segment results were below our guidance range, driven by the PC and ad trends mentioned earlier. Windows OEM revenue decreased 2% year-over-year. Despite the deteriorating PC market, we saw share gains again this quarter and volumes remained above pre-pandemic levels. 
Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 6% and 12% in constant currency, lower than expected due to some impact from the small and medium business deal moderation noted earlier. Surface revenue grew 10% and 15% in constant currency, driven by commercial sales. 
Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 18% and 21% in constant currency, lower than expected, driven by the slowdown in advertising spend noted earlier, partially offset by the inclusion of 3 weeks of results from Xandr. 
And in gaming, revenue declined 7% and 5% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Xbox hardware revenue declined 11% and 8% in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue declined 6% and 4% in constant currency, driven by lower engagement hours and monetization in third-party and first-party content, partially offset by growth in Xbox Game Pass subscriptions. 
Segment gross margin dollars were relatively unchanged and increased 4% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point year-over-year, driven by increased usage of Windows Commercial cloud services. Operating expenses increased 8% and 10% in constant currency, and operating income decreased 5% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency. 
Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $8.7 billion, in line with expectations. Cash paid for PP&E was $6.9 billion. Our data center investments continue to be based on significant customer demand and usage signals. Cash flow from operations was $24.6 billion, increasing 8%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $17.8 billion, up 9% year-over-year. 
This quarter, other income and expense was negative $47 million, primarily driven by net losses on investments, including mark-to-market losses on our equity portfolio. Equity market declines drove net investment losses this quarter compared to net investment gains last year, resulting in a negative 3-point impact on EPS growth. 
Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we returned $12.4 billion to shareholders, up 19% year-over-year through share repurchases and dividends, bringing our total cash returned to shareholders to over $46 billion for the full fiscal year. 
Now moving to our outlook. My commentary for both the full year and next quarter does not include any impact from Activision, which we still expect to close by the end of the fiscal year. Let me start with some full year commentary for FY '23. First, effective at the start of FY '23, we are extending the depreciable useful life for server and network equipment assets in our cloud infrastructure from 4 to 6 years, which will apply to the asset balances on our balance sheet as of June 30, 2022, as well as future asset purchases. 
Investments in our software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment as well as advances in technology have resulted in lives extending beyond historical accounting useful lives. This change only impacts the timing of depreciation expense in the future for these assets. 
As a result, based on the outstanding balances as of June 30, we expect fiscal year '23 operating income to be favorably impacted by approximately $3.7 billion for the full fiscal year and approximately $1.1 billion in the first quarter. This has been included in the guidance we will provide on today's call. Additional details on the mechanics of the change are in our earnings materials. 
Second, on FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect a roughly 4-point impact to full year revenue growth with headwinds in H1 greater than in H2. FX should also decrease COGS and operating expense growth by 2 points. 
Now to our full year business outlook based on the current macro environment. At every level of the company, we manage performance on a constant currency basis, as we have for many years. Therefore, with the FX volatility we have seen, I will comment on full year in constant currency and in U.S. dollars. We continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth in both constant currency and U.S. dollars. Revenue growth will be driven by continued momentum in our commercial business and a focus on share gains across our portfolio. 
Operating expense growth will be significant early in FY '23 and will moderate materially over the course of the year as we slow the rate of hiring to focus on key growth areas, increase the productivity of prior year headcount investments and anniversary the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions. And even with this significant level of investment in our future, we expect operating margins based on constant currency to be approximately flat year-over-year in FY '23, excluding the benefit from the latest change in useful life. And in U.S. dollars, we expect FY '23 full year margins to be roughly flat as the useful life benefit is mostly offset by the FX headwind mentioned earlier. And finally, we expect our FY '23 effective tax rate to be roughly 19%. 
Now to the outlook for the first quarter, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. First, FX. With the stronger U.S. dollar and based on current rates, we expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately 5 points and to decrease total COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 3 points. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly 6 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and 3 points in More Personal Computing. 
Overall, our outlook has the trends we saw in June continue through Q1. Continued weakness in the PC market demand and advertising spend will impact Windows OEM, Surface, LinkedIn and Search and news advertising revenue. Our differentiated market position, customer demand across our solution portfolio and consistent execution across the Microsoft Cloud should drive another strong quarter of revenue and share growth, although we expect to continue to see growth moderation in our small- and medium-sized business segment. 
In commercial bookings, strong execution across our core annuity sales motions and increased commitment to our platform should drive healthy growth on a flat expiry base. As a reminder, the growing mix of larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, always drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. 
Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be up roughly 2 points year-over-year, driven by the latest accounting estimate change noted earlier. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, Q1 gross margin percentage will decrease roughly 1 point, driven by revenue mix shift to Azure and the impact from the Nuance acquisition, partially offset by continued margin improvement in Azure. In capital expenditures, we expect a sequential decrease on a dollar basis, with normal quarterly spend variability and the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out. 
Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 12% and 14% in constant currency or USD 15.95 billion to USD 16.25 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be sequentially lower by roughly 2 points on a constant currency basis with a bit more FX impact on U.S. dollar growth than at the segment level. 
In our on-premises business, on a prior year comparable, which benefited from contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition, we expect revenue to decline in the mid- to high 30s. In Office consumer, we expect revenue to grow in the low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. 
For LinkedIn, we expect continued strong engagement on the platform, although results will be impacted by the slowdown in advertising spend and hiring, resulting in low to mid-teens rev growth. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high teens, driven by share growth in Dynamics 365. 
For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 25% and 27% in constant currency or USD 20.3 billion to USD 20.6 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. 
We expect Azure revenue growth to be sequentially lower by roughly 3 points on a constant currency basis. Azure revenue will continue to be driven by strong growth in consumption, and our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, although we expect moderation in growth rates, given the size of the installed base. 
In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline low single digits, driven by strong demand for our hybrid offerings offset by the prior year comparable, which included benefit from contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition. At Enterprise Services, we expect revenue growth to be in the low single digits, driven by enterprise support, partially offset by declines in Microsoft Consulting Services. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to grow between 1% and 4% in constant currency or USD 13 billion to USD 13.4 billion. 
In Windows OEM, we expect revenue to decline in the high single digits. Excluding the impact from the Windows 11 revenue deferral last year, revenue would decline mid-teens, reflecting continued weakness in the PC market. In Windows Commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive growth in the high single digits. 
In Surface, revenue should decline in the low single digits. Search and news advertising ex TAC should grow in the mid- to high teens, roughly 10 points faster than the overall Search and news advertising revenue, driven by growing first-party revenue and the inclusion of Xandr. And in Gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits, driven by declines in first-party content, partially offset by growth in Game Pass subscribers and consoles. We expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits. 
Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow between 12% and 14% in constant currency or to be between USD 14.9 billion and USD 15.1 billion and operating expense to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency or to be between USD 13.3 billion and USD 13.4 billion. Total company headcount is expected to continue to grow, with 11,000 hires expected to start in Q1, primarily in cloud engineering, LinkedIn, customer deployment and commercial sales.  
In other income and expense, interest income and expense should offset each other. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility. And we expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. 
Finally, as a reminder on Q1 cash flow, we will be making $3.2 billion of tax payments related to the TCJA transition tax and the transfer of intangible property completed in Q1 of FY '22. In closing, we continue to see strong demand for our products and services and increased commitment to our platform as we remain focused on delivering compelling customer value in this dynamic environment, resulting in continued share gains. As we manage through this period, we will continue to invest in future growth while maintaining intense focus on operational excellence and execution discipline.

And that's where my question lies. You talked about the largest-ever number of big deals that you guys were able to sign in Q4. Typically, we think this type of environment is -- it makes it harder to sign those big deals. 
Can you talk to us a little bit about how you got that done? Was the consolidating impact that Microsoft brings to the market the price performance? And maybe the macro, is that actually a benefit for you guys to close these deals in this type of environment? Or was it just kind of a typical Q4 end-of-year kind of budget flush kind of thing for you guys? And it was absent of the environment or not really related to the environment?",147

It was a record even for us, even with the context of Q4. So there's obviously something going on in the macro environment, which does feel that it does play to our strength. There are 2 things at least I've observed. One is the -- whether the bookings number or the Mac deals and the size of the Mac deals and the number of them, I think, speak to very much what we have been talking about for a long time now, which is as a percentage of GDP, IT spend is going to increase because every business is trying to fortify itself with digital tech to, in some sense, navigate this macro environment. So that, I think, is probably what is reflected in those numbers. 
And then the second aspect is also what you just referenced, which is, we do have every layer of the tech stack, right, whether it's infra, data, hybrid work, security, even Power Platform. In each one of these, we do have this best-of-suite value, which includes best-of-category products. And that is leading to share gains. So if you want to bet on a vendor on a long-term basis where you have that best-of-suite value and then you're able to sort of consume it on your terms, I think that, that's effectively what some of those numbers are indicative of.",231

21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2022",2022-07-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3766.0,2604788.0,98242206.0,Question,Mark Moerdler,,Analysts,9,"Congratulations on the quarter. I'd like to follow up a little bit on that. With all the concerns about macro and recession, everyone is trying to understand how cloud and for Microsoft's case, more specifically, IaaS, PaaS offerings and this slowdown in recession, how do you think about Azure's resiliency? How do you think about Azure's exposure to advertising business, consumer Internet and SMB if we do see a real recession?",71
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2022",2022-07-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3766.0,2604788.0,98242207.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,10,"Yes. Maybe I'll start, and Amy, feel free to add. I mean, overall, we're not immune to what's happening in the macro broadly, right? To Keith's question and your question, Mark, I think I'd say I'd start there because whether it's on the demand side with consumers or SMBs, I think Amy in her remarks talked about some of that even in our results in the quarter. 
But what's happening with -- in Azure though, is in some sense, businesses trying to deal with the overall macroeconomic situation and doing -- trying to make sure that they can do more with less. So for example, moving to the cloud is the best way to shape your spend with demand uncertainty, right? Because -- and in fact, if anything, one of the things that we're seeing is an increased shift towards the cloud. 
And then, of course, optimizing your bill. We are incenting even our own field to ensure that the bills for our customers come down. And that, in fact, even shows up in some of the volatility in our Azure numbers because that's one of the big benefits of the public cloud. And that's why I think coming out of this macroeconomic crisis, the public cloud will be even a bigger winner because it does act as that deflationary force. 
So that's sort of what we are seeing in the Azure numbers. We will be exposed to consumer-driven businesses and SMBs. But at some level, our strength as a company is much stronger in the core commercial. So I think that we'll do fine there. The other one is also people building new applications at a completely new frontier. 
I mean there are 2 numbers that I talked about. One is the triple-digit growth in Cosmos DB and triple-digit growth in container app services. You take those 2 things and you say, what are people doing? People are writing applications at a completely different frontier of efficiency, which is cloud-native serverless container-based types of applications. And so to me, that's one of the way for you to make sure that your IT spend goes a long way in a time like this.",363

I guess many are asking, are you embedding a worsening macro environment or a similar environment that we're in to get to that type of growth?",33

As I said, it's trying to take into account the current macro environment. And as I said, I took what we saw in June, applied it as best we thought we could through the course of the fiscal year. And if you think about how the -- and if you try to look over the course of the year with some of my comments, you'd say, okay, in H1 versus H2, I would point out 3 things that changed a bit over the course of that time.
First, of course, if we're talking about USD would be FX, it's a bigger headwind in H1, it's less of a headwind in H2. The second thing I would point to would be OpEx. As we've talked about in H1, we've obviously added 22% headcount this quarter. We still have 11,000 hires that we have starting in Q1. We've still got Nuance and Xandr in acquisitions, and we anniversary a lot of that as we focus our hiring and focus on the productivity of all of the hiring we've done over the past year. 
And then the OEM comparables obviously get a lot different when you get from H1 into H2. And so as you're trying to think about the shape and how did I consider it, I sort of took those things into account, thought about the trends we've been seeing in June and applied them as best we can.",240

Amy, you and Satya talked about very robust large new deal activity. I thought your guidance for Azure constant currency growth in the September quarter of a 3-point decel to 43 is fairly solid. But you did mention that in the June quarter, you experienced a little bit of consumption softness. Do you mind explaining what that was? And when you put all this together, how you're feeling about the Azure business in the next couple of quarters in terms of the slope of the likely deceleration?",98
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2022",2022-07-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3766.0,2604788.0,98242213.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,16,"Thanks, Karl. Maybe I'll start, and then, Satya, you obviously should add on to the commentary. I would point you, Karl, really to some of the things Satya mentioned, which is, and we said in our comments, we did see some deceleration, a point a little more than we had expected in the consumption side through the course of Q4. It really applied across all customer segments and, in general, applied across geographies. 
You saw customers, as Satya discussed, much like they always do, focus on optimization and continuing to think about which new workflows to prioritize and start. We've really taken that frame and applied it as we thought to H1 and specifically to Q1 in that guidance. It does assume continued consumption deceleration of 3 points quarter-to-quarter. I still feel very good about the patterns we're seeing. I feel good about the workloads that Satya mentioned and where we feel like we can take some share. 
But at the same time, we really are focused on taking the agreements that we signed in Q4, making sure we're working with the customers on deployment, projects that have quick time to value, investing to make sure they're starting the projects that can save them money, that can help them innovate. And I think that's probably our larger focus rather than just the pure consumption number.",225

What are you seeing there in terms of your willingness to -- of customers to kind of use this time to kind of consolidate further?",83

Maybe I'll just start and Amy, you can add. I mean the 2 numbers that our usage -- user growth numbers, right, the 14% growth in the number of seats of Microsoft 365 and then the E5 growth of 60%, I think, speak to, again, that best-to-suite value in the core and in E5. So we're very, very competitive on both of those. And that's what you're seeing in that seat growth.",73

As you can see, I do think we've been building momentum really with E5. There's so much value and we've added and continue to add value to the E5 suite. And as that value has become more and more competitive, both at the category level and at the suite level, we are very focused on making sure customers get every bit of value in that SKU.
So focus on deployment, increasing usage, moving resources there, some of our investment that we've spent over the past 6 months and looking forward for hiring will be in those areas to make sure we are helping customers get the most out of that SKU. The team and in Q4 and specifically in some of the bookings numbers, E5 was a strong point in terms of both renewals and people adding E5 to their existing contract.",157

Amy, I just wanted to focus in on your comments about capital spending but also just utilization within Azure, and obviously, some of the supply chain issues you mentioned before. What are you -- sort of where utilization stands around Azure?

Maybe let me start by talking about Q4's capital spend. Obviously, the big driver of our growth this quarter was in data center spend, both new and newbuilds as well as adding capacity to existing data centers. We are seeing, obviously, good demand signal. So hence, we've guided to another strong spending quarter in Q1 in terms of capital. Although it's a sequential decline, I would think about that more as being timing. It's always -- can move around a little bit just based on when builds are complete or when shipments come in. We do feel that we've gotten in a good place on capacity on a global basis and are focused on making sure our customers can drive the new units they need, the new usage they need in those data centers. I don't know, Satya, if you wanted to add on anything to that.",149

I mean I think that you captured it right. And it is also right that customers are using more reserved instances. And so that's like essentially a price discount, right?

Kirk Materne,,Analysts,27,"Amy, you noted a couple of times just seeing some weakness in more of the small business segment. Can you just talk about what's going on there? Is that an opportunity for you all to go in and try to sell more bundles and your suite? I guess how much of a drag has that been? And do you see it getting better or worse? So just if you could add a little bit more color on that part of your business, it would be helpful.",86
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2022",2022-07-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3766.0,2604788.0,98242225.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,28,"That's a great question, Kirk. I did allude to it a couple of times when discussing Office EMS or the Azure per-user service as well as Windows commercial. And of course, that is because it's all related to selling Microsoft 365. And we did see, as I noted, some weakness in new deals, particularly in the SMB segment outside of E5. So to your point, think of them as SKUs are really intended, right, for that type of audience and customer base. 
And it came from a couple of things, Kirk, one of which we talked about before is that we are -- that is primarily sold through partner. And so we need to make sure we've got the best value props. We've got to make sure the price is right, offers right and make sure that we are tuning that value prop to what small business customers need today, which is great value, and so we'll keep executing that through partner. We're in the middle of that transition we talked about last quarter, and we're still working on it. 
The second thing is I would also say that is a spot where you tend to see macro weakness show itself, and we alluded to that as well in my comment because while I can't tell you, in particular, which part of that is some of the partner transition work we're doing versus macro, it certainly feels like both. And so that's certainly a spot that we're watching. 
I think your point around making sure we've got the right feed, which is absolutely do more with less and that we can help both modernize and get great value through the suites. But it's an important caveat to that. And you saw the way it shows itself, as you might notice is you saw the seat growth be a little lighter than you would have expected in the quarter. And then in Q1, that shows itself as a little bit of decel in that Office 365 growth number quarter-to-quarter.",339

Specifically, I guess, do you feel as though -- clearly, the guidance, I think, is very -- has a very confident posture. When you think about your visibility into those consumption dynamics, is it that you're seeing customers optimize their spend? Are you seeing them commit to longer duration contracts, and therefore, you kind of [indiscernible] the different linearity of that consumption pace? And then if you think about it on a global basis, are there any different patterns domestically versus internationally in those moderating project starts or just general optimization conversations?",107

When we talked about it, what we saw in June and through the quarter, and then as we're thinking about Q1 is we have seen that deceleration in consumption apply really across customer segments. And in general, it was across geos. I wouldn't point in particular to any specific geo as showing a very different pattern than any other geo.
And certainly, we've not applied that logic as we look to Q1. I do think it speaks to what Satya and I have said, which is we see customers continuing to optimize, whether that's -- whether it's through reserved instance, whether it's through existing workloads and purchase patterns. And I expect that to continue, which is absolutely what the guide implies. 
And it implies that these Azure commitments that we signed through the course of the year, because it takes time for it to convert those large contracts until actual consumption and new project growth, as that work gets completed both at the customer and with our help, you'll start to see new projects add as the plus to the optimization that occurs. So it doesn't really -- I would not point to it as being different that we have certainly seen to this point. It's just a consistent deceleration that we've talked about.",222

On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Alice Jolla, Chief Accounting Officer; and Keith Dolliver, Deputy General Counsel. On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.
On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's first quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results.
All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only.
We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release; in the comments made during this conference call; and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

To start, I want to outline the principles that are guiding us through these changing economic times. First, we will invest behind categories that will drive the long-term secular trend where digital technology as a percentage of world's GDP will continue to increase. Second, we'll prioritize helping our customers get the most value out of their digital spend so that they can do more with less. And finally, we will be disciplined in managing our cost structure.
With that context, this quarter, the Microsoft Cloud again exceeded $25 billion in quarterly revenue, up 24% and 31% in constant currency. And based on current trends continuing, we expect our broader commercial business to grow at around 20% in constant currency this fiscal year as we manage through the cyclical trends affecting our consumer business.
With that, let me highlight our progress starting with Azure. Moving to the cloud is the best way for organizations to do more with less today. It helps them align their spend with demand and mitigate risk around increasing energy costs and supply chain constraints. We're also seeing more customers turn to us to build and innovate with infrastructure they already have. With Azure Arc, organizations like Wells Fargo can run Azure services, including containerized applications across on-premises, edge and multi-cloud environments. We now have more than 8,500 Arc customers, more than double the number a year ago. We are the platform of choice for customers' SAP workloads in the cloud, companies like Chobani, Munich Re, Sodexo, Volvo Cars all run SAP on Azure.
We are the only cloud provider with direct and secure access to Oracle databases running in Oracle Cloud infrastructure, making it possible for companies like FedEx, GE and Marriott to use capabilities from both companies. And with Azure Confidential Computing, we're enabling companies in highly regulated industries, including RBC, to bring their most sensitive applications to the cloud. Just last week, UBS said it will move more than 50% of its applications to Azure.  
Now to data and AI. With our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform, we provide a complete data fabric, helping customers cut integration tax associated with bringing together siloed solutions. Customers like Mercedes-Benz are standardizing on our data stack to process and govern massive amounts of data. Cosmos DB is the go-to database powering the world's most demanding workloads at limitless scale. Cosmos DB now supports PostgreSQL, making Azure the first cloud provider to offer a database service that supports both relational and NoSQL workloads.
And in AI, we are turning the world's most advanced models into platforms for customers. Earlier this month, we brought the power of DALL-E to Azure OpenAI Service, helping customers like Mattel apply the breakthrough image generation model to commercial use cases for the first time.  
And Azure Machine Learning provides industry-leading MLOps, helping organizations like 3M deploy, manage and govern models. All up, Azure ML revenue has increased more than 100% for 4 quarters in a row.  
Now on to developers. We have the most complete platform for developers to build cloud-native applications. Four years since our acquisition, GitHub is now at $1 billion in annual recurring revenue, and GitHub's developer-first ethos has never been stronger. More than 90 million people now use the service to build software for any cloud on any platform, up 3x.
GitHub Advanced Security is helping organizations improve their security posture by bringing features directly into the developer's workflow. Toyota North America chose the offering this quarter to help its developers build and secure many of its most critical applications.
Now on to Power Platform. We are helping customers save time and money with our end-to-end suite spanning low-code, no-code tools, robotic process automation, virtual agents and business intelligence. Power BI is the market leader in business intelligence in the cloud and is growing faster than competition, as companies like Walmart standardize on the tool for reporting and analytics.
Power Apps is the market leader in low-code, no-code tools and has nearly 15 million monthly active users, up more than 50% compared to a year ago. Power Automate has more than 7 million monthly active users and is being used by companies like Brown-Forman, Komatsu, Maersk, T-Mobile to digitize manual business processes and save thousands of hours of employee time. And we're going further with new AI-powered capabilities in Power Automate that turn natural language into advanced workflows.
Now on to Dynamics 365. From customer experience and service to finance and supply chain, we continue to take share across all categories we serve. For example, Lufthansa Cargo chose us to centralize customer information and related shipments. CBRE is optimizing its field service operations, gaining cost efficiencies. Darden is using our solutions to increase both guest frequency and spend at its restaurants. And Tillamook is scaling its growth and improving supply chain visibility. All up, more than 400,000 organizations now use our business applications.
Now on to Industry Solutions. We are seeing increased adoption of our industry and cross-industry clouds. Bank of Queensland chose our Cloud for Financial Services to deliver new digital experiences for its customers. Our Cloud for Sustainability is off to a fast start as organizations like Telstra use the solution to track their environmental footprint. New updates provide insights on hard-to-measure Scope 3 carbon emissions, and we are seeing record growth in health care driven in part by our Nuance DAX ambient intelligence solutions, which automatically documents patient encounters at the point of care. Physicians tell us DAX dramatically improves their productivity, and it's quickly becoming an on-ramp to our broader health care offerings.
Now on to new systems of work, Microsoft 365, Teams and Viva uniquely enable employees to thrive in today's digitally connected distributed world of work. Microsoft 365 is the cloud-first platform that supports all the ways people work and every type of worker reducing cost and complexity for IT. The new Microsoft 365 app brings together our productivity apps with third-party content as well as personalized recommendations.  
Microsoft Teams is the de facto standard for collaboration and has become essential to how hundreds of millions of people meet, call, chat, collaborate and do business. As we emerge from the pandemic, we are retaining users we have gained and are seeing increased engagement, too. Users interact with Teams 1,500 times per month on average. In a typical day, the average commercial user spends more time in Teams chat than they do in e-mail, and the number of users who use 4 or more features within Teams increased over 20% year-over-year.
Teams is becoming a ubiquitous platform for business process. Monthly active enterprise users running third-party and custom applications within Teams increased nearly 60% year-over-year, and over 55% of our enterprise customers who use Teams today also buy Teams Rooms or Teams Phone.  
Teams Phone provides the best-in-class calling. PSTN users have grown by double digits for 5 quarters in a row. We are bringing Teams Rooms to a growing hardware ecosystem, including Cisco's devices and peripherals, which will now run Teams natively. And we are creating a new category with Microsoft Places to help organizations evolve and manage the space for hybrid and in-person work. Just like Outlook calendar orchestrates when people can meet and collaborate, Places will do the same for where.
We also announced Teams Premium, addressing enterprise demands for advanced meeting features like additional security options and intelligent meeting recaps. All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365. Leaders in every industry from Fannie Mae and Land O'Lakes to Rabobank continue to turn to our premium E5 offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice and analytics.
We've also built a completely new suite for our employee experience platform, Microsoft Viva, which now has more than 20 million monthly active users at companies like [ Finastra ], SES and Unilever. And we are extending Viva to meet role-specific needs. Viva sales is helping salespeople at companies like Adobe, Crayon and PwC reclaim their time by bringing customer interactions across Teams and Outlook directly into their CRM system.  
Now on to Windows. Despite the drop in PC shipments during the quarter, Windows continues to see usage growth. All up, there are nearly 20% more monthly active Windows devices than prepandemic; and on average, Windows 10 and Windows 11 users are spending 8.5% more time on their PCs than they were 2.5 years ago. And we are seeing larger commercial deployments of Windows 11. Accenture, for example, has deployed Windows 11 to more than 450,000 employees' PCs, up from just 25,000 7 months ago; and L'Oreal has deployed the operating system to 85,000 employees.
Now to security. Security continues to be a top priority for every organization. We're the only company with integrated end-to-end tools spanning security, compliance, identity and device management and privacy across all clouds and platforms. More than 860,000 organizations across every industry from BP and Fujifilm to ING Bank, iHeartMedia and Lumen Technologies now use our security solutions, up 33% year-over-year. They can save up to 60% when they consolidate our security stack, and the number of customers with more than 4 workloads have increased 50% year-over-year.
More organizations are choosing both our XDR and cloud-native SIEM to secure their entire digital estate. The number of E5 customers who also purchased Sentinel increased 44% year-over-year. And as threats become more sophisticated, we are innovating to protect customers. New capabilities in Defender help secure the entire DevOps life cycle and manage security posture across clouds. And Entra now provides comprehensive identity governance for both on-premise and cloud-based user directories.
Now on to LinkedIn. We once again saw record engagement among our more than 875 million members, with international growth increasing at nearly 2x the pace as in the United States. There are now more than 150 million subscriptions to newsletters on LinkedIn, up 4x year-over-year. New integrations between Viva and LinkedIn Learning helped companies invest in their existing employees by providing access to courses directly in the flow of work. Members added 365 million skills to their profiles over the last 12 months, up 43% year-over-year.
And with our acquisition of EduBrite, they will also soon be able to earn professional certificates from trusted partners directly on the platform. We launched the next-generation Sales Navigator this quarter, helping sellers increase win rates and deal sizes by better understanding and evaluating customer interest. Finally, LinkedIn Marketing Solution continues to provide leading innovation and ROI in B2B digital advertising. 
More broadly, with Microsoft Advertising, we offer a trusted platform for any marketeer or advertiser looking to innovate. We've expanded our geographies we serve by nearly 4x over the past year. We are seeing record daily usage of Edge, Start and Bing driven by Windows. Edge is the fastest-growing browser on Windows and continues to gain share as people use built-in coupon price comparison features to save money. We surfaced more than $2 billion in savings to date. And this quarter, we brought our shopping tools to 15 new markets. Users of our Start personalized content feed are consuming 2x more content compared to a year ago. And we're also expanding our third-party ad inventory. Netflix will launch its first ad-supported subscription plan next month, exclusively powered by our technology and sales. 
And with PromoteIQ, we offer an omni-channel media platform for retailers like the Otto Group looking to generate additional revenue while maintaining ownership of their own data and customer relationships.
Now on to gaming. We are adding new gamers to our ecosystem as we execute on our ambition to reach players wherever and whenever they want on any device. We saw usage growth across all platforms driven by the strength of console. PC Game Pass subscriptions increased 159% year-over-year; and with cloud gaming, we're transforming how games are distributed, played and viewed. More than 20 million people have used the service to stream games to date, and we are adding support for new devices like handhelds from Logitech and Razer as well as Meta Quest. And as we look towards the holidays, we offer the best value in gaming with Game Pass and Xbox Series S. Nearly half of the Series S buyers are new to our ecosystem.
In closing, in a world facing increasing headwinds, digital technology is the ultimate tailwind. And we're innovating across the entire tech stack to help every organization while also focusing intensely on our operational excellence and execution discipline.
With that, I'll hand it over to Amy.",2074
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2022",2022-10-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3673.0,2662840.0,100180487.0,Presenter Speech,Amy Hood,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter revenue was $50.1 billion, up 11% and 16% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.35 and increased 4% and 11% in constant currency when adjusted for the net tax benefit for the first quarter of fiscal year '22.
Driven by strong execution in a dynamic environment, we delivered a solid start to our fiscal year, in line with our expectations even as we saw many of the macro trends from the end of the fourth quarter continue to weaken through Q1. In our consumer business, PC market demand further deteriorated in September, which impacted our Windows OEM and Surface businesses. And reductions in customer advertising spend, which also weakened later in the quarter, impacted search and news advertising and LinkedIn Marketing Solutions.
As you heard from Satya, in our commercial business, we saw strong overall demand for our Microsoft Cloud offerings with growth of 31% in constant currency as well as share gains across many businesses. Commercial bookings declined 3% and increased 16% in constant currency on a flat expiry base. Excluding the FX impact, growth was driven by strong renewal execution, and we continued to see growth in the number of large long-term Azure and Microsoft 365 contracts across all deal sizes. More than half of the $10 million plus Microsoft 365 bookings came from E5.
Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 31% and 34% in constant currency to $180 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 23% year-over-year. The remaining portion, which we recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 38% year-over-year, and our annuity mix increased 1 point year-over-year to 96%.
FX impacted company results in line with expectations. With the stronger U.S. dollar, FX decreased total company revenue by 5 points and, at the segment level, FX decreased Productivity and Business Processes, and Intelligent Cloud revenue growth by 6 points and more personal computing revenue growth by 3 points. Additionally, FX decreased COGS and operating expense growth by 3 points.
Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 73%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft cloud gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point driven by sales mix shift to Azure and lower Azure margin, primarily due to higher energy cost. Company gross margin dollars increased 9% and 16% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 69%. Excluding the impact of the latest change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased roughly 3 points, driven by sales mix shift to cloud, the lower Azure margin noted earlier and Nuance.
Operating expense increased 15% and 18% in constant currency, driven by investments in cloud engineering, LinkedIn, Nuance and commercial sales. At a total company level, headcount grew 22% year-over-year as we continued to invest in key areas just mentioned as well as customer deployment. Headcount growth included roughly 6 points from the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions, which closed last Q3 and Q4, respectively.
Operating income increased 6% and 15% in constant currency, and operating margins decreased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 43%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins declined roughly 4 points year-over-year driven by sales mix shift to cloud, unfavorable FX impact, Nuance and the lower Azure margin noted earlier.
Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $16.5 billion and grew 9% and 15% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, with better-than-expected results in Office Commercial and LinkedIn. Office Commercial revenue grew 7% and 13% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue increased 11% and 17% in constant currency, slightly better than expected with the strong renewal execution noted earlier.
Growth was driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments as well as higher ARPU from E5. Demand for security, compliance and voice value in Microsoft 365 drove strong E5 momentum again this quarter. Paid Office 365 Commercial seats grew 14% year-over-year, driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although we saw a continued impact of new deal moderation outside of E5. Office Consumer revenue grew 7% and 11% in constant currency, driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions which grew 13% to $61.3 million.
Dynamics revenue grew 15% and 22% in constant currency driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 24% and 32% in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue increased 17% and 21% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected growth in Talent Solutions, partially offset by weakness in marketing solutions from the advertising trends noted earlier.
Segment gross margin dollars increased 11% and 18% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the latest change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly, driven by sales mix shift to cloud offerings. Operating expense increased 13% and 16% in constant currency, and operating income increased 10% and 19% in constant currency, including 4 points due to the latest change in accounting estimate.
Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $20.3 billion, increasing 20% and 26% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 22% and 28% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 35% and 42% in constant currency, about 1 point lower than expected, driven by the continued moderation in Azure consumption growth as we help customers optimize current workloads while they prioritize new workloads.
In our per user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 18% to over 232 million seats, with continued impact from the new deal moderation noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue was flat and increased 4% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations, driven by hybrid demand, including better-than-expected annuity purchasing ahead of the SQL Server 2022 launch. Enterprise Services revenue grew 5% and 10% in constant currency, driven by Enterprise Support Services.
Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 26% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly. Excluding the impact of the latest change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage declined roughly 3 points, driven by sales mix shift to Azure and higher energy costs impacting Azure margins. Operating expenses increased 25% and 28% in constant currency, including roughly 8 points of impact from Nuance. And operating income grew 17% and 25% in constant currency with roughly 9 points of favorable impact from the latest change in accounting estimate.
Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue decreased slightly year-over-year to $13.3 billion and grew 3% in constant currency, in line with expectations overall but with OEM and Surface weakness offset by upside in gaming consoles. Windows OEM revenue decreased 15% year-over-year. Excluding the impact from the Windows 11 deferral last year, revenue declined 20%, driven by PC market demand deterioration noted earlier. Devices revenue grew 2% and 8% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by the impact of a large HoloLens deal, partially offset by low double-digit declines in consumer Surface sales.
Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 8% and 15% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by demand for Microsoft 365 E5 noted earlier. Search and news advertising revenue, ex TAC, increased 16% and 21% in constant currency, in line with expectations, benefiting from an increase in search volumes and roughly 5 points of impact from Xandr even as we saw increased ad market headwinds during September. Edge browser gained share again this quarter.
And in gaming, revenue grew slightly and was up 4% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected console sales. Xbox hardware revenue grew 13% and 19% in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue declined 3% and increased 1% in constant currency, driven by declines in first-party content as well as in third-party content where we had lower engagement hours and higher monetization, partially offset by growth in Xbox Game Pass subscriptions.
Segment gross margin dollars declined 9% and 4% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 5 points year-over-year driven by sales mix shift to lower-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 2% and 5% in constant currency, driven by the Xandr acquisition. And operating income decreased 15% and 9% in constant currency.
Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $6.6 billion; and cash paid for PP&E was $6.3 billion. Our data center investments continue to be based on strong customer demand and usage signals. Cash flow from operations was $23.2 billion, down 5% year-over-year, driven by strong cloud billings and collections, which were more than offset by a tax payment related to the transfer of intangible property completed in Q1 of FY '22.
Free cash flow was $16.9 billion, down 10% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of this tax payment, cash flow from operations grew 2%, and free cash flow was relatively unchanged year-over-year. This quarter, other income and expense was $54 million, driven by interest income, which was mostly offset by interest expense and net losses on foreign currency remeasurement. Our effective tax rate was approximately 19%. And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Now moving to our Q2 outlook, which, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. My commentary, for both the full year and next quarter, does not include any impact from Activision, which we still expect to close by the end of the fiscal year. 
First, FX. With the stronger U.S. dollar and based on current rates, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately 5 points and to decrease total COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 3 points. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly 7 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes, 6 points in Intelligent Cloud, and 3 points in More Personal Computing.
Our outlook has many of the trends we saw at the end of Q1 continue into Q2. In our consumer business, materially weaker PC demand from September will continue and impact both Windows OEM and Surface device results even as the Windows installed base and usage grows, as you heard from Satya. Additionally, customers focusing their advertising spend will impact LinkedIn and search and news advertising revenue.
In our commercial business, demand for our differentiated hybrid and cloud offerings, together with consistent execution, should drive healthy growth across the Microsoft Cloud. In commercial bookings, continued strong execution across core annuity sales motions and commitments to our platform should drive solid growth on a moderately growing expiry base against a strong prior year comparable, which included a significant volume of large long-term Azure contracts. As a reminder, the growing mix of larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, always drives increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate.
Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be up roughly 1 point year-over-year, driven by the latest accounting estimate change noted earlier. Excluding that impact, Q2 gross margin percentage will decrease roughly 2 points driven by lower Azure margin, primarily due to higher energy cost, revenue mix shift to Azure and the impact from Nuance. In capital expenditures, we expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis with normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out.
Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 11% and 13% in constant currency or USD 16.6 billion to USD 16.9 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365, with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth from E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be similar to last quarter on a constant currency basis. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-30s.
In Office Consumer, we expect revenue to decline low to mid-single digits as Microsoft 365 subscription growth will be more than offset by unfavorable FX impact. For LinkedIn, we expect continued strong engagement on the platform, although results will be impacted by a slowdown in advertising spend and hiring, resulting in mid- to high single-digit revenue growth or low to mid-teens growth in constant currency. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the low double digits or the low 20s in constant currency driven by continued share gains in Dynamics 365.
For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 22% and 24% in constant currency or USD 21.25 billion to USD 21.55 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period recognition depending on the mix of contracts. We expect Azure revenue growth to be sequentially lower by roughly 5 points on a constant currency basis. Azure revenue will continue to be driven by strong growth in consumption with some impact from the Q1 trends noted earlier. And our per user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect moderation in growth rate given the size of the installed base. 
In our on-premise server business, we expect revenue to decline low single digits as demand for our hybrid solutions, including strong annuity purchasing from the SQL Server 2022 launch, will be more than offset by unfavorable FX impact. And in Enterprise Services, we expect revenue growth to be in the low single digits, driven by enterprise support. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of USD 14.5 billion to USD 14.9 billion. 
In Windows OEM, we expect revenue to decline in the high 30s. Excluding the impact from the Windows 11 revenue deferral last year, revenue would decline mid-30s, reflecting both PC market demand and a strong prior year comparable, particularly in the commercial segment. In devices, revenue should decline approximately 30%, again, roughly in line with the PC market.
In Windows Commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive growth in the mid-single digits or low double digits in constant currency. Search and news advertising, ex TAC, should grow in the low to mid-teens, roughly 6 points faster than overall search and news advertising revenue, driven by growing first-party revenue and the inclusion of Xandr.
And in gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-teens against a strong prior year comparable. That included several first-party title launches, partially offset by growth in Xbox Game Pass subscribers. We expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the low to mid-teens.
Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow between 6% and 7% in constant currency or to be between USD 17.4 billion and USD 17.6 billion, and operating expense to grow between 17% and 18% in constant currency or to be between USD 14.3 billion and USD 14.4 billion.
As we continue to focus our investment in key growth areas, total headcount growth sequentially should be minimal. Other income and expense should be roughly $100 million as interest income is expected to more than offset interest expense. Further FX and equity movements through Q2 are not reflected in this number. And as a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility. And we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And finally, as a reminder for Q2 cash flow, we expect to make a $2.4 billion cash tax payment related to the capitalization of R&D provision enacted in 2017 TCJA and effective as of July 1, 2022.
Now some thoughts on the full fiscal year. First, FX. Based on current rates, we now expect a roughly 5 point headwind to full year revenue growth. And FX should decrease COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 3 points. At the total company level, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth on a constant currency basis. Revenue will be driven by around 20% constant currency growth in our commercial business, driven by strong demand for our Microsoft Cloud offerings. That growth will be partially offset by the increased declines we now see in the PC market.
With the high margins in our Windows OEM business and the cyclical nature of the PC market, we take a long-term approach to investing in our core strategic growth areas and maintain these investment levels regardless of PC market conditions. Therefore, with our first quarter results and lower expected OEM revenue for the remainder of the year as well as over $800 million of greater-than-expected energy cost, we now expect operating margins in U.S. dollars to be down roughly 1 point year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, excluding the incremental impact of the lower Windows OEM revenue and the favorable impact of the latest accounting change, we continue to expect FY '23 operating margins to be roughly flat year-over-year.
In closing, in this environment, it is more critical than ever to continue to invest in our strategic growth markets such as Cloud, Security, Teams, Dynamics 365 and LinkedIn, where we have opportunities to continue to gain share as we provide problem-solving innovations to our customers. And while we continue to help our customers do more with less, we will do the same internally. And you should expect to see our operating expense growth moderate materially through the year, while we focus on growing productivity of the significant headcount investments we've made over the last year.

A question for Amy, and it pains me to ask a question about a percentage point. But I think this is what's on a lot of investors' minds. This is 2 quarters in a row now where Azure constant currency growth came in a little bit below your guidance.
I think what investors are worrying about or sort of wondering about is the -- is there an inherent volatility in that business that's just harder to forecast. And on a go-forward basis, how should we think about that forecast? Have you applied more conservatism in it? And how should we think about Azure growth, like the glide path for the whole year? If you could address those, I think it would put a lot of investor minds at ease.",139

And I do appreciate you asking about that 1 point because I do know it is a point of focus every quarter. And what I would say is there is some inherent volatility to that number. A point here or there, you've heard me say it when we've been a point better, and you've heard me say it when we've been a point worse. And I want to focus mostly on what and how we see the number, which is that it is still a very large growth rate with growth across all segments and with growth across all geos. That was, to the question, generally in line with where we expected.
And what we did see through the quarter is a real focus, both by customers but also by our sales and customer success teams on going proactively to customers and making sure we are helping them optimize their workloads. And as we went through the quarter and as, of course, the macroeconomic environment got more complicated, we continued to focus on that because, ultimately, those optimizations bring value even as budgets are still growing and budgeted spend is still growing.
And so it's this nuance of you're still seeing digitization. This is still the tailwind that helps customers solve problems. This is still the way to build growth and leverage in your business, and yet you still want to optimize your workloads. You still want to run them the most efficiently so that you can then make room for new workload growth.
We saw that across all segments. If there was one segment where I may have seen it a bit more, I would say, in the small or mid-sized segment of the market, that tends to be more through partner. We rely on partners to help customers do those same optimizations and prepare workloads. But it is that 1 point, I know, that people are focused on. But if you step back and say this is how you drive ultimate share gains and build customer loyalty and help customers grow, I think that needs to be the focus of our teams inside the company and also the partners that we rely on to help customers do that as well.
And so as I look forward, there is some inherent volatility to this number. And here, I think you will hear us talk about continuing to invest to make that happen, whether it's in customer success, whether it's in optimizations, whether it's frankly in engineering to help people be able to even have better solutions to optimize against. I do think that will remain top of mind for us even as this remains probably the most exciting opportunity in TAM across infra, data and AI that exist in technology. I don't know, Satya, if you...",469

I mean I think that's the only thing I would add, Amy, to your point, is that obviously our investment profile here is that this is the largest TAM where we, on a large number, have good growth rates with the kind of volatility you're seeing. So we're going to stay focused on it. And in this particular period, I think we are going to optimize for long-term customer loyalty by proactively helping them optimize their spend, which I think is the right thing for us to be doing as a company for -- on behalf of our shareholders long term.",102

So next quarter, you're guiding to sequential further slowing in the business. Is that the factor of optimization? Is it something else that's going on in here? How should we think about that specific component of the guidance given the fact that you've got good bookings, strong RPO growth, et cetera?",64

I'll -- you're right. Let me go ahead and reiterate part of that, which is that this quarter, as you saw, we did have very good bookings growth. And within the RPO number that you're referring to, we had what we would call long-dated growth, which means we're having and seeing customers continue to sign commitments to the platform, and that goes really to what Satya mentioned, is that the plans to invest here remain intact. And so it's about both the optimization that you're talking about and we are seeing, and the guide includes that, and it also includes new workloads starting. And those also may not be matched up one to one to see sort of a consistent pattern, and that does result in some volatility.
The other piece of it, Mark, that we didn't talk on before because I was really focused on consumption is that there is per user headwinds as well, right, because we're getting and seeing some of these laws of large numbers in terms of the per seat business. So there's a couple of things going on here, Mark, as you said, a very large base. So it's not just the optimization to new workloads. It's also some per user work as well.",212

It sounds like that continued. I think many are questioning if did that get worse this quarter. And did you see it filter now into the enterprise? Can you talk about what you're seeing higher up above SMB?",50
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2022",2022-10-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3673.0,2662840.0,100180498.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,14,"Thanks, Brent. Maybe this is a chance to talk a little bit about Microsoft 365. I think that's a place where we can talk specifically about the SMB market because we did see continued impact there in Q1, although it was not different than what we saw, frankly, in Q4.
In Microsoft 365, what you saw was very good renewal execution; and it speaks to, I think, the value people are seeing in Microsoft 365. We had on-time renewals that were frankly better in Q1 based on expirations than we've seen a year ago. So deals are both getting done and I think getting done on time.
They're getting done within a discount range that we feel good about that's consistent. And we saw good upsell to E5. So if you think about that as sort of forming the basis of what are we seeing above SMB, that's a good summary.
Where we, in fact, saw -- I think we've talked about it, new deal moderation. I've referred to that, frankly, in Q4 as well. It tended to be in, to your point, the smaller end of the market, small to mid-sized companies. And it also tended to be through partner, which we had talked about before, Brent, a little bit, and I referred to. And it tended to be around selling what is, in fact, some new value that we've put into E3.
So this is a place where there is some macro impact, but there's also, I think, a better job we can do in our E3 SKU, which is really a core value proposition. We added a lot of value to that SKU in Q4 in terms of security and auto patching for Windows. It's a great value in the same way E5 is. We landed E5 really well. We've got some work to do on landing E3. So there is some macro, seems pretty consistent, frankly, more than inconsistent with what we saw. And there is some execution that, I think, frankly, we can get better at as well.",343

Thinking of GitHub Copilot and the image generation and your Designer product, what is it that's enabling you to innovate so rapidly and essentially to be first to market? I'm wondering if it's the OpenAI relationship or maybe some of your inferencing capabilities or something else.
And then as a quick follow-up, Amy, you did mention the lower margins in Azure due to the higher energy costs. Are you inferring that we can kind of dimensionalize that incremental impact at something like $200 million per quarter? And then is there anything you can do to try to manage that through this period?",115

First, yes, the OpenAI partnership is a very critical partnership for us. Perhaps it's sort of important to call out that we built the supercomputing capability inside of Azure, which is highly differentiated. The way compute and the network, in particular, come together in order to support these large-scale training of these platform models or foundation models has been very critical. That's what's driven, in fact, the progress OpenAI has been making.
And of course, we then productized it as part of Azure OpenAI services. And that's what you're seeing both being used by our own first-party applications, whether it's the GitHub Copilot or Designer, even inside MATCH. And then, of course, the third parties like Mattel. And so we're very excited about that. We have a lot sort of more sort of talk about when it comes to GitHub universe. I think you'll see more advances on the GitHub Copilot, which is off to a fantastic start.
But overall, this is an area of huge investment. The AI moment clearly has arrived. And it's going to be part of every product, whether it's -- in fact, you mentioned our Power Platform because that's another area where we are innovating in terms of corporate qualities, AI models. So yes, so I think AI is a place where I think we have differentiated capability and the infrastructure layer for training and inference and the model that sells our platforms for third parties and our first-party applications are getting better because of the use of those AI models.",260

We did not see as big of that. As I said, it's over $800 million for the year. Some of that was in Q1, but the majority of it will be in Q2 through 4. And I think if you want to think about it, it's somewhere 250-ish a quarter. It's not exact, but that would be a decent assumption for the remainder of the year.",84

Great. Amy, I'd love to just ask you around margins. Clearly, you're experiencing a little bit more sales mix given the weakness on the Windows side. It looks like you've elected not to throttle back OpEx to enable you to meet the 3 months ago guidance for flat margins, so they'll now drift a little bit lower. Do you mind talking through that decisions? Why not throttle back OpEx as a counter to that Windows pressure?",77

And I shared a little bit on the call, but let me share a little more because I think it's important in terms of how we think about investment and continuing to invest where we're seeing substantial opportunity and growth. The PC market is cyclical. And we had some great benefits for a couple of years during the pandemic, and we chose not to spend against that favorability over the past couple of years. And it fell to the bottom line, and you saw substantially increased margins over that time period.
And we did that potentially because it is a cyclical market. And so in the same way I see it now is that PCs are going to be a tough headwind for us for the year. But overall, the Windows [ backed ] installed base, our ability to grow usage, it's still higher than it was. And that's a good opportunity for us.
And so in the same way that we let it fall to the bottom line when we saw a surge, it's important to stay consistent in this down market because when you have type of opportunity that we have specifically in the commercial business and the TAMs that Satya talked about as being some of our most exciting and you have the opportunity with your customers to gain share, to gain confidence, right, and I think it's important to have a steady hand.
Now let me also say it is not as though we are not responding to the macro environment around cost. As I commented, our sequential headcount growth from Q1 to Q2 will be minimal. It'll be about investing where we said we would invest, which is in focused areas. It's about moving headcount to make sure inside the company we've got it on the highest and most important things. We've added a lot of headcount over the past 12 months, and we want to make sure we use those headcount in the most productive way possible, and we're going to do that.
And also, we're going to, frankly, lap some investments that we've made at the end of H2, Karl. We closed Nuance at the end of Q3. We closed Xandr in Q4. When we come and lap those, you will see a material decline in OpEx investment. You will also see us start to lap some of the headcount surges that we made last year in key areas. And by then, I feel good that we'll see productivity improvements from the headcount [ have ] and our focus. And so it's an ability to say, absolutely, I want to stay consistent, and we'll respond to the macro. It's possible to do both those things, and I think that's what we're doing.",461

A lot of the growth here is driven by subscriber growth, this quarter, for example, 17% constant currency, subscriber growth of 14%. Could you remind us where the incremental subscriber's coming from? Could we see that mix of growth shift away from subscribers towards ASP potentially over time?
I think you're already over 300 million subscribers. So just any color on just the runway from here? Where is the incremental seat coming from? And with all the works that you're doing with E3, E5 and collaboration security analytics, might we see more of the growth coming from ASP versus subscriber growth over time?",112
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2022",2022-10-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3673.0,2662840.0,100180508.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,24,"Thanks, Brad. It's a good question because you've continued to see the seat growth, I think, for actually much longer than many of the investors had expected. And it really should continue in some ways because we're focusing on frontline worker scenarios. We're continuing to focus on small and mid-sized business growth, and we're adding new things to which you can grow, whether that's Viva, whether it's Teams. There's new things that enable us to add relevancy, frankly, and then to add value and then to add seats.
And so I don't want to say it has to be, again, this vision of or. So I think you'll continue to see lower-end seat growth, which is what we've been seeing, and you will see us continue to focus on the value of E5 and the E3 SKU, where we've added some value, making sure we can still move people to that suite as well. And so you will see, right, over time, long term, the seat growth move a little bit, and then you'll see ASPs show up. And it depends a little bit on mix, frankly, each quarter. You saw a little more ARPU in Q4. You saw a little less in Q1. That had to do with some E3 execution in Q1. But I actually think there's room to do both those things, and I felt that way now for a couple of years.",236

Do you see these as largely offsetting factors? Or are you expecting the former variable to be a lot more prominent than the latter?",89

I mean the way we see it is, overall, macro will mean that everybody is going to optimize their build. In fact, as Amy said, our job #1 for large swaths of our sort of even customer-facing organizations is to proactively help them optimize. In fact, our incentives in our customer success teams are lined up with them helping customers ""do more with less."" So that's sort of one side. 
The thing, though, from a customer perspective, the best way for them to align their spend with what is uncertain demand is to move to the cloud. So we see the value prop of the cloud. So the big winner in all of this will be public cloud because public cloud helps businesses offset the risk of taking demand risk.
The other side, as you described today, is the risk around supply chain or energy costs. And so that's another one. The best way to hedge against an energy cost and be, in fact, more energy efficient is to move to the cloud. So that's where I think a little bit of -- as you all think about what happens to cloud, for us, we look at this and say, this is a period where cloud [indiscernible] going to gain share because we're still in the early innings of adoption. And so we just want to invest going into it with that mindset and build long-term customer loyalty.",239

I wanted to pivot to advertising. This was a segment that crossed over $10 billion, I think, earlier this year; Netflix rolling out ad-supported model next year powered by Microsoft.

[Audio Gap] 
yes, our core advertising business has got 2 elements to it. One is, I'll call it, LinkedIn B2B advertising where we clearly have a leadership position around both reach, quality of ROI and will -- of course, it will be cyclically impacted, but we feel that the LinkedIn engagement continues to grow. And as that market comes back, our premium position of LinkedIn owned and operated, I feel, well -- very well positioned. We'll continue to invest in that space.
The second one is the place where we are, again, very, very focused on, first, starting with our own owned and operated. So when we talk about the overall active devices on Windows have grown by 20% over the pandemic, one of the big opportunities it opens up is for us to take our own owned and operated inventory, right, whether it is Bing and search, whether it's the feed. And those are things that you see some of the growth. We are share takers in the browser. We are share takers in terms of engagement of the feed. And those are things that we are high leverage on top of the installed base that's now structurally changed in terms of growth. 
And then the third party with Netflix, we're really excited about that, and we're going to look to grow our -- and first make Netflix a successful partner, but we're going to continue to grow our third-party business on the ad platform. So those would be the 3 areas: LinkedIn, our owned and operated advertising, both search and feed as well as third-party ad network.",276
