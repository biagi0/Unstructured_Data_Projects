Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today. As I look back on the quarter, I am pleased with the results as we exceeded our expected revenue growth while continuing to maintain our focus on improved execution and cost management. 
Our Devices and Consumer segment had a very good quarter and grew 13% with the successful holiday. Our Commercial segment had another great quarter and grew 10% to over $12 billion as we continue to deliver on our differentiated cloud strategy. We performed well this quarter and you see it in our financial results. 
This holiday we continued to make significant progress in the consumer space, headlined by Xbox One, which launched in 13 markets and sold in 3.9 million units in just over 5 weeks. According to NPD group figures, Xbox One was the leading console in the U.S. for the month of December, which was its first full month in market. When adding in Xbox 360, which held the third spot, Xbox led the U.S. market with 46% share in December. We are excited for this enthusiastic response from our loyal customers and are working to increase the availability of Xbox One. 
With Surface, demand continued to grow, benefiting from improved execution at retail and favorable reviews of the new Surface devices. Sequentially, both units and revenue more than doubled this quarter, with customers recognizing Surface's differentiated value proposition as one device for everything in their life. We feel good about the progress we have made over the past couple of quarters and are enthusiastic about the overall opportunity ahead with Surface. 
The Windows ecosystem as a whole is also making important progress. Earlier this fall we launched Windows 8.1 which enabled smarter, faster and more personalized devices, and our OEM partners are taking advantage of this. Over the last few months, they've delivered a breadth of differentiated devices designed to meet a wide range of customer needs. We're encouraged by what we've been able to accomplish with our partners, and collectively, we will continue to focus on driving the Windows ecosystem forward. 
Now let me share some perspective on what we saw in the PC market, which was slightly better than our expectation. Business PCs grew again for the third consecutive quarter and benefited from an improving macro environment, better availability of innovative new hardware and a refresh cycle ahead of Windows XP end of support. 
Additionally, growth was higher in large enterprises than small- and medium-sized businesses. Consumer PCs, while better than our expectations, continued to be soft as they faced challenges from competing form factors. And as a general theme, developed markets outperformed emerging markets. 
Windows continued to be the platform of choice for business. This quarter, Windows Pro revenue grew 12% and outpaced the underlying business PC market. This was driven by faster growth in both enterprises and developed markets where Pro attach is higher. Windows non-Pro revenue, however, was down 20%, reflecting the dynamics of the consumer PC market. 
Now let's move to our Commercial business where key metrics remain strong. Bookings grew 12% and renewal rates remained in line across our product portfolio, even with the large, expiring base in the quarter. Unearned revenue grew 12%, and our contracted not-billed balance is at a record level of over $23 billion. To me, this is important as these long-term commitments demonstrate the confidence that customers have in our product roadmap, where we are investing in key areas such as Big Data, infrastructure management and cloud computing. 
In Big Data, our upcoming release of SQL Server 2014, builds on the momentum we've established. Offering a complete business intelligence solution for Big Data, SQL Server is driving significant in-memory performance gains. Additionally, it enables hybrid cloud solutions with cloud backup and disaster recovery, as well as providing enhanced availability and security. 
Hybrid infrastructure and management offerings also continue to be important priorities. Windows Server, Azure and System Center are the centerpieces of our hybrid cloud strategy, and together, they enable portability and scalability of workloads. Using our suite of products, customers get high-scale virtualization, built-in software-defined networking and hybrid business continuity that enable their modern data centers. 
As CIOs look to cloud computing to reduce costs and deliver business agility, they are turning to our cloud services. Office 365 and Dynamics CRM Online offer customers the ability to transition easily to the cloud and benefit from enterprise-class features and a familiar user interface. Additionally, Windows Azure provides the scalability and flexibility that addresses their evolving infrastructure and platform needs. 
In summary, we had a very good quarter across our Consumer and Commercial business. We are taking share with many products and seeing improvements in areas where we needed to be better. As we do this, we continue to prioritize the deployment of our resources to areas that accelerate innovation and deliver products that our customers love. 
With that overview of the quarter, I'll hand it over to Chris to give more details about our performance before I come back and share thoughts on our outlook.",845
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2014",2014-01-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3165.0,571081.0,25970202.0,Presenter Speech,Chris Suh,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Amy. First I'm going to review our overall results, and then I'll move on to the details by reporting segment. 
We had a successful holiday quarter, and our broad, diversified portfolio helped us deliver record revenue in Q2. Total revenue was up 11% to $24.5 billion, and without the impact of foreign exchange, revenue would have been higher by $196 million or 1 percentage point. 
Cost of goods sold increased 46%. This increase was primarily due to costs associated with the new Xbox and Surface products, which launched this quarter, and also growth in cloud infrastructure supporting our consumer and commercial offerings. Even as we invest in our devices and services initiatives, gross margin was flat at $16.2 billion. 
Operating expenses grew 3%, which was below our guidance, as we continue to focus on prioritizing spend towards strategic growth initiatives. Operating income and earnings per share both declined 4% to $8.0 billion and $0.78, respectively. 
This quarter, we returned $4.3 billion of cash to shareholders in buybacks and dividends, our highest amount in the last 12 quarters. 
I'm now going to talk through the performance of each of our reporting segments. In our Devices and Consumer segment, revenue grew 13%. Within this, the licensing segment, which primarily includes Windows OEM, Consumer Office and Windows Phone declined 6%, reflecting the overall PC and device market trends. 
We continue to see similar dynamics to the previous quarter. Total Windows OEM revenue declined 3%. As Amy described, the 12% growth in Windows Pro was offset by 20% declines in Windows non-Pro. Excluding the impact of China, where we continue to draw down inventory levels, Windows non-Pro revenue declined 14%. 
Office attach, including our cloud offerings, was up again this quarter. Traditional Consumer Office licensing revenue declined 24%. However, we estimate that approximately 16 percentage points of this decline was due to the shift to Office 365 Home Premium. Excluding this impact, traditional Consumer Office outperformed the underlying consumer PC market. 
Next, I'll move to our Hardware segment, where revenue grew $1.9 billion or 68%, driven by a good holiday quarter for our consumer devices. Xbox One had a record launch, and together with Xbox 360, we shipped 7.4 million consoles. For Surface, we saw improved sales of Surface RT and also introduced Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2 into the market. 
Moving to the Devices and Consumer Other segment. As a reminder, this segment includes our online marketplaces, advertising, Xbox Studios, Office 365 Home Premium and other consumer products and services. Revenue in this segment declined 10% when compared to last year when we launched Halo 4. 
Search advertising revenue grew 34%, driven by continued revenue per search improvement and query volume growth. Bing has now grown its share of search queries to 18.2% in the U.S. 
Office 365 Home Premium adoption continues to be strong. With this service, customers are always running the most up-to-date version, have content available across their devices with SkyDrive integration and get free Skype minutes. The overall value proposition is resonating well with customers and we now have more than 3.5 million subscribers. For the quarter, it accounted for more than 15% of total Consumer Office licenses sold. 
Turning now to our Commercial segment. All-up commercial revenue and gross margin across both on-premise and cloud services grew 10%. Commercial Licensing segment, which reflects our traditional software licensing, grew 7%, and our Commercial Other segment, which captures our commercial cloud services, as well as our Enterprise Services business, grew 28% to $1.8 billion. As economies of scale benefits accrue to these Online Services, we're seeing gross margin expansion in our Commercial Other segment. 
We saw continuing strength across our Commercial portfolio. Server product revenue grew 12%. In the Data Center, the premium version of Windows Server, which targets Tier 1 application workloads, saw a significant revenue growth again this quarter. Revenue for System Center grew double digits, and Hyper-V, our virtualization product, gained 5 points this year over the last year. 
In our Data Platform business, SQL Server continued to outpace the market and revenue grew double digits, with SQL Server Premium revenue growing over 25%. Our Commercial Office product also remained strong, growing 10%. Within this, our productivity server offering, SharePoint, Exchange and Lync continued to perform well, with Lync growing over 25%. We're excited about the unified communications opportunity as we combine the enterprise richness of Lync and the global reach of Skype to transform the communications experience. 
We're pleased with our momentum in cloud services. This quarter, revenue for commercial cloud services again grew over 100% as customers of all sizes continued to leverage our cloud services to improve productivity, reduce costs and leverage a secure and trusted platform. We are seeing broad-based adoption as Office 365 seats, Azure customers and Dynamics CRM net seat adds all grew over 100%. We now have 70% of the Fortune 500 companies using at least one of our cloud services. 
Having now reviewed our results for this past quarter, let me turn it over to Amy to discuss our forward-looking guidance.",844
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2014",2014-01-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3165.0,571081.0,25970203.0,Presenter Speech,Amy Hood,,Executives,4,"Thanks, Chris. Before I get into our expectations for the quarter, let me quickly touch on Nokia. We continue to expect that the deal will close this quarter but are still in the process of securing all regulatory approvals and meeting closing conditions. So all guidance provided here assumes no impact from Nokia. Assuming the deal closes this quarter, we will include Nokia in our guidance starting in the fourth quarter. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter, we are expecting a similar macro environment to what we saw this quarter. As such, many of the dynamics from the second quarter will likely continue into the third. 
With that, let's get into the outlook, starting with Devices and Consumer. In licensing, we expect revenue to be $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion. This range reflects similar dynamics to what we saw in the second quarter with business PCs growing, strong Pro mix and headwinds in consumer PCs. In Hardware, we expect revenue to be $1.9 billion to $2.0 billion. This reflects continued post-launch momentum with Surface 2, Surface Pro 2 and Xbox One, with the upcoming launch of the Xbox exclusive game, Titanfall. And in Devices and Consumer Other, we expect revenue to be about $1.8 billion. 
Moving on to Commercial. In what is a seasonally slower quarter, we are confident in our ability to continue to be the vendor of choice with our productivity and infrastructure offerings. In Commercial Licensing, we expect revenue to be $10.4 billion to $10.6 billion. In Commercial Other, we expect revenue to be about $1.8 billion, reflecting continued momentum in our commercial cloud business. We expect COGS to be $6.1 billion to $6.3 billion next quarter. This range primarily reflects variability associated with our Hardware business. 
Moving on to operating expenses. We expect OpEx to grow 5% to 6% to $7.7 billion to $7.8 billion. We are also reducing and narrowing the range for our full year guidance to $31.2 billion to $31.5 billion. As a reminder, other income and expense includes dividend and interest income, offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. We expect these items to generally offset one another. We still expect our full year tax rate to be between 18% and 20%. 
We now expect full year capital expenditures to be about $6 billion, which is down about $500 million from our prior guidance. This reduction is primarily driven by improved capacity utilization and scale benefits as we converge our Online Services infrastructure platforms while continuing to support the strong demand that we see in business. Adjusting for prior year tech guarantees and product deferrals, we expect unearned revenue to sequentially decline, as it has in prior years. 
So in summary, I feel good about the financial results this quarter. We are executing well across the company as demonstrated by share gains in our commercial business, but we are also making important inroads with our consumer offerings. Looking ahead, there is a lot to be excited about as we continue our transformation around One Microsoft. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Chris, and we'll take your questions.",519

21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2014",2014-01-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3165.0,571081.0,25970206.0,Question,John DiFucci,,Analysts,7,"Obviously, nice upside in the Hardware business with Surface and Xbox. But my question is on the licensing business and so bear with me a little bit here. You had both licensing businesses, Device and Consumer and Commercial Licensing. They were both better than expected, at least by about $100 million each. At the same time, deferred revenue was shy by, I don't know, something like $250 million. But there's some conflicting things here. I'm just trying to get my head around this. The contracted, not billed, Amy, you pointed out was really strong. It's a big jump by somewhere around $2 billion sequentially. And you also saw some nice traction, the commercial cloud services more than doubled, assuming it's small but -- so here's my question. With all that happening, is there a shift happening with your on-premise corporate business to more transactional versus ratable contracts? That would sort of help out to help offset the financial implications as you shift to sort of cloud services on the corporate side. Is that what's happening with all these movements? Sorry about all the details.",184
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2014",2014-01-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3165.0,571081.0,25970207.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,8,"I really appreciate the question because it's going to let me help expand on a couple of dynamics, which I think are at work here. So now I'm going to ask you to bear with me with a little bit of a long answer. Let me start by your comments, I think, around the overall commercial licensing bucket. What I'm going to expand to include as you did, the overall Commercial business, both cloud and licensing. There are a number of metrics that I tend to look at together as opposed to individually to think about how we did in the quarter. You touched on, one, unearned, which grew 12% this quarter, which is quite good; the second is bookings, which grew 12% in the quarter, which is very good; renewal rates, which were in line across our products; and finally, the CNB balance, the contracted not billed balance, being up sequentially, $2 billion, as you point out, is very big. If you think about those together as a group, those data points are very important because, together, I would say any -- I think you said a couple hundred short on unearned. With those data points together, I would say there's no shortage in terms of Commercial Licensing and Commercial Other strength all up. As you know, contracted but not billed tends to be at the end of a quarter, right? We signed a bunch of contracts that we can't bill for until the very beginning of the next. Think about that as business done in quarter. You'll see that come into the unearned balance, frankly, in Q3, as well as into adjusted. So that dynamic answers, really, the first question and a part of the question you asked. Now that could have -- so that's sort of a separate piece. Then you said, ""Well, some of the dynamic could be explained by some strong transactional business in the quarter."" I would say there's one place, and I would actually separate these things because the first was good and the second was better than we thought. Office non-annuity or transactional did a little better than we thought in quarter as well, and so that's a good point that we didn't bring out. But that is another, sort of, component of the 10% all-up commercial growth. Now -- so I guess my answer is I agree with your transactional comment, but I disagree that it's probably the overall -- it's a component of a ""short fall in unearned"". I would say both are actually quite good.",427

You said that -- and yes, contracts get signed at the end of the quarter. But -- so you're saying that the big jump, primarily, was because they just hadn't been billed yet versus signing. I could see if you were just signing longer-term deals, that you're going to build annually, but that's not what's happening. It's more about just -- is that accurate? Either one could happen.",83

If something was actually billed at the end of the quarter, it goes into unearned. Contracted but not billed is actually that the contract was signed but because the billing won't quite take place until after the end of the fiscal quarter, it ends up in contracted but not billed as opposed to unearned.",57

21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2014",2014-01-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3165.0,571081.0,25970214.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,15,"Mark, that's actually -- here's how I think about the value prop because I can't really say these are sales through retail and through OEM, generally, whether it's a net new user or not. What I can say is that attach overall went up in the Office Consumer business, which I would say is and could be a sign that some of those are net new. And I would hope that to be the case. The value prop of Office 365 Home Premium really does expand the footprint. It allows for multiple users. It has cross-platform capabilities with Office for Mac. It's got mobile capabilities as well and allows for easier trial. So it does sort of lower many of the barriers to experience and try the products. So while I can't point and say there's an exact number that is a new user, I can certainly say with attach going up, that dynamic is helpful.",156

The second quick question on it -- the second quick question is on the Windows side. Any sense whether or not -- we've seen obviously an improvement on the numbers on here.

I covered a little bit in my comments, but it's probably worth spending a little bit more time. Let me start with the business market. I think there really are 3 factors that I would point to particularly in the business environment. And the first one may, Mark, also help on the consumer side. The overall macro spending environment is better. It's a little better than we thought. And in businesses, we're seeing it -- you're seeing it in some of the IT spend forecasts you all put out. They're being raised and I think that has an impact. The second is I think our partners have done a very good job expanding the types and availability of new and interesting hardware. That brings people to the store and I think is encouraging sign. And finally, as you asked, at the end of life of XP. That is -- that has been an impact, and we expect it to continue to be, as we said, in Q3. But I wouldn't point to simply one of the factors as being the reason, but it is a combination of those factors.",190

You kind of touched on it earlier. But you saw a 10% growth this quarter versus 6% last quarter, so you continue to have very healthy growth here. One of the questions I've been getting from some clients is, a, what's driving that; and b, when we get -- as we get, sort of, closer and then actually pass the official end of life of XP, how do you think that's going to affect the growth in Windows licensing sort of beyond that point?",96
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2014",2014-01-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3165.0,571081.0,25970219.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,20,"Thanks, Phil. Let me -- I'm going to take the opportunity to make your question 2 questions. One is to talk about Windows volume licensing overall and, secondly, allow me to talk a little bit about the places that you could see the impact of Windows XP in the current quarter, and I think that will help as you think about Q3 going forward. In volume licensing, you're right, it did grow 10% in Q2. And we do believe we are seeing some of the benefits of that growth is the end of life of Windows XP. But it's also reflective of the value many of our bigger customers are seeing in upgrading to the enterprise version of Windows. The enterprise SKU includes things like DirectAccess, Windows To Go, the corporate image, AppLocker. And those really are differentiating, and they really do matter to many CIOs. So I think specifically on VL, while end of life of XP is one component, it's certainly not the only component. Now if I expand your question to sort of -- and I think, in a way, John asked about it, too -- I mean, Mark asked about it, too, is the end of life of XP. One place that we've talked about it was Windows and how does it play in to the business PC growth; the second we talked about was volume licensing; and the third, which I actually talked about in John's question, was Office and some transactional strengths. Some of the strengths that we saw in Office transactionally really can be linked back to the end of life of XP. As people refresh a PC and if they're buying Pro, those people often are Office customers. And so if they tend to buy on a transactional basis, they'd also see some impact through Office. I think you can tie that back to some of the outperformance we saw in the quarter as well.",323

And as you look out to when the transition is complete, and I know you probably don't know when exactly that's going to occur, how do we think about what it will look like?",69
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2014",2014-01-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3165.0,571081.0,25970222.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,23,"Heather, thanks. This is one of those questions that I think is best taken in a bit of a chunk. First of all, I think if you look at our Commercial segment, I'll do it all up because I think it's relatively easy with that breakdown. In general, and you saw it this quarter, even if we continue to invest in the infrastructure to support our cloud conversion of our commercial customers to Azure and Office 365 and CRM Online, our actual gross margin remains flat, which means we're increasing our utilization and growing gross margin in the commercial cloud business as we continue to see traction. Over time, I continue to believe our Commercial business, in the absolute, moving to the cloud is a net positive, as we talked about before, to overall profit, including increasing the amount of gross margin we make as a company. So that -- I think this quarter was 83%-ish, so that, I would take as a separate bucket from our Devices and Consumer business. And now what's interesting is we have a couple of business models there with different gross margin profiles. And you're actually seeing the impact of some of that in this quarter. Xbox, as we know, especially with new consoles like the One, tend to be gross, margin-negative on the front. This is a heavy quarter for that. Over time, through the attach, a second -- first-, second-, third-party games and other services, the margin profile with any console life changes. But it's never going to be an 83% gross margin. It's just a different business, even for the market leader and even successfully generating cash in return. That is different from other businesses we also have in D&C. So I think the important thing that I tend to focus on as I go through all these businesses is continued margin improvement within the business, continued efficiency within the business and continued focus on the absolute profit within each of those areas. And then the mix then becomes more of a math equation as we continue to grow the overall amount of cash and profit the company generates.",358

You had 4 quarters over $21 billion and then jumping up obviously to north of $23 billion.

Yes and no, of course. Brent, let me say, contractual -- contracted but not billed is related to the number of expirations we have in the quarter. Chris and, I think, I both talked about, we did have a lot of expirations in the quarter. When those tend to fall at the end, it can impact the actual magnitude is the absolute number of expirations. And then that timing of when those fall in the quarter can also impact how it's recognized. And that's why I never really look at it separately from unearned, bookings and renewals together. And so -- because timing is one thing, that's why I tend to put them in a bucket and say together, it's a good and healthy trajectory.",126

This is the first year, I think, you've had full retail store presence. You also, I believe, had some presence in some of the Best Buys with sort of mini stores in there.

When we talk about improved retail execution, I really think that's a partnership, as you said, with retailers, with our OEMs and with our efforts to really improve both the devices, the assortment and the experience of buying in the PC aisle. So I do feel good about the investments we've made there, and we've made them, I think, thoughtfully and continue to keep a focus on cost and expense as we do that. So do I think it's had an impact? I do. But I really think the broader impact was investments and commitments we had with our partners to also improve the retail buying experience.",109

Despite the fact that you saw significant outperformance in D&C Hardware, which, as you were saying, especially for something like Xbox One, which is just out of the gate, we had expectations of being very low, if not negative gross margins. Can you help us understand a little bit of where that gross margin outperformance came from? Was any of it in D&C Hardware getting better yields or, sort of, better gross margins on those products than your expectations? And if not, where did the outperformance come from?",116

I'm glad you asked that question. With our outperformance, as you pointed out, in D&C Hardware, we did actually see increased COGS related to that. However, that was offset by some COGS improvement and savings we saw across other areas as we continue to focus on efficiency and execution. And so you're right, we did see COGS grow with Hardware, but we were able to find savings elsewhere as we focused on improved execution.",76

In many ways, you've seen this over covering our company for a while. Expirations can be chunkier. That's not a year statement. This quarter, we had a big expiry base. I wouldn't characterize it as sort of abnormally large, but the timing is a bit related to 3 years ago and the timing of some of the contracts. So it's probably a consistent driver.",68

And last quarter, we talked a bit about -- are there any metrics you can help us to understand better what the effect of your revenues is from the shift to the cloud?

I think I talked about this a little bit. The place where you can see the most direct impact is in the Consumer Office business. We talked about the business on a traditional license basis being down 24 points, but our estimate is approximately 16 points of that decline is accounted for by the shift to Office 365 Home Premium. So that gives you sort of a good estimation of the impact -- the direct impact we're seeing, particularly on the consumer side.",86

That's a good point. We didn't have a chance to discuss the Phone results. We did see growth in Windows Phone, both in the licensing and in the mobile phone IP revenues. Both grew this quarter. I think regarding Nokia, we continue to see the growth in many places that we've seen historically: so unsubsidized markets, as well as with entry-level smartphone devices. So I think many of those dynamics haven't really changed. Do I have any updates to how to think about Nokia other than we continue to expect it to close in the quarter? I don't. We mostly remain focused on working hard to get to the point. We're working together as 1 team to drive that business forward.",123

But the margin differential between these 2 businesses is still is a pretty wide one. It looks like the Consumer business is growing. The 2 dynamics that I can see are that the Consumer business -- the 3 are [ph] : one is the margin differential is too wide. You try to improve it. The margin differential is still wide. The Consumer business, trend-wise, is growing faster than commercial. And third is that you have the shift to the cloud. So unless you do something like an Adobe or Autodesk where you force the transition to happen very quickly, there is the risk that you get a lot of growth, which is fantastic, and there's a lot of progress to share. But the margin inflection point could be delayed for several years, so I think that was one of the questions, that was the spur behind, I think, presumably, Heather's question. That's what I'm trying to get at. So how long are you going to get this shift to result in a way that we may not see the earnings growth rate but we may have to wait until some point in time? Or are you at the point where you can actually force this shift to happen much quicker?",231

I think the way I think about it is we are -- we have a broad portfolio, and we address customers of all types. And in many ways, our biggest goal is to meet the needs of our customers, whether they be CIOs or consumers, and setting our business model to support the products, and the adoption curve that we want needs to be married with the adoption curve and timing of our customers. I feel like we've done a very good job of balancing the pace of that. I've been encouraged by the pace of adoption of many of our cloud services. You heard the Home Premium numbers today, as well as talking about the commercial cloud. And so for me, it's hard to say -- they're too big of a delta. It's really about managing each of these things toward absolute growth and absolute improvement and having customer adoption. So I probably just have a different perspective on that than you have.",166

We only recently started selling the Office client in our volume licensing agreements through a subscription. So that is actually good feedback for us to think going forward about talking about the Office-specific business that way because, in general, we think of Office 365 as being a broad set of assets, including Exchange, SharePoint, Lync and Office in the Commercial business.

Maybe if I could slip in one other one, just to go back on the contracted not billed. I just want to be clear in my own mind because I've heard 2 things. One thing I heard you say was we had stronger transactional business late in the quarter, but I also heard you say that there were, frankly, more renewals on multi-year that would have resulted in that balance going up, especially if those were late in the quarter. So am I right to think it's those 2 factors that are at play here, both stronger transactional and a larger pool, if you will, of multi-year renewals? And is it relatively evenly balanced between the 2?",139

Actually, transactional execution in the quarter is recognized all in quarter. That's not annuity. It doesn't go to either the unearned balance or the contracted not billed balance. So that's not an impact that results in a change to your unearned or CNB. The latter, which is the absolute size of the expiration days, frankly, could or couldn't impact CNB. It can impact things like unearned growth, but it also can impact CNB, depending on if it's contracted and quartered but not billed until after the end of the quarter.",91

You're right, I only pointed out a few of the value props of SQL Server. And actually, dating back years, the real value prop of SQL has been the breadth of its offering: analytics, reporting and core database functionality. And so over the years, I think the balance of those things and continuing to add and innovate at very good value has continued to be appealing. And I -- as we move forward and add some cloud capabilities into our hybrid model and continue to add features into the premium levels, when you're the established, and I think in many ways, unit leader, then you can focus on continuing to move up the stack, adding value and increasing your premium mix. And the team has really done a terrific job of doing that. So it's nice to be asked so that I can talk about it. And I think, I mentioned it briefly, that System Center is another where we've gained share in virtualization.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel.
On our website, microsoft.com/investor, we have posted a document summarizing our quarterly results, as well as a slide deck, which is intended to follow the quarterly results document and provide a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Please keep in mind that all growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period of last year. Unless otherwise specified, all impacted numbers have been adjusted for the cumulative effect of last year's revenue deferrals and recognition related to the Windows Upgrade Offer, the Office deferral, the video game deferral and the expense related to the nontax deductible European Commission fine.
As a reminder, in our segment reporting structure, we have consolidated revenue adjustments of this nature into corporate and other to provide better comparability of operating results. We will post this call's prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript at the Microsoft Investor Relations website until April 24, 2015.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.",339

It's great to have the opportunity to join today's call. From my first day, I've said I'm committed to an ongoing dialogue with investors. Joining these investor calls going forward is going to be a big part of that, and I'm enthusiastic about today's call. It's been an incredibly busy couple of months. In addition to executing on our plan and announcing new products and services, I've spent a lot of time gathering feedback and exchanging ideas with customers, partners, employees and investors. It is important and valuable to see the company with a fresh perspective, to get grounded both on our current realities and future opportunities. 
As I've told our employees, our industry does not respect tradition; it only respects innovation. This applies to us and everyone else. When I think about our industry over the next 5, 10 years, I see a world where computing is more ubiquitous and all experiences are powered by ambient intelligence. Silicon hardware systems and software will coevolve together and give birth to a variety of new form factors. 
Nearly everything we do will become more digitized, our interactions with other people with machines and between machines. The ability to reason over and draw insights from everything that's been digitized will improve the fidelity of our daily experiences and interactions. This is the mobile-first and cloud-first world. It's a rich canvas for innovation and a great growth opportunity for Microsoft across all our customer segments. 
To thrive in this world, we will continue to zero in on the things customers really value and Microsoft can uniquely deliver. We want to build products that people love to use. And as a result, you will see us increasingly focus on usage as the leading indicator of long-term success. To that end, we're already making progress.
Amy will provide additional detail, but I wanted to say a few words about the quarter itself. Today's results demonstrate the breadth and strength of our overall business. We saw strong momentum in cloud services. Our commercial cloud business more than doubled year-over-year with Office 365 and Azure both performing extremely well. Business customers continue to make Windows their overwhelming platform of choice, with solid growth both in Windows Pro and Windows volume licensing revenues. 
We saw continued improvement in search, with our U.S. search share growing to 18.6% and search revenue increasing by 38%. Bing continues to deliver platform capabilities across our products. One recent example of this is the recently announced Cortana virtual assistant for Windows Phone.
And very importantly, across all our businesses, we continue to have a rigorous focus on execution and cost discipline resulting in solid revenue and earnings per share.
I sum up this quarter in 2 words: execution and transition. We delivered solid financial results, and we took several steps to reorient Microsoft. In recent weeks, we talked about how we're advancing Office, Windows and our Data Platform, and how we think holistically about the constituencies we serve, IT developers and the people at the center in a mobile-first, cloud-first world. 
We will continue to invest in our cloud capabilities, including Office 365 and Azure, in the fast-growing SaaS and cloud platform markets. We are committed to ensuring that our cloud services are available across all device platforms that people use. We're delivering a cloud for everyone on every device.
At the same time, we have bold plans to move Windows forward. We're investing and innovating in every dimension, from form factor, to software experiences, to price. Windows platform is unique in how it brings together consistent end user experiences across small to large screens, broadest platform opportunity for developers and control and assurance for IT. And with the addition of Nokia's talented people and their depth in mobile technologies, we will enhance our device capabilities.
The past 2.5 months have been a period of significant change at Microsoft but also a period of nailing the basics and delivering against our products and financial plans. In the months ahead, we will continue to intensely be focused on 2 things, rock-solid execution and pivoting the company towards the future. We will continue to push hard and move quickly, and you will see the proof of that month after month in the products and services we build for the mobile-first, cloud-first world. What you can expect of Microsoft is courage in the face of reality. We will approach our future with a challenger mindset, we will be bold in our innovation, we will be accountable to our customers, partners and shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Amy to go further into the details of the quarter, and we will be happy to take your questions after that.",788

Let me start with a few things I think are notable this quarter. Then I'll give our outlook before moving on to Q&A. We had a very good third quarter, with solid results across our businesses and strong momentum in our most strategic areas. At the same time, we remain focused and disciplined in our spending. 
Total revenue was $20.4 billion, up 8%, and earnings per share grew 5%. We had outstanding momentum and results in our cloud services.
As Satya mentioned, commercial cloud revenue more than doubled again this quarter. Office 365 is now on an annual revenue run rate of $2.5 billion, and Azure revenue grew over 150%, driven by both new customers and increased usage. 
In our Office 365 Home service, we added nearly 1 million new users this quarter and now have over 4.4 million subscribers. We continue to enhance this value proposition with new features, premium services and cross-platform functionality. As we cross the 1-year anniversary since launch, we are pleased with the renewal rates we are experiencing thus far.
With Bing, we made clear progress again this quarter. We grew our U.S. share and improved RPS significantly. Display revenue related to portal and email declined, while we saw ad revenue growth in products like Skype and Xbox. 
Importantly, we're innovating while expanding our cloud gross margins through both improved scale and continuous engineering efforts to drive efficiency. Business are clearly expressing their overwhelming preference for Windows. Windows Pro revenue grew 19%, driven by growth in business PCs, mix shift to developed markets where attach is higher, continued strength in the enterprise and an increased mix of Pro in small and medium businesses. Windows volume licensing also had a solid 11% revenue growth. Windows XP end of support contributed in part to this growth we saw this quarter, as did a general hardware refresh.
Our commercial results reflect ongoing strengths, and we again outperformed the enterprise IT market. Customer movement from transactional purchasing to subscription and multiyear agreements was better than our expectations. Therefore, our commercial unearned revenue grew 12% this quarter, which was above our expectations and our contracted not-billed balance exceeded $22 billion. We had double-digit growth in SQL, System Center, Windows Server Premium and Lync. Clearly, our value proposition and product roadmap is resonating.
Xbox One has sold in over 5 million units since launch, and engagement has been high, with users spending nearly 5 hours per day on their console. We will continue to extend the unique entertainment value proposition of Xbox One, particularly in markets outside of the U.S., where some services aren't as mature. 
Xbox 360 sales exceeded our expectations this quarter and across the platform, Xbox LIVE members continued to embrace service, with transactional revenue growing 17%. We do expect to work through some inventory in Q4. 
We continued to enhance the value proposition of Surface through both hardware and software innovation, which makes Surface one of the best high-value productivity devices available. This quarter, the mix of sales moved to our second-generation and Pro devices, and this change had a positive impact on gross margin.
Now let's turn to operating expenses. As a result of our ongoing prioritization efforts, OpEx was favorable to what we expected in January. Across the company, we are focused on continually aligning our resources to our top priorities, which includes investing in the next wave of innovation for our customers. We are devoting resources to our sales team and partner ecosystem to ensure they are positioned for the migration to cloud services.
And finally, our agility is also improving, as planned marketing spend was redeployed from Q3 to Q4 in support of a commercial cloud campaign. 
With that summary of Q3 results, I'd like to talk about our outlook.
Given the Nokia Devices & Services transaction is closing tomorrow, the guidance I will walk through next excludes any related impact. Let's start with Devices and Consumer. 
In licensing, we expect revenue to be $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion. This range reflects an expectation that the benefits of XP end of support will moderate. In hardware, we expect revenue to be $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion in what is a seasonally slower hardware quarter. This number also reflects channel inventory drawdown for Xbox consoles. 
In Devices and Consumer Other, we expect revenue to be about $1.9 billion. We expect to see continued growth in Office 365 Home and Bing as we drive additional usage.
Moving on to Commercial. We expect revenue across our 2 segments to be $13.1 billion to $13.3 billion. Within this, we expect Commercial Other revenue to be about $2.1 billion on the strength of the transition to our cloud. And in Corporate, we expect, to defer revenue of about $100 million. We expect COGS to be $5.7 billion to $5.8 billion, with variability primarily due to hardware. 
And moving on to operating expenses.
For the fourth quarter, we expect OpEx to be $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion when adjusting for the prior year European Commission line. This represents full year operating expense growth of about 4%. This is on the low end of our original guidance that we provided a year ago of 4% to 6%, as we invested in R&D and sales efforts while rationalizing our marketing spend.
As a reminder, other income and expense includes dividend and interest income offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. We expect these items to generally offset each other. We expect a higher tax rate in Q4 and the full year tax rate to be between 18% and 20%. We expect capital expenditure to be about $1.5 billion as we build out our cloud infrastructure. We are concentrating on hardware, software and data center optimization and supply chain efficiencies to maximize the benefits of our cloud scale. The benefits of this work are realized in improving gross margins. We expect unearned revenue to grow in line with normal seasonality.
Now let me share some thoughts regarding Nokia Devices & Services. The acquisition will close tomorrow, which is about 4 months later than the deal economics we outlined in September assumed. Since then, the Nokia business results have also changed. We are focused on the transition from planning to implementation, which accelerates with the deal closing tomorrow. Given this is a complex body of work that will take time, we do not intend to update our financial guidance for any Nokia impact during the quarter. However, I want to share the following to help as you update your models.
Under the existing commercial agreement between Microsoft and Nokia, license sales and platform payments are reported in the D&C Licensing segment. Once the acquisition closes, results for Nokia Devices & Services will be reported in the D&C Hardware segment. For Q4, we will clearly show the impact of the ending of the commercial agreement, Nokia's ongoing operations and any onetime integration and severance cost. And we remain committed to achieving annual cost synergy target of at least $600 million within 18 months of close.
Now looking toward fiscal '15. Satya and I, along with the rest of the senior leadership team, are working together to solidify our plans for the year ahead. Our goals are clear: get more out of the tremendous resources we have available, drive innovation and products that people love to use and execute in areas where Microsoft can uniquely succeed in today's mobile-first, cloud-first world. 
And with that, let me turn it back over to Chris, and we can move to Q&A.",1263

The first 10 weeks or so have been extremely energizing. And as I said, for me, what was important was to reach out, talk to lots of different constituents and relearn the place and see it for the first time and just get a different, fresh perspective, even in spite of having spent the 22 years here, it's been fascinating to get that fresh perspective. And the way I look at it is even from day 1, I've had the deep conviction that our vision is about being -- going boldly into this mobile-first, cloud-first world, and we feel that we are well on our way, and if there's anything that I want to do is how do we make sure we remain focused on it, with every device launch, with every service launch, we keep coming back on reinforcing that vision. Because at the end of the day, it's the purpose with which we approach the vision and the execution behind it, which is what counts. And to me, being able to think about that deeply, what does it mean for us culturally, what does it mean for us in terms of our plans, and then just getting behind it, leaning into it as an entire company is what's my priority, and that's what I obsess about, that's what I focus about.",226

If you don't mind, I'm going to ask an overall question, either of Amy or of Satya. Looking at commercial license business, how much of the shrinkage year-over-year in commercial license is driven by the move of traditional license players from license -- or license-paying customers from license to the cloud? How much is related to guys moving from software assurance, how much from license? Can you give any color in there?",81
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2014",2014-04-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3281.0,617242.0,27839825.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,10,"Thanks, Mark, for that question. Why don't I take that one. Overall, in Commercial Licensing, I often talk, as you know, about the commercial business all up. [indiscernible] really reinforce that we see a bit of what you're talking about, which is that renewal rates have remained high and in line. Our ability to recapture revenue in those contracts remains strong and our ability to attach cloud products has grown. And so what we've seen this quarter and what you see even in the Commercial Licensing line itself is that continued switch. And in fact, it was faster this quarter than we had thought. Really, when you look at our commercial unearned revenue, along with the CNB balance that we talked about last quarter, we had so many billings at the end of last quarter. When you really normalize for those end-of-quarter billings, bookings were also better than we had expected in terms of the annuity stream. So I think, both a transition to long-term agreements is encouraging, addition to premium product, the addition of new product, as well as the transition to a cloud is really core to thinking about the health of the segment all up.",198

It's great to have your views and inputs here. One of the questions I get more most often from investors is trying to understand sort of how you're going to approach the role, and what you're doing initially in terms of is there a strategic review that's going on? Are you reviewing the businesses? And should we expect any big changes in the strategy of Microsoft? So I'm going to put that question to you in terms of over the next couple of weeks, months, quarters even, is there anything of a strategic review going on? Is there any big changes in the Microsoft strategy that we should be expecting from that review?",122
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2014",2014-04-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3281.0,617242.0,27839828.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,13,"Thanks, Keith, for the question. The framework I have in terms of how I'm approaching my job and how we as a leadership team and as a company are going to execute and plan, because one of the things that I strongly believe in is you're planning on a continuous basis, you're executing on a continuous basis. It's not episodic, if you will. The only way we're going to succeed here is by having this notion that you are planning all the time and you're also making the changes to your plan based on the changed circumstances, and I think that's the way to run a company like ours in a marketplace that's as dynamic as ours. But that said, I start with, though, a vision that's very grounded on what the future opportunity is. So this mobile-first, cloud-first thing is a pretty deep thing for us. When we say mobile-first, in fact, what we mean by that is mobility first. We think about users and their experiences spanning a variety of devices. So it's not about any one form factor that may have some share position today. But as we look to the future, what are the set of experiences across devices, some ours and some not ours, that we can power through experiences that we can create uniquely. So that notion of having a central focus and a central purpose is what, I think, we've already signaled and we are well on our way to execute on it. Now you also need to continuously build some new capability. When you think about mobility first, that means you need to have really deep understanding of all the mobile scenarios for everything, from how communications happen, how meetings occur, and those require us to build new capability. We'll do some of this organically, some of it inorganically. A good example of this is what we have done with Nokia. So we will -- obviously, we're looking forward to that team joining us, building on the capability. And then, execution. Even in the last 3 weeks or so, we have announced a bunch of things where we talked about this one cloud for everyone and every device. We talked about how our Data Platform is going to enable this data culture, which is in fact fundamentally changing how Microsoft itself works. We also talked about what it means to think about Windows, especially with the launch of this universal Windows application model. How different it is now to think about Windows as one family, which was not true before, but now we have a very different way to think about it. And so we are well on our way to execute on it. But your core question of are we going to review. We're all the time reviewing. And one of the things that I feel as a leadership team we have really picked up the pace on asking the hard questions. What is the believability of any one of our plans and pushing ourselves. Because at the end of the day, to me, I want to be very accountable to you, all, to our customers, to our partners, as a team, by executing on our plans very well. Because at the end of the day, that's what matters. So that at least gives you a framework for how we're approaching it.",561

I'm just not sure what the margins are on your cloud business. And as you transition, most SaaS companies have 70%, 80% gross margins. I'm not real sure where you are on your cloud businesses today. Do we think this is going to be a smooth transition or might we expect it to be a little more disruptive as you gain more and more traction on a subscription and cloud basis?",135

Thanks for the question. I'll start, and maybe, Amy, you want to even add. The way I look at it, Rick, we are well on our way to making that transition in terms of moving from pure licenses to long-term contracts and as well as subscription business model. And so when you talked about Platform-as-a-Service, if you look at our commercial cloud, it's made up of the platform itself, which is Azure. We also have a SaaS business in Office 365. Now one of the things that we want to make sure we look at is each of the constituent parts, because the margin profile on each one of these things is going to be different. The infrastructure elements right now, in particular, is going to have a different economics versus some of the per-user applications in a SaaS mode [ph] have. It's the blending of all of that, that matters. And the growth of that matters to us the most in this time where I think there's just a couple of us really playing in this market. I mean, this is gold rush time in some sense of being able to capitalize on the opportunity. And when it comes to that, we have some of the best, the broadest SaaS solution and the broadest platform solution. And that combination of those assets doesn't come often. So what we are very focused on is how do we make sure we get our customers aggressively into this, having them use our service, be successful with it, and then there will be a blended set of margins across even just our cloud. And what matters to me in the long run is the magnitude of profit we generate, given a lot of categories are going to be merged as this transition happens. And we have to be able to actively participate in it and drive profit growth.",317

I think, specifically, as you think about the transitions and where you'll see it, first, I would say, year-over-year, we had flat to improving gross margins in all segments but hardware, where we had a mix shift to the Xbox console, which from a business model perspective, obviously drives gross margin decline. But that being said, within the Office 365 business, I start from the fact and a principle, which is having a user, whether they be in the consumer or in the enterprise, have access to our most recent, most innovative, most secure products, which is always going to be, for us, probably the one born in the cloud, will be a driver of satisfaction and a driver of usage. Those 2 things lead to revenue. You're already seeing that transition in the enterprise, where we already sold that way. The transition is quite easy from an economic standpoint. In the transactional business, you saw the impact of it this quarter. We had a bigger mix shift to annuity. More went on the balance sheet. We still had strong growth. But you do see the impact inter-quarter. And in the consumer side of the business, which you also referenced with Adobe, I think, we've just launched another SKU, in addition to Home, called Personal, as we continue to drive consumer usage that way. The launch of Office on the iPad is an example of where we will add the most value, which is in the subscription.",254

I was wondering if you could share with us the decision recently to offer Windows for free for sub 9-inch devices and how you think this impacts your share in that arena? And also, how should we think about Windows pricing, given your comments about how Windows is going to kind of play in different market segmentations. How do we see Windows pricing evolving, if at all, for other types of form factors over time?",94

Overall, the way I want us to look at Windows going forward is what does it mean to have the broadest device family and ecosystem, because at the end of the day, it's about the users and developer opportunity we create for the entirety of the family that's going to define the health of the ecosystem. So to me, it matters that we approach the various segments that we now participate with Windows, because that's what has happened. Fundamentally, we participated in the PC market. Now we are in a market that's much bigger than the PC market. We continue to have healthy share, healthy pricing, and in fact, growth, as we mentioned, in the enterprise adoption of Windows. And that, we plan to, in fact, add more value, more management, more security, especially as things are changing in those segments, given BYOD and software security issues, we want to be able to reinforce that core value. But then, when it comes to new opportunities, from wearables to Internet of Things, we want to be able to participate in all of this with our Windows offering, with our tools around it. And we want to be able to price by category, and that's effectively what we did. We looked at what it makes -- made sense for us to do on tablets and phones below 9 inches. And we felt that the price there needed to be changed. We have monetization wrinkles on the back end for those. And that's how we're going to approach each one of these opportunities. Because in a world of ubiquitous computing, we want Windows to be ubiquitous. That doesn't mean it's one price, one business model for all of that. And it's actually a market expansion opportunity, and that's the way we want to go execute on it.",314

I'm going to give Amy a question here for numbers. Amy, we see your sales and marketing expense declined 7% year-over-year in this quarter. Can you remind us if there's anything unique last year or is this just better controls? And along these same lines, free cash flow, excluding acquisitions, grew 2%, which is a bit of a surprise, given the direction the company is going, and the first time in 7 quarters we've actually seen growth in free cash flow. So can you tell us how we should be thinking about this going forward?",97

I was getting lonely. I didn't have any question, so I appreciate it. Let me start with your first one, which was there any sort of unique thing that resulted in that comparable in sales and marketing. We did have more launch expense going on a year ago, but we also focused on rationalizing and focusing our marketing dollars in quarter. So I don't -- I think it's a combination of both, and I would probably say more of the latter, which is really thinking and prioritizing more effectively throughout the year to earn the highest ROI on the dollars we're spending. We also did invest in sales year-over-year. So most of that is specifically around marketing. So I want to make sure that you understand that where we see opportunity, we're investing in our selling engine to get it. I was making an important caveat to make sure it's clear when you see year-over-year sales and marketing decline. The second half of that, in terms of cash flow, I think, as we remain focused on prioritizing and really thinking about the return on the dollars we spend, you did see also, as I talked about earlier, margins increase year-over-year. All of that's had a positive impact on cash flow.",212

I think, when we talked at the end about how I think about '15, maybe it's better said is how we think about every day, which is what can we do today, this week, this month to better invest behind places where we feel like we are uniquely capable of success and not being afraid to make those changes. And finding the agility and the empowerment here to do those things is incredibly important. And I would say, culturally, Satya mentioned about being more data-driven. I think, in addition to the day-to-day, which was more focused on customers, I think, really, it's a cultural statement about how we are going to operate more internally as well. And so maybe that's the most forward-looking comment I could tell you, which is that being empowered to look weekly, monthly and see how we can get better and better and better. And I think, that's actually driven a lot of excitement around here.",161

I want to focus in on Office 365. I mean, if you compare this quarter to last quarter, you added 1.1 million Home Premium users. Last quarter, I think it was 500k. In September, you talked about a run rate of, I think, $1.5 billion. Now you're at $2.5 billion. I wonder if you could just talk about the momentum that you're seeing in Office 365 and maybe give us some thoughts on sort of business versus the home/consumer side of that. And then, Amy, when you think about Office 365, how do you think about the difference in sort of lifetime value of an Office 365 customer versus a traditional Office user?",123
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2014",2014-04-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3281.0,617242.0,27839843.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,28,"Great. Let me start, and then, Amy, you should definitely add onto it. Because Office 365, I'm really, really excited about what's happening there, which is, to me, this is the core engine that's driving a lot of our cloud adoption. And you see it in the numbers, and Amy will talk more about the numbers. But one of the fundamental things it's also doing is it's actually a SaaS application and it's also an architecture for enterprises. And one of the most brilliant [ph] things we announced when we talked about the cloud for everyone and every device and we talked about Office 365 having now iPad apps, we also launched something called the Enterprise Mobility Suite, which is perhaps one of the most strategic things during that day that we announced, which was that we now have a consistent and deep platform for identity management, which, by the way, gets bootstrapped every time Office 365 users sign up, device management and data protection, which is really what every enterprise customer needs in a mobile-first world, in a world where you have SaaS application adoption and you have BYOD or bring-your-own-devices happening. So to me, the Office 365 growth is, in fact, driving our enterprise infrastructure growth, which is driving Azure growth. And that cycle, to me, is most exciting. So that's one of the reasons why I want us to keep indexing on the usage of all of this. And the growth numbers you see is a reflection of that.",252

First, whenever we launch a new motion, a new SKU in this instance, especially subscription, I do think it takes some time, both for the customer to understand the value proposition, as well as for retailers and partners to really hone their motion to pivot to selling a new subscription model. I think, you're starting to see some acceleration, as well as increasing awareness of the product, which I think is terrific. And maybe more importantly, as we think about the value we're adding, the Office on the iPad announcement certainly brought attention as we continue to drive people to the subscription. And I made a comment around renewal rates, and we're happy with them as we've just sort of passed the 1-year anniversary of the launch. And I think, when you look at the LTV, we will be better off for many reasons, including financially, when a person moves to the subscription. My deep belief is the most important thing we will do is continue to think about how we can modernize, add features, add innovation so that it's more valuable to them every day they use it. And that is far easier in a cloud world than it is on premises. And so I think that's probably the most important driver of LTV long term.",249

I know you're not providing updated guidance for Nokia. Just wondering, maybe a little bit of thought behind that decision. I know the deal closes tomorrow. You probably could have easily moved things around here a bit and reported on early next week on had that benefit. Is the lack of guidance there, is it just simply you haven't been able to get your hands into that business at this point? Is there something else that's changed in that business?

The reality is we've not had the type of access until close where we could confidently begin to give the type of guidance that I believe we've come and you've come to expect from us in terms of the depth and analysis required to get there. They do report in a different accounting system. It needs to be converted to GAAP. We've not had access to forward projections, haven't had deep access to their systems. And so until we get that, which really starts tomorrow, it's not really a question of whether it was this week or next week, it's really a question of us getting the confidence and access to be able to report at the level of details I know you all would expect me to do.",135

And Satya, I think, you know a thing or 2 about this group, so perhaps I'll direct that to you. But that growth rate is, so far, still above what a lot of your mega-cap tech vendors -- peers, I should say, are posting. And I just wanted to ask you if you could try to outline for us the couple of factors that have enabled Microsoft to continue growing that server business well above your peers? And secondly, if you think that kind of 10 percentage growth is sustainable over fiscal '15?",106
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2014",2014-04-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3281.0,617242.0,27839850.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,35,"So I'll start. In fact, both Amy and I worked on that business, so we'll both take a crack at it. It's a pretty exciting change that's happening. Obviously, that part of the business has been performing very well for a while now. But quite frankly, it's fundamentally changing. One of the questions I often get asked is, ""Hey, how did Windows server and the Hypervisor underneath it become so good so soon? You've been at it for a long time but there seems to have something fundamentally changed."" I mean, we've grown a lot of share recently, the product is more capable than it ever was, the rate of change is different, and it's for one reason alone, which is we use it to run Azure. So the fact that we use our servers to run our cloud makes our servers more competitive for other people to build their own cloud. So it's the same trend that's accelerating us on both sides. The other thing that's happening is when we sell our server products, they, for most part, are just not isolated anymore. They come with automatic cloud tiering. SQL Server is a great example. We just launched a new version of SQL, which is by far the best release of SQL in terms of its features, like its exploitation of in-memory. It's the first product in the database world that has in-memory for all the 3 workloads of databases: OLTP, data warehousing and BI. But more importantly, it automatically gives you high availability, which means a lot to every CIO and every enterprise deployment by actually tiering to the cloud. So those kind of feature innovation, which is pretty boundary-less for us is a breakthrough work. It's not something that somebody who has been a traditional competitor of ours can do if you're not even a first-class producer of a public cloud service. So I think that we are in a very unique place. Our ability to deliver this hybrid value proposition and be in a position where we not only run a cloud service at scale but we also provide the infrastructure underneath it as a server products to others, that's what's driving the growth. The shape of that growth and so on will change over time. But I feel very, very bullish about our ability to continue this innovation.",394

I had a question about Device and Consumer licensing. First of all, the Windows Pro revenue is very strong. And Amy, I know you had alluded to receding impact of XP upgrades. But I wanted to get a sense of how sustainable you think that growth can continue? And also noticing that the, particularly, Office consumer revenue is improving on attach rates and there had been a bit of a disconnect there because of the transition to Office 365, I wanted to get your thoughts on how long that might be sustainable or whether this is related to the sort of the broader XP expiration?",115
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2014",2014-04-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3281.0,617242.0,27839853.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,38,"Let me take those in reverse, actually. On the Office consumer performance, I will always, first and foremost, think about the combination of Office 365 Home, as well as our consumer performance, and that grew obviously at a higher rate than 15% that we talked about this quarter. That -- and increasing attach. There were some dynamics this quarter that I think were important, some stabilizing that we've seen in the consumer developed world PC market also benefits, as you might imagine, our Office business. We had the highest attach rates in developed markets. And so that tends to be an important driver of Office revenue, whether earned as a license or as a subscription. The second thing is related a bit to your first question. These are -- it's sort of hard to separate oftentimes many of the dynamics in our market. As we've seen Pro -- Windows Pro mix increase, for example, in small business, when people buy PCs with Windows Pro, they're more likely to purchase a form of Office, whether it be a subscription or a license. That's another dynamic you saw this quarter. A final dynamic that I'll talk about relating to Office was around Japan. We did see some pull forward due to the end -- to the tax increase. And so that did have an impact on Office consumer growth. But even without that, as we talked about, we still had increasing attach and very good performance for the quarter. Now backing up, because it's complicated, was the Windows sustainability in the business segment. As we said, it's very hard to separate cleanly the impact of XP from what is an improving business PC refresh cycle, as well as some positive macroeconomic trends that we're seeing. So as I said in my comments, the end of XP does create a bit of a moderation in growth. That being said, the differentiation and value proposition of Pro is clearer than it has been. The investment in that SKU and the value proposition of Pro has had mix increasing within segments of the market, for example, in small business and in the enterprise, for people who buy Windows PC. And so I think that's an important dynamic that we'll continue to invest in and we're excited to see.",383

As we think about the new world in terms of more usage and more software-driven rather than device-driven, can you talk a little bit how you want to reengage or further engage with the developer community with the big theme of your presentation at Build. I noticed, at Build, Xamarin was kind of mentioned by a lot of guys and saw a lot of attention. But talk a little bit about that, how the developer community is really important for you and what you're doing around that to kind of get the software future of Microsoft going again.",101

So thanks for the question. Developers are very, very important to us. If you're in the platform business, which we are on both on the device side, as well as on the cloud side, developers and their ability to create new value props and new applications on them is sort of life itself. I would say a couple of things. One is the announcement we made at Build on the device side is really a breakthrough work for us, which is we're the only device platform today that has this notion of building universal apps with fantastic tooling around that. So that means you can target multiple of our devices and have common code across all of them. And this notion of having a Windows universal application help developers leverage their code asset, which is their core asset across this expanded opportunity is huge. There was this one user experience change that Terry Myerson talked about at Build, which expands the ability for anyone who puts up his application in Windows Store to be now discovered across even the billion-plus PC installed base. And so that's, I think, a fantastic opportunity to developers, and we're doing everything to make that opportunity clear and recruit developers to do more with Windows. And in that context, we'll also support cross-platforms. So one of the things that we have done is a relationship with Unity. We have tooling that allows you to have this core library that's portable. You can bring your code asset. In fact, we're the only client platform that has the abstractions available for the different languages and so on. And then, on the cloud side, in fact, one of the most strategic APIs is the Office API. If you think about it, if you would be building an application for iOS, if you want single sign-on for any enterprise application, it's the Azure AD single sign-on. That's one of the things that we showed at Build, which is how to take advantage of list data in SharePoint, contact information in Exchange, Azure Active Directory information for log-on. And those are the APIs that are very, very powerful APIs and unique to us. And they expand the opportunity for developers to reach into the enterprise. And then, of course, Azure is a full platform, which is very attractive to developers. So that gives you a flavor for how important developers are and what the opportunities are.",407

And I guess, I have 2 questions. One is are you able to separate the XP end-of-life impact from the broader improvement in corporate PC refresh, for example? And then, two, Satya, what thought have you given around how you could potentially make what has been traditionally a unit model with Windows OEM revenue into something potentially more recurring in nature?",103

Let me take the first part of that. I think our guidance for the D&C Licensing segment takes into account a moderate decline, as I said, in the benefit of the end of XP, as well as some of the impact of the pull-forward in Office for Japan. So, I think, in general, it's pretty reflective of the trend lines that we discussed. And it's -- I do think it is hard to really separate completely the difference between a generally improving business PC environment and the end of XP. We tried our best to do that in the guidance, and we'll obviously learn more over the coming weeks.",111

You have back-end subscriptions. In our case, it will be Office 365. There is advertising, there is the App Store itself. So these are all things that attach to a device. And so we are definitely going to look to make sure that the value prop that we put together is going to be holistic in its nature and the monetization itself will be holistic and it will increase with the usage of the device across these services. And so that's the approach we'll take.",116

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel.
On our website, microsoft.com/investor, we have posted a slide deck, which provides a summary of our financial results, a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures and a table of noted items to aid in understanding our results this quarter. Additionally, the slide deck contains detailed information regarding the impact of the Nokia Devices and Services acquisition on our financial results. Our press release is also on the website and includes an addendum with additional information about our fourth quarter performance.
Microsoft is reporting the financial performance of the acquired Nokia Devices and Services business in a new segment called Phone Hardware. Additionally, the Devices and Consumer Hardware segment was renamed the Computing and Gaming Hardware. The products included in this renamed segment remain the same. 
Current year information reflects the financial performance of the acquired business beginning on April 25, 2014. Any reference to operating expense includes research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative, but excludes integration and restructuring charges. Please keep in mind that all growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year. Unless otherwise specified, all impacted numbers have been adjusted for non-GAAP and noted items, which are detailed in our press release and slide deck. We will post the prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until July 22, 2015.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I will -- I'll turn the call over to Amy.",425

This month is an important time for Microsoft. As a leadership team, we're taking bold and decisive action to evolve our organization and culture. This includes difficult steps, but they are necessary to position Microsoft for future growth and industry leadership. Today, we'll spend more time talking about the significant changes we're driving. However, let me first start with this quarter's results. After that, Satya will talk more about our path forward, and then I'll share our financial outlook before we take your questions.
As I think about our strong execution this quarter, there are 3 things that stand out to me: significant momentum with our cloud services, progress in a number of our consumer businesses and continued cost discipline. Our total fourth quarter revenue was $23 billion, including $2 billion from the Phone Hardware segment. As you know, our Q4 guidance did not include the impact of the acquisition of Nokia's Devices and Services business. Excluding that, we grew revenue 10%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range.
Moving on to earnings per share. Before the impact of the acquisition and the noted items Chris highlighted earlier, EPS grew 12% to $0.66. These details can be found in the earnings slide deck on our Investor Relations website.
Geographically, performance was strong across most markets, particularly in North America and in Europe. We did, however, see challenging conditions in China, where, like many other multinationals, we're experiencing a weak business environment, which we do not expect to change in the near term. 
Our Commercial cloud revenue grew 147% this quarter, driven by both Office 365 and Azure. Our Commercial cloud annual revenue run rate more than doubled this year and now exceeds $4.4 billion. And with this rapidly growing scale, we continue to expand our cloud gross margins. We saw strong commercial seat growth across Office 365, particularly with SMB customers. Additionally, we added over 1 million new subscribers to Office 365 Home and Personal, and we ended the quarter with 5.6 million users.
Azure has also grown dramatically, with storage doubling and compute tripling this year. Along with increased usage of our core services, over 50% of our Azure customers are now also using higher-value services like the Enterprise Mobility Suite, which has seen strong adoption since the May launch. We're pleased that our customers are enthusiastically embracing Office 365, Azure, CRM Online and our other cloud services, especially considering it's still early in the cloud transition.
Each customer has unique deployment needs, and as a result, CIOs value the flexibility that our hybrid cloud offerings provide. You can see this in our commercial bookings, which grew 23% this quarter, and our contracted not billed balance now exceeds $24 billion. As we previously discussed in fiscal year '14, both the quarter and the year presented a large renewal opportunity. Our differentiated value proposition, combined with strong execution, kept our renewal rates very high.
In addition to transitioning to the cloud, our customers continued to invest in premium versions of our on-prem server products like Windows Server, System Center and SQL Server. As a result, our server licensing revenue grew 14% this quarter. 
We feel good about the progress we're making with Windows. Developed markets continue to show stability, and we're encouraged by the initial response from OEMs to our new consumer offerings like Windows with Bing. This quarter, OEM revenue grew 3% as we saw the commercial hardware refresh cycle continue, with businesses updating their devices and renewing their commitment to the Windows platform.
XP end of support contributed to the double-digit growth in both Windows Pro and volume licensing, though the benefits moderated throughout the quarter.
In Bing, we continue to see growth in both usage and monetization. This quarter, U.S. search query share exceeded 19%, and RPS grew double digits again. As we saw in prior quarters, display revenue remained soft.
In late June, we launched Surface Pro 3. While it's still early, sales are outpacing earlier versions of Surface Pro, and we are excited to bring the device to many more markets this summer. During the quarter, we reassessed our product roadmap and decided not to ship a new form factor that was under development. Combined with the transition of production toward our latest Surface offering, we made inventory adjustments which impacted our gross margins. 
Also in June, we released our new Xbox One offering, and we're pleased with the response. At E3, we reasserted our focus on games with Blockbuster titles and key exclusives coming this holiday. With the progress we are making in channel inventories, the new markets for Xbox One and our exciting game line up, we feel well-positioned heading into the holiday season.
With the closing of the Nokia Devices and Services acquisition during the quarter, we established a new segment, Phone Hardware, to provide transparency into the progress we'll make as we improve and grow the phone business. This quarter, Lumia device sales were primarily driven by good performance in the lower price point, 500 and 600 series. Sales of non-Lumia devices were in line with the overall feature phone market dynamics. Our gross margins were impacted by decisions we made to rationalize the device portfolio, as well as acquisition-related amortization expense. 
Across the company, we grew gross margin by $1 billion or 7%. While the faster-growing cloud and hardware businesses impacted our overall company gross margin percentage, it's important to note we continue to drive margin growth in key areas, with improved discipline and business process.
In D&C Other, revenue from search advertising and subscriptions are driving gross margin growth. In Commercial Other, margins expanded again this quarter, benefiting from both improved business scale and data center efficiency in our cloud services. And we've made key changes to our Hardware business, which have been discussed by both Satya and Stephen Elop in the past 2 weeks.
We've also kept our focus on rigorous operating expense discipline. Excluding the addition of about $750 million from NDS, our Q4 operating expense came in at the low end of our guidance. And for the full year, with disciplined decision-making, we grew revenue 9% before NDS, more than twice as fast as operating expense, which grew 4%. 
Our effective tax rate was higher this quarter. Part of this was due to an adjustment to prior year taxes related to intercompany transfer pricing. Beyond that, the increase was driven by the inclusion of NDS results and our changing geographic mix. 
In Q4, we returned $3.4 billion in cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends to finish the fiscal year at $15.7 billion, an increase of 28% over the prior year.
With that overview, let me turn it over to Satya to share some thoughts.",1126
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2014",2014-07-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3480.0,660974.0,29413890.0,Presenter Speech,Satya Nadella,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Amy. Hello, everyone. I'm proud of the results we delivered this quarter and across the fiscal year. In Q4, on an operating basis, we grew revenue 10% and operating income 12%. We accelerated our Commercial cloud business to a $4.4 billion annual run rate. And perhaps more importantly, we made bold and disciplined decisions to define our core as a productivity and a platform company for the mobile-first, cloud-first world. 
Before I get into the investment principles and decisions, I want to explain how our focus on productivity and platforms leads us to participate in cloud and mobile markets.
Mobility for us goes beyond just devices. While we are certainly focused on building great phones and tablets, we think of mobility more expansively. We think the opportunity that comes from running our productivity experiences on Windows, iOS and Android device. Office 365 and Dynamics SaaS offerings are targeted here. 
We also see great opportunity in simplifying and managing the user experiences spanning multiple devices, ecosystems with our identity management, device management and data security. This is the focus of our Enterprise Mobility Suite.
Similarly, when it comes to the cloud opportunity, we run an app scale public cloud service and provide service for private and hybrid clouds. Azure, StorSimple, InMage and our data center additions of server products across Windows Server, System Center and SQL Server all help us participate in the cloud growth. 
Our mobile and cloud opportunity views informs our decisions on what to build and where to invest. More specifically, we use the following 3 principles to guide our investments: first, focus investments on the core. Productivity experiences and platform investments were prioritized across engineering, sales, marketing, as well as M&A; second, consolidate overlapping efforts. This means 1 operating system that covers all screen sizes and consolidated dual-use productivity services that cross life and work; third, run all businesses in an economically sound way. We will get crystal clear on the core businesses that drive long-term differentiation and the businesses that support them. For those supporting efforts such as MSN, retail stores and hardware, we will also ensure disciplined financial execution.
Now let's talk about the specific investments. We will be relentless in our focus on our core digital work and life experiences and the 2 platforms that support it: the cloud operating system and the device operating system and hardware.
Everything we do starts with digital work and life experiences to delight dual users. These are users who use technology both at work and in their personal life. This is how we reinvent productivity. 
Last year, we started to take steps in this direction. Now, OneDrive and OneDrive for Business are one team. Outlook and Exchange are one team. Skype and Lync are one team, all focused on those dual-user scenarios. 
We are clear that our experiences are going to be available on all devices. We have a specific goal for multiple Microsoft applications to be available on every home screen. This is why we brought Office to the iPad, and now there are more than 35 million downloads of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote. 
We believe productivity experiences will go beyond individual applications to deliver ambient intelligence that spans applications. To that end, we introduced Cortana, our personal assistant in Windows Phone 8.1. We also believe that productivity includes group collaboration and business processes within organizations.
In February, we announced our Power BI suite to help customers harness the power of Big Data in order to drive a data culture and greater productivity within their organizations. Power BI suite enables you to ask natural language questions, do rich visualizations and collaborate around data. Customers are loving it. In fact, the average monthly users have grown over 130%. 
We are pleased to see all up Dynamics growth at 13% for the quarter, with CRM Online nearly doubling. And it's great now to have Dynamics CRM in the Gartner Leaders quadrant in both sales and service, the 2 most relevant areas in the CRM space.
Looking forward in fiscal year '15, we are increasing our investment in R&D and sales for our digital work and life businesses, even as we cut total operating expenses. We have a rich roadmap going forward. Two examples of our innovation are what we are doing with Delve and Skype Translator. 
Delve is an Office 365 cloud-based service that is the first in the new breed of intelligent and social work experiences. Delve will turn enterprise search on its head as information that is relevant to you finds you. Think of this as the Facebook News Feed for productivity.
Skype Translator will break down the language barriers in our communications and impact everything from everyday conversations with friends to education to global business. 
Additionally, I'm pleased to see the progress with Bing, now more than 19% U.S. query share and strong RPS growth. Going forward, we will drive our Bing-related investments to contribute to the core digital work and life experiences such as Cortana, Smart Search, Delve, Power Q&A and many others. We expect Bing to be profitable on a stand-alone basis in FY '16.
Now let's transition to the Cloud OS. Our Cloud OS represents the fastest-growing opportunity for Microsoft. Quarter-after-quarter, we drive growth and customer adoption. Our server products benefit from our public cloud. The fact that we use our servers to run our cloud make our server software the most capable, enabling others to build and operate their clouds. This has led to growth in Hyper-V share, which is now at 30.6% and has helped grow data center editions of Windows Server and System Center, both up more than 40% for the year. 
We also had another breakout year for SQL Server. With SQL Server 14, we released industry-leading in-memory technology across all database workloads of online transaction processing, data warehousing and business intelligence. And we grew our SQL business by more than 19%.
Our Azure business is growing rapidly, and we further accelerated growth last year. We grew our data center footprint into Australia, Brazil, Japan and China while doubling our capacity in existing regions.
In FY '14, we also started to see the adoption of our high-value services on top of our base cloud infrastructure. We announced the Enterprise Mobility Suite, a comprehensive cloud solution to address the consumerization of IT challenges such as Bring Your Own Device and SaaS application adoption. EMS brings together identity management, device management and data security into 1 IT control plane and architecture. The early data from customer adoption for EMS is very encouraging.
We announced the Azure Intelligent Systems Service, our IoT service in the cloud that enables organizations to securely connect, manage and capture machine-generated data from a variety of sensors and devices. 
To support these high-value services in Azure, I have prioritized acquisitions such as GreenButton for Big Compute, Capptain for mobile back-end services and just in the past few weeks, InMage for disaster recovery for hybrid clouds. In FY '15, we'll make investments to drive this strategy forward. We will expand our Azure data center footprint and increase capacity in existing regions; we will launch new high-level services, including Azure machine learning that currently is in preview; we will expand our hybrid solutions with new services such as StorSimple, InMage, as well as our server products all offering cloud tiering; we will continue to build out the EMS value proposition; and we will expand our sales efforts to drive growth.
Let's transition to our device OS and hardware, the third component of our core. In everything we do with our Windows OS and first-party devices, we will light up our digital work and life experiences. We are approaching the Windows OS business with a bold, challenger mindset and pushing both the product and business model forward. We start with a focus on business customers in FY '14. We saw these customers recommit to Windows. In April, we released an update to Windows 8.1. To start, we improved the core desktop experience with mouse and keyboard advancements. For enterprises, we released Internet Explorer enterprise mode and extended our mobile device management capability. With Windows 8.1 update, we also load the hardware spec required so that OEMs can build tablets and clamshells at lower price points.
In addition, we made the decision to evolve the Windows business model. Now Windows licenses are 0 dollars for any OEM building a device less than 9 inches. We also added a low-cost Windows offering with Bing integration for OEMs. This new offering, combined with lower hardware specs, means OEMs will bring a fantastic lineup of value-based notebooks and tablets to the market this holiday.
In June, we launched Surface Pro 3, the most productive tablet on the market today. The reason it's the most productive tablet on the market is because we thought through the experience end-to-end. For example, one of the things you will notice with Surface Pro 3 is how it excels at note-taking. You can jot down your thoughts rapidly, just like with a pen and paper. To make this work in an integrated natural way, our developers pulled together 1 vision to write code that resides in the firmware in the Surface Pro 3's pen, the Windows shell and its inking support to reduce the parallax error, as well as in OneNote. And as Amy said, we are optimistic given the early signs from the Surface Pro 3's performance in the market.
On phones, we saw a good early start to Lumia 630 and 635, as well as Lumia 930, especially in Europe. 
In the year ahead, we are investing in ways that will ensure our device OS and first-party hardware align to our core. We will streamline the next version of Windows from 3 operating systems into 1 single converged operating system for screens of all sizes. We will unify our stores, commerce and developer platforms to drive a more coherent user experience and a broader developer opportunity. We look forward to sharing more about our next major wave of Windows enhancements in the coming months. 
Our approach to first-party hardware going forward is clear. At times, we will develop new categories like we did with Surface, and we will responsibly make the market for Windows Phone. However, we are not in hardware for hardware's sake, and the first-party device portfolio will be aligned to our strategic direction as a productivity and platform company. As I said before, going forward, all the devices will be created with an explicit purpose to light up our digital work and life experiences. Good examples of this today are what we are doing with Surface Pro 3 for note-taking and PPI for meetings. You can expect to see this type of innovation in our hardware, including phones. Amy will talk more on our plans for disciplined execution around our hardware business going forward. 
I want to make a few comments on Xbox. It's important for us to have a core that's thriving. It's equally important to place smart, bold bets in other areas where we have the ability to add value and have impact. That's what we're doing with Xbox. We made the decision to manage Xbox, to maximize enterprise value, with a focus on gaming. Gaming is the largest digital life category in a mobile-first, cloud-first world. It's also the place where our past success, revered brand and passionate fan base present us a special opportunity. With our decision to specifically focus on gaming, we expect to close Xbox Entertainment Studios and streamline our investments in Music and Video. We will invest in our core console gaming and Xbox LIVE with a view towards the broader PC and mobile opportunity.
I hope you can see that we have bold ambitions and we have made a lot of progress. Also know that we are well underway in evolving our organization and culture to deliver on these bold ambitions. This includes simplifying how we work and modernizing our engineering processes. In all that we do, we will be accountable to our customers, partners and shareholders. Empowering every individual and organization to do more and achieve more in a mobile-first, cloud-first world is a huge undertaking, and it is one that Microsoft is uniquely qualified to take on and change the world.
Thank you. And with that, let me turn it over to Amy to give you more guidance on FY '15.",2071

Before going into details about our outlook, let me first say that all forward-looking information assumes the macroeconomic environment remains stable throughout this coming fiscal year. 
As Satya detailed, we're taking bold steps to move Microsoft forward with a renewed sense of clarity and alignment. Our investment plan reflects those changes, as we reallocate resources to aggressively drive toward our goals and pursue the highest growth and financial return businesses. 
Even as we invest for growth, we expect our total operating expense in fiscal year '15 to be down from this past year before considering the addition of the Nokia cost structure and integration and restructuring cost. Now let me address Phone separately.
In fiscal year '14, we recorded about $750 million of operating expense for the Phone business for the period post the acquisition. Annualized, this would have been about $4.5 billion, but we are aggressively working to drive synergies across key functions such as development, supply chain and operations as we integrate and rightsize the business. We expect to realize more than $1 billion in synergies, and as a result, we will be on a path to reach operating breakeven for the Phone business in fiscal year '16. Including Phone, we expect operating expense to be between $34.2 billion and $34.6 billion in fiscal year '15. 
In addition to the expense guidance I just provided, and as we announced on July 17, we expect to incur between $1.1 billion and $1.6 billion in restructuring expense. These will be substantially complete in the first half of the fiscal year.
Separately, we will also incur about $150 million per quarter in integration costs such as systems work. Similar to this quarter, we will continue to report these items in a separate line item in the income statement.
Now let me give our view on the first quarter, starting with Devices and Consumer. In licensing, we expect revenue to be $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion. This range reflects an ongoing business PC refresh cycle, headwinds for consumer PCs and a continued moderation of the benefits from the XP end of support. 
In computing and gaming hardware, we expect revenue to be $1.7 billion to $2 billion. This range reflects the continuing ramp of Surface Pro 3 and Xbox One as both products are introduced into new markets in Q1. 
In Phone Hardware, we expect revenue to be $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion as we align the device portfolio to our strategy. 
And in Devices and Consumer Other, we expect revenue to be $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. 
Moving on to Commercial. We expect revenue across our 2 segments to be $12.0 billion to $12.2 billion. Within this, we expect Commercial Other revenue of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion. And in Corporate, we expect about $300 million of negative impact next quarter.
We expect COGS to be $7.5 billion to $7.9 billion, with variability being driven by both hardware segments. We expect first quarter operating expense, excluding integration and restructuring, to be between $8.5 billion and $8.7 billion. As a reminder, other income and expense includes dividend and interest income, offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. We expect these items to generally offset one another.
We expect our full year tax rate to be between 21% and 23%. This is in line with the fourth quarter, excluding the prior period tax adjustment, as the changing mix of our business, as well as the impact of the NDS acquisition will continue to influence our tax rate.
Investments in cloud infrastructure are necessary to support and enable the significant growth and momentum in our cloud services. In Q1, we expect CapEx to increase sequentially to further support our growth. Similar to fiscal year '14, these investments are decided based on the thorough review of demand and capacity plans to ensure that the investments provide an appropriate return on capital. We also remain focused on software-driven innovation to increase the utilization and capacity of the capital we deploy. We expect unearned revenue to grow in line with normal seasonality. 
In closing, Q1 is the start of an incredibly important year for Microsoft. We're making important changes to our organization and culture to enable and empower our people to do their very best work. Mobility and cloud present an enormous opportunity, and we are focusing resources on our core so we can capitalize and deliver on the next wave of innovation, growth and long-term shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Chris, and we can move to Q&A.",761

One is the diversity of products that Microsoft has from silicon tape-outs to services that we are continuously updating in Azure or Office 365 is a lot more than, let's say, when we first created the Microsoft engineering system. That was for retail package products. So since then, a lot has changed and a lot has evolved. And so what we are doing is we are introducing new functions and new skills. Design is even more important than it ever was. Data analytics, as you said, is very important to us. And they're not outside functions. They are functions that are integral to how we do product development, how we do A/B testing, how we do log analysis on a continuous basis. So that's the engineering process and culture change that we have ongoing and, in fact, a lot of learning from a variety of different teams that's now spreading across a lot of Microsoft.",159

We saw a significant acceleration this quarter in cloud revenue -- or I guess Amy or Satya -- we saw acceleration in cloud revenue year-over-year. What's -- is this Office for the iPad?

In general, I wouldn't point to 1 product area. It was across Office 365, Azure and even CRM Online. I think some of the important dynamics that you could point to, particularly in Office 365, I really think over the course of the year, we saw an acceleration in moving the product down the market and to increasing what we would call the midmarket and even small business at a pace. And that's a particular place I would tie back to some of the things Satya mentioned in the answer to your first question, improvements to analytics, improvements to understanding the use scenarios, improving the product in real time, understanding trial, ease of use, ease of sign-up. All of these things actually can afford us the ability to go to different categories, go to different geos and to different segments. And in addition, I think what you'll see, Mark, as we initially moved many of our customers to Office 365, it came on 1 workload. And I think what we've increasingly seen is our ability to add more workloads and sell the entirety of the suite through that process. I also mentioned in Azure our increased ability to sell some of these higher-value services. So while I could speak broadly about all of them, I think I would generally think about the strength as being both completion of our product suite, ability to enter new segments and ability to sell new workloads.",259

Our cloud runs on our service. So it's that combination which makes us both unique and reinforcing. And the best example is what we are doing with Azure Active Directory. The fact that somebody gets on-boarded to Office 365 means that tenant information isn't Azure-ready. That fact that the tenant information isn't Azure-ready is what makes EMS or our Enterprise Mobility Suite more attractive to a customer managing iOS, Android or Windows devices.

Let me actually -- I'll start and I think Satya actually will have some things to add. This is -- first of all, I would start by saying I wouldn't ascribe the behavior to me. I would ascribe the behavior to a senior leadership team and to a group that's focused on investing in the core, focused on making trade-offs, focused on really accelerating our growth in key areas. Our ability to make changes, really, throughout the second half of this year in particular and as we've led into fiscal year '15 is really about a group focused on building and investing in something that can really be even greater than it is today. And so while I would use the word disciplined, I don't think it's about a person, and it shouldn't be. It should be about an environment, in which every person here thinks about how they can increase their ROI and accrue to the collective. And I think we've actually seen the benefits of that in the past few quarters, and I think you'll see it as we head into '15.",186

You guys look to cut expenses pretty aggressively there. But this is -- and particularly, smartphone is a very competitive marketplace. Can you tell us a little bit about sort of the strategies for how you actually start to gain share with Lumia on a going-forward basis? And maybe give us an idea of what levels of share or what levels of kind of unit volumes are you going to need to hit to get to that breakeven in FY '16?",99

So overall, we are very focused on, I would say, thinking about mobility share across the entire Windows family. I already talked about in my remarks about how mobility for us even goes beyond devices. But for this specific question, I would even say that we want to think about mobility not just 1 form factor of a mobile device because I think that's where the ultimate prize is. But that said, we are, even year-over-year basis, seeing increased volume for our Lumia. It's coming at the low end, in the entry smartphone market, and we are pleased with it. It's come -- in many markets, we now have over 10%. That's the first market I would sort of say that we need to track country by country. And the key place where we are going to differentiate is looking at productivity scenarios or the digital work and life scenarios that we can light up on our phone in unique ways. When I can take my Office Lens app, use the camera on the phone, take a picture of anything and then have it automatically OCR-recognized and into OneNote Win searchable fashion, that's a unique scenario. What we have done with Surface and PPI shows us the way that there is a lot more we can do with phones by broadly thinking about productivity. So this is not about just a Word or Excel on your phone, it is about thinking about Cortana and Office Lens and those kinds of scenarios in compelling ways. And that's what, at the end of the day, is going to drive our differentiation and higher-end Lumia phones.",282

You put up another quarter of pretty impressive metrics, gone up to 5.6 million Home Premium users. I think the commercial side grew -- I think it was 98% year-over-year. And, Satya, you talked about some pretty meaningful download numbers as far as -- on the iPad. I wonder if you can just give us an update on Office 365, sort of how it's doing versus your expectations and sort of what your expectations are over the course of the next 12, 18, 24 months as we continue this transition.",98

In terms of versus our expectations, in this quarter, it did do better than we expected. And frankly, we had quite lofty goals. So I think that is encouraging. And I think I talked about some of those key drivers in the prior question. When I think really about home and personal, because we haven't had a chance to talk specifically about the consumer usage, and you sort of referenced Office on the iPad in your question, I think it's really about continuing to make the subscription value, whether it's through the home SKU or the personal SKU, have the most value to a user. It's about a user having the opportunity to access Office, the world-leading productivity app, on the device of their choice, having it light up the very best on Windows devices and having that accrue back to our subscriptions. And so I think our ability to execute on that over the past, I guess, 18 months that we've had these SKUs in market is quite encouraging. I don't really look to Office on the iPad as one item. It's a part of a value proposition that I think we make both in the Consumer segment, as well as in the Commercial segment.",208

The -- first of all, I believe the category that Office is in, which is productivity broadly for people, their groups, as well as organizations, is something that we are investing significantly and seeing significant growth in. On one end, you have new things that we are doing like Cortana. This is for individuals on new form factors like the phones, where it's not about any single application but an intelligent agent that knows everything about my calendar, everything about my life and tries to help me with my everyday tasks. On the other end, it's something like Delve, which is a completely new tool that's taking some -- of what is enterprise search and making it more like this Facebook News Feed, where it has a graph of all my artifacts, all my people, all my groups and uses that graph to give me relevant information to discover. Same thing with Power Q&A and Power BI, it's a part of Office 365. So we have a pretty expansive view of how we look at Office and what it can do. So that's the growth strategy. And now specifically on Office renewals...",237

In terms of Office on the consumer side between what we sold on-prem, as well as the home and personal, we feel quite good, with attach continuing to grow and increasing the value prop. So I think that's to address the consumer portion. On the commercial portion, we actually saw Office grow, as you said, this quarter, I think the broader definition that Satya spoke to of the Office value prop. And we continued to see Office renewed in our enterprise agreements. So in general, I think -- I feel like we're in a growth phase for that franchise.",111

That's -- it's a really competitive market. It feels like, ultimately, you need to be a very, very meaningful share player in that market to have value for a developer to leverage the universal apps that you're talking about in terms of presentations you've given and built and so forth. And I'm trying to understand how you can do both of those things at once. And in terms of responsibly making the market for Windows Phone, it feels difficult given your nearest competitors there are doing things that you might argue are irresponsible in terms of making their market given that they monetize it in different ways.",136

So one of the beauties of universal Windows apps is it aggregates, for the first time for us, all of our Windows volume. The fact that even what is an app that runs with a mouse and keyboard on the desktop can be in the store and you can have the same app run in a touch-first, in a mobile-first way gives developers the entire volume of Windows, which is 300-plus million units as opposed to just our 4% share of mobile in the U.S. or 10% in some countries. So that's really the reason why we are actively making sure that universal Windows apps is available and developers are taking advantage of it. We have great tooling because that's the way we are going to be able to create the broadest opportunity to your very point about developers getting an ROI for building to Windows. So that's how I think we will do it in a responsible way.",160

You've got enterprise, you've got consumer less than 9 inches for free, the offering that you mentioned earlier that you recently announced.

The reality is that we actually did not have 1 Windows. We had multiple Windows operating systems inside of Microsoft. We had 1 for phone, 1 for tablets and PCs, 1 for Xbox, 1 for even embedded. So we had many, many of these efforts. So now we have 1 team with a layered architecture that enables us to, in fact, one, for developers, bring that collective opportunity with 1 store, 1 commerce system, 1 discoverability mechanism. It also allows us to scale the UI across all screen sizes. It allows us to create this notion of universal Windows apps and Bing coherence [ph] there. So that's what more I was referencing. And our SKU strategy will remain by segment. We will have multiple SKUs for enterprises, we will have for OEM, we will have for end users. And so we will be disclosing and talking about our SKUs as we get further along. But this -- my statement was more to do with how we are bringing teams together to approach Windows as 1 ecosystem very differently than we ourselves have done in the past.",200

So that's why having this 1 team that thinks about Outlook.com, as well as Exchange helps us think about those dual use, same thing with files and OneDrive and OneDrive for Business. Because we want to have the software have the smarts about separating out the state, caring about IT control and data protection while me, as an end user, get to have the experiences that I want. That's how we are thinking about harmonizing those digital life and work experiences. On the hardware side, we will continue to build hardware that fits with these experiences. If I understand your question right, which is how will we differentiate our first-party hardware, we will build first-party hardware that's creating categories. A good example is what we have done with Surface Pro 3 and in other places where we have really changed the Windows business model to encourage a plethora of OEMs to build great hardware. And we are seeing that. In fact, in this holiday season, I think you'll see a lot of value notebooks, you'll see clamshells. So we will have the full price range of our hardware offering enabled by this new Windows business model. And I think the last part was how will we monetize. Of course, we will again have a combination. We will have our OEM monetization. And some of these new business models are about monetizing on the back-end with Bing integration, as well as our services attach, and that's the reason, fundamentally, why we have these 0-priced Windows SKUs today.",309

That's where, at least, for me, much of the upside came. We haven't seen server product revenue growth in the mid-teens in a while. Total Microsoft bookings, 20%, x Nokia, haven't seen that in ages. Perhaps the answer to these questions are related. But what's happening with those 2 numbers to drive the upside? I'm sure a little bit came with Azure being strong, but that's relatively small. So clearly, there was an inflection up on the on-prem Server Tools Business. Maybe part of it was renewal rates. And if that's the answer, how much room do we have to go on that?",116

Overall, we've had a major revamp of our server lineup, SQL 14 being a recent one, which we launched in the last quarter. And it's the strength of our server products. I mean, this is that phenomena where our servers are becoming -- or have become much more competitive, Windows Server for virtualization and private cloud, Systems Center for data center management, SQL for all the in-memory workload capabilities it has and BI. All of that has really benefited from us running our own cloud, pushing our own servers to run these at-scale services. And with that being in place and these refreshes, we are seeing increased investment and interest on our infrastructure when it comes to data centers. One of the things is as the public cloud is growing, we, in fact, don't see it, at least for now, as a zero sum. In fact, we see growth, especially with the virtualization rates, because people are not -- overall, the number of applications on mobile side are growing. All of those mobile applications drive back-end compute and storage. And that back-end compute/storage, some of it goes into the public cloud, but a lot of it even goes into the data center. And that's where we have a very good price performance equation and a TCO equation. And so we are being pretty competitive in grabbing share. And a Hyper-V share is a good example of that.",247

Overall, my comments remain the same. I answered this even in the last call, which is the approach we have taken is a balanced approach and a thoughtful approach. We're going to look at our own need to invest in order to drive growth in the opportunities we see. I think today's conversation and results show how some of the bets we have made with our cloud are paying off. And it's great to see that momentum. And it's, in fact, a pretty broad-based momentum across Azure, Office 365, and Amy mentioned it very briefly, even CRM Online growth. So to me, that remains the core, which is being able to place our capital to drive organic growth and, for the long term, health of this company.

Good afternoon, everyone. 3 months ago, I outlined how Microsoft is the productivity and platform company for the mobile-first, cloud-first world. Since then, we have galvanized around this direction and are executing well. I'm proud of the results we have delivered this quarter across all businesses. Results are up in every category from commercial to consumer to hardware. With $23.2 billion in revenue for this quarter, we are off to a great start to the year.
More importantly, we are also pleased with the progress we have made in evolving our culture to be fast, innovative, partner-friendly and customer-obsessed. As I reflect on this past quarter, there are 4 important indicators of progress that I want to highlight: cloud, Windows, hardware and finally, I'll talk about our ecosystem momentum.
First, our cloud offerings continue to grow at a rapid rate. More people and organizations are signing up and we are generating more revenue across both commercial and consumer customers. Our commercial cloud revenue grew 128% year-over-year, the fifth consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth. In fact, we are the only company with cloud revenue at our scale that is growing at triple-digit rates. And 80% of the Fortune 500 are now on the Microsoft cloud. Office 365 commercial seats nearly doubled. 2 out of every 3 new customer seats are premium versions. Consumer Office 365 now exceeds 7 million subscribers, up more than 25% for the last quarter alone. 
We continue to invest in growing our leadership position in areas with great opportunity. To that end, we are expanding our Data Center capacity to meet demand, provide the best customer experience, enable data sovereignty and deliver continuous innovation. Azure is seeing robust growth because of our unique approach as the only hyperscale public cloud provider with enterprise-grade capability and true private cloud and hybrid cloud offerings. 
We continue to add new features and capabilities faster than ever based on user feedback cycles. One major Azure service or feature is released every 3 days on average, opening up many more new user scenarios for our customers. Our premium services on Azure create new monetization opportunities in media, data, machine learning and fast analytics and enterprise mobility. More than 60% of the Azure customers are now using at least one of these premium services such as Enterprise Mobility Suite, which is off to a very fast start. Startups and ISVs love our open and flexible approach and are building on Azure at a rapid pace. In fact, 40% of Azure revenue now comes from startups and ISVs.  Even with our tremendous growth in public cloud, we are still seeing strength in our on-premise businesses with double-digit growth across Windows Server, SQL Server, System Center and Dynamics. This is because of the unique hybrid and private cloud capabilities that are built into our servers.
The second indicator of progress is the improvement in the overall health of the Windows ecosystem in the first quarter. We introduced and expanded set of Windows offerings, which help drive consumer unit growth in quarter 1 and will provide incremental opportunity for use of Microsoft services such as Bing. With these new offerings, OEMs are delivering exciting new devices at extremely attractive price points, including Windows PCs at $199 and below.
In September, we took the first steps in publicly sharing more about the next generation of Windows. Windows 10 will unlock new experiences for customers to work, play and connect across an incredibly broad set of devices, with screens from 4 inches to 8 inches and even IoT devices. Windows 10 will deliver a single unified application development platform, one way to write a universal app across the entire family of Windows devices and one store with a unified way for applications to be discovered, purchased and updated across all these devices. Think about it, with Windows 10, developers can build one app that spans billions of devices. 
When I talk about putting customers at the center of everything we do, it's especially true for Windows. We're incorporating customer feedback earlier than ever in the development cycle, especially with our enterprise customers. This will be the best Windows release ever for businesses. And with hundreds of thousands of pieces of feedback flowing into the team already, Windows 10 will be the most collaborative version of Windows we have ever shipped.
Third, I want to highlight some specific markers of advancement in hardware and gaming. Across the entire hardware portfolio, I am encouraged by the reception from customers and are continuously improving execution. Surface had strong results this quarter. Driven by positive customer response to Surface Pro 3, the product lineup is the right one and customers are responding favorably. Surface Pro 3 is now in 28 markets and importantly, we have improved the business economics of this product line.
With phone, we have moved quickly to integrate the business. We are executing on all of the restructuring changes we talked about in the last quarter while driving Lumia share growth. We saw modest growth over the prior year driven by sales in Europe, where we gained share with lower-priced devices.
Now let's talk gaming. As I previously said, gaming is an important category that will drive additive business value for Microsoft. It is the single biggest digital life category measured in both time and money spent across devices of all types. We launched Xbox One in 28 markets, increased console unit sales from a year ago and grew users of Xbox LIVE apps by more than 20%. The acquisition of Mojang, which we expect to close in November, extends our ecosystem and community across multiple platforms. Minecraft adds to our already strong portfolio of first-party games and content, such as Halo, and will strengthen our gaming experiences on PCs and consoles as well as cross-platform monetization. 
The fourth and final area I want to focus on today is the renewed energy and momentum in our partnerships. As a productivity and platforms company, we create vast opportunity for our partners. We're moving fast to extend our platforms and tools to reach more customers through partnerships. From SAP and Oracle to Salesforce, Adobe and IBM to the latest partnerships we announced this past week with Docker, Cloudera and CoreOS, great partnerships emerged from great products, strong momentum and a shared enthusiasm about our long-term vision. Technology leaders across the board recognize the customer value inherent in products like Office 365, Azure and Windows and they want to align their businesses with our healthy and growing ecosystem.  You will see more partnerships in the months ahead. It's the best way to deliver the best possible experience for our customers in today's heterogeneous mobile-first, cloud-first world.
In summary, I'm pleased with the progress we are making. Teams all across the company are rallying around our core focus to reinvent productivity and create platforms for a mobile-first, cloud-first world. We will continue to drive the changes that will position us for the future. We will be accountable to our customers, partners and shareholders and we will be relentless in looking for areas to invest for long-term growth.
With that, Amy will go through our Q1 results in detail and share our outlook for Q2 and then I'll join her for Q&A. Thank you very much.",1215
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 23, 2014",2014-10-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3324.0,708916.0,31308562.0,Presenter Speech,Amy Hood,,Executives,3,"Thanks. And good afternoon, everyone. As Satya said, we had a very strong start to the fiscal year. We made meaningful progress with improved execution across all our businesses. I am encouraged by what we have received -- achieved and believe we are well-positioned for the future.  
With that said, let me take you through the financial highlights of our first quarter. Revenue was $23.2 billion, up 25% over last year and up 11%, excluding phone. Earnings per share were $0.54, which included an $0.11 negative impact from integration and restructuring expenses. Excluding that impact, EPS grew 5% to $0.65, even after considering the impact of the Phone business on profits. 
We are accelerating the pace of decision-making and taking decisive actions to improve how we operate. This approach is reflected in the progress we've made in restructuring the company and integrating our phone business. As a result, we incurred charges of $1.1 billion this quarter. Geographically, we saw strong performance across the U.S. and Europe and consistent with Q4, a more challenging environment in China and Russia.
Let me now discuss our results in greater detail. Our commercial business had another strong quarter. Revenue grew 10% and unearned revenue grew 12%. Renewal rates were higher than what we've seen in recent first quarters. And in Office, 1/3 of renewals included Office 365. Importantly, we are seeing a mix shift from on-prem to the cloud, from transactional purchasing to annuity and from standard to premium versions.
Our commercial cloud services continued their exceptional trajectory with another quarter of triple-digit growth. We're investing in higher level services and new scenarios in Azure, enabled by the scale, cost and flexibility of the cloud and these services are expanding our addressable market. We're adding new users and, importantly, growing revenue from existing on-prem customers who have adopted Azure services. Our on-prem Data Platform infrastructure products continue to have strong momentum, with an ongoing shift to premium versions. Revenue from premium SKUs was up 25% this quarter.
Office 365 had another terrific quarter and remains on path to becoming the unparalleled leader for cloud-based productivity apps. CIOs are selecting Office 365 as the centerpiece of their hybrid productivity solutions as they look to meet the growing mobile needs of their employees. SMBs are also realizing the benefits of Office 365 and as a result, are moving from transactional purchasing to subscription. And as Satya mentioned, we're seeing good partnership momentum as other companies look to integrate Office 365 into their products.
Turning to Windows. Windows OEM Pro revenue performed in line with the business PC market and volumes were more consistent with those seen before the XP refresh in fiscal '14. Windows volume licensing grew 10% as business customers continue to value the platform security and manageability. During the quarter, we took important steps to grow Windows usage and improve the health of the ecosystem. Both our existing and new OEM partners are bringing to market an expanded set of device offerings at more competitive price points. Channel inventories are higher than they were last year, reflecting confidence from our OEM partners heading into the holiday quarter.
IP licensing revenue declined this quarter as our licensees sold a higher mix of low-cost devices, which generated lower per unit royalty. Consumer Office revenue, inclusive of our subscription offerings, grew 7% this quarter. Within this, we saw an accelerated transition to Office 365 Home and Personal, which contributed to a decline in traditional Office license revenue. Overall, it's important to note that we continued to grow attached to customer devices.
In Bing, revenue is driven by both volume and rate growth. We again delivered double-digit monetization gains driven by investments in relevant and ranking algorithms. These improvements keep us on the path to Bing profitability in fiscal '16. And consistent with prior quarters, display revenue remained under pressure.
We are excited by Surface Pro 3 performance, as unit sales are pacing at twice the rate of what we saw with Pro 2. We're seeing strong interest from students, professionals and, increasingly, enterprises, who are replacing their laptops and tablets with Surface Pro 3 for their productivity needs. Gross margin for Surface was positive this quarter.
Within gaming, our results reflect a growing console market, our improved competitive position with the new Xbox One SKU and the launch of Xbox One into new geos, including the initial channel fill for the launch in China at the end of Q1. As we head into the holiday season, we're looking forward to the differentiated content that will be available on the Xbox platform, including Sunset Overdrive, which launches in late October; and Halo: The Master Chief Collection, which launches in early November.
In Phone Hardware, the focus of the quarter was on positioning the business for the future and we remain committed to reaching breakeven in fiscal '15. As part of our restructuring efforts, we started rightsizing our manufacturing capacity, created one development team to accelerate the pace of innovation and focused our sales and marketing efforts on Lumia, which grew in several key markets. Sales of non-Lumia phones were down, driven by declines in the underlying feature phone market as well as portfolio rationalization as we execute on our phone strategy. Gross margin this quarter included the benefit of nonrecurring items resulting from our business integration efforts. 
Operating expenses were favorable to our expectations as we chose to redeploy spend to projects occurring later this fiscal year. These decisions reflect our disciplined assessment as we prioritize where to best allocate our resources. Importantly, we continue to invest in developer and customer-facing roles to capture the opportunities in key growth categories such as the Cloud, Big Data and the Internet of Things.
Our effective tax rate was 23% this quarter, influenced by the changing mix of our business as well as NDS operating losses and restructuring charges, some of which are not tax-deductible.
This quarter, we had $1.3 billion of capital expenditure. We continue to expand the capacity and locations of our data centers to deliver higher service levels, reduce latency and help meet local data compliance requirements for our global customers. Importantly, even while making these investments, we continue to grow the gross margin of our cloud business.
This quarter, we increased our capital return by 19%, with $4.6 billion returned to shareholders through buyback and dividend. As we said in September, the board and management continue to assess our broader capital allocation strategy as we focus on increasing long-term shareholder value.
With that overview of the current quarter, let me now turn to our outlook for the second quarter, starting with foreign exchange. Foreign exchange did not have a material impact on our Q1 results as movements were relatively late in the quarter. The following guidance is based on current FX rates. And should the U.S. dollar continue to strengthen, it will create headwinds in our foreign transactional business. The impact of FX in our annuity business will first be reflected in deferred revenue, as it is based on rates when the contract is built and then into the P&L at that same rate as the revenue is recognized.
Now moving on to guidance, starting with Devices and Consumer. In licensing, we expect revenue to be $4.0 billion to $4.2 billion. Remember, in Q2 of last year, we recognized about $650 million of revenue from our commercial agreement with Nokia, which has ended. Our revenue recognition for the agreement was heavily weighted to Q2 based on contract terms. COGS were recognized ratably over the course of the year. Consistent with the current quarter, IP licensing revenue will reflect lower per unit royalties with the changing mix of devices sold by our licensees. 
With the addition of Office 365 consumer services in Japan, the transition from traditional licensing to a subscription service will negatively impact revenue by approximately $100 million in Q2.
We expect the ongoing business PC refresh cycle to continue. The comparables are challenging as we begin to see the benefits of XP end of support in Q2 of last year. We expect that the consumer PC market will remain stable, with many of the same dynamics we saw in Q1.
In Computing and Gaming, we expect revenue to be $3.5 billion to $3.8 billion. This range reflects growth in Xbox One consoles over the last year but a mix shift to lower-priced SKUs announced last June. With the momentum we are seeing with Surface Pro 3, we expect units to grow sequentially.
In Phone Hardware, we expect revenue to be $2.0 billion to $2.2 billion. This range anticipates both year-over-year and sequential growth in Lumia units, driven by the 500 and 600 series devices. As a result of the ongoing market dynamics and our portfolio rationalization, we expect both volumes and ASPs of non-Lumia devices to decline in Q2.
In Devices and Consumer Other, we expect revenue to be $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion, which includes growth from Office 365, the launch of Halo: Master Chief Collection and continued monetization gain in Bing.
In Commercial Licensing, we expect revenue to be $10.8 billion to $11 billion, which includes a slight drag from prior year's estimated XP impact. With the accelerated shift to our cloud services, we expect Commercial Other revenue to be $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. Overall, we expect our fundamental strength in our commercial business to continue.
And in Corporate, we expect about $300 million of positive revenue impact next quarter as we recognize prior period deferrals related to bundle offerings.
We expect COGS to be $9.5 billion to $9.9 billion, with variability driven by both hardware segments.
We expect second quarter OpEx to be between $8.6 billion and $8.8 billion. As I mentioned earlier, our Q1 favorability was primarily driven by the timing and our continued prioritization of activities. Therefore, we still expect full year operating expenses to be $34.2 billion to $34.6 billion, as we remain committed to investing and prioritizing growth areas where we have customer momentum.
Over the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect to incur an additional $500 million of expense related to our restructuring efforts. This results in total charges of roughly $1.6 billion, the high end of the range we provided in July. Separately, we are reducing our anticipated integration expenses down to $100 million per quarter for the remainder of the fiscal year.  As a reminder, other income and expense includes dividend and interest income, offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. We expect these items to generally offset one another. We now expect our full year tax rate to be between 20% and 22%, including the impact of integration and restructuring.
In Q2, we expect CapEx to sequentially increase in support of our growing cloud business.
As you know, we typically see a decline from Q1 to Q2 in our unearned revenue balance. This Q2, we anticipate a slightly higher sequential decline in our noncommercial segments. This is primarily due to the $300 million impact from revenue recognition in corporate that I referenced earlier. We expect commercial unearned to be in line with historical trends, with some of the benefit of our business model transition to annuity offset by FX rate impacts.
In closing, this was another quarter of continued growth and disciplined execution. Across the company, we're making thoughtful data-driven decisions to continually assess and prioritize our resources. We are also investing to accelerate momentum in key strategic areas and to capitalize on emerging trends. We are making great progress in reshaping our company and I'm encouraged by the opportunities to continue to create long-term shareholder value. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Chris and we can move to Q&A.",1954

Overall, what we see is the increasing competitiveness of our products. I think that's really what's reflected in our results. The cloud story, I think, is fairly clear at this point. The combination of Office 365 as well as Dynamics CRM in particular, combined with Azure, are driving our cloud growth. As it turns out, the technology that we build for our cloud is what we incorporate in our server products. In fact, our R&D expense is the same expense. And that's made our server products very competitive. And so again those are traditional competitors, we are seeing significant share gains across the entire infrastructure line of our server products in particular. And we've also architected our cloud very differently. We are one of the only -- we are the only hyperscale cloud provider that also thinks of our server products at the edge of our cloud. So some of the hybrid capabilities of our serves [ph] have increasing attach and that's also leading to our overall competitiveness as well as monetization and margin. And so those are the trends we see in our numbers. We live in the same macro environment as the rest. But right now, we are confident about our competitiveness driving our results.",210

We talked pretty extensively about the customer case studies at our cloud event last week and it turns out that we have ISVs in many cases driving new applications on top of Azure. There are businesses like, for example, NBC that are reinventing their business models on top of Azure. We have customers using us for true hybrid 
[Audio Gap]
dev test for Azure is the workload. But at this point, I would say we have emerging ISVs, some of the global ISVs building their SaaS applications on top of Azure, driving a significant amount of growth, new businesses and new business models emerging on Azure as well as hybrid, which I would say are driving. One of the other categories that I see a lot of lately is IoT. And the way we participate, just on the Azure side -- we obviously participate even with our Windows Embedded, but on the cloud side, we are seeing the attach to our emerging machine learning services as well as advanced analytics. That's another place where we are well-suited for some of the emerging use cases.",197

Clearly, nice gross margin improvements across the board, but you did mention some onetime items. So I was hoping you could help us understand where you're seeing sort of underlying gross margin improvements, particularly if we look at sort of any improvements that you saw in the phone gross margins as well as the big improvement we saw in the cloud gross margins. How much of that should we look at as durable on a going-forward basis?",82

Let me start with the cloud and then I'll move to your phone question. Overall, in the commercial business, I think we continue to see gross margin improvement. And that is sustainable improvement as opposed to I think what you characterized as some nonrecurring things that I had mentioned. It continues to be improvements in scale, improvements in our infrastructure, improvements in utilization, really strong work across all of our engineering teams here. And so I think our year-over-year improvement as well as sequential improvement and our ability in the overall commercial business to see the gross margins we did as the mix shifts to the cloud, I think we're all quite proud of. On to the Phone business, where I did call out nonrecurring items due to the business integration expense, I don't -- an easier way, frankly, to think about that, Keith, is our Q4 gross margin and our Q1 gross margin. Q4 was a little depressed, is how I would think about it, due to some of the restructuring. Q1 is a little bit higher. A more blended rate of those 2 is probably a better way to think about a go-forward margin. Although when you're transitioning any business and all the hard work that we're doing here to prepare ourselves going forward, I do expect to see some volatility in that number.",228

Specifically, in Office 365, the overall product depth and breadth is continuously improving. One of the great benefits of Office 365 that our customers get to enjoy is that as we innovate and launch new features, they get to use them as soon as we have got them deployed on our cloud. And so that's what's driving the -- both the competitiveness as well as usage of Office 365 and, quite honestly, the full consumption of what we build and which I think in the long run is super important to us and our customers. But it also turns out, some of the server products that we have, as we are seeing increasing adoption of the cloud, we still have, as I said, very competitive server products. I mentioned a lot of our infrastructure server products. But take something like Lync. It's a fantastic product. It is again gaining share in the marketplace. It's getting deployed in on-premise solutions. So it's the combination that's driving our growth. The other dimension we are seeing is Office 365 is a cross-platform cloud service. We've seen our coverage across all devices and that leads to customers still using the service even more. So that combination of effects, competitive server products, very competitive cloud service with new features being added all the time as well as cross-platform is what's driving our growth.",240

Our Office transactional business was down this quarter. And the difference, as you said, to get to the 5% growth is clearly the growth in Office 365 all up. The other place that I think always I like to point to in terms of triangulating when I look at the health of the overall transition is renewal rates. Our renewal rates are amongst the highest we've had in a Q1. Both our ability to recapture both the contract as well as the revenue and the value and add services is higher than it has been. In addition, we're seeing premium units added more frequently in the cloud than we have on-prem. In those types of mixes, you'll see both a bookings number as well as in the unearned balance growth. And so while the exact dollars in and out in any given quarter may be difficult, I guess, to triangulate on the components I always look to, to see health, I've outlined there specifically in the Office business.",205

I think that Office transition, our analysis suggests that, that's a net benefit from here for you. I'd like, Satya, some thoughts maybe about the transition for the rest of the business. If you've got Server & Tools at some point, I mean, it continues to show really terrific growth. At some point, I suppose that becomes cannibalized by your cloud business with Azure. Maybe, Satya, if you can share how you think that transition, how long, how does it transpire, any thoughts. And should it be net additive to the revenues and operating income as we've seen on the Office side? And maybe if you could talk on Windows as well. It looks like it was OEM down a little bit this quarter, which has -- had been growing. Are we going to see lower ASPs with these $200 devices coming out this fall?",154
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 23, 2014",2014-10-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3324.0,708916.0,31308582.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,23,"Let me talk a little bit about the dynamics you're seeing in particular with our infrastructure servers as well as Azure because it is actually pretty unique, I think, to at least our product offering. As I said, our servers have become much more competitive because of the same technology investments that we are making in our cloud. And the use cases that we see in the cloud, in many cases, happened to be net new workloads. IoT was not driving our server growth traditionally. Mobile back-end was not driving our servers traditionally. So machine learning and advanced analytics are areas we did not participate even in the past. So one of the things that we are seeing is a lot of new use cases of Azure, which were really new greenfield territory for us. And it turns out that the need for more computing, more storage and more infrastructure server products is much broader than just even the hyperscale public cloud. Because the one thing that is true, as there are more devices, is that you need back-end. And that back-end, in many cases, in regulated industries with the geo participation we have, is needed everywhere. So one of the things that we are, in fact, very focused on is enabling others to build their own cloud. So our private cloud premium SKU mix is also growing. You see that in our results. So at least in the intermediate time frame, we do not see cannibalization. We see more impact of these hybrid private as well as public clouds all being complementary and of course, being used together to deliver more value to customers and that's where our competitive advantage comes from. On the Windows side, just to finish off, we wanted to make sure that we have competitive Windows ecosystem participation across all price points. So we made some deliberate changes to our business model. And that is, in fact, playing out in the marketplace, where we now have very competitive full Windows PCs less than $199 going into this holiday season. And that, in fact, in Q1 caused the market to expand. That was really by design and so we are happy to see that. And so on a blended basis, of course, the ASPs will be different because of the 2 ranges. So but overall, that's what our goal is. We want to be able to make sure that we compete on all price points and overall grow the volume.",415

And I'm wondering how important it is for you, kind of medium and long term, to be able to get things like Bing, Xbox LIVE and Office 365 running on the same infrastructure as Azure in terms of getting the kind of scale you want and ultimately driving the margins to where you want it to get to. Are those -- is that sort of a prerequisite to get to where you'd like those margins to be?",103

And in fact, a lot of the core Azure technology around machine management and Data Center management comes out of our green efforts. We manage all of the supply chain of all of this as one supply chain. We do a SKU design as one SKU design. We drive costs of both network storage, compute down altogether. In fact, you should think of Azure as the common fabric of all our applications. And you look at even some of our games, like Halo, have significant usage of our cloud and that's what's really driving some of the economics. In fact, the first -- the fact that -- I celebrate the fact that we don't have just one first-party workload because it's very easy for one first-party workload to completely co-opt, if you will, the architecture of a cloud. But in our case, we have a very diverse set of workloads. We have Xbox LIVE. We have Office 365. We have Dynamics and Bing. And that diversity is what allows us to build, in fact, for our own needs, a cloud architecture that then can meet many more workloads and that's working pretty well for us.",218

And so that's what I think Amy's comments also reflected and that's what we expect to have happened in the rest of this fiscal year. The thing that, Heather, we are focused on is how do we make sure that not only do the incremental value that we have today on Windows 8 gets adopted, there are, in fact, lots of use cases, especially around field devices, mobile workforce, where we are, in fact, seeing great adoption of Windows 8. But Windows 10 is something that's completely optimized for the enterprise and across all screen sizes, for the mobile worker as well as the desktop and large screens. Perhaps one of the most unique things about at least our portfolio and our innovation is that we think that it's the mobility of the individual, not the one device, that is important in the enterprise. And that's what we are building towards with great management and great security. And so we are pleased with the early feedback we are getting from the first disclosure of Windows 10 and as well as some of the successes we are having with Windows 8 adoption in the enterprise. But the adoption, I think, will get back to a normal PC refresh in the enterprise.",223

21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 23, 2014",2014-10-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3324.0,708916.0,31308591.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,32,"I mean, for us, the biggest opportunity is to be able to get into spaces. I mean, one of the things that I always think about is for all the success we've had in our server business, we were a low share player. And when I look at the total IT spend of -- that enterprise customers have today, as I said, we've not participated in many, many areas. I'll bring up even the data stack. We have a very good business in SQL Server. We have perhaps the most competitive SQL Server product ever in SQL 2014, which is growing nicely. But if you look at what is secular in terms of growth going forward, it's data, data management in a variety of new ways. So those are the opportunities we want to be able to take advantage of by doing some good work, both in the public cloud as well as with our server products. The challenge will always remain, at the end of the day for us, to make sure that we are bringing together unique offers. One of the things that I want us as a team to be very focused on is to bring uniqueness that only Microsoft can bring into the marketplace. That's why this approach around platforms and reinvention of productivity, I believe, is what we can do, that, for sure, we're going to have credible competition. But at the same time, I think that you if you ask anyone, at least in our campus, whether we deeply get what it means to reinvent productivity, I believe so. Do we get deeply how to take the various constituents from end users to IT and developers and harmonize their interests in unique ways so that enterprises can adopt solutions? We get that deeply. So to me, staying with that and staying focused on our unique contribution is perhaps both our opportunity and our challenge and we will obviously index on the opportunity side.",329

And it feels like the consumer side of the house is pulling away much faster. And obviously, you've got some implications for how you look at the business in terms of margins and how they could potentially inflect in the future. If you can just give us your thoughts, Satya, on how you see that business mix, that will be great. I'm also wondering, Amy, if you could shed some light on cost controls. And what were the things that specifically the company engage in? Because sales and marketing expense came in at a nice surprise, much lower than we expected.",136

So the way I see the market when we sort of talk about productivity and platforms, we really don't make this big distinction between consumer and enterprise. And when it takes productivity, we are very focused on dual use. In fact, one of the pieces of data that Amy and I shared was the growth in the consumer subscriptions of Office 365 even sequentially grew by a significant percentage. So therefore, we are seeing good adoption of our productivity services, specifically in the context of this dual use where people want to use it at home and people want to use it at work. And that's where, in fact, a lot of our R&D investment is to make that very seamless. So to me, that's how I view on a drive. And gaming is the one category we have said that we will invest in it for its own sake in driving enterprise value out of our gaming. There are, in fact, lots of benefits which come because of technology. In fact, the reason why we are so competitive now in Cortana and speech recognition, which I think is core to productivity, is we started with Kinect and Xbox. So we'll always have those kind of incidental benefits. But really, in gaming, we want to have our first-party gaming, Xbox LIVE, console and as well as PC gaming thrive and drive our incremental value for us. And Minecraft obviously helps in that context. So that's how we'll view the future for how we think about our businesses.",259

I think what is perhaps most impressive is that we have managed to continue throughout the quarter, whether it's week-to-week or month-to-month, to look and ask, where is the highest ROI we get from our spend? How can we drive our business forward, both in period but also for the future? It's just as important for us to balance that and I think we've done a very good job of picking those places and really investing intentionally and aggressively behind places where we know we're differentiated.",113

Amy, just thinking through your guide by business segment, everything seems roughly in line, but for the D&C Licensing guide, which implies, I think, a 24% year-over-year decline and given that, that's a 90% gross margin business, I just want to make sure I understand what's happening there. And I have two questions. I'm wondering if you could help disaggregate how much of that is due to the tough XP-related compare versus some other perhaps onetime issues that make for a tough comparison. And then secondly, when, in your best judgment, do you think that D&C Licensing revenue might turn positive?",104

Karl, thanks for asking that question. It gives me a chance to reiterate how many of those components are a bit onetime in nature. The first and the largest issue is the end of the Nokia commercial agreement. That's about $650 million that we earned in Q2 of a year ago that because of the end of the agreement simply goes away. So I'll start with that point. The second component relate to the same trend we saw in our IP business that we saw in Q4 -- I mean, in Q1, we're doing and seeing again in Q2. So I would also see that exact same trend line and assessment. The next component, which is a change, is we have actually launched some of our Office 365 consumer services in Japan, which is a geo that we had not been in historically. That does result in a revenue deferral. It will end up in unearned, but that's about $100 million impact that we would not have seen before that. And so by the time you move all of that out of the comparison group, you really get back to very similar trends in our D&C Licensing business that we saw this quarter for what I think are the components you are focused on, which is OEM Pro and OEM non-Pro, which we expect to really resemble the results we saw this quarter and marry and sort of match the PC business dynamics overall.",245
