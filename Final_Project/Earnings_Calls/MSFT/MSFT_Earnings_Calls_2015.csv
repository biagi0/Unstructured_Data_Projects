Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll focus my top line thoughts on our progress this quarter and the progress we are making in transforming our business. This quarter, we reached $26.5 billion in revenue, with an operating income of $7.8 billion. This quarter's results show the product and business transformation underway at Microsoft. We saw success in a number of our strategic areas, including cloud adoption, redefining and revitalizing the Windows ecosystem and improving economics in our hardware portfolio.
We also saw some challenges this quarter. As expected, the onetime benefit of Windows XP end of life PC refresh cycle has now tailed off. Additionally, we ran into unexpected issues in select geographies. Where there are execution issues, we will address them. Where there are macroeconomic challenges, we will weather them. With that in mind, I'll walk you through the quarter.
Let's start with our cloud business, an area where we are extending our leadership position and accelerating our innovation. In commercial cloud, we saw continued customer and revenue growth across a growing footprint of cloud services: Office 365, Azure, Enterprise Mobility Suite and Dynamics CRM Online. In fact, this quarter is the sixth consecutive quarter of triple-digit revenue growth in commercial cloud, and we are now at a run rate of $5.5 billion. Azure services continue to grow in appeal to enterprise IT and developers with rapid improvements across hybrid services, premium cloud storage and virtual machine offerings, enhanced data and data analytics offerings.
Microsoft Enterprise Mobility Suite is one key area of product innovation that I would like to highlight given the growth and the uniqueness of this offering. Microsoft offers a comprehensive solution for all devices that brings together mobile device management, mobile application management, hybrid identity management and data protection into one unified offering through EMS.
Office 365 now includes new application experiences on all phones and tablets for mobile productivity. Further, we have released completely new scenarios. This includes Office Sway for visualizing and sharing ideas, Delve to help search and discover content, Office 365 Groups to make it easier to collaborate, Office 365 Video for secure media streaming for businesses.
Finally, we continue to invest in enterprise value by integrating MDM and Enterprise Mobility Suite into Office 365, new encryption technologies, compliant certification and new e-discovery capabilities in Exchange.
In Dynamics CRM Online, we added 53 markets this quarter, bringing us to 130 markets around the world. We are bringing together CRM with Cortana, Yammer, Power BI and Skype to add unique value to customers.
We're expanding our capabilities in the cloud through 5 new acquisitions. Last week, we announced an agreement to purchase Revolution Analytics, the leading provider of statistical computing and predictive analytics, which will enable our customers to unlock Big Data insights. We bought HockeyApp, a leading mobile app testing and development service to enhance Azure services for mobile developers. Our acquisition of Aorato accelerates our ability to give customers unique security capabilities by tapping into behavioral intelligence around identity and access spanning on-premise and the cloud. We're bringing on new capabilities in machine learning as applied to e-discovery and other enterprise compliance processes with the acquisition of Equivio. And we also welcomed Acompli, a provider of innovative mobile email applications for iOS and Android. The common theme across all these acquisitions is advanced data analytics and machine learning-driven capabilities that improve with more customer adoption and usage of the cloud.
We're also making progress in our consumer cloud services. Office 365 Home and Personal revenue grew nearly 150% year-over-year as we added 2.1 million net new subscribers since last quarter. Bing U.S. search share continues to grow as does Search revenue, with 23% growth this quarter. I will talk about our progress in Xbox LIVE later in my comments.
Now let's turn to Windows. To start, the overall Windows ecosystem is driving more innovation. Over the holiday season and at CES, our partners showcased a diverse lineup of Windows devices, including more premium device choices than ever. Last spring, we made a strategic decision to introduce new Windows pricing programs to drive unit growth in opening price point PCs as well as tablets. And this quarter, we saw year-over-year growth. Also, businesses continue to value Windows. We are seeing healthy demand for Windows Pro even though we face challenging prior year comparables in Q2 as well as in the second half of the year, following the Windows XP end of support related PC refresh.
Now let's talk about Windows 10. Last week was an important milestone on our path to release Windows 10 and usher in an era of more personal computing. The heritage of Windows was about enabling one single device, the PC. With Windows 10, we're building a device platform for the mobile-first, cloud-first world. It's a world where the mobility of a person's experience is paramount, requiring a platform that spans devices from small screens to large screens to no screens at all. It's a world where interacting with technology is as natural as interacting with other people. And it's a world that demands trust and security. It is also a world with rich opportunity for developers. And Windows 10 will be the most attractive Windows development platform ever. With our free upgrade offer and with universal application and unified store for developers, we'll have a large unified up-to-date user base to target.
We want people to love Windows and have made this our most collaborative project yet, with more than 2 million insiders giving us feedback every day. I'm very optimistic about Windows 10.
We're making progress with our own devices, both those in the market today and also the ones that we have recently announced.  This quarter, we surpassed the $1 billion revenue mark with Surface for the first time. The value proposition of being the most productive tablet is resonating.
Further, the sales for Lumia phones topped 10 million units, growing 30% year-over-year this quarter, with strength in devices such as Lumia 500 and 600 series, our affordable smartphones. In this segment of the market, the combination of our brand and value stand out, and we plan to continue to build a beachhead here.
We're also creating new device types that open up new markets and opportunities for Microsoft. In October, we launched our first wearable, the Microsoft Band. And just last week, we revealed 2 new hardware with Windows 10, Microsoft Surface Hub and Microsoft HoloLens. Microsoft Surface Hub will revolutionize group collaboration in meetings. HoloLens and Windows holographic computing will make mixed reality applications part of everyday life across work and home.
I want to talk briefly about Xbox. Xbox One console adoption accelerated this holiday and was the top selling console in the U.S., and fans on Xbox LIVE were engaged with the service more than ever before. However, it's our strategies coming together with Windows 10 that give me the greatest optimism. The vibrant social gaming community on Xbox LIVE will span Xbox, Windows PC, tablets and phones. With Windows 10, gamers on a PC, tablet or Xbox console can play together, and games on Xbox One can easily stream to a Windows 10 PC or tablet. It's also getting clear how games people love today will evolve to mind-blowing experiences in the future when designed for mixed reality that Windows 10 and HoloLens create. Just imagine what's possible with Minecraft. Gaming truly is a valuable part of millions of people's lives, and Microsoft will excel and increase our lead.
Before closing, I wanted to share a few thoughts on capital allocation. Over the past several quarters and certainly with last week's Windows 10 announcements, you've seen us unleash new innovation in our cloud services with Windows and our hardware. We did all of this without materially growing our cost base. This required clarity in purpose and value proposition, realignment of talent and disciplined execution. Our increasing innovation and competitiveness in today's growth markets and the creation of new categories is how we will most positively impact the returns for our investors.
Earlier today, we announced our intention to complete the existing $40 billion share repurchase authorization by December 31, 2016. This is another step in our ongoing commitment to increase capital return for our shareholders while investing in the growth of our business. It too shows our optimism for the future growth of Microsoft. As we move forward, we will certainly continue to be thoughtful in our capital return decisions, balanced across dividends and share repurchases.
In closing, I'm encouraged by the progress we are making in our transformation to become the productivity and platform company for the mobile-first, cloud-first world. I'm proud of how our teams are stepping up to both change and execute to make this transformation happen. I'm confident of the decisions and choices we are making to drive our business and products forward to serve our customers and partners in the future.
With that, I'll hand over to Amy to go through the quarter's results in further detail and share our outlook for the next quarter. I look forward to rejoining you after that to answer your questions. Thank you.",1527
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2015",2015-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3786.0,748987.0,32826402.0,Presenter Speech,Amy Hood,,Executives,3,"Thanks, and good afternoon, everyone. As Satya shared, in Q2, we again made solid progress on our business transformation. We had strong growth in our cloud and subscription businesses. Our annuity renewals were healthy as customers remain committed to our enterprise portfolio [ph]. And our hardware products performed well during the holiday season. As we expected, our year-over-year growth rates were impacted by the prior year benefits that we realized in our OEM and Office transactional businesses following the Windows XP end of support refresh cycle.
Beyond that, our results in China and Japan fell short of our expectations. In Japan, the PC market lagged due to their macroeconomic environment along with the combined impact of XP end of support and the VAT increase last year. Our Office attach rate to PCs is very high there, so our -- so the weak PC market also impacted Office revenue.
With that said, let me take you through the financial highlights of our second quarter. Revenue was $26.5 billion, up 8%, and would have been 1 point better without the impact of foreign exchange. Gross margin grew slightly this quarter, even when comparing against the year ago that benefited from the XP refresh cycle. Our commitment to ongoing execution improvement and thoughtful portfolio management helped to improve the gross margin percentage in each of our operating segments.
Operating income declined 2%, which included $243 million of integration and restructuring expenses. Excluding that, operating income grew 1%.
Our reported GAAP earnings per share was $0.71, which included a $0.02 negative impact from integration and restructuring expense and a $0.04 income tax charge for an IRS audit adjustment. Foreign exchange had a $0.01 negative impact on EPS.
As we discussed last quarter, FX movement first impact our bookings growth and unearned revenue on our balance sheet. Our contracted but not billed balance was adjusted down to reflect current FX rates. Therefore, our bookings were flat this quarter.
Unearned revenue was up 9% year-over-year to $21.2 billion, but the sequential decline was slightly larger -- slightly higher than we expected due to the larger-than-anticipated impact from FX. Adjusting for that FX impact, our commercial unearned balance was in line with historical trends and our expectation.
From a geographic perspective, relative to our expectations, the U.S. outperformed and Europe was generally in line. As I mentioned earlier, China and Japan were below our expectations.
With that backdrop, I will now move to a detailed discussion of our results. Last year, we ended support for Windows XP. That stimulated a PC refresh cycle, in particular in developed markets and with business customers. During the period from Q2 through the end of our fiscal year, Windows Pro revenue growth was over 10% and meaningfully outpaced business PC growth. As expected, in Q2, PCs have reverted to a more normalized mix between developed and emerging markets and Pro attach to business PCs has returned to the levels we saw prior to FY '14. Also, to drive revenue growth in academic institutions, we lowered the price of Windows Pro for that customer segment. This pricing change, along with the impact of XP, caused Windows revenue growth to be lower than the relatively stable business PC market we have seen since the end of FY '13.
We again grew Windows non-Pro licenses and saw year-over-year growth in activations. This was driven by particularly strong demand for opening price point PCs related to the strategic decisions Satya spoke of earlier. The hardware mix shift to opening price point PCs impacted license mix and therefore, aggregate revenue per license in the quarter. The mix shift was the main driver of our Windows non-Pro revenue decline.
Inventory in the channel is a bit higher than normal, which we expect to work through in Q3.
Office consumer products and services revenue declined 12% and was impacted by the ongoing transition to Office 365 and by the dynamics in Japan, where PC growth was lower than we expected in a geography where the paid attach of Office is high. Adoption of Office 365 Home and Personal remained strong, and we now have over 9.2 million subscribers.
In our computing and gaming segment, we are proud of the continued progress we are making in our Surface portfolio. Strong interest in Surface Pro 3 helped to drive record revenue as well as improved gross margin. Surface Pro 3 volumes are pacing over 3x the rate of what we saw with Surface Pro 2.
In gaming, Xbox One was the console sales leader in the U.S, Xbox LIVE users grew, and those users increased their purchases of third-party publisher content and consumables. Sales of the Xbox platform exclusives, Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Forza Horizon 2 were strong. And in this quarter, we welcomed Minecraft.
We articulated our plan for the phone business back in July and we are executing to plan. With our Lumia portfolio of phones, we are driving volumes in the low price device category. We sold 10.5 million Lumia phones this quarter, an all-time high. We also sold over 39 million non-Lumia phones even while we make changes to the product portfolio and manage this business for profitability. We are looking forward to bringing new products to market that will showcase the features that we presented at our Windows 10 event last week.
Revenue in our Devices and Consumer Other segment grew 30%. As noted earlier, Xbox LIVE transactions and first-party games performed well and contributed to this growth. Additionally, Search revenue growth was strong, with improvements in both rate and volume. Within display, revenue declined on our MSN portal though we saw revenue growth across other Microsoft properties. We are also pleased by our gross margin expansion in this segment.
Transitioning now to our consumer results where revenue grew 5%. Our annuity revenue remained strong, growing double digits, and renewal rates remained high. Customers are continuing to move from transactional purchasing to long-term annuity contracts as they show an increased commitment to our product road map. Our transactional revenue declined over 15%, slightly more than we expected, primarily in Office, and mostly due to our performance in China and Japan, which I detailed earlier. Additionally, FX had a greater negative impact on commercial revenue than we had anticipated.
Our commercial cloud services delivered triple-digit revenue growth for the sixth consecutive quarter. Office 365 continues to be priority for CIOs as both existing and new customers move to the cloud. This transition accelerated, with 45% of our renewal seats in Office moving to the cloud this quarter. We are seeing great growth in revenue from premium Azure services, driven by both the increase in customer base and an expansion in the number of services that those customers deploy. Within Dynamics CRM Online, customer growth accelerated and revenue nearly doubled.
From a product perspective, commercial Office product and services revenue declined 1%, slightly below our expectations. Annuity revenue remained strong, with high renewal rates and continued adoption of Office 365. Within our Office transactional business, year-on-year comparables are difficult given the benefits from last year's XP refresh where customers chose to update their desktop productivity solutions along with their PC.
Additionally, the shift to Office 365 continues to impact transactional revenue. While these dynamics were consistent with our expectations, revenue in China and Japan both fell short given the factors that I noted earlier.
Server products and services revenue grew 9%, again outpacing the broader IT market. Growth in premium mix helped to drive double-digit revenue growth in SQL Server and Systems Center. Windows Server annuity revenue grew double digits again this quarter, but transactional revenue was down, primarily due to a decline in traditional server market. Additionally, we are pleased with the performance in our Dynamics business, which grew revenue 13%, driven by growth in both on-premises and cloud offerings.
Operating expense grew 1% to $8.3 billion and was favorable to our expectation. These results are inclusive of investments that we made in our strategic growth areas, a few of which were showcased last week at a Windows 10 event. Excluding approximately $750 million from the addition of NDS, operating expense would have declined 8%. Relative to the guidance that we provided for the quarter, roughly half of the favorability resulted from FX changes, with the balance driven by our continued prioritization of spend.
Our integration and restructuring efforts have been focused on optimizing resources across the company, which includes reducing the expense base in our phone business. To date, we have integrated the manufacturing and supply chain teams across Microsoft, while also rationalizing our phone manufacturing capacity. In operating expense, we committed to reducing $1 billion from the phone cost base, which we have done. We continue to look for opportunities to drive further efficiencies.
Our effective tax rate was 25% and higher than expected due to previously mentioned income tax charge for an IRS audit adjustment. Beyond that, the increase was driven by the inclusion of phone results and our changing geographic mix.
Capital expenditures were $1.5 billion, driven primarily by investments to increase our capacity as we expanded existing and added new data centers, as well as made server purchases in support of our fast-growing cloud business.
This quarter, we increased our capital return by 5%, with $4.5 billion returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. And as Satya reinforced in his comments, we will continue to take thoughtful steps to increase capital returns to shareholders with a focus on value.
With that overview of the current quarter, let me now turn to our outlook. Our guidance is based on our current view of FX rates. Should the U.S. dollar strengthen beyond those assumptions, as it did this quarter, we would see additional negative impact to earnings, revenue, our balance sheet and our contracted but not billed balance. As a reminder, in our annuity businesses, the FX impact is first reflected in unearned revenue, which is recorded at the rate when the contract is billed. Then, revenue comes on to the P&L at that same rate as it is recognized, generally over the next year. Therefore, in Q3, we will start to recognize a higher percentage of revenue from periods with a stronger U.S. dollar than the prior year comparison. In total, we expect that FX will negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 4 points in Q3. The majority of this impact is in our commercial business.
In FY '14, it was our Q2 through Q4 results that most benefited from Windows XP end of support. As such, our growth rates across Windows Pro and transactional Office will be impacted as our business moves back to pre-XP levels.
On a geographic basis, we expect year-on-year revenue declines in China, Russia and Japan. In Japan, Q3 represents an even tougher comparison with the anniversary of the VAT, which again will create different comparables -- difficult comparables in Windows and Office. We currently expect that the geographic dynamics, challenging comparables from XP and FX headwinds will be in place throughout the remainder of our fiscal year.
With that overall background, let me move to our specific Q3 guidance, starting with Devices and Consumer. Our revenue guidance includes approximately 4 points of drag from FX.
In licensing, we expect revenue to be $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion. This range assumes the more challenging comparables I mentioned earlier. The range also includes a reduction in channel inventory for Windows non-Pro opening price point PCs.
Within Consumer Office, we expect to see similar trends to Q2. And within our IP licensing business, we expect lower per unit royalties with the changing mix of devices sold by our licensees.
In Computing and Gaming, we expect revenue to be $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. This range reflects normal seasonality coming out of the holidays for our Xbox and Surface businesses.
In Phone Hardware, we expect revenue to be $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. This range anticipates accelerating year-over-year growth in Lumia units, driven by our affordable smartphone devices. We also expect both volumes and ASPs of non-Lumia devices to continue to decline in Q3.
With this lower aggregate revenue base, we expect gross margins, which include noncash amortization, to be lower for the next couple of quarters.
In Devices and Consumer Other, we expect revenue to be about $2 billion, reflecting continued progress in key areas like Office 365 Home and Personal, Xbox LIVE and Search.
In our commercial business, we expect our significant momentum in annuity and commercial cloud services to continue. Within our Commercial Licensing segment, we expect revenue to be $9.7 billion to $9.9 billion. In addition to the factors that I discussed which impact our year-over-year comparability, we anticipate a 4-point drag from FX.
In commercial other, we expect revenue to be $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion. Even after considering the impact of FX, growth will remain robust with expected momentum across our commercial cloud portfolio, Office 365, Azure and CRM Online. And in corporate, we don't expect any revenue impact.
As we continue to work towards the launch of Windows 10, we will share additional detailed information regarding any accounting impacts from the Windows 10 Free Upgrade Offer and Windows as a Service. I would like to reiterate that our OEM royalty model, which is paid upfront, will remain in place.
We expect COGS to be $7.1 billion to $7.4 billion with variability driven by both hardware segments. We expect third quarter operating expense to be $8.2 billion to $8.4 billion. We are lowering our full year guidance to $33.2 billion to $33.6 billion, which reduces full year growth, including NDS, to 4% to 5%. Our Q3 plans include investments in advertising and customer-facing roles to continue to accelerate our momentum, with commercial products such as SQL and the cloud. These investments are a direct result of reprioritization decisions made during H1.
Over the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect to incur an additional $200 million of restructuring expense. This results in total charges of roughly $1.4 billion, which is lower than our previous guidance. Separately, we still expect integration expense of $100 million per quarter for the remainder of the fiscal year.
As a reminder, other income and expense includes dividend and interest income, offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. Given the current FX environment, we expect other income and expense to be negative $100 million in Q3.
We now expect our full year tax rate to be between 22% and 24%. This includes the Q2 income tax charge for an IRS audit adjustment as well as the changing geographic mix of our business.
In Q3, we expect CapEx to sequentially increase in support of our growing cloud business.
Unearned revenue will continue to benefit from customers moving to our subscription services and high contract renewal rates. We expect to see low single-digit sequential decline in our unearned for Q3, which includes 1-point drag from FX as new billings will reflect the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar. Our commercial unearned balance will follow recent historical seasonality when adjusted for FX.
In closing, this quarter was another example of the progress that we are making across this company. Our execution continues to improve, and we are making data-driven decisions to inform our investments both shorter term, as you have seen in our marketing and sales adjustments, as well as for the longer term, as we adjust our product portfolio. There are certainly short-term comparability challenges as we anniversary last year's XP refresh cycle and see the impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar. But we are confident in the underlying health of our business, proud of the significant innovation we are funding within our prioritized operating budget and excited to continue gaining share in key strategic markets.

Why don't I talk a little bit about that from a math perspective, and I'll let Satya add from some of our engineering improvements, which I think are important. Mark, as I talked a bit about, we've seen a mix shift as we have moved Office 365 and Azure to our premium service and to premium SKUs within our cloud environment. That is one of the drivers that helps improve margin growth. In addition, we've done a lot of hard engineering work, I believe, over the past 6 quarters to be able to take advantage of more utilization and capacity over time. And I'll let Satya maybe add a little bit technically.",113

The other one is what I talked about in the Enterprise Mobility Suite. That's really got fantastic momentum in the marketplace because the solution has really come together and is fairly unique, as well as Dynamics CRM. So these have all got different profiles in terms of margin, and they're all now pretty high growth businesses for us. So when you think about our cloud, you got to think about the low-level infrastructure. Even there, we now have premium offerings. And then, we have higher level services. So that aggregate portfolio is what helps us move up the margin curve.",126

Obviously, there's a very direct impact, which we talked the most about, in terms of Windows Pro, and its mix would attach to business PCs. The other important component of that was when people bought a PC, as we talked through the year, they often took the chance of whether generally in the business segment, which impacts in our world Commercial Licensing as a reporting unit, to buy Office and generally on a non-annuity basis. So if you think about that being the next major transactional type purchase, that was driven a year ago as the first externality. The second was in Windows VL. We also saw non-annuity purchases in Windows VL, which again is in our Commercial Licensing segment. So if you think about it from a product portfolio, it really is Windows and Office. If you think about it from our reporting segments, it's the D&C Licensing segment as well as our commercial licensing segment and specifically, our transactional revenue growth year-over-year.",203

It's -- I actually think of it as a general concept. I think we are trying to invest behind opportunities where we see them. Some of those are more public as we talk about in terms of our sales and marketing adjustments or ad campaigns that we run like the commercial cloud. Others, I think, you don't have the opportunity to see until we launch products like we did last week, where we were able to re-assort our product portfolio and really move our talent to invest in, I guess, mind-blowing is the word Satya used in terms of product portfolio in that way. So I'm not sure that all of it, Brent, I would say is across a line in that way. There's sort of short-term optimization and longer-term portfolio optimization, that I think we've talked about this before, I think the entire senior leadership team use it as an opportunity to think about where we can best innovate and drive the highest value of every dollar that we invest. And I think we've made great progress as a team. And I think you're seeing that both in the long-term guidance and then frankly, our day-to-day execution through the quarter.",204

We have in China currently a set of geopolitical issues that we are working through. We are very committed to China as a market. We have, in fact, pockets of good growth in China, with our cloud doing fairly well. But at the same time, we are grounded that in the fact that we need more work to do, and we are working through them. And then, as and when they'll work out, we'll let you know.",86

And Walter, to answer your question, I don't have any concerns to that expand, such that it's a unique issue beyond Japan. With the Windows end of XP plus the VAT increase, I do think -- as well as some of the macroeconomic environment, it tightened far faster than we had anticipated. And Japan, in particular, because of its model for us, it is a non-annuity geography for us. So impacts in Japan more directly come to the P&L as opposed to on our unearned or CNB balances. And that's why this quarter, you saw some weakness in Commercial Licensing. But when adjusted for FX, our unearned balanced and bookings actually felt quite good from a commercial perspective.",127

I think with all products, I think about the complete sales cycle. And I'm really encouraged by the fact that we are doing a good job of moving from the initial sales through deployment, through adding on services and back to renewals. And I think the importance of that customer life cycle is really how we think about our workloads and our workload health in the cloud. The workload that we're furthest along on is obviously Exchange. It happens to also come with directory implementation. And so we generally think of a fast deployment [indiscernible] and then adding on workloads and premium workloads to the cycle. And then, as you might imagine, that provides an interesting environment for us to add on some of the products actually that Satya mentioned very directly in his comments such as EMS or Enterprise Mobility Suite. So while I think there's always a lag, the actual goal is the commitment that the customer showed to the movement to the cloud and then moving them quickly as we can, but also at their own pace through deployment.",184

And just trying to sort of better understand the dynamics between what we see in the marketplace. When we look at industry analysts that we're looking at basically sort of flat to slightly down unit growth and the down 13% OEM that -- revenue growth that you guys are seeing. Some of this is mix and some of this is ASP. I was wondering if you could help us with a little bit more color in terms of exactly what that ASP dynamic is going on in terms of these lower entry-level additions, was that due into the overall ASP of what you're able to extract from the market?",121
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2015",2015-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3786.0,748987.0,32826426.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,27,"Thanks, Keith. I'll take the opportunity actually to do it for both Pro as well as non-Pro because I wasn't sure which category you were talking about. Let me start at the highest level, which is if I look at industry analysts as well as many of our peers in the ecosystem, I actually think we agree with most of the benchmarks in terms of PC unit health across business, which has been stable since FY '13, and across consumer, where we've seen meaningful progress made in unit growth both last quarter and especially this one. So then I'll take a second and talk about sort of the distinction between the revenue growth versus the unit growth. Let me start first in Pro. There, there are really 2 key dynamics. The first is the return to the XP levels that we saw prior to the XP refresh. They are consistent. The dynamic mix in terms of emerging markets and developed as well as enterprise sizing is not an ASP problem in Pro. It is a return to the attach level we saw before. The component that actually has impact -- the second component in Pro that is a ""ASP/mix"" comment is the academic licenses that I referred to earlier, where we did lower the price and saw an increased unit number. So that was a second component of the revenue piece, but the larger component was the XP reversion. And again, that's not an ASP comment. When you come to non-Pro, I think this really refers back to Satya's comments, which is we saw device growth in low-priced devices opening price points. We actually made, I believe, a strategic decision to increase our ability to put devices on the shelf, especially at retail, at prices under $200 to $249, it's how to think about the price points that were the most impacted. We do have the Windows with Bing SKU there. It is a lower RPL than our traditional non-Pro OEM license. But I do believe it drove meaningful ecosystem health and well -- and as well drove good competitive dynamics in the channel. And so overall, while it did have an RPL impact, which does explain, along with mix shift, the minus 13% in non-Pro OEM versus the PC license growth that we saw, I think really Satya covered the actual logic to that in terms of overall ecosystem health, which we feel quite good about.",407

One of the things that I feel very good about is the risk we took to introduce the 2-in-1 category. And I feel now that we see that, in fact, inspire even a lot of activity in our own OEM ecosystem.

As I said in my remarks, I'm very optimistic about what Windows 10 means for our customers, partners and Microsoft. The core idea of Windows 10 is to build a device operating system that spans the gamut from no screens to small screens to PCs and even large screens. In fact, if you look at our innovation, we are perhaps unique in the large screen innovation that we are doing with Surface Hub, HoloLens, as well as some of the 2-in-1 form factors. So overall, I think the most strategic objective for us is to get developer momentum with Windows 10. And that's where we are focused in on with a lot of different actions. One is the one unified developer platform, which I think of as perhaps the most strategic piece of Windows 10 with -- along with the unified store. And now, couple that with the call we have made to provide an upgrade offer. We are creating a great opportunity for every developer to write these universal Windows applications that will run on the desktop as well as on our phone and tablets, as well as on Surface Hub and, in fact, HoloLens runs universal applications. No one else provides that kind of a unified marketplace for developers. And especially the changes we have made to the desktop user interface means these universal applications are, in fact, very naturally discoverable right where we have high usage, which is the desktop. So that's the combination of things that we think are going to play out effectively. And of course, we are in beta right now or previews right now and getting daily feedback across the length and breadth of Windows 10. But overall, I'm very optimistic of what it means both as a platform as well as a set of end-user features.",309

Obviously, that continues to show strong growth. You've been calling out the cloud business, whether it be Azure, Office 365. But I just want to double-click on the Azure side. I wonder if you could help us parse through sort of the Infrastructure as a Service and the Platform as a Service side and the trends there, and any sort of joint benefit, I guess, that you're seeing of being able to offer both those 2. And also, Satya, as this business does scale and then, Amy, I'd love you to chime in here too, how do you think about the gross margin and just operating margin characteristics, once again as the revenue just continues to grow here?",128
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2015",2015-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3786.0,748987.0,32826434.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,35,"Thanks, Phil. So let me start. Overall, what we are seeing is, clearly, there's increased usage of Infrastructure as a Service because a lot of people will move an existing workload into the cloud. But the interesting thing that happens once you move your initial workload is you build around it, especially, for example, if you move a VM with some data into the cloud, you may want to use the same data to build a mobile front-end. And that's when you are starting to use some of our Platform as a Service components, like our Azure Mobile Services, Azure Media Services. So we see the combination. And there's -- they're not all happening coincident, but there is time lag in it. But therefore, that's one of the reasons why we want to be very aggressive in getting the workloads onto Azure, both storage and compute. And even in the storage and compute, we now have premium offerings for higher SLA, for higher performance, higher VM sizes. And then on top of that, we have these managed services, which have a different margin profile. So Media Services, Mobile Services, Web, which is another place where we actually have a lot of traction. And then that's all just on Azure. Once you get beyond Azure, you have things like CRM Online, you have Enterprise Mobility Suite and, of course, the Office 365 lineup. And when we think about our capital and, in fact, the core infrastructure, we don't have different infrastructure for these different services. It's one common infrastructure and one common data center footprint between O 365, Azure, CRM, Xbox LIVE, everything. So that's why utilization of that entire infrastructure is how we think about, even total return on invested capital for our cloud business.",295

So in our commercial business, I think we've done a very good job of continuing to outpace IT spend on an overall basis and continuing to push customers to our annuity business, whether they're on-premise or the cloud. That is our strategic goal as well as impacts in both segments. Now let me talk about sort of uniquely Commercial Licensing and how to think about it. While I won't give specific guidance, I will talk about how to think about the impact, in particular, from XP. Our transactional revenue will have a headwind from XP. That doesn't and it shouldn't be interpreted as customers not continuing to be committed or not committing to move to annuity over the longer term which is exactly, I think, the question that you're asking. And so while we have a comparability issue that will show itself most directly as weakness in Commercial Licensing and, most specifically, as weakness in Office transactional licensing, which will be a headwind, the overall goal of continuing to have more customers every quarter move to the cloud or whether or not they move, adding cloud services even if they have on-prem because they believe in a hybrid model, is actually the structural sort of guidepost we have on a multiyear journey.",227

Satya, I wanted to follow up on Phil Winslow's question earlier on Azure and the use cases there. I mean, in theory, you have a huge opportunity given your installed base on the server side. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing the SMB customer base doing there? Are we kind of in that people trying on bursting or where is that huge customer base in terms of adoption on Azure?",77

One of the products that's doing very, very well for us is the StorSimple product, which is essentially a storage product that cloud tiers virtualization storage from on-premise to the cloud. We also have built now into Windows Server backup and disaster recovery, same thing with SQL Server. So that's the first thing that we are seeing, is increased usage of our servers with the cloud component. Bursting is something for sure a lot of people do, but that's more on the high end because in the SMB segment, the real movement there is more to Office 365. In fact, one of the things in Office 365 is we are getting people to effectively use servers, which now happens to be in cloud, who never bought servers from us ever before because they didn't have Exchange, they didn't have Lync, they didn't have any of the core capabilities of Office 365.

I think we have a freedom to make those choices quickly. And I feel very good both about the decisiveness that comes with it, but also the empowerment that we give people within our organizations to make those calls to increase our performance without waiting to an annual budget process.

In general, I think we're still on the early-ins of seeing the opportunity that we have in that segment. As you point out, there's a couple of components that make gross profit dollars per seat or the lifetime value of a customer, depending on the terms you want to use, improve and increase over the life cycle. The very first thing, and I think Satya even mentioned it, and it's most direct in SMB, is moving from buying a copy of Office, which was a very static concept, to the idea where you could buy Office and, frankly, get all the benefits that those who used to deploy servers used to get only with IT departments of their own. So as you move Office, it's simply the first step. So even though, obviously, it comes at a lower gross margin percentage, our ability to add workloads, add premium services and to increase our overall footprint inside a customer is really where the lifetime value goes up. And frankly, over time, and watching, I think, both the creativity and the pace of innovation we've seen coming out of our engineering teams, particularly in Azure and Office 365 and our CRM team online, I actually even have more confidence in our ability to attach and grow that gross profit over time. We mentioned simply one that didn't exist, I think, Brendan, when we first started having this conversation, which was our EMS suite.

Could you quantify so far to what extent you've seen benefit? And as this plays into the free upgrade for Windows 10, at least for a limited period, how you expect this to play out benefiting the business case of your products across the portfolio?",80

So overall, at the highest levels, our strategy here is to make sure that the Microsoft services, i.e. cloud services, be it Azure, Office 365, CRM Online or Enterprise Mobility Suite, are covering all the devices out there in the marketplace. So that, that way, we maximize the opportunity we have for each of these subscription and capacity-based services. So that's sort of the core rationale for why we are doing cross-platform. Now the next question is what's the uniqueness of Windows? And the uniqueness of Windows comes because we don't think of these services and their application endpoints as apps but fundamentally core to the Windows experience, so we are building them natively into Windows. So for example, when you log into Windows, you are logging in with Microsoft account or Azure, really. When you have files there syncing with OneDrive, Outlook is the email client for Windows. So that's how Windows will differentiate, and not to mention our gaming and Xbox LIVE experiences. So overall, we will build a differentiated Windows because our application experiences for our cloud endpoints will be native in Windows. And at the same time, we'll make sure that our services are available on all endpoints, driving more usage, more subscription growth. So the best way to measure our progress is Office 365 subscription growth, Azure growth and EMS growth.",227

Good afternoon, everyone. Today I'll focus my remarks on our 3 business areas: cloud, Windows and devices. Next week at Build, our developer conference, I'll share more about our ambitions on how our next-generation platforms will empower every person and organizations. 
This quarter, we delivered $21.7 billion in revenue, an increase of 6% year-over-year or 9% in constant currency. We are seeing the impact of foreign exchange, geopolitical trends in certain geographies and product transitions. We're taking steps to respond quickly and adjust our plans as needed while we continue to move forward in our transformation.
Overall, I'm pleased with our business performance. More importantly, though, it's clear that we are well on our way to transforming our products and businesses across all of Microsoft. The early signs are evident in how our customers are using our products, which I'll share throughout my remarks today. 
Our momentum in the cloud is a highlight. Increasingly, customers are choosing Microsoft Cloud services to transform their own businesses. Going beyond just moving existing workloads to the cloud, these results showcase our ability to transform and perform simultaneously. With that in mind, I'll walk you through the quarter, starting with our cloud business.
At the core of our results this quarter is incredible growth across a growing portfolio of cloud services. Our commercial cloud business is a source of strength driven by Office 365, Azure and Dynamics CRM. Our commercial cloud annualized run rate now stands at $6.3 billion, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of triple-digit revenue growth. 
Office 365 is clearly a key growth driver. Like any cloud service, we track how people are actually using it, and we are proud that Office 365 is a vibrant, active service. Right now, there are nearly 50 million Office 365 monthly active users inside businesses. 
Exchange Online alone sees about 60 billion requests per day from all connected clients. About 70 billion transactions are user actions, and there are 830 million meetings a month created in Office.
And we are increasing our Office value proposition for businesses with new mobile device management capabilities built into Office 365 and through our continued commitment to customer data compliance and security. We released new versions of Office Delve for mobile devices. And earlier this month, we rolled out Skype for Business to the Office 365 customers worldwide. Finally, in anticipation of the release of Windows 10, we have announced a preview of new touch-first Office universal app.
Small- and medium-sized customers are adopting Office 365 at a continued rapid pace, led by our more than 65,000 Office 365 partners. 30 telecommunications companies are already offering 365 to small- and medium-sized customers, including some of the largest in the world. In Q3, we announced a new partnership with T-Mobile to bring Office 365 to more customers and enhance our partnerships with GoDaddy. 
At Build next week, I'll talk even more about Office as a platform and how developers can connect into the Office framework to both harness the rich data and have their own application extensions available to ultimately 1 billion-plus Office users.
Azure is also seeing impressive usage momentum. Right now, more than 5 million organizations are represented in Azure Active Directory with more than 425 million identities. Storage is also a strong indicator of consumption, and now we have 50 trillion objects stored in Azure, a 3x growth year-over-year in storage transactions, more than 5 trillion in March alone. And Azure websites are growing with nearly 0.5 million sites hosted.
Beyond strong usage of our existing services, we are excited by the customer response to our expanding portfolio of new cloud offerings. In particular, Enterprise Mobility Suite is growing, and we now have more than 13,000 enterprise customers using EMS. And as customer adoption and usage in the cloud increases, more developers are choosing Azure for their application. Nearly 3 million developers are signed up for Visual Studio Online, up 2x year-over-year. 
To foster developer innovation, we launched Azure App Services this quarter. It offers a powerful set of development tools for creating Web and mobile app backends for any platform or device while enabling integration with other applications including Office 365, Dynamics, Salesforce, Facebook, Twitter, SAP, Oracle, Siebel and many more. 
We also delivered new Azure compute instances this quarter with more memory in storage than any other public cloud provider, attracting more mission-critical workloads to the cloud. And we improved our Big Data capabilities with support for the latest version of Hadoop and Linux in HDInsight and improved disaster recovery with Azure Site Recovery and Backup.
We are seeing significant customer interest and adoption in Azure machine learning and Azure stream analytics, in particular for IoT scenarios. In a world where every company has the opportunity to become a software company, a diverse set of companies like ThyssenKrupp, Toyota, Rockwell, Ford, Fujitsu and Miele are engaging with us in their transformation.
Further, our Dynamics business also has traction in the enterprise. It is now nearly a $2 billion business. Dynamics CRM Online enterprise paid seats more than doubled year-over-year, and we more than doubled enterprise seats sold this quarter for ERP. We also announced the wave of innovation in Microsoft Dynamics CRM this quarter with new social, mobile and analytics capabilities for business process transformation, including seamless integration of Dynamics CRM with Office 365.
While our commercial cloud business is expanding dramatically, we're also seeing strong growth in our consumer cloud services. Office 365 Consumer added an average of 1 million new customers per month, and we now have more than 12 million subscribers, an increase of 35% over the prior quarter.
We're clearly taking Office everywhere. Core to our Office -- a core to our mobile-first strategy is to ensure that our service endpoints are on every mobile device. And to that end, we have seen continued momentum with more than 100 million downloads of Office on iPhones, iPads and Android tablets. And with the release of Outlook on iOS and Android this quarter, updates to our OneDrive application and a preview of the forthcoming Office for Mac, we are making Office more available on to even more users on more devices.
Bing achieved a significant milestone this quarter when U.S. search share topped 20% and search advertising revenue grew 21%. Search is key to productivity in work and life, and it's a huge opportunity for Microsoft as we continue to innovate with Bing across our applications and platforms. On top of that, I'm pleased with our renewed partnership with Yahoo! and our combined ability to compete more effectively in the search marketplace.
Our investments in innovation and user experience in Xbox LIVE are paying off. Xbox LIVE users grew 18% year-over-year, helping drive increased Xbox LIVE usage growth by 30%. 
When I step back and look at Office 365, Bing search and Xbox LIVE collectively, I see real usage growth and monetization of our consumer services all up.
Now let's talk about Windows. To start, our Windows revenue from business customers is stabilizing post the XP refresh anniversary, coming back in line to historical levels. We're also transforming the consumer Windows business to adapt to the changing market dynamics, including lower price point devices. This quarter, while non-Pro revenue declined, activations were up. Importantly, we are now at a place where we can start to see early signs of how usage increases in services like search and gaming can drive new monetization opportunities over the lifetime of a Windows consumer device.
Windows is a tremendous asset for Microsoft with more than 1.5 billion users. This means every day, hundreds of millions of people are using Windows and Windows applications. In fact, more than 16 million unique apps are used on a monthly basis from PCs running Windows 7 and later. 
We are focused on making Windows 10 the most loved version of Windows ever. Perhaps most importantly, last quarter, I talked about how Windows 10 will be a service across an array of devices and will usher in a new era of more personal computing, an era where the mobility of the experience, not the device, is paramount. We look forward to sharing a lot more about Windows 10 at Build next week.
In our device portfolio, Surface adoption continues across enterprise and consumer customers with 44% revenue growth year-over-year. And 64% of Surface Pro 3 users use OneNote, 9x that of any other touch laptop. This shows how great hardware innovation influences customer experience and usage. We're looking forward to Surface 3 availability next month, a device that has received positive reviews for being a superior versatile device at a lower price point.
We continue to demonstrate momentum in the value smartphone segment of the phone market, driving 18% growth in Lumia volume this quarter. However, we need to take further action to reduce our costs across devices as we execute on our Windows 10 first-party hardware plans.
I'm excited that next week, I'll be able to talk much more extensively about our ambitions and the opportunity ahead to 2 important audiences: developers at Build and our investor community at the financial analyst briefing in San Francisco.
Before I turn it over to Amy, I want to close by reflecting on Microsoft's transformation to a company that will thrive and help our customers thrive in a mobile-first, cloud-first world. This is a new world with new growth. It's a world that requires fundamental transformation in products, business models and delivery models across Microsoft.
In 2008, we started our transformation by taking an iconic franchise, Office to the cloud. We took the next big step towards -- forwards 5 years ago when we launched Azure, and another step forward with the recent announcement of Windows 10 as a service. Microsoft's overall transformation isn't about one-for-one shift. It is about delivering new value to more customers and unlocking new growth opportunity. To do this, we will continue to push forward with big ambitions and persistence while delivering solid performance.
With that, I'll hand it over to Amy to talk about this quarter's results in greater detail, and I look forward to rejoining you after to answer questions. Thank you.",1698
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3745.0,793890.0,34586358.0,Presenter Speech,Amy Hood,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our execution in the third quarter. 
In our commercial business, we continue to see healthy underlying fundamentals with strong renewals of volume license annuity contracts, a mix shift to cloud offerings and solid bookings. Importantly, you can see the progress we are making in the execution of our cloud strategy as the percentage of our revenue from annuity contracts in our commercial business continues to rise. 
As Satya highlighted, we also saw momentum in strategic businesses we've been investing in such as Bing, Xbox LIVE and Surface, which have a key role in our plans to further monetize Windows devices.
Like most multinational companies, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar has had a significant impact in our reported results. Accordingly, when applicable, I will give growth rates in both GAAP and constant currency to help you better understand the underlying business demand. 
Revenue was $21.7 billion, up 6%, and 9% in constant currency.
Gross margin grew 1% and 4% in constant currency. We improved gross margin percentage year-over-year in each of our segments again this quarter, reflecting our ongoing focus on operational excellence.
Operating income declined 5%. Adjusting for both integration and restructuring expense of $190 million as well as the negative $87 million impact from FX, operating income declined 1%. 
Earnings per share was $0.61, which includes a $0.02 negative impact from FX and $0.01 of integration and restructuring expense.
As a reminder, FX movements first impact our bookings growth and unearned revenue on the balance sheet. Each quarter, our contracted not billed balance is adjusted to reflect current FX rates. When FX rates move rapidly as they have in the last 6 months, bookings growth can be significantly impacted. This was the case again this quarter as bookings grew 2%. However, when measured on a constant currency basis, bookings grew 9%.
Unearned revenue was up 4% year-over-year to $20.2 billion and 7% in constant currency. Total unearned revenue was slightly below expectations, driven primarily by a stronger-than-expected mix of sales that are recognized in the current period. 
From a geographic perspective, the U.S. outperformed our expectations. This relative strength in the U.S. resulted in roughly 1 point less of constant currency impact than we expected in our commercial business. China, Russia and Japan were generally in line with our expectations. 
I want to touch briefly on what we were seeing in Japan given it's our second largest market from a revenue perspective. Revenue was down $550 million, which is nearly 4 points of growth for the whole company. With high Office attached to PCs, revenue is particularly sensitive to the underlying PC market dynamics. Q3 was the toughest comparable due to both XP end of support and the VAT increase, which went into effect last April 1. The impact is most evident in our D&C and Commercial Licensing segments. The macroeconomic climate remains challenging as well in Japan, and we don't expect this to change in the short term. 
With that backdrop, I will now move to a detailed discussion of our results starting with Windows. Q3 last year was the peak of the XP refresh cycle, evidenced by Windows Pro revenue growth of 19%. This growth significantly outpaced the underlying PC market, driven by higher attach to Pro, particularly with large enterprise customers in developed markets. This quarter, Pro revenue declined by 19% and is essentially flat to our Q3 FY '13 levels as both business PCs and Pro mix in that segment returned to pre-XP refresh levels. For Windows non-Pro, as we talked about last quarter, inventory in the channel was higher than normal. This quarter, activations grew, and we exited Q3 with channel inventories at more normal levels. This channel inventory reduction was the main driver of our Windows non-Pro revenue decline.
We continued to see a mix shift to opening price point PCs, which impacted license mix and aggregate ASP. However, it was significantly less than the impact in Q2 when holiday sales favor lower price point PCs.
Office consumer revenue and D&C Licensing was down 41% this quarter, due primarily to the shift of purchasing toward Office 365 consumer where we now have 12.4 million subscribers. This transition to Office 365 accounted for 27 points of that decline and the impact of Japan's PC market, the remaining 14 points. Excluding Japan, we grew our combined Consumer Office licenses by 10%.
Revenue in our Devices and Consumer Other segment grew 25% and 28% in constant currency, exceeding our expectations. Many of our growth efforts are represented in this segment, and we made terrific progress this quarter across Office 365, Bing and Xbox LIVE transactions. Gross margin expanded again, benefiting from the increased scale in our services. Inclusive of the estimated impact of the Yahoo! agreement reached last week, we remain confident in our goal of Bing profitability in FY '16.
Moving to hardware. Revenue from Xbox consoles declined largely due to a mix shift of Xbox One consoles to lower ASP SKUs as well as the impact of launch supply from a year ago. With Surface, we saw 53% constant currency revenue growth, driven by strong retail sales and attach of accessories.
On phones, we sold 8.6 million Lumia devices and have gained share in key markets such as the U.K. and Germany over the course of the year. Gross margin declined sequentially, driven by lower Q3 revenue and approximately $60 million of negative impact from foreign currency relative to Q2 FX rates. 
We've made significant progress in reducing the operating expense base in the phone business, moving from an annualized rate of $4.5 billion at acquisition to a run rate under $2.5 billion. That said, the changing mix of our portfolio to the value segment and the significant negative headwind from FX will impact our ability to reach operational breakeven in FY '16. In response, we have in Q3, and will continue in Q4, to aggressively focus on our operating cost base by pursuing efficiencies in both COGS and operating expenses. We will focus those efforts across our entire first-party device portfolio even while we expand into new form factors such as HoloLens and Surface Hub.
Now moving to our commercial results where revenue grew 5% or 7% in constant currency. Commercial bookings declined 1% on a reported basis, but grew 10% in constant currency. The underlying health of the business remained very strong despite the negative impact from specific geos and prior year XP comparables.
The transition of our customers to cloud and subscription annuity services is a critical element of our business transformation. To provide ongoing transparency into our progress, we have added a new KPI: commercial annuity mix. This quarter, 82% of our commercial revenue came from annuity revenue stream, which is up 5 points from last year. While quarter to quarter, the mix can vary with uneven growth rates we've seen in transactional licensing before and after the XP refresh cycle, the overall trend clearly reflects the meaningful progress that we have made.
Office Commercial products and services declined 2%, but grew 1% in constant currency. Japan was a 3-point drag. We successfully renewed a large volume of annuity contract expirations in Q3 at healthy levels, in line with historical rates. And we continue to see a strong shift from traditional licensing to Office 365 across our business customers. In each of the last 3 quarters, we have added more Office 365 seats than transactional licenses with SMB customers.
Server products and services continue to exhibit strong momentum with revenue growth of 12% and 16% in constant currency. Our portfolio was well-positioned to meet the needs of our customers for their private, public and hybrid cloud solutions. Adoption of our premium products remained strong and revenue grew 25% across our premium offering for SQL, Systems Center and Windows Server. Overall, revenue from our commercial cloud services more than doubled again this quarter. Enterprise penetration is accelerating with over half of all agreements signed during the quarter, including cloud services. Within Office 365, premium workloads now make up more than 50% of the installed base. And we are seeing strong attach of our Enterprise Mobility Solutions to Office 365. Azure usage grew rapidly this quarter, and Dynamics CRM Online benefited from strong customer growth.
Moving now to operating expenses, which were favorable to our guidance, driven by decisions that we made during the quarter to reduce spending and to continue to reallocate resources to accelerate growth in key areas. For instance, in markets where we are facing challenges, we reduced our sales and marketing expense to reflect the current environment. And as I mentioned earlier in my comments on our phone business, we took further actions to lower our cost base. Across the company, we continue to prioritize and reallocate our spend to activities with the highest impact. The result was that operating expenses grew 4% for the company. Normalizing for the approximately $300 million year-over-year benefit from FX and the addition of $570 million related to phone, operating expenses grew just 1%. 
Our effective tax rate was 24%, which is 5 points higher than last year. The increase is primarily driven by the inclusion of our phone results and our changing geographic mix.
We returned $7.5 billion to shareholders this quarter, which is an increase of $3 billion from Q2. This change is consistent with our objective to increase capital return to shareholders with a focus on value.
With that overview of the current quarter, let me now turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter. I'll start with a few overall comments for additional context. The guidance that we are providing is based on current FX rates. And should actual rates differ, they will be reflected in our financial result. As a reminder, in our annuity businesses, the FX impact is first reflected in our unearned revenue as it is based on rates when the contract is billed and then into the P&L at that same rate as the revenue is recognized generally over the next year. In Q4, unearned revenue will reflect 3 quarters of billings with a stronger U.S. dollar, which will negatively impact year-over-year comparable. Likewise, we will be recognizing a higher percentage of revenue from periods with a stronger U.S. dollar than both the recently completed Q3 and also the prior year comparison. In total, we expect FX will impact revenue growth by approximately 4 points in Q4 with the majority of that impact in our Commercial segment.
While XP-related comparables remain tough for Q4, we are starting to anniversary the XP benefits from last year. And finally, from a geographic perspective, we expect the year-over-year declines in Japan to continue.
With that additional context, I'll now move to more specific guidance, starting with Devices and Consumer. In licensing, in Q4 last year, we recognized $382 million of revenue related to the end of the commercial agreement with Nokia, which will impact year-over-year growth trends. For this Q4, we expect revenue to be $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion. This range reflects the anniversary of XP, the impact of the Japanese economy and an anticipated drawdown of inventories in the PC ecosystem ahead of the release of Windows 10 this summer. 
Within Consumer Office, we expect similar trends to Q3, including the continued transition to Office 365 subscriptions. In Computing and Gaming Hardware, with the addition of Surface 3, we expect revenue to be $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. In Phone Hardware, we expect revenue to be $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion with continued momentum in value smartphones and anticipated declines in non-Lumia phones. Gross margins will reflect similar Dynamics to Q3.
In Devices and Consumer Other, we expect revenue to be $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion with continued growth in Bing, Office 365 and Xbox LIVE transactions.
In Commercial Licensing, we expect revenue of $10.5 billion to $10.6 billion with a continuing shift to annuity. This range reflects roughly 4 points of negative impact from FX in addition to the factors that I discussed earlier.
In Commercial Other, we expect momentum to continue in our commercial cloud with revenue of $3.0 billion to $3.1 billion. And in corporate, we don't expect any revenue impact. We expect COGS to be $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion with variability being driven by both hardware segments.
We expect operating expenses to be $8.4 billion to $8.5 billion. This range implies that our full year operating expenses will be roughly $2 billion below our initial guidance for the year, while still investing in key growth opportunities across R&D and sales.
We have benefited from FX, but the biggest driver has been our ongoing cost discipline and prioritization effort. In Q4, we expect to incur $100 million integration expenses and separately, another $100 million in restructuring expenses. 
As a reminder, other income and expense includes dividend and interest income offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. 
Given the current FX environment, we expect our net cost of hedging to increase and other income and expense to be negative $200 million.
We expect our Q4 tax rate to be 22% to 24%. In Q4, we expect CapEx to sequentially increase in support of our growing cloud business. And we expect unearned revenue will grow sequentially, in line with historical seasonality, excluding the foreign currency impact.
In closing, as you heard from Satya, we are making progress in our strategic goals. And we are seeing our focused investments land in differentiated products, customer usage and sales results. Customers are seeing and embracing our innovation, leading to increased usage of our cloud services and a transition towards subscription and multiyear purchasing. We continue to invest aggressively to capture opportunities where we see competitive advantage, while also becoming more efficient to accelerate our pace of innovation. 
We encourage you next week to watch the webcast of keynotes from our Build Developer Conference. We will share more of the innovation happening with Windows 10 and our cloud services. We'll also host our financial analyst briefing where Satya, Kevin Turner and I will discuss how the company's transformation provides unique growth opportunities that drive increased lifetime customer value across our core businesses. We look forward to share that -- we look forward to sharing that progress with you.

Thanks for the question. Overall, when I think about the Microsoft Cloud, it's really the combination of Office 365, Dynamics as well as Azure. We think about our capital allocation that way. We think about our utilization, product architecture and customer value, in how uniquely we can bring these 3 assets together, to serve our customers well. And that's the momentum you see. And I talked about the run rate, the usage metrics, and there is really increasing intensity of usage amongst organizational customers in our commercial cloud. One of the other things, it's also -- is a huge benefit for us is -- because our cloud, our public cloud runs on our software asset, our software asset gets packaged up as our servers. In fact, I think of our servers as the edge of our cloud. So the unique capability we now have in Windows Server, SQL Server, is becoming that much more competitive because we are running our public cloud in it, and that's what anyone deploying their own private cloud expects to have. And so you see there's 2 sides or benefits in 2 sides for us. One is in our cloud momentum, which, itself, is a combination of SaaS applications, PaaS and IaaS, which I believe is unique in the marketplace, as well as we -- the software itself is packaged up into our public cloud offerings, be it Windows Server or SQL Server, and they are becoming increasingly competitive in the enterprise and data center editions. And so that's what you see in our commercial results, both on the licensing side as well as on the cloud side.",275

It seems like overall revenue between your commercial and D&C for Office 365 is up over 100%. And if you look at the consumer, this user count is up huge, just quarter to quarter there. So my question is sort of -- both Satya and Amy. So Satya, when you think about sort of the positioning and sort of where we are into the adoption life cycle of Office 365 on the consumer side and then, call it the SMB and enterprise, just sort of where we in terms of the inflection point there? And then Amy, how should we think about just sort of going forward in terms of the guidance that you gave, how we should think about sort of the financial applications of where we are in that transition from on-premise to Office 365?",156
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3745.0,793890.0,34586365.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,10,"Sure. Let me start, and Amy, you could take it from there. Overall, I would say there's this secular movement that's happening in particular with Office 365. Quite frankly, it's happening across the entire product portfolio of Microsoft, which is more to what I would describe as annuity relationships, as well as subscription relationships. Because those are the long-term contracts of relationships we want to have with all customers, be it consumer, be it small business or large customers. In all the years I've been at Microsoft, this was always our dream, to be able to sell more of the sophisticated capabilities of Office to individual consumers as well as small businesses. But it was hard to do in the previous generation because of the server infrastructure, and what I would say, sophistication of IT required. Whereas now with the cloud, for the first time, we now can serve both individuals as well as small businesses with the same kind of sophistication that, in the past, was exclusively available for the large enterprises. So that's what you see. When we see our subscription growth in consumer, we see subscription growth in small business, these are folks who never bought a server from us. So that's what we are seeing, is increasing what I would call annuity relationships and subscription relationships with all classes of customers. And it's new penetration, so it's not even a one-for-one replacement. Even for the enterprise customer, their consumption is going up. They may have consumed 1 or 2 workloads. But now, they can have the opportunity to consume the entirety of the portfolio. And not just that, if you look at the products in Office 365 that we have, take e-discovery. It's a complete new space for us, where we are able to do things in security, e-discovery, enterprise management that we didn't even do for the top end of the enterprise in the server side. So that's what we are seeing.",327

Next week, at the financial analyst briefing, I'll spend -- have a lot more time to explain the actual lifetime value of each of these customer segments, especially in Office 365. But I think, in consumer, it's maybe the easiest one to talk about, is that -- we talked about license growth of 10% when you correct for Japan. Our ability to quickly, I think, move our customer base through stronger execution, both direct to retail and having our channel execute well and partner with us on this transition, I do think we've made a lot of progress. And maybe more importantly, we continue to innovate in the product and deliver value to the end-user, which is really what matters. And so I think we'll be able to show the progress we've made over every quarter, and give you some goals going forward. So I look forward to having the chance to spend more time on that in detail. And SMB looks very similar in some ways. They purchase similarly. It was bought with a PC. It was bought 1 time. It was infrequent, with an inability, as Satya said, to add workloads. So I think those are some of the bigger transitions you've seen for us in terms of being able to increase the value. So hopefully, we'll be able to give you more details on that next week.",242

Overall, the core of how I want us to approach expenses is to make sure that we are not limited in our ability to invest in categories where we have unique things to contribute. So we're going to do that, though, with great discipline. And that's I think you've seen us do over the course of the last year, and we'll continue to exhibit that. But at the same time, we will not shrink away from our ability to go put investment, be it in sales, marketing or product R&D, when we clearly we have unique things in secular categories of growth.

First is, I think we have exhibited an increasing ability over the course of the year to reallocate during the year, both at the organization level and at the team level, to make sure our dollars are going to the highest-ROI things. And secondly, I think it's a general belief held at highest levels of the company, that operating efficiency increases our ability to be responsive, both to the needs of our customers as well as innovate faster inside this place.

Let me start. Thanks, Rick. When I think about even just my own day-to-day usage of Office, even in the last year, it's gone through a drastic amount of change. Of course, I use Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook on a daily basis. But if I think about all the tools that I'm using, which is all part of Office 365, today on a daily basis and multiple times a day, I start my day as I've talked about in many conferences with Delve, which is a tool I love, which is in fact something that's uniquely possible because of the shift to Office 365, where we can take organizational data and break through all the boundaries of org and silos inside an organization and have people discover information. It's the richest way for me to visualize what's happening at Microsoft in real time. That news feed for me is sort of the lifeblood of Microsoft. I use Power BI, one of the things that I -- we talked a lot about is usage. In fact, one of the cultural changes inside the company is everyone, from the front-line engineer to the front-line salesperson, is responsible for usage. And given that, we want to have these leading indicators showing up in our dashboard not as static reports. And Power BI is this rich canvas for us to be able to, one, visualize data as well as ask natural-language questions. I look at my own usage of OneNote in Surface. That's gone through a sea change, both because of the hardware innovation: innovation in Windows, innovation in Office. I look at something like Sway, which I'm pretty excited about. Because basically, we are taking the concept of what is an interactive document and a website, and bringing it all together into these Sway documents, if you go, and I'm very excited about what that could mean in customer service, marketing or for school reports. So that's of your -- well into it. So this is not going to be waiting for some future date to release anything that's new, but we are well on our way with all of these tools and they're available today. And we'll, of course, be iterating continuously.",371

And there's disclosure, in fact, in our revenue recognition section in the 10-Q, that talks about that specifically. When we talk about the accounting for Windows 10, I will touch on that next week.

Satya, you can add at the end if you want. It's -- no, I think, Mark, you're reading it correctly. We've actually had our annuity volume licensing business, as you know, has been starting growth and stability for a while. And as we talked about, Pro is back to the pre-XP levels. And while you can see some fluctuation, I think this has been a stable business for us for a long period of time, when you take out that XP bump from last year. Talking about consumer, I think frankly, Satya and I both reflected a bit on it in our comments. We do expect to see some additional inventory drawdown in front of a launch, that's not unusual prior to a launch cycle. And that will clearly impact our revenue in the quarter. But I think as I look to '16, I'm excited about the designs we've seen. I'm excited about the products that are possible with Windows 10. And I think we feel good and are looking forward to sharing some of that excitement next week.",183

The one thing I'd also add is, there is actually a much more fundamental transformation happening, even with how we think about Windows and its delivery. And we'll talk more about this even at our financial analyst briefing next week. Because I increasingly think about the lifetime value we can deliver to the user of a Windows device, be it in consumer, or even in the enterprise. And if you think about -- when we say Windows-as-a-Service, it's actually a pretty profound construct, which involves us being able to not only think about what shifts with OEMs, but how do we, on a continuous basis, if it's the consumer, we have things now in the store. We have subscriptions. We have gaming. And then, when it comes to the enterprise, there is management, security, servicing, which is all unique value. So there is going to be an increasing emphasis in the concept of lifetime value that we can deliver to customers.",162

I would think that most of Office 365, because most people were already on Office, represents transitions from being a -- to a [ph] license model. But so far -- and I know it's still early, but so far, what about the rest? Can you give us an idea of how much of this is new business? And how much of this is transition business?",106

I mean, I think you have to sort of look at all the use cases. In fact, as I said, a lot of the Azure use case, I think you referenced this, has been non-zero sum because people started using their mobile back end, Web back end, using Big Data, not workloads we have. I look sort of every day usage growth, even if they're creating a Web work load, it's for a very different of Web back end on a mobile back end. And the same thing with advanced analytics. I even looked at the growth of virtual machine instances on Azure. We not only see Windows Server obviously, but we see 20-plus percent of Linux growth. So that's again non-zero-sum. So there's significant traction we have in terms of moving beyond just one-for-one shift of a workload that traditionally ran on our server to our Azure cloud. In fact, if anything, the majority of what we are seeing is new. Even on Office 365, it's not just one-for-one shift. Of course, if you are -- we're using as a large enterprise exchange, and you move to Office 365, you move to moving Exchange Online. Same thing is true for Sharepoint. But again, take all the other things I described, Power BI, Delve and the list goes on, take E-discovery. Even for the largest enterprise, these were things that have low penetration or low deployment. And so we're seeing increasing usage of it. Same thing with our Dynamics business. EMS, it's completely a new category. We never had that kind of a management footprint. We now have the ability to have one control plane for IT, for all the devices, identity management, device management, data protection. That's a new workload. So that's what we are seeing. We definitely are seeing one for one migration. But the opportunity in every one of our offerings, from Office 365 to Dynamics to Azure has a non-zero sum component to it.",336

I mean, other than Office 365, did you say the majority of the cloud business is new business? And again, I know that it can't be -- I mean, maybe you know exactly what it is. But I'm sure some of it is somewhat cloudy or -- no pun intended -- or vague. But do you think, most of it at this point is new business? Is that what I heard you say?",82

Because one of the things, IT, as you know, it's not about sort of replacing what you have. It's always augmenting what you have. A very classic scenario would be, I'll take a SQL database application, bring it to the cloud and then, build a new mobile back end using the same data. So reuse of code, reuse of data, so you will use some amount of IAS infrastructure, and then PaaS consumption. So that's one of the very typical enterprise solutions you will see. In fact, our own IT systems, take what we have done with our HR and our financial systems and some of those things as they move to the cloud, we bring some existing, and then add to it.",133

Amazon released their profitability for the first time, I think AWS, and it was, I think higher than most people were expecting. I'm wondering how should we be should think about your mix of business in Azure? You're running Linux. You're running a lot of the services based on Azure software. You're also running some of your own IP there. How should we think about, where your margins are today? And should we think of Amazon's AWS margins as a good benchmark for where you could be at, sort of scaled there out today?",106

I think about the Microsoft Cloud because even the way we do capital, the way we measure utilization is all with the complete unit, which is, of course, all of Office 365 runs on Azure. Azure AD powers all of our cloud. So it's really its entirety that we think of as our unique value. So that means we have SaaS, which is a huge component between O365 and Dynamics, PaaS, which is huge component of Azure itself. We see of many customers who would use even our PaaS services and even AWS. So we, for example, you can, in fact, with a single sign-on, using EMS and Azure AD in Azure, and use your resources on AWS. And then, of course, we have our IaaS business. So that's how we think about it. The -- and then it's reflected even in our margins. So when we look at our cloud margins, they will have -- our revenue quality, which is very different, that's the combination of PaaS, IaaS and SaaS, and that's how we want to make sure we make progress, because that's when both the product value, which is unique to us, and also the quality of revenue that's unique to us. But the one other thing that I -- see, my world view is not that all compute storage networks, it just goes to one place. That's why I think of our servers as the edge of our cloud. And as I said, there's a huge software asset in there, which is becoming increasingly competitive. Of course, we don't count that in our run rates, so when we talk about our $6 billion dollar plus run rate, that's just pure public cloud number. And that's fantastic to see, and we want to measure it that way. But quite frankly, if you sort of looked at what's broadly happening in the cloud transition, we are participating in both the private hybrid cloud as well as the public cloud.",349

I think as far as the low-cost devices, it's pretty broad, I think. We think of the U.S. itself being, in fact, a big driver of some of growth on the consumer side. We are also obviously stimulated this, so that we can be much more effective, even in the educational markets worldwide. And Amy can add to that, if you have any more detail on it. When it comes to our Commercial Licensing, in our servers, it's the same trend, Heather, which is the big shift that's happening is our enterprise and data center products be it Window System Server Centers SQL Server, are more competitive. It's the same thing that I would say at least to the last couple of years clearly have played out. There is clearly -- and in fact, as our products have become competitive, there's been this mix shift. People have bought from us previously just standard editions, are able to now look at our enterprise editions. And that's what's playing out. And there's definitely some pricing action we were able to take, but mostly because we were able to deliver this incremental value. And even with all the pricing action we took, we, from a total cost of ownership or just raw pricing perspective, are very competitive, versus what's available in the market. So that's what we see. And so we cycle [ph] some of the pricing actions, obviously, will anniversary out. But the overall thing that I'm focused on is how can we continue to run our software assets ourselves in public cloud and translate that into our servers, and really paint this vision and make it a reality of hybrid computing and drive the secular growth of that.",290

For example, do you think you have built out data center capacity to support the commercial cloud business all the way to a $10 billion run rate, or a $20 billion run rate? So if there's any way you can help us to try to gauge how much overhead you have in the capacity, and perhaps what type of data center footprint you envision a few years down the road?",97

We have driven significant process improvement to essentially make it as efficient as one can make it, and that's a continuous process for us. So when I think about even the capital allocation per quarter, we very carefully look at what is our current utilization forecast and what our demand forecast is. And we now have the ability to be much more dynamic because surely, there are some things which are long lead, like dynamic -- data center locations. But you don't need to build out data centers much before they're really being utilized. And so we have a very good process, that's still a place where, quite frankly, a lot of the proprietary advantage of someone with an at-scale public cloud provider, with not just with one application. And this is where the huge distinction is, after all, we did run large-scale consumer services ourselves between Xbox LIVE and Bing. But this business of supporting a highly geo- distributed Enterprise Cloud business is very different than just running in one at-scale public cloud service. And we have learned a lot with what is our workload diversity, as well as our geo- diversity. And our supply chain management is optimized for it.",265

Good afternoon, everyone. Today, we will share the results of the final quarter of the year and our optimism for the year ahead. We delivered $22.2 billion in revenue this quarter and $93.6 billion in total revenue for the fiscal year '15, an increase of 8% year-over-year. We pushed forward in our transformation by focusing our investments in areas where we have differentiation and significant opportunity for future growth in large, addressable markets. We galvanized around our mission and ambitions. We aligned our structure to deliver better products at a more rapid pace. We focused our advertising business on search, we focused our mapping efforts on higher level experiences and developer services. We restructured our Phone portfolio so that we can operate more efficiently near-term while driving reinvention long-term. We invested more in new mobile applications like Wanderlust, Acompli and Sunrise. We also strengthened our enterprise cloud platform by acquiring Revolution Analytics, Datazen and BlueStripe in this quarter alone, and we are at the threshold of the Windows 10 launch.
I'm proud of these steps and I'm proud of the results we delivered in tandem. In cloud alone, our annualized Commercial cloud run rate surpassed $8 billion this quarter and the revenue grew 88% year-over-year. We're on a strong trajectory towards our goal of $20 billion in fiscal year '18.
With that as the backdrop, I want to walk you through the progress we are making in each one of our 3 ambitions.
Let me start with reinventing productivity and business processes, including our efforts across Office 365 and Dynamics. We continue to see strong demand for Office 365 and Dynamics products. We now have more than 15 million Office 365 customers -- consumer subscribers, and customers are signing up at a pace of nearly 1 million per month. In addition, we surpassed 150 million downloads of Office Mobile on iOS and Android and have introduced a new version of Office for the Mac. 
In the Commercial space, the number of Office 365 users continues to climb with seats growing 74% year-over-year. Office 365 now is in 4 out of 5 Fortune 500 enterprises and more than 55% of the installed base is on premium workload. It is clear that we have success moving customers to the cloud. Even half of all the Enterprise Agreement renewals were for Office 365 this quarter. 
Small and medium businesses offer one of our best opportunities for new growth in the cloud. In fact for more than one year now, we have seen 50,000 new SMB customers adopt Office 365 every month. Last week at our Worldwide Partner Conference, we announced our new Office 365 premium SKU for business, E5. Now our customers will get rich, new voice functionality in Skype for Business with Cloud PBX and PSTN Conferencing, deep analytics with Dell World analytics and Power BI Pro and advanced security features such as Lockbox and Advanced Threat Protection. With E5, we've expanded our market opportunity for Office 365 by more than $50 billion. This new E5 SKU and the launch of Office 2016 will drive one of the biggest new businesses for us.
Let's now turn to CRM. This market alone is $20 billion-plus and has massive opportunity for reinvention. Mainstreaming Dynamics into our engineering, sales and marketing efforts gives us the ability to participate in this large and growing market in a more meaningful way. Last week, we announced the acquisition of FieldOne, which helps strengthen our Dynamics CRM customer service offering. This quarter, total paid seats for Dynamics CRM Online increased 140% year-over-year, and we have more than 8 million paid Dynamic seats across CRM and ERP in total, up 25% year-over-year. This creates a great foundation for future growth in our Dynamics business.
Next, I want to share our progress in building the intelligent cloud platform with Azure. Again, this quarter, we have seen proof that preference for our cloud SaaS services creates a flywheel of growth for our cloud platform services. In Azure, both revenue and compute usage increased by triple-digits year-over-year. We tripled our revenue from Azure premium services this quarter. In the Enterprise Mobility services, we now have 17,000 customers. Appeal for Visual Studio tools has grown to include developers beyond our traditional base, with some of the decisions we make to embrace open source with .NET and support across platform development. Since November, we have seen more than 5 million downloads of Visual Studio community, the fastest-ever adoption of a Visual Studio product. Visual Studio Online continues to gain momentum with over 3.1 million registered users.
Business intelligence and analytics is another large, rapidly growing market for us with an opportunity of more than $15 billion. We are focused on strengthening our offers in this space. Just last week, we announced the availability of Cortana Analytics Suite, a fully managed big data and advanced analytics solution. We are not only building the tools but are also delivering the insights customers need to transform their businesses.
Security is a key priority for our enterprise customers and another $30 billion market opportunity for us, and we are building capability to meet customers' needs. For example, we made significant investments in security with Azure Key Vault, enabling our customers to protect data in the cloud with secure key management and encryption customers in control. We have 4 new certifications for Azure, bringing our certification and attestation total to 22 globally, more than any other cloud platform today.
Our third bold ambition is to create more personal computing experiences with Windows and our devices. I'm thrilled we are just days away from the start of Windows 10. It's the first step towards our goal of 1 billion Windows 10 active devices in the fiscal year '18. Our aspiration with Windows 10 is to move people from needing to choosing to loving Windows. Based on feedback from more than 5 million people who have been using Windows 10, we believe people will love the familiarity of Windows 10 and the innovation. It's safe, secure and always up-to-date.
Windows 10 is more personal and more productive with Cortana, Office, universal apps and Continue. And Windows 10 will deliver innovative new experiences, like inking on Microsoft Edge and gaming across Xbox and PC and also opens up entirely new device categories such as HoloLens.
Windows 10 will deliver significant value to enterprise customers as well. Windows 10 provides advanced security capabilities with additional features for hardware-based security, mobile work and data protection. It also provides a single device management platform across all devices from phones to laptops to Internet of Things devices. And Windows 10 helps enterprises stay up-to-date with Windows Update for business and Windows Store for business.
While the PC ecosystem has been under pressure recently, I do believe that Windows 10 will broaden our economic opportunity and return Windows to growth.
First, we have an OEM ecosystem that is creating exciting new hardware designs for Windows 10. In fact, our OEM partners have over 2,000 distinct devices or configurations already in testing for Windows 10 upgrade, as well as hundreds of new hardware designs. We are delighted that the first of these exciting new devices will start to be available on Windows 10 launch day. And by this holiday, we will be selling the widest range of Windows hardware ever available.
Second, we will generate new growth through gross margin on our own differentiated first-party, premium-device portfolio. We will also significantly reduce our losses on the phone by operating more effectively and efficiently with a more focused portfolio.
Third, we will grow monetization opportunities across the commercial and consumer space. In the enterprise, customers will continue to value our unparalleled management, security, appdev and servicing capability. And for consumers, Windows 10 creates monetization opportunities with store, search and gaming. We are confident that these are the right levers to revitalize Windows and restore growth. The progress we made this quarter, and the forward-looking guidance that Amy will share, shows the opportunity for renewed growth is real.
In hardware, both Surface and Xbox had an incredible Q4. We more than doubled Surface revenue to nearly $900 million this quarter, capping off a year in which it delivered more than $3.6 billion in revenue. Both consumers and enterprise customers love this device. Surface is clearly a product where we've gotten the formula right, earned fans and can apply this formula to other parts of the hardware portfolio. 
Gaming is an important scenario for Windows 10 and our success with Xbox this quarter gives us a strong starting position heading into launch. Xbox LIVE users grew 22% this quarter and logged nearly 3.5 billion hours of game play. Our growing fan base is excited for the best games lineup in our history. All of this comes together with Windows 10 when fans can connect with each other, stream all of their Xbox One games to Windows 10 and experience the best virtual reality platform given our partnership with Oculus Rift and Valve.
In search, Bing will now power both differentiated experiences on Windows 10 such as Cortana, as well as search and search advertising across the AOL portfolio of sites, in addition to the partnership we already have with Yahoo!, Amazon and Apple. With advertising revenue growth of 21% year-over-year, Bing will transition to profitability in the coming fiscal year.
It's been a strong year of progress. Above all else, I'm optimistic about our future. Our cloud services are accelerating fast and Windows is positioned for renewed growth. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Amy to talk about this quarter's results in more detail. I look forward to rejoining you after that for questions. Thank you.",1618

Our fourth quarter results demonstrate the strong progress that we've made as a company over the past year. Key strategic initiatives such as cloud, first-party hardware and consumer services delivered significant growth as well as improved profitability.
Commercial customer renewals remained healthy, with strong adoption of cloud services and a higher mix of annuity than we expected. And our disciplined approach to resource allocation has allowed us to increase investment in the growth initiatives Satya mentioned while reducing the company's operating expenses. This allows us to better compete in markets with structural growth, where we feel we have unique competitive advantages.
With that said, I will start with an overview of our financial performance before moving into a more detailed discussion of the results.
This quarter, we recorded an impairment charge related to our Phone Hardware business and incurred integration and restructuring expenses. Additionally, like most multinational companies, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar continues to have a significant impact on our reported results. Accordingly, when applicable, I'll give results and growth rates adjusting for the impairment, integration and restructuring expenses but also in constant currency to help you better understand the underlying business fundamentals.
Revenue was $22.2 billion, down 5% and down 2% in constant currency. As a reminder, last year included $382 million of revenue that we recognized at the conclusion of our commercial agreement with Nokia. Significant gross margin improvement across commercial cloud, Surface and our consumer services helped to mitigate the impact on gross margin from the decline in the D&C Licensing. Total gross margin declined 7% and 3% in constant currency.
Operating income declined 3% and 1% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $0.62, growth of 11% and growth of 8% in constant currency. Unearned revenue grew 1% to $25.3 billion and 7% in constant currency. Commercial unearned was better than expected as we saw a higher mix of annuity in the quarter.
From a geographic perspective, the majority of markets performed in line with our expectations. The notable exception was Brazil, where inflation and macroeconomic volatility weighed on our performance. Overall, macro conditions remain a challenge in some large opportunity markets like China, Russia, Japan and Brazil. There was slightly less impact from currency than our expectation. With that backdrop, I'll move to a detailed discussion of our results.
Q4 last year effectively marked the end of the XP refresh cycle. It impacted our Windows OEM and non-annuity volume licensing as well as our Office non-annuity volume licensing results. During that time, OEM revenue exceeded that of the underlying PC market driven by a higher attach of Pro, particularly within the developed markets. This quarter Pro declined by roughly 21% and, similar to last quarter, we saw Pro attach remain at pre-XP level, even with the underlying softness in the business PC market. The annuity portion of Windows volume licensing grew again on a constant currency basis with non-annuity revenue declining due to XP.
Windows non-Pro revenue declined 27% as OEMs tightly managed PC inventory ahead of the Windows 10 launch, particularly in developed markets. In our view, this is a healthy state for the channel as we head into a transformational launch that starts next week.
Consumer Office 365 had another strong quarter of net subscriber growth. Overall, Consumer Office revenue results reflected the decline in the underlying driver of that business, developed market consumer PC sales. Within D&C Licensing, the transition to Office 365 accounted for 13 points and the impact of Japan's PC market accounted for another 19 points.
We had another impressive quarter in search, with revenue growth of 21% and 25% in constant currency, driven by increases in both volume and revenue per search. As Satya said, revenue from Surface more than doubled this quarter, with continued strength of Surface Pro 3 and the launch of Surface 3.
Enterprise sales accelerated this quarter and sales of Surface 3 were particularly strong to educational customers. Our differentiated products, as well as improved discipline and execution, helped to improve gross margin by over $450 million this quarter and $1.3 billion in fiscal '15.
Within Xbox, strong growth at consoles, online transactions and first-party game helped to drive revenue growth of 27%. This progress, as well as the excitement that we generated at E3, with Xbox exclusive gaming content and backwards compatibility, demonstrates the building momentum that exists within the Xbox ecosystem.
In phones, we sold 8.4 million Lumias, which is an increase over last year's full quarter sales. ASPs, however, have continued to decline. Gross margin declined this quarter driven by lower per unit margins on Lumia devices as well as reduced volumes in non-Lumia phones. As announced on July 8, we are changing that approach in this business and are focused on delivering differentiated experiences for our targeted customer segments while improving our operating results.
Moving to our commercial results. Total revenue across our 2 segments grew slightly in USD [ph] and grew 4% at constant currency. Our contracted not billed balance, which is a key indicator of customer commitment, reached an all-time high of over $24.5 billion and it reached this level even with the significant appreciation in the U.S. dollar. Constant currency bookings were flat to the prior year. Though, as a reminder, last year, commercial bookings grew 23% on the strength of a large renewal base as well as the end of XP discussed earlier.
Our Office Commercial business continues to transition to Office 365. We, again, grew the installed seat base of Office, Exchange, SharePoint and Skype for Business. Office 365 allows us to have a deeper ongoing relationship with all of our customers which, in turn, provides us with the opportunity to expand and grow our business over time.
Because of this transition, as well as weakness in Japan and the impact of XP, Office Commercial products and services grew 1% in constant currency, quite similar to Q3. Dynamics revenue grew 15% on a constant currency basis, driven by the strong CRM results Satya talked about and our ERP business, which saw 35% growth in customers this quarter. Server products and services grew 4% and 9% in constant currency, continuing to outperform our peers in the enterprise software sector. SQL Server share growth continues as customers value its high performance and lower cost of ownership. Revenue and licenses of Windows Server grew against the backdrop of a declining server hardware market. And in the public cloud space, we had another quarter of significant Azure usage growth. Additionally, we significantly grew the gross margin percentage in our Commercial Other segment, increasing 13 points to over 43%.
Moving to operating expenses, which declined 9% or 4% in constant currency. Our continued disciplined approach has allowed us to incrementally fund strategic initiatives without having to increase our expense base. Other income was favorable to our expectation, driven by gains on foreign currency and sales with investment. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24% and was at the high-end of our guided range due in part to strong performance in our Computing and Gaming Hardware segment in the U.S.
We returned $6.7 billion to shareholders this quarter, nearly double the amount from last year. With that overview of the current quarter, let me turn to our outlook, starting with a few overall comments.
As we have communicated, over the past couple of months, the accounting for Windows 10 will change. We will be deferring a portion of Windows 10 revenue, primarily OEM, and recognizing it over time, generally 2 to 4 years. As shared previously, the initial deferral and the subsequent recognition of those deferrals will be netted in Corporate and Other in our segment reporting. Most importantly, underlying billings and cash flow won't change. Therefore, our commentary in this and subsequent earnings calls, including our guidance, will focus on results prior to the net deferral impact, which we believe is the best reflection of business health. With that background, let me share some thoughts on fiscal '16.
The strengthening of the U.S. dollar will continue to have a significant impact on our results over the course of FY '16. Assuming rates across our largest currencies: the euro, Japanese yen and the British pound stay in line with current rates and that the geographic mix of revenue stays as forecasted. In our non-annuity businesses, the impact is immediate as the revenue is recognized in quarter. In our annuity business, revenue is deferred and the impact is delayed as we earn the revenue off the balance sheet. In total, we expect that FX will negatively impact total revenue growth by 5 points in each quarter of H1, with 7 points of negative impact in our Commercial segment. H1 would be the peak of the FX headwinds. And in H2, we expect FX to have 3 points of negative impact in total and roughly 4 points of negative impact on our commercial revenue.
With Windows 10, we expect momentum to build throughout the year as we and our partners bring new devices, applications and services to market. We expect this to benefit our business results in the second half of the fiscal year. With the strength in Xbox and Xbox LIVE, along with the launch of Halo 5 in October, Xbox will continue to grow both fans and profitability.
With the recently announced changes in phones, there will be significant revenue declines year-over-year in the Phone segment each quarter. With the proactive measures we've taken to reduce our cost structure, overall losses will also decline for the fiscal year. We would expect the majority of that improvement in the second half of the year once the restructuring efforts are materially complete.
Bing will be profitable in FY '16. And assuming the macro environment is stable, we expect our commercial momentum will continue, highlighted by growth in our commercial cloud. We remain on track to achieve our $20 billion commercial cloud ambition in fiscal 2018.
We now expect operating expenses to be $32.1 billion to $32.4 billion, which is lower than the guidance we provided in April. The lowered guidance reflects the savings from our restructuring of the Phone business as well as important investments to drive top line growth as we support Windows 10, our first-party hardware effort as well as sales headcount to accelerate our leadership position in the Commercial cloud.
We expect our full year tax rate to be 24%, plus or minus 1 point, excluding the net impact from the Windows 10 deferrals.
Now to Q1, starting with Devices and Consumer. In licensing, we expect revenue to be $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion. This range reflects Windows revenue roughly in line with the PC market. Within Consumer Office, we expect the transition to Office 365 subscriptions to continue.
In Computing and Gaming Hardware, we expect revenue to be $2.0 billion to $2.1 billion. As a reminder, we launched Surface Pro 3 in late June last year, with launch benefits extending into Q1.
In Phone Hardware, we expect revenue to be approximately $900 million reflecting our change in approach. We expect gross margin in Phone to improve sequentially in Q1.
In Devices and Consumer Other, we expect revenue to be $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion, with continued growth in Bing, Consumer Office 365 and Xbox LIVE transactions.
And in commercial, as I discussed previously, we expect a significant FX headwind this quarter. Our constant currency growth is expected to be about 7% in Q1, which assumes we continue to take share in key markets and build momentum in the new areas we have entered. With the negative impact of FX, we expect revenue to be roughly flat.
On Commercial Licensing, we expect revenue of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion with a continued shift to annuity; and in Commercial Other, with the significant growth in our cloud, revenue of $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion.
We expect COGS to be $7.0 billion to $7.2 billion with the variability being driven by the hardware segment. We expect operating expenses to be $7.6 billion to $7.7 billion. As a reminder, other income and expense includes dividend and interest income, offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. Given the current FX environment, we expect our net cost of hedging to increase and other income and expense to be negative $200 million. 
Excluding the Windows 10 deferrals and the impact of foreign currency, we expect the sequential decline in unearned to be slightly better than historic seasonality, driven by the growing mix of annuity revenue.
In closing, I'm proud of the tremendous amount of progress that our company has made over the past year. We've improved how we operate in virtually every sense.

You guys showed another huge quarter of growth in terms of your consumer seat count, and I think it was 86% growth on the Commercial Other side for Office 365. Wondered if you could just drill into both the consumer and then the enterprise side, just the trends you're seeing there. And obviously, the guidance you all just provided. It looks like those -- you expect those trends to continue in Q1. So any color there would be great.",88

Overall, we are very excited about the growth we are seeing in Office 365. On the consumer side, as you noted, we're growing 1 million subs a month, and that's fantastic growth for us. The consumer value, especially now that we have even all the endpoints covered with Office, the definition of Office and where all it's present is also changed and that all accrues to consumers being willing to  have this subscription relationship with us. On the enterprise side, the growth remains very exciting for us. And the growth comes in multiple forms. It comes in the form of just the EAs renewing more to Office 365. It also comes in the form of some of the more comprehensive suites, the E3 and the new E5, that's the commitment we are seeing. And we also see small businesses. I talked about the 50,000 businesses, small- and medium-sized businesses, each month signing up for Office 365. That's pretty unprecedented. Having been in the server business all my life, I've never seen a lot of the small business customers adopt some of the rich capabilities like it's possible now, and that's great growth as well. And that cloud revenue number, that is the 88%, is all up cloud revenue. It's inclusive of Office 365, EMS and Azure. And it's good to see that kind of growth at that kind of scale now with $8 billion.",238

And we were able to see that this quarter across all the core workloads in Office. And when you think about why that's so critical long-term is our ability to sell some of the workloads Satya actually referenced that will be in E5 when it launches, we could -- we have the capability of upgrading on a more consistent basis using more of these premium services. So when you can both add to your installed base and add overall market opportunity, we do feel good about our line of sight in that business to our long-term goal.",146

I guess a couple of questions as it relates to the Windows 2003 retirement and any impact you're seeing there. And then secondarily, if you could just comment on some of the new product launches. It seems like there's a stack of new solutions that are coming on the server side that look pretty exciting and your partners are excited about it. If you could highlight what you see is the most interesting from your perspective over the next several quarters.",99

Overall, I'd start even with the bold view that my server business is not some legacy business. We fundamentally think about servers as the extension of the cloud. I even described it architecturally as the edge of our cloud. Every server, for example, have things like disaster recovery, backup and tiering with the cloud. And so we will continue to push that differentiation because I think that view architecturally and the delivery of it is what makes us pretty unique. And you see it in the numbers. Our servers, even this quarter, grew 9%. And compared to the industry peers, we're obviously gaining share on Windows Server, on SQL Server and pretty much all of our management and security products as well. And going forward, we have a fantastic lineup of servers, not just the infrastructure, but even SharePoint, Exchange, Lync server continues to have significant on-premise deployment. So as our cloud continues to grow, obviously, we are getting where there is more capability in the cloud. We're incenting customers and our partners to move to the cloud. But at the same time, we are going to have a great server wave. I'm excited about our SQL product. I think it goes into the first preview next -- in fact, tomorrow. And that product, I think, is a pretty revolutionary product because, for the first time, you can take a single table in a database and even tier it with the cloud. At that kind of capability only we can provide, and that's something that I'm looking forward to.",260

But in general, that business unlike the client upgrade that we see, just because so much of the business is already on annuity, you don't see that type of incremental impact in an in-quarter release. That isn't to say there isn't ample opportunity for us to make sure we upgrade customers to the higher-value prop and more secure and more manageable offerings we have in the server business.",91

This quarter, the year-over-year server product and services revenue growth was slower than it was in the past quarters. How much of that is because you're seeing now some revenue shift to Azure? Or is it not yet seeing any revenue shift? And then I have a follow-up question.",62
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2015",2015-07-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3889.0,835418.0,36082285.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,15,"Well, why don't I take that one and we'll see what Mark's follow-up is. At 9% growth and continuing to take share, I feel like our performance in this continues to be sort of a positive outlier to the peer group. And for me, that type of performance and double digits for the year, I still feel quite good about. In general, what's interesting, I think, as you're getting to the crux of it is, do we have incremental workloads that are unique to the cloud, that we continue to see that. The very best example, frankly, Satya mentioned in his comments, which is our EMS performance, Enterprise Mobility Suite offerings. It's just -- it's taking something that's very unique, built off of our core in the server business and allows us to us to both grow and add new perspective there. So I don't think of it as reflecting a bigger shift than we've seen, in particular, this quarter. Also, if you'll remember, a year ago, we had a very big base of expirations in Q4 and had very strong performance a year ago. So I don't look at it as a direct trend line.",196

The only thing I'd add is when you look at the total growth of Azure, the growth that's coming now from some of the premium services, this is sort of businesses that we actually did not ever participate on-premise at all. Even EMS, when I think about our management, our management was just about Windows management. But we now have management, data protection and identity systems that cross all devices in the enterprise, including Internet of Things, and that makes it pretty exciting and that growth is great to see. Same thing will be on the server management, we have a new suite called the Operations Management Suite, which also spans all the cloud units as well as on-premise units. Cortana Analytics, we never participated in any of the advanced analytics workloads at all, in spite of all the success we had in the database business. So I'm excited about built new workloads that, in many cases, are borne in the cloud workloads, where we are expanding our market opportunity and continuing to outperform our peers and grab share when it comes to on-premise.",185

Switching gears a bit. On Windows, obviously, you're seeing some amount of delay due to Windows 10 on the OEM side. Can you give maybe a little more color in terms of how you're thinking about that, how big a delay is it, how much we could see that starting to be replaced next quarter and beyond?",61
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2015",2015-07-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3889.0,835418.0,36082288.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,18,"Yes. I'll take that and, Amy, you can add to it. And the way I -- the Windows ecosystem works is there are phases to it. And in fact, if anything, this release of Windows 10, just the way we built it with the Insider Program, everything is, of course, speeding up because, in some sense, we've taken a very different approach with this Windows as a Service even when it comes to OEM relations and how they're able to co-create the products with us. But that's -- and there are 3 distinct phases. The first phase is what I'll describe as the upgrade phase, that's what starts in a week's time, and that is more of retail execution and upgrades. Then come the fall, you will see the devices from all the OEMs going into the holiday quarter. And then the enterprise upgrade, in fact, we have a release of enterprise features which I mentioned in my script, which will ship in that time frame. And I expect piloting to start and deployments to start in the second half of the fiscal year. So that's how we think about the OEM as well as enterprise adoption. So I would -- if -- my bullishness for Windows 10 is more in the second half of the fiscal year. And of course, it will build. It will build starting in a week's time in retail and in the upgrades, but I sort of see this in 3 phases.",247

Before every launch, we tend to have a tightening in the channel as they prepare and run reasonably lean, this is a healthy state, it's within the range of normal. So I don't think of it as a delay in the way you're talking about it. It is pretty standard, as Satya has talked about, in terms of the dynamic. And he mentioned we are feeling, I think, a lot of excitement from the ecosystem about what's possible with some of the new devices that will come. And so I don't really think of it in that way. I think about it as an encouragement that they want to fill the channel as quickly as they can over the coming quarters with new machines.",130

The revenue expectation for Q1, it was below our expectations, I think, quite below what the Street was looking for. Can you give us a sense of how you see that business trending over a longer period of time? Because if there's a significant restructuring going on, I think -- I don't think a lot of guys have a good view in their head of what your expectation is for the business on a revenue run rate basis or what do you expect to be selling this year and on a going-forward basis right now?",112
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2015",2015-07-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3889.0,835418.0,36082292.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,22,"Let me start and then, Amy, you can add to this. The big shift that we are making when it comes to phones is to not think about phones in isolation. That's perhaps the biggest shift because I think about Windows 10 in its entirety, the Windows ecosystem in its entirety. We clearly are going to have premium first-party portfolio. And you've seen some of the numbers, some of the progress we have made in Surface. I feel that we have a formula there that I would like to apply more broadly in terms of growing -- just delivering innovation, growing our own economic return for it, stimulating demand, creating categories, all of that is what I want to do broadly. And it applies to phones, it applies to Surface hub, it applies to HoloLens. And that's how I view it. I believe our participation in the Phone segment by itself, so the Windows phones and Lumia phones being there, is important. And that's why we picked the 3 areas where we have differentiation and we want to focus on it. We want to have great flagship phones for Windows SaaS. That's actually a segment we don't today have good devices, and we hope to change that with Windows 10. We have, in fact, good traction in the business segment. So this is business customers who are actually buying phone devices, which is basically a radio with -- essentially a smartphone to be able to deploy their line of business applications. That's where we have pretty unparalleled value, which is we have the Visual Studio Online and some of the tools I talked about. So you can generate these apps at a low cost of ownership, manage them, secure them and deploy them to our phone endpoints and then, of course, management and security. So that's the place where we are going to continue to focus. And in the value smartphone, that's the place where I want us to be much more efficient. We clearly have some value to add there because of the uniqueness of Office and Skype and our services. But at the same time, I think we want to be smart about how many of these phones do we want to generate, how many -- which price points do we want to participate. That's where you will see the most significant operational changes from how we operated last year to the coming year.",406

It's an approach that we've executed in other hardware segments that I feel is a proven model for us. Our profitability will also improve. More of that comes in the second half of the year structurally as we complete some of the restructuring efforts and those costs come out of our operating expense run rate. But I think that's probably the way to more appropriately think about, over time, you would expect to see gross margin improvement and operating profit improvement as opposed to focusing on the revenue line.",131

And if I could sneak one more just on the security side of the business. I think a lot of guys have thought traditionally about security, it's something that Microsoft does to make your platform more secure and to provide more confidence in users using your platforms and your tools. On a going-forward basis, is there more of an opportunity for you guys to sell security as more of a standalone opportunity? I mean, it's something that's in very high demand as you are looking for more secure solution. Is that something that could potentially be more of a standalone opportunity for Microsoft on a go-forward basis?",110
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2015",2015-07-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3889.0,835418.0,36082295.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,25,"In fact, we are adding significant value in security. It's much better for us, for example, to add capability around O 365 in security and that's all in, for example, the new suite that we have just announced called E5, the secure lockbox. That's actually a pretty -- a very cool set of features that allow both regulators and businesses to have, for example, auditability and control over their movement to the cloud. Similarly, Azure, where we launched a whole set of security offers around how people can encrypt and manage keys, so those are all security features. We bought a company in Colorado that's essentially a firewall on all your identity management. So when we talk about enterprise management suite growth, a lot of it is just, obviously, management growth but it's also security and data protection growth. So the approach we're taking is we're essentially creating, to your point, security value around our products, which -- it allows us to participate in essentially a security market that we never did in the ways that we are. So it's more than just launching one point security product. It's much more broadly participating in the security market, and you have seen some of that in the inorganic moves and the suites we have created.",214

I mean, overall business process collaborations, communication, these category boundaries are things that I believe are going to change. I've always felt that in some sense, most of the time, we even automate business processes where we spend really getting our business done in our communication and collaboration tools. And this impedance is something that I've always dreamt of sort of how do we go solve? And CRM has taken -- our own Dynamics product has taken some pretty unique approaches. And quite frankly, I was -- I want to open up our communication and collaborations for other CRM vendors. So one of the things that I'm very explicit about is we will have an open platform for other business process applications because this is a very fragmented market the world over, especially if you add SMB. And so we want to be having a platform play as well as our own business applications play, and both of them should be high growth for us. And in the last year, we've just added more focus and we put more selling capacity around it, more marketing capacity and now, of course, mainstreamed it across Microsoft because I'm a big believer in this, because I think we have something unique to add. As opposed to driving our own top line/bottom line growth, I think we can bring real innovation. And that's what is exciting to see. And it's not just CRM, I'm actually excited about our ERP business. Some of the numbers that Amy talked about is growth in the seats. And when I think about data as the new currency, we have lots of managed seats and a lot of data, which all will move to the cloud. And so things like Power BI and Cortana Analytics can help customers transform. So in fact, that's one of the reasons why I'm even sort of very optimistic about some of our new data capabilities is we have the attach capability to our even installed base of Dynamics.",336

Because of the performance in Xbox and in Surface, you're right, it is a hardware mix shift a bit. We outperformed significantly in both those products in Q4, and that does -- took us a little bit outside the COGS range but not as much as our revenue outperformed.

Machine learning as a service, one of the things that we realized is that every company out there becomes a software company beyond even our traditional reach through IT. Everyone has a digital office inside the company. They are, in fact, doing things in advanced analytics and using machine learning, and that's the place where we have some very unique capability. So that's another place where we're seeing wide adoption. We are seeing adoption in the building of new front-end -- or back-ends for new front-ends. So essentially using Azure as the cloud back-end for their mobile apps across Android, iOS and Windows as well as their web. That's another use case that's high growth for us. And of course, Cortana Analytics. This is the big data side of it. This is happening in IT, it's happening in, as I said, in digital offices within each one of the customers. So we have a pretty broad spectrum of use cases that some of the customers have talked about even in the recent set of conferences. From our Partner Conference to our Ignite Conference, we have been, in fact, showcasing. Even our ad campaign showcases some of these use cases.",253

I just had 2 questions, pretty quick ones. Just to follow up on Azure, I was wondering if you could share with us what you're seeing in the mix between IaaS and PaaS and kind of how you've seen that shift evolve over the last few quarters. And then secondly, just to follow up, I think, on Walter's question. Yes, you definitely have been focusing on the Customer Relationship Management opportunity and the financials market more. But given the big SaaS incumbents already competing in that area, can you share with us -- do you think you have the assets you need internally to execute against your long-term goals?",110
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2015",2015-07-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3889.0,835418.0,36082310.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,40,"Sure. On the IaaS versus PaaS, it's an interesting question. I've not looked at it in isolation because what happens is, at least the use cases, what starts off as IaaS suddenly will start using Azure AD for identity management, will use a little bit of our Media Services, for example, just doing content encoding. So there's a mix always. So there's nothing pure PaaS, nothing pure IaaS. That's the trend I see. But it's a split that we should go take a look at and then off-line maybe even talk about it. But overall, we see significant amount of IaaS in the last year because that's probably the place where we had more of a weakness, which we have now overcome. And so we're seeing significant growth of IaaS in the enterprise. But the place where we continue to have significant differentiation is in some of these managed services and PaaS. And that I think is the mix on it. And then on the Dynamics side, I absolutely believe we have a huge opportunity. Having sort of worked in business applications for a long time, first of all, the market is very fragmented. I think people like to talk about leaders. And there are, clearly, leaders when you go to the very top of the enterprise customers and segments. But the way the market splits into verticals and into horizontals and then the platform effect, there's plenty of opportunity. For sure, you've got to be one of the players. It will be 3 players, 4 players, whatever. But in every technology paradigm, you want to be one of them. We already have a $2-plus billion Dynamics business, I talked about the total number of seats and now we have this triple-digit CRM Online growth. So I feel that we are in a good position and I feel that we'll look at even in some of the inorganic means to keep growing it. In fact, the Field service acquisition I talked about in my script is an example of that. So that's my bullishness on our business process prospects.",349

Look, I talked a little bit about it but let me go into a bit of detail on that. I think the first half of your question was does the $32.1 billion to $32.4 billion full year OpEx guide reflect the timing of the implementation of our restructuring. And it certainly does. And so what you can then see as it relates to the second half of your question is that we are taking some of those savings and investing them back into the business, in some of these key growth areas we've seen. I outlined 3 on the call. The third one, I probably could have expanded more on. The first one is Windows 10. The second is the first-party hardware, where we just had such terrific performance again this Q4. And then finally, the third bucket was about accelerating our Commercial cloud lead. And I do feel like in that area, we could invest in Office 365, some of the new E5 capabilities. I look forward to adding sales capacity to take advantage of that. We'll also add sales capacity across some of the other opportunities we've seen broadly. And so I look and see that as an opportunity to accelerate top line growth.",207

I want to build a long-term, profitable business. In other words, one of the keys in biz apps is you can always get into the trap of overspending in sales and marketing and not having long-term leverage at all. One of the things I feel very good about our position is how do you really build a long-term, profitable business. That's front and center to me. So we will not overspend there in sales and marketing because we do believe the products -- in fact, there's a different way to sell even business process applications because of the cloud, and that's something that we want to take advantage of.",130

That's helpful. At Analyst Day, you did talk about -- I think it was 8% unit growth in the Office ecosystem over the last 2 years. And it sounds like you continue to see nice unit growth in Office. How should we think about that going forward? Are you fully expecting to continue to see unit growth? And then also just a clarification, I think your customer lifetime value was based on existing SKUs. So as you introduce E5 and others, does that open up the potential for even higher customer lifetime value?",103
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2015",2015-07-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3889.0,835418.0,36082316.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,46,"Great. I do think the work we showed at the Analyst Meeting on the importance of increasing the installed base across Office and Exchange, it did occur again this quarter, so I feel good that we're staying on the trajectory that we showed in the projection. Do continue to expect that to happen as we shared it back that last week in April. And on your -- on the second half of your question, I tend to think -- you're right. Generically, each of the examples look quite different. There were people that were upgrading from x to y, there were people that were just simply moving to the cloud. But one of the things that the cloud, to your point, makes fundamentally possible is the opportunity for us to quickly iterate the opportunities, build value and deploy it more quickly to customers. And generally, I do think that they will pay us for that, to your specific question. I also think the importance of it is that it tends to also come with higher margin. So our improvement and continued improvement in our Commercial cloud gross margin portfolio, I think this is a key criteria of that. So I associate it, yes, with life time value. I also associate it with our ability to move our gross margin percentage up.",221

And in there, Amy alluded to this, we have made significant changes in how we have allocated our own organic dollars, both in R&D as well as in sales and marketing, and we'll continue to do that. Because I think there is significant new opportunities for us to go after, and that will require us to just reallocate aggressively, and that to me is core. But beyond that, we will look at inorganic means. When I look at all the acquisitions that we have made over the course of the last year, and our OpEx guidance for next year shows how disciplined we are in bringing new talent in, be it in R&D, be it in sales and marketing. So we are not afraid to bring in new capability, but then also questioning what is the allocation we have. Of course, we have done smaller acquisitions, but they add up. They are pretty significant when you add up all the things that we have done in the Office 365 space, all the things that we did in the Azure space. So we'll continue to do that. And if anything comes up in M&A, which allows us to pursue our strategic vision that we will need to even allocate more to on an OpEx basis, post-acquisition, we will look at that. So I won't shy away from it because what's important to us is growth in areas where we have something unique to contribute and long-term profitability.",268

Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel. 
On our website, microsoft.com/investor, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provide the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. 
Our website also includes information related to our new financial reporting segments announced in September. This is also the first quarter that reflects the revenue recognition accounting for Windows 10. As a reminder, we report Windows revenue prior to any accounting adjustment in our More Personal Computing segment. The corresponding revenue deferral for Windows 10 sales is then reported in Corporate and Other in our segment reporting.
Earnings commentary today and going forward will focus on results prior to the net deferral impact as we believe this is the best reflection of business health. Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call. The non-GAAP measures exclude the impact of last year's integration and restructuring charges and the current Windows 10 net revenue deferral.
The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They're included as additional clarifying items that aid investors in further understanding the company's first quarter performance in addition to the impact that these items and events had on the financial results. 
Additionally, any mention of operating expense refers to segment operating expenses as defined in the footnotes of our Form 10-Q and includes research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative but exclude the impact of last year's integration and restructuring charges.
All growth comparisons we make on the call relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuation. At the segment level, we provide constant currency growth for both revenue and gross margin. However, due to the recent change in our segment reporting groupings, we aren't able to provide segment-level constant currency operating expense growth and consequently cannot derive constant currency segment operating income either. We do provide constant currency operating expense and income growth at the company-wide level.
We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission and in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until October 21, 2016.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factor section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.",584

Good afternoon, everyone. I'm looking forward to today's call. This quarter, we delivered $21.7 billion in revenue and grew profit. Also as part of our commitment to balance capital returns, we meaningfully increased our quarterly dividend and continued our stock repurchase plan.
More importantly, we are focused and making progress towards the goals for fiscal year '18 that we shared 6 months ago. Now, more than 110 million active devices are running Windows 10. We are well on our way to reaching 1 billion Windows 10 active devices. People are moving from needing to choosing to loving Windows.
Similarly, we are making great progress towards our goal of $20 billion in annualized Commercial cloud revenue run rate, which now exceeds $8.2 billion. The results speak to our differentiated cloud strategy, expanded market opportunity and the speed at which customers are adopting our service.
As I reflect on the quarter, it is important to note that we are investing in significant addressable markets where we also have meaningful differentiation. Today, we'll walk through our financial results for the first quarter and discuss how we're delivering new innovation and growing users and usage across each of our 3 segments.
Let's start off with Productivity and Business Process. Clearly, how people work has changed dramatically but one thing remains true: Everyone wants to get more out of every moment of their life. After all, time is our scarcest commodity. That's why we set out to reinvent productivity and business process.
The recent release of Office is a big step forward. We designed Office 2016 and Office 365 to take the work out of working together. We want to help change the nature of work within organizations of all sizes by focusing on the mobility of the person's experience, enabling collaboration and building a rich service that spans all aspects of how people work today. This approach is resonating with both our consumer and commercial customers.
More and more consumers are using Office across device platforms, which is driving Office 365 growth. There are now more than 18 million consumer Office 365 subscribers. We surpassed 200 million downloads of Office Mobile. More than 1 billion to-do lists have been created so far in Wunderlist, and more than 0.5 billion people manage their documents and photos in OneDrive.
We continue to see strong adoption in the Commercial space as well from our largest customers, such as Kraft, GE, Louis Vuitton, to schools and small businesses around the globe. Of note, commercial Office 365 monthly active users grew to 60 million with nearly 60% of our installed base using premium workloads. And we added 50,000 new small business customers in each of the last 19 consecutive months.
As customers move to our cloud, it enables us to deliver even more value and push for new growth by entering new categories. Information protection is a great example where we have done this because of natural synergies with our existing services. In fact, nearly 20 million people already use our new premium information protection capabilities in Office 365. That's a tremendous validation of how the cloud accelerates the adoption of new workloads and grows our ability to monetize new value in the $10 billion information protection market.
The new organizational analytics market is another area where we see growth opportunity. So we are investing with our acquisition of VoloMetrix, a powerful cloud-based tool for analyzing organizational productivity. The ability to visualize how people engage with others inside and outside an organization is something the cloud is uniquely suited to do. It is exciting to be on the forefront of creating a new technology category. This illustrates how our vision for productivity goes beyond helping individuals to empowering groups of people and entire organizations to accomplish more together. Our addressable opportunity will expand further as we launch more advanced security, voice and analytics workloads in our new premium Office 365 SKU next quarter.
Let's talk about business process. With Dynamics, we are making great progress in breaking down the boundaries between business process collaboration and productivity to truly empower organizations. The companies I talk with every day are under pressure to grow revenue while differentiating themselves on customer experience. It's one reason the usage of CRM is growing. Dynamics CRM Online enterprise seats more than tripled year-over-year. Dynamics AX revenue also grew double digits as the operational system for agile business processes. And we have a new release for Dynamics NAV for small businesses that is tightly integrated with Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics CRM.
Moving to the Intelligent Cloud. Before I talk about the great progress we are making with our Intelligent Cloud platform, I want to pause and reflect on where we are as an industry. While many companies are developing Commercial cloud offerings, there are really only 2 driving enterprise cloud platform innovation at massive scale: Amazon and Microsoft. We push each other and we each have a unique approach. Microsoft has bet on a strategy to build a hyperscale public cloud as well as reinvent servers at the edge of our cloud. This approach gives customers a true hybrid distributed computing platform that reflects their real world needs. Our unique hybrid approach, coupled with high-value services, is clearly a structural advantage.
It's great to see our customers like Walmart, Jet.com and Alaska Airlines seize the benefits of the cloud to transform and push for growth. Azure revenue and compute usage more than doubled year-over-year, and we're continuing to channel our innovation into high-growth scenarios with new features and services. In the last quarter alone, we have made major updates spanning Azure App Services for building enterprise web and mobile apps; Azure Data Lake for infinite data management and analytics; Advanced Threat Analytics, which help organizations identify breaches and threats using behavioral analysis.
CIOs are increasingly adopting our Azure premium service for security and manageability. Enterprise Mobility services has more than doubled to 20,000-plus customers. Our installed base has increased nearly 6x year-over-year, making EMS the largest mobility in identity management solution in a new and growing market.
Our acquisition of Adallom, an innovator in cloud security, will bring customers visibility and control over application access and company data stored across popular cloud applications, including Office 365, Salesforce, ServiceNow and many more.
To be a worldwide cloud player, global scale is a must. With that in mind, we launched new data centers in India, bringing our global total to over 20 regions, more than any other major cloud provider. We aren't just selling into these countries, we see the cloud as an accelerator of local economies by offering tools that empower emerging businesses, transform public sector services and create value for new local partners.
Our differentiated hybrid capabilities mean customers get to choose how they adopt the cloud and distribute their workloads. This, in turn, is driving the growth of our server business. Premium versions of Windows Server, SQL Server and System Center all grew double digits.
Lastly, we reached a big milestone with SQL Server, one that has been 20 years in the making. The database software market is still one of the largest, and now, we are an unparalleled leader in Gartner's Operational DBMS Magic Quadrant. That speaks to our differentiated vision in the category and the value we deliver to customers, and we are certainly not done innovating. This milestone with SQL, juxtaposed with our rapid growth in Azure and its position in the cloud Magic Quadrant, shows the overall strength and progress we are making with our Intelligent Cloud platform.
Now let's shift to progress in our More Personal Computing segment, specifically how the launch of Windows 10 is sparking new growth opportunities for the entire Windows ecosystem. As a platform company, we think about bringing the needs of multiple constituencies together: developers, IT professionals and users. And we are seeing great response from all 3. There are now more than 110 million monthly active devices running Windows 10. The majority of the upgrades in the first 10 weeks were naturally from consumers and are 3x that of Windows 7 over the same time period after launch.
We're also seeing a fast start to business adoption with more than 8 million business PCs now running Windows 10. We are adding more enterprise features, and we are making it easier for businesses to buy and support Windows devices.
Our early success in attracting developers, apps and store visits is also growing. Our stores have seen 1.25 billion visits, and developer revenue per download has grown 4x since the Windows 10 launch. Developers are responding to the opportunity, including Facebook, which will release universal apps for Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. 
Windows 10 is also driving increased usage of other Microsoft services. Specifically, Bing's share is up to 20.7% in the U.S., and advertising revenue grew 29% worldwide helped by Windows 10 users asking Cortana more than 1 billion questions.
Further in gaming, we have also seen an increase in active users as we extend our gaming experiences from the console to Windows 10 PCs. Xbox LIVE continues to grow active usage, and every day, nearly half of the Xbox One user base is engaged in the service. It'll be a great holiday for all gamers. The beta release of Minecraft for Windows 10 is off to a strong start, with players having already placed over 0.5 billion blocks.
The next -- and next week, we are excited to launch one of the most anticipated new games this holiday with Halo 5: Guardians. This new Halo includes an epic hunt for Master Chief, along with groundbreaking multiplayer matches on Xbox LIVE. As a result, I confidently predict that time will become much more scarce for Xbox One owners starting on Tuesday.
We see all of this Windows 10 usage as an early indicator of our ability to drive growth over the lifetime of a device. 2 weeks ago, we took the next major step in our journey with the announcement of new Windows 10 premium devices from us and from our OEM partners. It's an incredible lineup across a broad spectrum of categories from the new Surface Pro 4, Surface Book to Lumia 950, 950 XL to Microsoft Band 2 and HoloLens developer edition. 
Every -- early reviews are generating excitement with customers, and we are delighted that our preorder sales are reflecting the positive sentiment in the market. We're also seeing hundreds of new device designs from our partners, the widest range ever for this holiday. It's clear that by bringing together our applications, operating system and hardware, we will invent new personal computers and new personal computing.
Overall, I'm proud of our results this quarter, and I'm optimistic about our growth prospects. We are poised to seize the opportunity of the largest technology shift of our generation with the enterprise cloud. We are increasing users and engagement in services that cross every aspect of a person's life from Office at work to Xbox at home, while at the same time, we are positioning Windows for growth. 
Our transformation is well underway. Quarter-after-quarter, we build new capability, we enter new markets, scale our new businesses and new business models, and we are being disciplined in our execution. I'll now hand off to Amy to talk about this quarter's results in greater detail, and I look forward to rejoining you after to answer questions.",1902

Before addressing this quarter's results, I want to briefly comment on the reporting segment change we announced during the quarter. We believe our new segments, in combination with the supplemental metrics and the profit measure of operating income, provide transparency into our progress against our ambitions.
As Chris mentioned, my commentary today on our results and outlook will reflect the new segments and excludes the net revenue deferral impact of Windows 10. Last quarter, we discussed the material impact that foreign exchange movement would have on our financial results through fiscal '16. In Q1, the FX impact on total revenue was 5 points, with most of the impact in the Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes segments, given their high annuity mix. This was in line with the expectation we shared in July.
This quarter, revenue was $21.7 billion, down 7% and 2% in constant currency, primarily due to the changes we've made in our Phone business. Gross margin declined by 3% but was up 3% in constant currency. We were thoughtful with operating expenses, realizing savings but investing as well. As a result, operating income grew 1% or 11% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $0.67, growing 3% and growing 15% in constant currency.
We continued to see solid performance across most developed markets while the challenging macro conditions in Brazil, China, Japan and Russia persisted this quarter. Commercial results are now included in each of the reporting segments. Therefore, each quarter, I will cover overall Commercial results in my commentary.
Our Commercial business continues to be healthy with momentum in cloud services and a higher annuity mix across all our segments. Commercial bookings were slightly better than we expected and grew 10% in constant currency. We executed well in explorations and Commercial unearned revenue came in as expected, growing 3% to $21 billion, up 10% in constant currency. Our contracted not billed balance was more than $23.5 billion, in line with seasonality for the quarter.
As Satya remarked, our Commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate surpassed $8.2 billion, growing nearly 70% year-on-year and in line with our expectations. Consistent with the revenue pattern across our Commercial business, we typically drive the largest volume of renewals and new agreements in June and consequently see lower sequential growth rate in Q1. Importantly, our Commercial cloud gross margin percentage improved again sequentially from Q4 as we benefited from increasing scale and efficiencies. As I will talk about shortly, our leading indicators around usage, new cloud services and customer demand remain healthy, and we are clearly on track toward our $20 billion goal in FY '18.
Now let's turn to the detailed results of each segment. Our Productivity and Business processes segment, which is made up of commercial and consumer office, including Office 365 as well as Dynamics, delivered $6.3 billion in revenue, declining 3% and growing 4% in constant currency.
In Office commercial, revenue grew 5% in constant currency and was slightly better than we expected. Increased channel sales capacity, a higher adoption of premium services and continued installed base growth, all contributed to our performance. We saw broad-based Office 365 fee growth across both large enterprise and the SMB customer base.
Office consumer revenue declined 4% in constant currency, better than the underlying consumer PC market and slightly better than we had expected. This quarter, recurring subscription revenue more than offset the impact of customers transitioning to Office 365.
Our Dynamics business grew 12% in constant currency, slightly better than we expected. Growth was driven primarily by Dynamics CRM Online. We continue to make progress by investing in product innovation organically as well as adding capabilities through acquisitions like FieldOne and FantasySalesTeam.
Segment gross margin declined 6%, but grew 1% in constant currency. Gross margin percentages have been impacted by the mix shift toward our rapidly growing cloud services, including our consumer properties like OneDrive. As Chris mentioned, this year, we can't provide constant currency impact at the segment level for operating expenses and therefore, operating income. That said, FX in general and at the company level had a favorable impact on operating expenses, which declined 6%.
The Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes our portfolio of server products, Azure cloud services and Enterprise services, delivered $5.9 billion in revenue, up 8% and up 14% in constant currency, in line with our expectations. Our differentiated cloud platform offerings and rapid pace of innovation continue to be compelling to both new and existing customers.
Segment gross margin grew 8% or 15% in constant currency. We continue to invest in research and development resources to realize the large and growing addressable market opportunities and are accelerating our plans to add incremental sales capacity to support growing customer demand for cloud services. Segment operating income grew 14%.
Now to our final segment, More Personal Computing, which includes Windows, devices, gaming and search. Revenue was $9.4 billion, declining 17% and 13% in constant currency, mainly due to the changes in our phone strategy. As Satya mentioned, since the launch of Windows 10 in late July, we have seen solid momentum in our ecosystem and with our customers. And importantly, we saw positive engagement and usage signals across services like search and gaming that provide post-sale monetization opportunities.
Overall, our OEM business declined 6% this quarter, outperforming the PC market and better than we had anticipated, driven primarily by non-Pro OEM. As we discussed previously, this was a transition quarter as the ecosystem moves to Windows 10, and we believe overall inventory in the channel is at normal levels as we head into holiday. OEM non-Pro revenue declined 4%,  as we saw OEMs focused on premium devices aligned to the Windows 10 launch. This drove a richer mix to market, leading to improvement in the average revenue per license.
OEM Pro revenue declined 7%, slightly ahead of the overall Commercial PC market. Windows volume licensing grew 4% in constant currency with annuity growth in mid-single digits. Search revenue increased to more than $1 billion this quarter, and we passed an important milestone as our search business reached profitability.
In our devices portfolio, revenue declined 49% and 45% in constant currency, mainly due to Phone revenue, which decreased $1.5 billion. As expected, Surface revenue slowed with the market anticipation of a new Surface Pro device for the holidays. Surface continues to gain ground with businesses and schools, creating opportunities for a rapidly growing partner channel, which includes Accenture, Dell and HP. Both the number and size of deals in our Commercial segment for Surface have increased double digits year-on-year.
This quarter in gaming, revenue grew 6% in constant currency. We saw growth in Xbox LIVE transactional revenue and our first-party game portfolio, offset by declines in hardware revenue due to lower volumes of Xbox 360 consoles sold.
Segment gross margin declined 10% or 4% in constant currency. Gross margin percentages were flat year-over-year, excluding Phone. Segment operating expenses declined 13%, due primarily to lower Phone expense. As a result, segment operating income decreased 4%.
Now back to our overall company results. As usage of our cloud service grows, we will continue to invest capital into our data centers and servers globally. This quarter, we invested $1.5 billion to support that demand-driven growth.
Other income was negative $280 million due in part to foreign currency remeasurements and interest expense. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 21%, below our guided range. This was driven by the change in geographic mix of our earnings and lower nondeductible operating losses associated with Phone. 
This quarter, we returned $6.9 billion to shareholders, up 51%. This includes our recently announced 16% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.36. 
With that overview of the quarter, let's move to the outlook. I'll start with some overall comments and then move to a discussion by segment. First on FX. Based on current rates and the forecasted geographic mix of revenue, we expect 4 points of negative impact on total revenue in Q2. By segment, we expect a 7-point drag in Productivity and Business Processes, 6 points in Intelligent Cloud and 3 points in More Personal Computing. In H2, we expect the impact to lessen to around 3 points in total, weighted toward our segments with the highest percentage of annuity.
Next to our Commercial business, which we expect to remain healthy in Q2. Our annuity mix should trend up with good execution on contract renewals and continued adoption of our Commercial cloud services. Accordingly, we expect Commercial unearned revenue to be within a range of $19.5 billion to $19.7 billion, benefiting from these positive trends.
With the ongoing increase in cloud demand, we expect to accelerate our investment in data centers and capital equipment for the remainder of the fiscal year, expanding geographic coverage and capacity.
Now let me share some additional thoughts on each segment. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $6.6 billion to $6.7 billion, adjusted for 7 points of expected FX impact. The revenue growth reflects continued momentum of Office 365 and our Dynamics portfolio. And as Satya discussed, with our new E5 SKU in Q2, we're expanding our opportunity into security, analytics and voice.
For the Intelligent Cloud segment, we expect revenue of $6.2 billion to $6.3 billion, including a 6-point FX impact. Our hybrid approach continues to drive growth in our server licensing business and robust growth in our services. Gross margin in this segment will reflect the accelerating mix of cloud services.
We expect More Personal Computing revenue to be $12 billion to $12.4 billion, including the 3 points of FX impact. Because of the mix of devices and software in this segment, let me provide a bit more context. First on Windows. Overall in Q2, we expect our OEM business to look similar to Q1, with non-Pro outperforming the underlying PC market. As we move deeper through the fiscal year, the device mix should evolve as our OEM partners produce more models at a wider range of price points. In search, we expect Bing's strong trajectory to continue remaining profitable for the remainder of the year.
We will continue to see the impact of the Phone restructuring. Revenue declines and gross margin percentages in Q2 should look similar to Q1. And with the strong holiday Surface lineup, we expect revenue to grow in Q2. Gross margins will reflect the mix of device lifecycle between Surface 3, Surface Pro 3 and a growing mix of Surface Book and Surface Pro 4. 
We expect COGS to be $9.7 billion to $9.9 billion with variability driven by the device sales. We expect operating expenses between $8 billion and $8.1 billion in Q2. For the full year, we are lowering our guidance to $31.9 billion to $32.1 billion. We are and will continue to thoughtfully reinvest operating expense savings to accelerate growth in key areas to expand our addressable market and transform how we work to better deliver products and services to our customers.
We expect other income and expenses to be negative $300 million in Q2, similar to Q1. This includes the net cost of hedging and interest expense, offset by dividend and interest income. We expect our Q2 and full year tax rate to be between 19% and 21%. Similar to Q1, this reflects the changing geographic mix of revenue as well as lower nondeductible operating losses associated with Phone.
In closing, during Q1, we exceeded our own expectations across many of our businesses, and more importantly, we saw healthy indicators of future growth. Through business model transitions and strategic shift, our solid execution, paired with a focus on achieving our bold ambitions, has enabled us to take share in existing areas while we enter new ones.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Chris for Q&A.",1969

Again, it seems like you're seeing an acceleration in that overall business. And more broadly, it seems like industry-wide, both you guys and AWS are seeing something of an inflection point going on in terms of more and more business accruing to those public cloud environments. So my question is just that. Would you agree with that statement that there is an inflection going on in the business? And if so, what do you think is causing that? And is there a changing nature in how people are using that cloud? And then maybe for Amy. Is there something we should bear in mind in terms of your traditional business, sort of the on-premise business that maybe impacted as that inflection takes place that we should bear in mind as you go forward?",152

Keith, thanks for the question. Overall, what we have seen is the public cloud or cloud infrastructure makes it much more possible for businesses of all sizes and developers of all sizes to get at infrastructure with much less friction than ever before. I grew up in our server business in the past. We were definitely the ones who democratized servers by bringing servers to small businesses. But when I think about what's happening, for example, in Office 365, where we're adding 50,000 small business customers, who now get the most sophisticated server technology, but now as a SaaS service, that's what's really happening world over with all application categories, and that's where the growth is. I don't know long term whether there is a zero-sum equation, but in the -- right now and in the intermediate time frame, we see, in our case, growth in both sides. And in our case, the vision also we have for distributed cloud infrastructure is just that. It is distributed. So we don't think of our server as a legacy business. I think of it as the edge of our cloud. If you look at what we're doing with SQL, we will have the ability for any customer of SQL to stretch even a single table from between their on-premise to the cloud. Those are the kinds of things that we are excited about. But we clearly are seeing very rapid growth and adoption of our Azure cloud. But in our case, there are 2 unique aspects: one is this true distributed hybrid; and second is we don't think of Azure in isolation. We think about it in the combination of Office 365, Dynamics EMS, because really, it's one cloud infrastructure, first of all, from a capital perspective that serves all of these. And there's a virtuous cycle between all of these for our customers as well.",317

As Satya said, I do expect both to grow, both the on-premise and the cloud, but I expect the mix to increasingly shift toward the cloud, given its sort of robust growth rate which will impact the gross margin percentage over time.",61

Let me -- related. Let me give you the first one. The commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate grew slightly from $8 billion to $8.2 billion or more than each of those. You had Office 365, Azure, Dynamics CRM Online, all of them seem to be growing very fast. How should we think about the difference? Should we figure that the run rate reaccelerates next year -- next quarter, excuse me? And then I have a follow-up.",79

For me, that is more symbolic of how you should think about the pace, and that is a very fast number on an increasingly growing base.",55

The second one is that cloud margins improved nicely. Given the data that's in here it looks like they all started to move up. Azure seems to move up. You'd said in the FAM, the gross margins for '15 should be about 44%. How should we think about cloud gross margins for '15? I know you don't know obviously the mix of all the cloud products, but how should we think about the improvement there?",79

Looking in the old segments I know you all have done, we saw year-over-year improvement in the overall commercial other segment that we disclosed this time too of about 10 points year-over-year. We saw sequential improvement from Q4 to Q1. We're still focused on continuing to have that sequential improvement, and especially as some of the things Satya talked about, which is the addition of premium services, the pace of innovation especially on the premium end. And if you think about our launch of E5, which is a premium SKU in Office 365, it continues to give us the opportunity to both get more efficient in the infrastructure and to add higher-margin products especially at the SaaS end.",120

Just the one thing that's structurally, I think, that we think a lot about and we are very disciplined about is our capital allows us to build all of the cloud services from Office 365 to EMS to Dynamics to Azure. And that diversity of workloads long term is what lead to margin improvement, and there will be changes in seasonality from quarter-to-quarter. But structurally, those 2 things the diversity of what we are doing and how capital is utilized across all of it is, I think, a big structural differentiator for us.",94

Satya, you talked about the good adoption of Office 365 on the commercial side, both in the SMBs and larger enterprise. Wonder if you could just sort of break that down and sort of where you're seeing the faster adoption as you start to get into the enterprises, especially that might have enterprise agreements with Microsoft. How is that sales motion going and sort of what is the pitch there? And then to Amy, I thought this was a key point I know we've been looking for. You noted that the subscription recurring business now has offset the cannibalization on the license. Is that kind of something that we should think about going forward? Or was there something specific about this quarter that would push that out?",138

First, as far as the Office 365 usage itself, I talked about some of the numbers of 60 million monthly active users, the fact that our seats grew 66% year-over-year, the small business number I talked about, the 50,000 per month additional customers that we're adding to Office 365. These are all the growth numbers in the usage growth numbers, the mix even, that information protection, I mean, that's just another very important point, which is amongst the customers who are using Office 365, already 20 million are using some of these premium services like information protection, and of course, we're going to further expand that with new SKUs and new categories that are going to become part of Office 365. So I see that stretching on both sides, which is to small business on one end and then these premium SKUs on the other end. And we see nice attach as far as EAs to the cloud as well, and that's definitely a big driver of our growth.",170

One of the important things that's distinct about the small business market is that there tends not be much of a lag in terms of buying and deployment. They kind of want to be able to instantaneously use and get value very quickly, and that's something we've actually seen and a real testament to our ability to add so many customers in every quarter. And what you've seen on the consumer side, which it was an important point, once we've built the installed base up to 18 million users on the consumer side, that recurring rate does, in fact, offset the deferral from new. And so it is an important inflection point for us this quarter.",131

I was wondering, Satya, if you could give us a sense for just a high-level commentary about the split of IaaS versus PaaS and Azure, and maybe some color on the growth you see in each of those and how you see them evolving. And then the second question would be related to the launch of Windows 10. You gave the Bing example for the month of September and the solid pull forward there or pull along there. Just wondering if you could share with us any other areas where you're seeing a similar kind of pull along with Windows 10 adoption.",108
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2015",2015-10-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3688.0,880706.0,37769919.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,21,"So Heather, on the first one on the mix between IaaS and PaaS and SaaS, the thing that we're seeing is quite frankly, all of these are growing, but the most interesting thing for me as a pattern is growth in IaaS leads to growth in other PaaS services or SaaS services. I mean, just to put very concretely, take something like Azure Active Directory. That's probably the best manifestation of the virtuous cycle that we see in any of the cloud adoptions that we have, right? It could be someone coming from Office 365, it can be someone coming from Azure, Dynamics, EMS. All of those tenants get into Azure Active Directory, which is our largest PaaS service, because it's got even developer API. So that means more developers are using it, more IT professionals are using it as a controlled play. So that's the network effect that we see when it comes to the PaaS services. And then in terms of infrastructure itself -- and again, I said, there's people who are tiering even applications, people who build hybrid applications where the storage could be even on-premise in some cases, but the mid-tier and the Web and the mobile back-ends are in the cloud. We see a lot of growth there. We see lot of growth in our data, both in terms of infrastructure, but in the new services like our Data Lake services, which are PaaS services. Hadoop is another good example. We see lots of Hadoop usage inside of IaaS, but we also see HDInsight growth. So I would say there is real good mix of those two. And then on Windows 10, the -- I mean, I'm very, very excited obviously about what's happening with Bing. I think Amy talked about, we had $1 billion quarter with 29% growth and good share position growth in the United States. That's fantastic to see. But gaming is the other place where we talked about Xbox LIVE, now that spans both console and PC. We see increased engagement because of that. We see, in fact, increased engagement with titles like Minecraft. So we have some high hopes for what we can achieve with engagement around Xbox LIVE across the console plus PC.",374

And I'm curious if you're starting to see a halo impact, where those that are looking to move up are saying ""We want to go with more of the complete infrastructure set?"" And are you seeing different sales motions among those enterprise customers as those customers are coming back to you?",83

I mean, that is absolutely the fact -- our case. That is, we are seeing a much faster adoption cycle, obviously, starting with the consumer side but even the 8 million business PCs that were already running Windows 10 before we had started. In fact, the push on enterprise, we expect the enterprise deployment to start in earnest next -- the beginning of the next calendar year or the second half of this fiscal year. But to your point, the fact that there's pull already is a very, very good indicator of, and a good sign, and it's even better than what we saw with Windows 7. And so to me, that's all positive news and -- but yet we are very, very focused on delivering, I think, new value to the enterprise customers, because if you look at Windows 10, we've already talked a lot about all the consumer value. But just take security itself, I think that Windows 10 represents a real breakthrough in terms of security on the endpoint as well as in embedded, which we are very excited about in terms of driving the enterprise upgrade cycle.",193

And a lot of that was premium-driven. Now I have a distinction between a price question that you sort of asked versus seeing the value of a premium SKU. And so I do think it was premium-driven as opposed to sort of a price-driven in particular.",74

Yet it feels like as early as this first quarter, it's creating a lift at least to the Windows OEM business. And I just wanted to understand what's changed in the last 3 months such that it's having an earlier-than-expected positive impact on Microsoft.",81

Why don't I take that and Satya can add? In particular, what we saw this quarter was really as much about the mix of the devices that the OEMs are bringing to market as it was in the absolute unit distinction. And you saw that in the non-Pro revenue performance. And so for us, I think really the way to think about the early signs of the impact were the strong device mix, some higher-priced units across a wide variety of OEMs as we build into holiday did provide some slightly better-than-expected results, as you noted, in the non-Pro business. But really, some of the other upside that we saw in the quarter was from things that are the second sort of derivative of that, which was our search results were better than we had thought, because of some of these results about where the PCs were upgraded and the pace at which they were upgraded. And so I do think we are encouraged as Satya said. But it's -- we're a quarter in, and I think what's exciting for us is really the opportunity we have going forward. We're excited about Q2 when the devices hit the shelves. We're excited to have so many first-party devices in Q2. And then the next stage after that, which is really the enterprise deployment, which as Satya mentioned, we expect in the second half of the year. So it's early but you're right, we did see some incremental improvement over what we expected.",253

You talked about this quarter seeing growth ahead of the PC market. You alluded to a diversity of devices coming in the second half. How do you think about that variable in the model, say beyond this sort of launch period where you had a little bit of a different mix going on in the devices and you get to more of a steady-state out in kind of years 2 or 3 of the Windows 10 launch? Do you think you can grow ahead of the PC market? Or do you think -- I know for the last few years, you've grown below the PC market. Just wondering how we should think about that.",135

Let me talk a little bit about what I said in my outlook. This quarter as I just talked about, the non-Pro outperformance versus the market was really due to a higher revenue per license. I expect that actually to continue in Q2. I expect our overall Pro business to remain in line with business PCs. Once we work through sort the end of XP bump, that really should be in line. And as we talked about as we move through the year, I do expect things to more normalize overall in terms of RPL comparisons. But I do think that's probably the best way to think about the curve over the course of the year.",118

Or would that decline as you see the transition over to cloud in productivity specifically?",68

21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2015",2015-10-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3688.0,880706.0,37769938.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,40,"Okay, good. The trend we saw there, as I said, we're 5% up on a constant currency basis. That was sort of 70% cloud minus 8% on-prem. That's a trend that's not new for us. We've thought about making this transition as quickly as possible. But what we're seeing, which you heard us talk about, was a transition to sort of increasing premium mix, selling more workloads, doing all of that while we're growing the installed base. So to think back to how we've talked about the long term -- the lifetime value equation, it's those components that I really think about proving out over the time, and we have lots of encouraging signs about that. New users, Satya referenced on the small business and mid-market side. Premium mix, we talked about how many premium services we're now selling. And then in terms of renewals, yeah, they're quite good, which we talked about. And so I think all of those, when you talk about should we expect it to -- sort of the traditional business to be in decline, I don't think that's new. I think what's important is our ability to switch it to the services and add more over time that I really focus on.",207

I'm wondering if you could just comment on that so that we can try to maintain a consistent analysis there if it's relevant. And also Satya, now that SQL Server has taken over this #1 position in the Gartner quadrant for the database market, could you help us understand how the road map evolves from here, as we did notice Amazon made its debut also in the leaders quadrant. And I think we're trying to understand how the movement to cloud platforms like Azure could further alter the database landscape and how you could capitalize on that.",117
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2015",2015-10-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3688.0,880706.0,37769941.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,43,"I'll go first. I mean I think the data architecture that underlies what's happening in the enterprise underneath applications is going through a dramatic change. That said, the relational database itself remains still a very strong component, but not the only component anymore, both on-premise and off premise. And what we want to make sure as a company is to cover all of that landscape with a very rich data platform. So if you look at what we're doing, the length and breadth of our ambition as well as our delivery today, everything from what SQL itself is doing, we have now all in-memory workloads for OLTP, BI, data warehousing built in. We have the ability to now tier even the database with the cloud. This is all the things that are coming in SQL 2016, and we are excited about that. When it comes to the cloud itself, we have a PaaS service for SQL, which is very unique in terms of SQL Azure. We have now the Data Lake service for basically petabyte, exabyte scale data management. We have higher-level data services like Azure ML, which is about advanced analytics, a category we didn't even participate in the past. So we've entered that category. Revolution R fits into that. So we have a very rich story, and this is not even talking about some of the other end-user BI capabilities like Power BI. So I think we have a very rich vision in execution on what is an expanding data platform opportunity. And it's nice to see us innovate on the new services, while we also in what is still the big market, which is the relational database market claim a leadership position.",286

Total bookings, because the volatility frankly in consumer businesses and times like the holiday periods, it can make it far more volatile than usually what many of you have been asking for, which is sort of the continuity and health of the overall commercial business. If you want to get to total bookings, you just add back in all the consumer revenue, it's technically how you would do it. But I do think the more helpful KPI for us in terms of bookings is the commercial one.",112

The first one, just your comment that the consumer Office business, you're seeing basically the subscription revenue now being larger and -- than the offset, if you will, on the license side. Where do we stand with regard to that on the commercial side of the Office transition?",54
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2015",2015-10-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3688.0,880706.0,37769945.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,47,"The way to think about that, how I look at -- well, the way I would generally say it is if you look at each of the KPIs we give, so the Office commercial business grew 5%. It was negative 8%. There's some transition earning back off the balance sheet. The total cloud is 70%. When we start to get to this point and the percentage we already have in the cloud, it is really an offset. And that's probably frankly been through a little bit longer than we talked about technically in terms of what goes off and what comes on, given we've now got, as Satya said, 60 million users and more than that in terms of seats sold. Now that can technically, Ross, be interesting in certain quarters of the year where we have very heavy expirations. And so it just depends year-over-year. That's why the commercial's slightly harder to do it on, because there's some volatility in the ins and outs based on seasonality.",168

Would that be a fair statement?",44

Because so much of our installed base was already on an annuity contract, it makes this transition mathematically hard. I think what you're asking is specifically, for our transactional component. When the old transactional component has gone, but it's a very hard -- but that's a component of the number, not the total. So it's why it's technically difficult to answer the question you're specifically asking, Ross. But the way I would think about it is we are moving such a substantive piece of our EI business and with our annuity mix all up in commercial, up to 86%, we're feeling very good about our ability to transition people, add LTV and grow the business overall at a very high level.",136
