Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and Carolyn Frantz, our new Deputy General Counsel, Corporate Secretary.
On the Microsoft Investor Relations website you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provide the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. This quarter, we incurred a tax charge related to the enactment of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act. We have excluded the impact of this tax charge in our non-GAAP net income and earnings per share metrics. These non-GAAP financial metrics should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's second quarter performance in addition to the impact that these items and events had on the financial results.
All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only.
  
We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until January 31, 2019.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during the conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.",416

Our results this quarter speak to us picking the right secular trends and markets and following that up with focused innovation and execution. The intelligent cloud and intelligent edge paradigm is fast becoming a reality. Azure growth accelerated. LinkedIn growth accelerated. Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365 are driving our growth and transforming the workplace. Xbox is reaching new customers with new offers.
With that as a backdrop, I want to highlight key areas of innovation and growth across our customer solutions. Every CEO I talk to is keen to start their transformation journey by empowering their employees and creating a modern workplace. They want productivity and collaboration tools that deliver continuous innovation and do so securely. Spectre and Meltdown are the latest instances in an increasingly complex threat environment. Our investments to make Windows 10 the most secure, always up-to-date operating system enabled us to move quickly to protect customers in the face of these threats.
Protecting customers will continue to be a top priority. Our continued commitment to operational security and advanced technology is one reason customers like BP, Goodyear, PayPal are choosing Microsoft 365. MasterCard chose Microsoft 365 to empower employees and inspire teamwork with integrated apps like Teams, Yammer and SharePoint. We're infusing AI across Microsoft 365 with the simple goal of helping people do their best work. Insights in Excel is a new service that uses machine learning to detect and highlight patterns. Translator brings 60 languages to Word. We are helping people be more productive on-the-go on any platform with real-time co-authoring in Office apps on iOS, Android and now the Mac.
And just this month, we announced that dictation will be available across multiple apps in Office 365, empowering users to write freely using only their voice. We are making voice a first-class input for productivity. Cortana can help manage your e-mail by pulling up important e-mails, reading them aloud and letting you reply using just your voice. We're also bringing Cortana's intelligence to Outlook mobile app, notifying you when it's time to leave a meeting to get to your next one based on your location and traffic. Mixed Reality empowers employees with new immersive experiences. Enterprise customers like Mercedes-Benz in Germany are using Mixed Reality to transform training, helping maintenance technicians learn everything from guided brake repair to how components in a new diesel engine work.
We are expanding our opportunity with Microsoft 365 for organizations of all types and sizes. Take first-line workers. Leading global telecommunications, retail and hospitality companies, such as BT, Target, Panera Bread and Delta Global Services all chose Office 365 to maximize the impact of their first-line workforce. In education, we are empowering every student with new learning tools natively built into Office 365 to improve reading, writing and comprehension as well as mixed reality experiences for immersive learning. This quarter, we launched Surface LTE and unveiled a new generation of always-on, always-connected Windows 10 PCs from our OEM partners. With up to 20 days of standby power, this new category of PCs deeply integrated with Cortana and with new near-field and far-field capability will fundamentally change productivity.
Now I'll turn to LinkedIn and business applications. As we pass the 1-year mark of Microsoft and LinkedIn uniting the world's leading professional cloud with the world's leading professional network, LinkedIn continues its strong trajectory with accelerating revenue growth and record levels of engagement, the fifth consecutive quarter of more than 20% sessions growth. Appetite for conversations across the platform continues to grow, from sharing in the feed to video to one-on-one messages sent, all up more than 60% year-over-year. This increased engagement across the platform is driving strong growth in demand for sponsored content and marketing solutions and record levels of job postings and job visitors in Talent Solutions.
LinkedIn is continually creating new ways for members to connect and engage with one another, such as this quarter's launch of Career Advice. From the deeper integration of Sales Navigator and Dynamics 365 for Sales and Dynamics for Talent to the launch of Profile Card to bring personalized LinkedIn insights directly into Office 365 to the new Resume Assistant, I'm excited about the many ways in which we are delivering powerful customer and member experiences that leverage both the Microsoft and LinkedIn graphs.
We continue to see good momentum in Dynamics 365 with revenue growth of 67% year-over-year. Our modern and modular business process applications are resonating with customers, driving digital transformation. Park Place Technologies, a global leader in data center support, chose Dynamics 365 along with LinkedIn Sales Navigator integration. And United Technologies and Columbia Sportswear chose Dynamics 365 and Azure for their digital transformation.
Now I'll talk about cloud and AI. As intelligent cloud/intelligent edge becomes more predominant, our architectural advantage is increasingly clear to our customers. You see this reflected in the latest CIO surveys as well as in our 98% Azure revenue growth this quarter. Only Microsoft delivers hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities and trusted security and compliance. This architectural advantage helps us address both existing enterprise workloads and new workloads, such as IoT and edge AI. To thrive in this new era, customers need a consistent stack across public cloud and the edge, a model Azure Stack uniquely enables.
Since broad availability just a few months ago, we are seeing incredible customer demand for Azure Stack across a diverse set of industries, including Schlumberger, ABB, Mitsui Knowledge Industry. We're democratizing data science and AI so any organization can convert their data into actionable insights and drive competitive advantage. Azure Cosmos DB is the first globally distributed multimodal database. It is unique in its support for a new class of low-latency, event-based serverless applications. Azure Databricks brings leading Apache Spark-based analytics. Our new SQL Server on Linux is off to a strong start with more than 5 million downloads and will bring more developers to the SQL ecosystem longer term.
To thrive in a world with millions of intelligent endpoints, every company needs an IoT strategy. Microsoft is giving customers comprehensive solutions to help them realize the promise of connected world of devices and things. Azure IoT Central is the first global-scale SaaS offering that enables customers to build intelligent, secure, enterprise-grade IoT app in hours. Azure Event Grid simplifies the creation of event-driven IoT solutions across millions of endpoints. Azure IoT Edge enables customers to run serverless computing and machine learning models at the edge.
Chevron is using Azure IoT to harness massive amounts of data from its oil fields to accelerate deployment of new intelligent solutions for oil exploration and to manage thousands of oil wells worldwide, increasing revenue and improving safety and reliability of their operations. Kohler is building connected, voice-activated products powered by Azure IoT. And Johnson Controls is using large-scale device management capabilities in Azure IoT and Windows IoT for their new smart GLAS thermostat with Cortana voice control.
We reached the human parity milestone in machine reading comprehension using the Stanford Question Answer Dataset benchmark, which is the ability for AI to read a document and answer questions about it. We're using this and other AI advances to address some of society's most stressing challenges by partnering broadly across industries.
In health care, we are partnering with Adaptive Biotechnologies to build a practical solution for mapping the human immune system to detect cancer and other diseases in their earlier stages. We have created a HIPAA-compliant health bot powered by Azure Cognitive Services to assist with questions about health insurance, symptoms and location on nearby doctors. Aurora Health Care, UPMC, Premera Blue Cross have already signed on.
In retail, Kroger is using Azure to power their digital grocery store display solution for real-time pricing and promotions based on customer data to boost sales. Lowe's autonomous in-store robot uses Azure to keep constant tabs on inventory and identify out-of-stock or misplaced items, freeing store employees to focus on their customers. And Publicis Groupe's new AI platform built on Azure and Office 365 will empower their 80,000 employees worldwide.
Now let me turn to gaming. Our new Xbox One X was the top-selling premium console this holiday in the United States, and we saw strong sales of Xbox One S. We will continue to innovate in console to attract high-value gamers who want immersive 4K experiences to build a broader subscription service with Game Pass and to extend our services to all devices in our customers' lives across the console, PC and mobile. Our decision to release exclusive game content on the Xbox Game Pass simultaneously with global release increases the value of the subscription for members and our partners, and we are off to a very good start. We grew gamer engagement again this quarter with 59 million monthly active Xbox LIVE members, record usage of our Xbox LIVE services, record viewers of our new streaming service, Mixer, and record Minecraft users.
Finally, we just acquired PlayFab, which serves more than 700 million gamers with more than 1,200 games from companies like Disney, Rovio and Atari. It's a complete back-end platform for mobile, PC and console game developers to build, launch and scale cloud-connected games, extending our investments in Azure to provide a world-class cloud platform for the gaming industry.
Before I turn over to Amy, I want to reflect on a topic that is at the forefront of every customer conversation that I have. In an era where there is rapid transformation driven by digital technology, customers are looking for a trusted partner, someone with a business model that is aligned with their long-term interests, deep technical innovation and an understanding of the responsibility that goes along with this innovation. This perhaps is one of our key differentiators. Internally, we have a saying, ""Microsoft runs on trust,"" and we strive to earn it every day with all of the constituents we serve.
Now I'll hand it over to Amy, who will cover our financial results in more detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining you for the questions later.",1685
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2018",2018-01-31,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3691.0,1378995.0,55114844.0,Presenter Speech,Amy Hood,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. Our second quarter revenue was $28.9 billion, up 12% and 11% in constant currency with better-than-expected performance across all segments. Gross margin increased 12%. Operating income increased 10%. This quarter, we incurred a tax charge of $13.8 billion related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding that, earnings per share was $0.96, increasing 20%. We achieved another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth as we continued to realize the impact of strategic growth investments along with strong sales execution.
At a company level, LinkedIn contributed approximately 4 points of revenue growth and 5 points of gross margin growth with minimal impact on operating income growth. Excluding the cost of amortization of acquired intangibles, LinkedIn contributed $111 million operating income and continues to be accretive to EPS this fiscal year, ahead of our original expectations.
Across most geographies, our results were in line with overall improving macroeconomic trends. Large markets, including the U.S., Western Europe and France, performed better than expected driven by commercial cloud momentum. Our sales teams and channel partners delivered another quarter of outstanding commercial results, even as we continue to work through our sales reorganization from July.
Our commercial revenue annuity mix improved by 3 points year-over-year to 86% with healthy renewal rates. Commercial bookings increased 7% and 4% in constant currency even with a 20% smaller underlying expirations base. Commercial unearned revenue came in slightly higher-than-expected at more than $20.2 billion from growth in multiyear customer commitments to Azure. Commercial cloud revenue was $5.3 billion, growing 56% year-over-year with broad-based growth across geographic markets and customer segments. Gross margin increased by 7 points to 55%, in line with seasonal trends. We improved gross margin percentage in each cloud service, and Azure again saw the most significant margin improvement this quarter.
Company gross margin was 62% and flat year-over-year. Sales mix of higher-margin products and services, including better-than-expected performance from Windows Server and Windows OEM Pro, combined with improving cloud margins offset the impact of a growing mix of cloud revenue, LinkedIn amortization cost and device launches.
The FX impact on company and segment revenue growth was in line with expectation. The weaker U.S. dollar increased revenue growth by less than 1 point. FX had only 1 point of impact on operating expense growth, less than expected. This quarter, operating expenses grew 14% and 13% in constant currency with 10 points of growth from LinkedIn, including $154 million of amortization expense. We continued to increase investments in cloud engineering, AI and sales capacity to drive future growth.
Now to the segment results. Productivity and Business Processes revenue grew 25% and 24% in constant currency to $9 billion, slightly better than expected, fueled by LinkedIn revenue acceleration. LinkedIn contributed 15 points of growth. Office commercial revenue grew double digits again this quarter, increasing 10% year-over-year. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 41% from an installed base growth across all customer segments and ARPU expansion from continued customer migration to higher-value offers in the E3 and E5 workloads. Office 365 commercial seats grew 30%, in line with the expected trend given the increasing size of the base.
Office consumer revenue increased 12% and 11% in constant currency driven by Office 365 recurring subscription revenue and growth in our subscriber base, now at 29.2 million. Our Dynamics business grew 10% and 9% in constant currency driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 67% and 68% in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue for the quarter was better than expected at $1.3 billion driven by strong sales execution across all LinkedIn services. We saw continued strength in user engagement, customer acquisition, renewals and upsell performance.
Segment gross margin dollars increased 24% and 23% in constant currency with 14 points of contribution from LinkedIn, including the impact of $222 million of amortization expense. Gross margin percentage decreased slightly due to the impact of LinkedIn-related amortization expense and the increased mix of cloud services.
Operating expenses grew 41%, 39% in constant currency with 33 points of contribution from LinkedIn, including $154 million of amortization expense. Excluding LinkedIn, operating expenses increased on cloud engineering and sales capacity investments. Operating income increased 9% and 10% in constant currency with only 2 points of negative impact from LinkedIn.
The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered $7.8 billion of revenue, growing 15% with better-than-expected performance driven by hybrid cloud. Server products and cloud services revenue grew 18% with another quarter of double-digit annuity revenue growth. Azure revenue growth accelerated to 98%, with Azure premium services revenue growing triple digits for the 14th consecutive quarter. Enterprise Services revenue grew 5% and 3% in constant currency as growth in Premier Support services and Microsoft consulting services was partially offset by declines in custom support agreements for Windows Server 2003.
Segment gross margin dollars grew 13%, and gross margin percentage declined slightly as the impact of increasing cloud revenue mix was mostly offset by material improvement in Azure gross margin. Operating expenses grew 3% and 2% in constant currency from ongoing investments in sales capacity and cloud engineering. Operating income increased 24%.
In More Personal Computing, revenue was $12.2 billion, up 2% with better-than-expected results driven by Windows and search. Excluding phone, revenue grew 4%. Our Windows OEM business grew 4% this quarter, better than we expected. OEM Pro revenue reflects a stronger-than-anticipated commercial PC market bolstered by improved macro conditions and continued healthy enterprise Windows 10 deployments. We benefited as well from higher mix of premium licenses and the timing of license purchases.
OEM non-Pro revenue was down 5 points, below the stabilizing consumer PC market. We continued to see growth in the premium category in line with the market, but heightened price competition of entry-level devices contributed to lower volumes. Inventory levels remained in the normal range.
Windows commercial products and cloud services declined 4% and 5% in constant currency mainly due to the impact of a large deal in the prior year. Search revenue ex TAC grew 15% from higher revenue per search driven by continued optimization of our advertising platform and search volume growth in both the U.S. and international markets.
Surface revenue grew 1%, roughly flat in constant currency, as we continue to transition our portfolio towards Surface Laptop, Pro with LTE and the new Surface Book 2. This holiday quarter, gaming revenue grew 8%, mainly driven by hardware revenue growth of 14%, 13% in constant currency from the launch of our premium console, the Xbox One X. Xbox software and services revenue growth was 4% with continued monetization growth partially offset by a prior year first-party AAA title launches.
Segment gross margin dollars were roughly flat year-over-year with the decline in gaming offset by growth in search and Surface. Segment gross margin percentage declined as expected with the console launch. Operating expenses increased 2% and 1% in constant currency from growth in engineering investments in search, AI and gaming that were partially offset by declines in Windows marketing and phone expenses. Operating income declined 2%. As a reminder, Q2 was the last quarter of phone comparability given the sale of feature phone business last year.
Now back to the overall company results. As expected, our capital expenditures, including finance leases, increased sequentially to $3.3 billion due to higher levels of customer demand and usage for our cloud services. Cash paid for property and equipment was $2.6 billion. Free cash flow generation -- free cash flow grew this quarter 23% driven by operating cash flow growth of 25%. Free cash flow increased from higher customer collections following strong billings growth, working capital improvements in the hardware business and contribution from LinkedIn. Other income and expenses was $490 million this quarter, more than planned due to higher interest income. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate this quarter was 18%, lower than anticipated, driven by an audit settlement as well as the normal variability between service and license revenue mix, geographic revenue mix and the timing of equity vest. We returned $5 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends.
Now let's turn to next quarter's outlook. Assuming rates -- assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by 2 points, COGS by 1 point and operating expenses by 1 point. With positive IT spend signals, a strengthening commercial PC market and growing customer demand for hybrid cloud services, we expect our commercial business to remain strong as we drive annuity growth, expand our installed base and execute well on renewals. We expect commercial unearned revenue to be down approximately 2% to 3% sequentially, in line with historic seasonality. And our Q3 expiry base will return to year-over-year growth, impacting commercial bookings growth.
Third, CapEx. We will increase our capital expenditures to support increasing demand and capacity requirements. On an accrual dollar basis, we expect a sequential dollar increase next quarter. We expect year-over-year improvement in overall commercial cloud gross margin as Azure margin improvement continues to offset an increasing mix of Azure revenue.
In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $8.6 billion and $8.8 billion. Both Office commercial and consumer revenue growth will be driven by Office 365 with growth rates for each consistent with Q2. We expect double-digit Dynamics revenue growth from the shift to Dynamics 365. LinkedIn should deliver approximately $1.2 billion, growing more than 20%.
In Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $7.55 billion and $7.75 billion, with strong double-digit revenue growth in server products and cloud services. In Enterprise Services, we expect a revenue growth rate similar to Q2 as growth in Premier Support should offset the decline of Windows 2003 custom support agreements. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $9.1 billion and $9.4 billion. In Windows, we expect OEM revenue to be largely in line with the total PC market. Both OEM Pro revenue and non-Pro revenue should be impacted by similar dynamics seen in Q2.
Now to devices. Surface revenue should grow year-over-year from continued launch momentum from the latest Surface Pro, Book and Laptop, but decline sequentially consistent with holiday seasonality. In search ex TAC, we expect a similar strong rate of revenue growth to Q2. In gaming, we expect revenue growth similar to last quarter but with a revenue mix shift to software and services and continued year-over-year growth of our Xbox LIVE user base. We expect COGS between $9 billion and $9.2 billion, including 1 point of FX headwind. We expect operating expenses of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion, including 1 point of FX headwind. Given the opportunity ahead of us and our execution to date, we will continue to invest in intelligent cloud, intelligent edge, AI and our sales teams to drive sustainable top line growth. Other income and expense should be approximate $350 million as we continue to take gains in our equities portfolio and earn dividend and interest income. This is lower than we previously expected, reflecting the impact of rising interest rates on our fixed income portfolio.
Now a few comments on the fiscal year. First, given our outperformance in the first half of the year, we are now ahead of our previous expectation for full year gross margin. We are now trending to be roughly flat year-over-year, including LinkedIn. Second, we still expect full year operating expenses, including LinkedIn, between $36.4 billion and $36.7 billion. We are confident in this investment given our significant growth opportunities, consistent execution and strong competitive position. Third, on operating margin. We are again trending ahead of our previous guidance. We now expect company operating margin, including LinkedIn, to be slightly up year-over-year. Excluding LinkedIn, company operating margin should improve by more than 1 point.
Fourth, tax rate. Based on our current understanding of the recently enacted tax law, we now expect our effective tax rate for H2 to be 16%, plus or minus 2 points. For FY '19, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be slightly below the new U.S. corporate rate of 21% due to the impact of tax law provisions effective for us July 1, 2018. We will continue to have quarterly variability based on the mix of service and license revenue, geographic mix of revenue and the timing of equity vests.
Finally, we remain consistent in our ongoing commitment to capital return. As always, we believe the highest shareholder value is created first through organic and inorganic investment to pursue the significant market opportunities ahead and are proud of our resource allocation changes and the results. And we've been focused on capital return through both dividend and share repurchase as a key part of our commitment to total shareholder return for many years. With the recent tax reform, we can continue that commitment without the need to access the capital markets.
Before turning to Q&A, I have one special thank you. Chris Suh is moving to a new role as the senior finance leader of our Azure and Server business. On behalf of the company, thank you for your significant impact on Investor Relations for the past 5 years. And I'd like to welcome Mike Spencer, the former finance leader of our Office 365 business, as the new head of Investor Relations. We look forward to having you lead the team.

And it wasn't just the amazing Azure performance. Your on-prem server product business accelerated despite the cautious commentary about a tough comp on the last call. Even Enterprise Services was plus 3 instead of flat, and your guide actually suggests that, that goodness in Intelligent Cloud should continue next quarter despite actually a way tougher comp. So I'm just curious, Amy or Satya, if there are any threads that you can weave through this Intelligent Cloud outperformance, if you saw any broader increase in enterprise spend in the December quarter, any change in behavior. Or is all of this goodness a little bit more Microsoft-specific? Amy, you called out IT spending signals, so I'm guessing maybe a little bit was macro.",148

Let me start and Amy can add. For me, it all comes down to really having an architectural advantage on what is a new secular trend. So when we think about the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge and then bring that to the Azure business, you can see it at each layer. When it comes to infrastructure, we're the only cloud provider that provides true hybrid cloud computing with Azure and Azure Stack. When it comes to the data tier, we have real uniqueness. Take something like Cosmos DB. It's the only planet-scale database that's multimodal, supports these new programming models of serverless and event-driven programming. Take SQL. What we are seeing in terms of SQL growth, in terms of Azure DB as well as SQL Server and SQL Server on Linux, that's, again, addressing the customer needs. There are new workloads that are being born that require both the cloud and the edge, IoT being a great example of that. And especially when you take that in combination with AI, again, you train on the cloud and you score on the edge. That's a real competitive advantage. We have everything from sort of the life cycle management of how these models get created and deployed and so on. So I think that's what you're seeing. There will be variability quarter-to-quarter. There will be mix differences. But overall, when I look at what is it that we need to get done is innovate on what is a fundamental architectural advantage to where the world is going.",259
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2018",2018-01-31,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3691.0,1378995.0,55114849.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,8,"And I would say, Karl, a couple of things. We've been investing here both in engineering to land the differentiation that Satya just talked about in sales resources and in continuing to invest in technical sales resources that can help our customers be successful in these deployments. I actually think you're continuing to see the impact of those investments growing in time and growing in expertise. And so I feel encouraged both by the technical differentiation but also the return on the investments we've made here that lead us to have a good amount of confidence that you do see in the guide in Q3. And yes, you're right. We do have a tougher comparable particularly on prem in Q3, which is correct.",123

And Chris, it's been great working with you. Sorry to see you go from this role. As for my questions, one question for Satya, and starting a little bit narrow and maybe running off from there. Gaming in the quarter, seems to have had a good quarter for gaming with the Xbox launch. But more broadly, there's some murmurings out there about Xbox falling behind PlayStation if you look at the sort of the bases of those 2 consoles. There's murmurings about not having enough kind of exclusive games on the console. I know you sort of mixed up the leadership a little bit there. How do you feel about your positioning in gaming from a narrow focus? And then more broadly, how are you guys feeling about your position in the home, if you will? When I go home, I'm talking to Alexa, not talking to Cortana. Is that something that you're comfortable with where we are today? Is that something we should see improving on a going-forward basis?",177

So let me take both of those questions. So on gaming, we feel good about Xbox One X, the premium console launch. We also feel good about the volume we got for Xbox One S because we always wanted that halo effect of the premium console driving even the lower-end console because that creates the sockets for gaming for us. But our real strategy going forward is not only to do great work on the console, but to complement that with the work we're doing on the PC. PC gaming is a growth market. And so therefore, you see us whether it's our subscription offer, whether it's our streaming efforts that are increasingly bringing the console plus PC together and then not stopping there but going to other devices. So for example, mobile. Minecraft on mobile, we just launched, in fact, in the last quarter in China. We are seeing tremendous growth of Minecraft expansion on mobile platform in China. So overall, you will see us do good work on console. We'll compete there. But more importantly, we have a much more broader gaming view in terms of what value we can add with our subscription services, streaming services across all devices. And one other point, I think, I made in my remarks earlier is gaming also is a growth area for Azure. In other words, we have now increasing PaaS services that we are going to reinforce on Azure and attract more game developers. Some of the know-how that we have from Xbox is not just about the Xbox, but it's going to help developers across the board. So that, I think, will also transcend or lead into even media companies. So we are very excited about some of what we can get out of our investments in gaming. So that's our focus on gaming. In terms of Cortana and home, I think it's probably important, although the question I'll ask is -- you asked it narrowly, but my investments are much broader. In other words, I first start by saying let's make sure our best AI capability, whether it's speech, whether it's ultimately even image recognition and dialogue management because right now most assistants are fairly dumb in terms of just doing one-turn dialogue, but where we're going to go is multi-turn dialogue and that requires real natural language understanding. So all of those investments, for example, are available on Azure as Cognitive Services. I even referenced in my remarks how in health care, people are using those to build bots and skills and agents. That's where we will make sure we do our best building blocks and AI work. Of course, it will manifest for us with Cortana as an agent for Microsoft that has some special skills, especially around that crossover between work and life. Most agents and their knowledge of smarts come from the data access they have. In our case, it's going to be about things that are there in Office 365: the people, places, things and how we reason about it and help users whether they're at home or whether they're at work. Lastly, even when it comes to devices, we want to take an approach that brings all assistants. That's why we are working with Alexa. We would welcome it on our devices because we believe in a world where our own assistant should be available everywhere and so should other assistants be available on our devices versus thinking that the end game here is about speaking -- doing one-turn dialogues on one speaker in one home. That's just not our vision.",602

I'm sure you'll be greatly successful. Satya, I'd like to ask you a question. Can you give us a sense of what is the adoption of Azure in the U.S. versus international, not just in the revenue point of view, but in terms of the mix of premium workloads, types of workloads, et cetera? How should we think of where we are in that process?",71

We clearly see, first, things happening in U.S. and quickly followed by geographies like Germany and the U.K. There are certain workloads, like the IoT workload, where we do see very advanced action in countries like Germany, especially with industrial customers in terms of smart factories, Japan. But I think broadly, I don't see any difference than, say, what we used to see or what we still see on our server or any other technology adoption curves. And they have differences in industry patterns because different industries are strong in different parts of the globe. So and then they represent different use cases in terms of the components of Azure that get used.",149

One, Amy, I guess you've been talking about, and so is IR, about the commercial bookings where the expiry base was down over year-over -- on a year-over-year basis. I'm just wondering, if you look ahead to 2019, is there anything you could share with us about the size of the expiry base in that period just so we could think about it? I know you don't give guidance that far out, but just as we start to think about -- thinking about further outgrowth. And then I guess the other question would be, you mentioned better IT spending. But just also given the significant savings companies in the U.S. are going to be seeing due to lower tax bills, is there any early feedback from partners or customers about the rate that this might be reinvested back into IT spending and digitization?",145
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2018",2018-01-31,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3691.0,1378995.0,55114858.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,17,"Thanks, Heather. In general, FY '19 we'll have a higher base than FY '18 just as you start to think through the impacts on bookings for the next year. And as we talked about, Q3 has that same attribute. It's higher than it was a year ago Q2. The reason we called that out obviously because it was such an outlier. And if you look back 3 years sort of how this EA expiry base works, our performance this quarter was really strong compared to 3 years ago. So I feel great about our sales execution, especially in terms of growing the recapture rate at accounts. To your question on the demand signals we're seeing in the U.S. in particular, I think it is quite early. But as we've said, the U.S. has been a good market for us and a strong market for us for a good period of time, and it was again in Q2 as we noted. And I think we are optimistic as we look to H2 when we see the signals we're seeing in the market, whether it's PCs, server or the cloud demand.",189

The -- my focus is actually on the commercial side, but specifically on Office. Office 365 revenue continues to outpace fee growth there. We've talked about that in the past with pricing. But if I just look at also overall Office on the commercial side, up 10%, same as Q1, when you all think about just going forward just the mix of those 2, obviously, the on-prem business is still declining in the high teens and then Office 365 growing rapidly, how do you think about just the blended growth of Office commercial and the puts and takes there?",130

Our goal and I think the real opportunity that remains with Office 365 and Microsoft 365 going forward is our ability to continue to grow the installed base and to also continue to grow ARPU. The combination of those 2 things and the opportunity we see is the reason in the sales reorg that we did in July, we continue to put resources and sales resources behind collaboration and communication and so many of the important workloads that allow us to give great value to customers. And you even started to see it this quarter, as you're pointing out, Phil. We saw a little bit more impact of E5 this quarter in ARPU than we had been seeing. It's been in the market a while. We're seeing that momentum, the value all up of E5 not just from an Office perspective, but from a Microsoft 365 perspective with security and management as well as some of the newer products that are getting some strong adoption like Teams. I think we feel really good about where we are and the value and our opportunity both from small business up to the large enterprise, from first-line workers to do all of these things and continue to execute well. So the guide certainly implies that continued optimism.",240

I just wanted to double click on the productivity gaze you see in the cloud, especially on Azure. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers there? I know one is that your build-out pattern was different than some of your competitors, so you're kind of filling capacity. But also talk a little bit about what you see in terms of how you're delivering the services in Azure and how that's evolving.",79

When we look at our CapEx spend, we want to make sure that the data center regions meet the needs of our customers globally across both consumer workloads and enterprise workloads where real data sovereignty requirements and speed-of-light issues are all really relevant. Having said that, the way it fills up is by the value-add that we can do. So that's why the mix of these higher-level services, especially around data and AI, is definitely driving a lot more consumption of our higher-level services. And even something like IoT, they're not just at the consumption meters, but they also got SaaS-like qualities to them. So I feel very, very good about ultimately having innovation that drives both the consumption of more higher-level services and then also making sure that we are available in all parts of the world where the demand is going to spread to because we're in the very, very early innings of, essentially, this new cloud growth. And there's only going to be increasing demand as there's more digitization of every city, every factory, every hospital and so on. So I think we have a long way to go to still fill up.",224

That actually is a benefit to the gross margin rate. Then again, all the work we have done through the supply chain. So while we have a signal come in, you see a very quick turn from demand signal to us having servers in place and ready to be utilized very quickly. That work continues and the team has done a really nice job. And then as well, software improvements. They continue to go on to increase our ability to run more on less. Those, taken together, continue to show gross margin improvement.",130

And so I'm wondering, looking beyond this quarter, if you could expand on how commercial bookings growth ex renewals is trending. And in other words, are you getting more separation, if you will, between reported growth and growth excluding renewal activity?",72
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2018",2018-01-31,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3691.0,1378995.0,55114868.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,27,"Let me take a shot. The way I think about bookings growth every quarter is you tend to look at a couple of things. And I would say I start with renewals, not just that we renew the contract, but how many new products, new services did we add to that contract. Did we expand our footprint, our percentage of the IT budget at a customer? Did they rely on us for more products and more services? This quarter is a good example of that happening. And if you think about the connection to why that happens, it's not just the terrific engineering work that we've done in product value. It's also the investments that we've made to put resources in some of these larger accounts to continue to add new workloads that are only possible in the cloud, and we've added resources that we're seeing the revenue get recaptured in that way. So that, I think, feels very good from a resource allocation and return perspective. And so then the next component obviously is being able to grow just brand-new accounts. Are we growing customer bases? Are we penetrating segments? And you also saw that in the quarter. So at a high level, you can either sort of add more expand your footprint or you get to add a new customer, and both of those are motions that we focus on. And I feel good about our execution. I think there's -- and you'll see that dynamic. So if the expiry base is a little bigger, you'd expect obviously a number bigger than that on the bookings side and when the expiry raises, there's growth. It's really about the delta between the 2, as you note, and our execution this quarter was quite good. But it's come from sustainable investment and our sales technical resources and in the engineering to deliver a differentiated value at the customer.",318

Number one, I would say we have -- when we have seen an opportunity to invest, we have not really waited for tax reform to do that. Our opportunity, the TAM, really the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity is really the technical transition and digital transformation that's occurring now. And so we've invested to make that happen. We've made acquisitions when they made sense. We have used the capital markets and the debt market to fund those to make sure that we made the right investments to grow our business. And so for us, we also didn't wait when we thought about capital return. Even this quarter, we returned almost all of our free cash flow generation in dividends and share repurchase. And we've been on that path for a number of years. Now that being said, I am pleased, obviously, to be able to access the cash more easily and not have to go through the debt market to be able to make these choices, whether it's investment in ourselves and the returns you've seen in this quarter in revenue growth, whether it's the acquisitions like LinkedIn that are performing better than we expected. And I think today, we would even say it's a more strategic asset than we even maybe thought a year ago in terms of the power of it to add to our graph and our understanding and then be able to return capital. So for me, while I appreciate the spirit behind the question, for us, we have felt a necessity to do that for years as a part of total shareholder return and our commitment to do that. And I think we've done a good job, and I'm proud of what we've done and I'm proud and excited for what we can continue to do.",304

Are there any limitations other than storage-related workloads that would limit Office 365 commercial gross margin from reaching, say, 80% over time? And what are some of the current limitations on that gross margin that you think could be improved upon for that to work higher than 70% over time?",60

You're right. In general, workloads like Exchange and increasingly, SharePoint, which we have seen some really great encouraging numbers on usage of SharePoint in our Office 365 consumer -- commercial base, those do have storage requirements. And so you're absolutely right. They are slightly different than many of the very high-level SaaS workloads that you see. But we still do have room, which I think is really the core of the question. We still have some room to improve that Office 365 commercial gross margin from the new workloads we've added, which have even more of those pure SaaS-like workloads. And aside from Office in that same segment is Dynamics who -- or LinkedIn, which both have those SaaS-like margins and can and we see opportunity to both improve those as well. So I don't think there's necessarily a level, but there's certainly room even within these storage-heavy workloads.",150

Amy already referenced how small businesses that perhaps never did advanced workloads are now able to do so. Emerging markets that never did are able to do so. So first of all, whether it's -- on first-line workers, we never had any solutions for first-line workers. So there is a market expansion in terms of users and the sophistication of the workloads that they can use or the higher-level services. The other thing is Office by itself, you talked about storage. It's an interesting question to say what is being stored in Office: in meetings going forward, at home office or people calling in, things like Mixed Reality being used in meetings. It's very different. It's not about you sitting in front of Word and entering text. That's not the full limit of Office. Office is about any people collaborating in voice or in -- with even computer vision and many other ways that I think collaboration will happen. So we have a very expansive view, much like Azure for infrastructure and data and AI in terms of human activity that gets digitized at work and at home is something that we are going after with Microsoft 365.",230

Let's just take, for example, what's happening in a factory. In a factory, one thing that is secular is that they're putting lots and lots of more sensors. A lot of these sensors today are, in fact, rendezvousing some of that data straight to the cloud. As you do more of that, what happens is you need to -- and then you start doing sensor fusion, which is your multiple sensors that you want to be able to fuse and take action. The speed of light gets in the way. So they want local compute. And so in order to have that local compute in some of these factories with millions of sensors, you may, in fact, need Azure Stack. So it's not just about old workloads and service providers and essentially hybrid computing as we understand it. When I think about hybrid computing, at least in the fullness of time, it's more the future of distributed computing where there is a cloud, there is an edge and even the edge is not just one single edge, but it's got a typology associated with it going all the way to the sensors, whether it's at home, whether it's in a hospital, whether it's in a factory. So that's where we're going to end up, which is a true distributed computing fabric that the world needs in order to be digitally transformed. How and quarter-to-quarter will there be volatility, shifts, changes, that's all going to be the case. But we see the pattern emerge pretty clearly in terms of where we need to go.",282

It was another strong quarter, the result of picking the right secular trends, delivering differentiated innovation and focused execution that results in increased engagement and usage. 
The intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge era is already upon us. It represents a tremendous opportunity. We took significant steps this quarter to put this at the forefront of everything we do, realigning our entire engineering organization to accelerate innovation and better serve the needs of customers and partners. With that as the backdrop, I want to highlight key areas of innovation and growth across our customer solutions.
Creating a modern workplace where people can do their best work requires the right culture and the right technology. Microsoft 365 helps every organization empower their employees with AI-backed tools that unlock creativity, increase teamwork and fuel innovation, all the while ensuring compliance and protecting data from new cyber threats. 
Microsoft is a clear leader in cloud security. Advanced AI [ releases ] over hundreds of billions of signals each month to identify anomalies, automate detection and help customers respond to cyber threats. Just last week, we announced new value for customers, Microsoft Secure Score, Attack Simulator and Windows Defender ATP automatic detection and remediation capabilities as well as a new open API for the Intelligent Security Graph. 
We've also built compliance capability directly into our cloud services. Thousands of organizations are using the recently launched compliance manager with new information protection scanner and built-in classification capability to help prepare for GDPR. Our comprehensive approach and proactive protection are one reason Coca-Cola chose Microsoft Cloud for their digital transformation.
One year in, Teams has rapidly become the hub for teamwork. More than 200,000 organizations in 181 markets use Teams, from Maersk to General Motors. Teams is now enabled for a broad spectrum of calling and meeting room devices. We're also building AI-powered services into Teams. We've integrated Microsoft Stream, our enterprise video service, into Teams for transcription and time coding of recorded meetings. We've added new facial recognition capabilities, which will attribute remarks to specific meeting attendees. And we are adding new Cortana capability to make calls, join a meeting or initiate 3-way calling just using your voice. 
All this innovation is driving customer usage. Windows 10 continues to gain traction in the enterprise, with Windows 10 commercial monthly active devices up 79% year-over-year. Office 365 commercial now has more than 135 million monthly active users and Office 365 consumer subscribers increased to 30.6 million.
Now I'll turn to LinkedIn and business applications. From the start, we recognized the opportunity for LinkedIn and Microsoft to combine forces to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce and enable professionals to be more productive and successful. A little over 1 year in, we feel great about the value we are delivering for members, customers and shareholders. 
Our integration model has enabled LinkedIn to accelerate growth while retaining its member-first ethos. Results are ahead of expectations across all lines of business, with revenue growth of 37% year-over-year. We saw record levels of engagement again this quarter with sessions growth of more than 30% year-over-year, driven by innovation across the platform. This increased engagement is driving strong demand for sponsored content and marketing solutions and record levels of job postings and job visitors again this quarter in Talent Solutions.
Shifting to business applications. Dynamics 365 is gaining traction as our third commercial cloud growth engine, up 65% this quarter. We unleashed a wave of AI innovation in Dynamics with hundreds of new capabilities to transform sales and automate marketing, with Office 365 embedded inside Dynamics for productivity. Relationship analytics for sales and marketing leverage the Microsoft Graph and data from social networks to improve customer relationships, and predictive lead scoring help sellers identify and focus on high-quality leads.
We're investing in our business applications platform capabilities across Power BI, Power Apps, Flow and a Common Data model. Now customers can extend Dynamics 365 and Office 365 and quickly build applications using data from across the organization as well as third-party data with minimal custom code. The new power platform enables customers like Inter Cars, a leading European auto parts company, to go from paper to digitized workflows within days versus months. With the rapid growth of Power BI, we are now the leader in business analytics in the cloud.
Now I'll turn to infrastructure and AI platforms. Our architectural advantage of a consistent stack from the cloud to the edge is resonating with customers, with Azure revenue growth of 93% this quarter. Recent CIO surveys affirm our leadership position in hybrid, developer productivity, trusted security and compliance and new workloads such as IoT and AI at the edge. 
We have made the right investment decisions and they're having an impact, increasing our overall share in an expanding market. Our recent data center expansion, including the United Arab Emirates and Switzerland, brings our total number of regions to 50, more than any other cloud provider, and the additional availability zones provide the most comprehensive resiliency in the industry.
We also continue to see strong customer demand for Azure Stack across industries, and it's unlocking new workload scenarios across hybrid and edge. Industrial IoT is transforming the rules of manufacturing, fueling cloud and edge innovation, accelerating the evolution of digital factories and enhancing supply chain performance. 
Azure IoT and Azure Stack enable customers and partners to build industrial IoT solutions that run at the edge, so operators on the factory floor can manage devices and analyze data in real-time. And HoloLens is quickly becoming an indispensable tool as we take digital twin technology to the next level.
We're also innovating in silicon to help customers realize the promise of a connected world of devices and things. Our just announced Azure Sphere is a first of its kind, highly secure edge solution that combines chip design and IoT operating system and a cloud service to secure more than 9 billion microcontroller-powered devices entering the market each year. 
And we're already seeing rapid customer adoption of IoT scenarios. Toyota Material Handling in Europe is using Azure as well as HoloLens to create a factory of the future. Using AI, drones learn complex processes to automate the flow of a factory, increasing supply chain and warehouse efficiency. And Microsoft and ABB are partnering to push the boundaries of smart manufacturing for industrial automation.
We're investing to make Azure the best cloud for enterprise data estates. In less than a year, Azure Cosmos DB, the first globally distributed multi-model and multi-model database, exceeded $100 million in annualized revenue. Azure database for MySQL and PostgreSQL makes it even easier to bring open source powered applications to Azure, expanding our opportunity in this space. We are seeing a rapid adoption of Azure Databricks for data preparation, advanced analytics and machine learning scenarios.
We continue to innovate to democratize AI. More than 1 million developers have already used cognitive services to quickly and easily create AI applications, and we have more services than any other cloud provider. Our Azure Bot Service has nearly 300,000 developers, up more than 150% year-over-year. 
Microsoft Translator brings AI-powered translation to developers where their data is, whether that's in the cloud or on the edge. And just last month, we reached human parity in language translation, a new milestone, in addition to our previous human parity achievements in object recognition, speech recognition and machine reading comprehension. We're also gaining traction in machine learning tools adoption with tens of thousands of customers using Azure ML. 
Finally, we are innovating with new GPU and FPGA-based offerings to lead in AI infrastructure for both training and inference. I'm excited to share more about our cloud and AI innovation at our developer conference next month at Build.
Now to gaming. We continue to pursue our expansive opportunity in gaming from the way games are created and distributed to how they are played and viewed. We had one of the best quarters in gaming with strong revenue performance and record levels of engagement. Software and services revenue grew 24% as we continued to attract, retain and deepen user relationships across Xbox Live, Game Pass and Mixer. 
Xbox Live monthly active users grew to 59 million, up 13%. Our new first-party game, Sea of Thieves, drove gameplay across Windows 10 and Xbox One, in addition to nearly 10 million hours of viewing on services like Mixer in its very first week. Our results speak to the strength of our platform and services for both first-party and third-party experiences. And we'll continue to invest in our platform, enhancing our cloud services with AI capabilities for developers to quickly build and monetize games across PC, console and mobile.
In closing, intelligent cloud and intelligent edge represents a tremendous opportunity for our customers. It comes with a responsibility to ensure trust in technology. We are working to instill this trust in 3 key areas. The first is privacy. We recognize that privacy is a fundamental human right, and we have consistently acted accordingly. Our success is grounded in our customers' success. We have been working towards the May 25 GDPR implementation date since 2016, with hundreds of engineers across the company working on end-to-end privacy architecture, and we'll ensure that all our products and services are GDPR compliant.
For customers, we will provide robust tools backed by a contractual commitment to help them comply with GDPR. In fact, for most customers, it will be more effective and less costly to host their data in Microsoft's GDPR-compliant cloud than to develop and maintain GDPR compliance tools themselves.
Second, cybersecurity. In response to escalating cyber attacks around the world, we are leading a bold initiative to defend and protect our customers. We recently led a coalition of 34 global technology and security companies in signing the Cybersecurity Tech Accord. The accord is an important first step by the industry to help create a safer and more secure online environment for everyone.
Finally, we recently established the AI in Ethics and Engineering and Research Committee at Microsoft to ensure we always advance AI in an ethical and responsible way to benefit our customers and the broader society. This includes new investments in technology to detect and address bias in AI systems. 
Microsoft stands for trust and this will continue to be a differentiating focus for us moving forward. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Amy to cover our financial results in more detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining for your questions.",1767

Our third quarter revenue was $26.8 billion, up 16% and 13% in constant currency, with better-than-expected performance across all segments. 
Gross margin increased 16% and 13% in constant currency. Operating income increased 23% and 20% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $0.95, increasing 36% and 31% in constant currency. From a geographic perspective, we saw broad-based strength across markets of all sizes, benefiting from the positive global corporate IT spend environment.
Growth in cloud services increased our commercial annuity mix, up 2 points year-over-year, to 89%. Along with healthy renewals, our sales teams and partners drove a higher volume of new business, leading to commercial bookings growth of 26% and 18% in constant currency. Commercial unearned came in slightly above our expectations due to FX, growing 20% and 17% in constant currency. 
Commercial cloud revenue was $6 billion, increasing 58% and 55% in constant currency, highlighted by healthy growth in the U.S., Western Europe and the U.K. We again improved commercial cloud gross margin, now at 57%, up 6 points, with improvement in each cloud service, most notably Azure. 
We outperformed our expectation on company gross margin, finishing the quarter at 65%. We are up slightly year-over-year with improvement in our Productivity and Business Processes segment from Office 365 commercial and LinkedIn, offset by a decline in our Intelligent Cloud segment, driven by a greater mix of Azure revenue.
FX positively impacted revenue growth by 1 point more than expected. 3 points of the company and Productivity and Business Processes level and 2 points on both Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing. FX added 2 points of growth to COGS and operating expenses, 1 point more than expected. 
Operating expenses grew 10% and 8% in constant currency as we continued to invest in commercial sales capacity, cloud engineering and LinkedIn. Even with this accelerated pace of spend, we increased operating margin 2 points year-over-year, a direct result of our focused investments to drive top line growth.
Now to the segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was approximately $9 billion, increasing 17% and 14% in constant currency, with better-than-expected results from Office 365 commercial and LinkedIn. 
Office commercial revenue grew double digits again this quarter, up 14% and 12% in constant currency, including a couple of points from a greater mix of contracts with higher in-period recognition. 
Office 365 commercial revenue grew 42% and 40% in constant currency, with continued installed base growth and ARPU expansion, driven by customer migration to our premium workloads in E3 and E5. Office 365 commercial seats grew 28%, in line with the expected trend, given the increasing size of the installed base.
Office consumer revenue increased 12% and 9% in constant currency, driven by recurring subscription revenue and a growing overall installed base. 
Our Dynamics business accelerated this quarter, growing 17% and 14% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 65%, 62% in constant currency. 
LinkedIn revenue grew 37% and 33% in constant currency, with more than $1.3 billion in revenue. We continued to see outperformance across all segments, with record levels of engagement.
Segment gross margin dollars increased 18% and 15% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased, with margin improvements in Office 365 commercial and LinkedIn, offsetting the increased mix of cloud revenue. 
Operating expenses grew 14% and 12% in constant currency as we continued to strategically invest in LinkedIn, commercial sales capacity and cloud engineering. 
Operating income increased 23% and 19% in constant currency. The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered $7.9 billion of revenue, increasing 17% and 15% in constant currency, exceeding expectations due to our on-premises server business.
Server products and cloud services revenue grew 20% and 17% in constant currency to $6.3 billion, driven by continued strong Azure revenue growth of 93%, 89% in constant currency, on a significant revenue base. Our on-premises server business grew 3% and 1% in constant currency, driven by customer demand for hybrid solutions as well as increasing virtualization needs, resulting in the uptake of premium versions. 
Enterprise Services revenue increased 8% and 5% in constant currency, with growth in premium support services and Microsoft consulting services more than offsetting the continued decline in custom support agreements for Windows Server 2003.
Segment gross margin dollars grew 16% and 14% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage declined with a growing mix of Azure IaaS and PaaS revenue, mostly offset by another quarter of material improvement in Azure gross margin. 
Operating expenses increased 9% and 7% in constant currency, driven by our continued investment in sales capacity and cloud engineering. Operating income increased 24%, up 21% in constant currency.
Now to the results of More Personal Computing. Revenue from the segment was $9.9 billion, up 13% and 11% in constant currency, with significantly better-than-expected results in gaming, Windows commercial and Surface. 
Windows OEM revenue increased 4% this quarter. OEM Pro revenue grew 11%, in line with a strong commercial PC market. 
We continued to see healthy enterprise demand for Windows 10 benefiting our OEM partners. OEM non-Pro revenue declined this quarter by 8%, below the consumer PC market, driven by a higher mix of lower-priced licenses and continued pressure in the entry-level price category. Inventory levels were within the normal range.
Windows commercial products and cloud services increased 21% and 17% in constant currency from strong double-digit billings as well as a higher mix of in-quarter recognition from multiyear agreements. The fundamentals of this business remained healthy, with installed base growth and adoption of our security solutions. As a reminder, under Accounting Standard 606, the Windows commercial growth rate will have significant variability quarter-to-quarter due to its relatively high mix of on-premises licensing revenue.
Search revenue ex TAC grew 16% and 14% in constant currency, with higher revenue per search and search volume driven by Bing performance in the U.S. and international markets.
Surface revenue grew 32% and 27% in constant currency with better-than-expected performance from Surface Book as we continued to transition to the latest products in our portfolio and against the prior year comparable impacted by product end-of-life cycle dynamics. 
Gaming revenue increased 18% and 16% in constant currency due to Xbox software and services revenue growth of 24% and 21% in constant currency. 
Momentum in digital distribution as well as record levels of engagement, driven by a third-party title, contributed to better-than-expected software and services revenue. We grew Xbox Live monthly active users by 13% to 59 million, with user expansion across Xbox One, Windows 10 and mobile platforms. 
Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 11% in constant currency, in line with revenue growth. Segment gross margin percentage was relatively flat year-on-year. 
Operating expenses increased 5% and 3% in constant currency from investments in engineering across gaming, search and AI. Operating income grew 24% and 20% in constant currency.
Now back to total company results. In line with our expectations, we increased capital expenditures on a sequential basis, with $3.5 billion invested to support current and future growth of our cloud offerings. Cash paid for property and equipment was $2.9 billion. 
Cash flow from operations was up 14%, driven by collections from strong billings growth. Free cash flow of $9.2 billion grew at a slower rate, 3%, due to an increasing cash use for property, plant and equipment. 
Other income and expenses was approximately $350 million from net recognized gains on investments and income from dividends and interest, partially offset by interest expense. Our effective tax rate came in at 14% due to a benefit from an R&D tax credit.
We returned $6.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, increasing total shareholder return by 37%. We nearly doubled our year-over-year amount buyback, accelerating our pace from the prior quarter and now have roughly $30 billion remaining of our current $40 billion share repurchase authorization.
Now let's turn to next quarter's outlook. 
First on FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by 3 points, COGS by 1 point and operating expenses by 1 point. 
Second, we again expect strong performance from our commercial business with solid execution in our largest quarter of the year. We expect commercial unearned revenue to be up 38% to 39% sequentially.
Third on CapEx. We expect sequential growth in capital expenditures on an accrual dollar basis as we continued to see strong demand signals globally. 
Finally, we expect commercial cloud gross margin to be roughly flat to Q3, representing another quarter of material year-over-year improvement even with increasing Azure revenue mix.
Now to the segments. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $9.55 billion and $9.75 billion. We expect Office commercial growth rates to normalize as we do not expect the same level of in-quarter recognition on multiyear contracts as we saw in Q3. Dynamics should see another quarter of double-digit revenue growth, driven by Dynamics 365 and LinkedIn growth should remain high. 
In Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $8.95 billion and $9.15 billion, with another quarter of server products and cloud services revenue growth in the high teens as our hybrid cloud leadership continues to be a differentiator for customers. 
We expect the total Azure revenue growth to reflect the balance of our continued strength in infrastructure, data and application services and a moderating growth in our per user base services like EMS.
In More Personal Computing, we expect $10.3 billion to $10.6 billion. Across both OEM Pro and non-Pro, we anticipate trends in Q3 to continue into Q4. 
In our devices business, we expect Surface revenue growth in the high teens as we continued to transition to the latest products in our portfolio. Search ex TAC should see another mid-teens revenue growth quarter as it has the entire year. 
In gaming, we expect a higher revenue growth rate in Q3 as we continue to benefit from third-party game title performance and user engagement on our platform. 
We expect COGS between $9.6 billion and $9.8 billion, including 1 point of growth from FX. We expect operating expenses of $9.8 billion to $9.9 billion, with 1 point of growth from FX. This would place us slightly above the high end of our prior range for the full year operating expense growth due to the impact from FX and incremental revenue-driven expenses that support our continued strong top line growth.
In Q4, we expect other income and expense to be approximately $350 million as we continue to take gains on our equities portfolio and earn dividend and interest income, as we have in prior quarters. We expect our effective tax rate in Q4 to be approximately 16%, with some volatility in the final quarter of our fiscal year.
Finally, I want to offer a few early thoughts on FY '19. Assuming the macro environment remains consistent, many of the key drivers of our business should remain intact. Revenue growth will continue to be driven by the transition to cloud services. And within our commercial business, strong execution and our differentiated hybrid position should drive continued high teens growth in our server product and cloud services revenue KPI. Office 365, Dynamics 365 and LinkedIn should also continue to drive double-digit revenue growth in our Productivity and Business Processes segment.
The gross margin percentage of every commercial cloud service will continue to improve, with more improvement in Azure IaaS and PaaS consumption-based services and less improvement in our per user SaaS services. While we expect continued improvement in the overall commercial cloud gross margin, the revenue mix shift to Azure will moderate the rate of improvement relative to FY '18.
We'll continue to grow our investment in capital expenditures to meet the growing demand for our cloud services. With the business results we delivered and the tremendous opportunities we see ahead, we will continue to see growth in operating expenses in key areas we discussed, including LinkedIn. We expect other income and expenses to be slightly negative in FY '19 as we don't expect to have any significant equity gains.
And lastly, we continue to expect the full year FY '19 effective tax rate to be slightly below the new U.S. corporate tax rate of 21%, with variability across the quarters due to the mix of cloud versus license revenue and the timing of equity vests. 
And with that, Mike, let's go to Q&A.",2055

21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2018",2018-04-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3913.0,1441428.0,57354565.0,Question,Heather Bellini,,Analysts,6,"Great. You guys are seeing a really nice acceleration in Intelligent Cloud gross profit growth. And with 15 straight quarters now of triple-digit premium services growth in Azure, I know you mentioned some comments directionally about the gross margin ramp. But how do we think about the pace of the ramp in gross margin expansion from here for this -- for Azure, in particular, as you approach what we estimate to be roughly an $8 billion business in annualized revenue? And I guess, what -- the other thing that would be helpful is when you think of the COGS of commercial cloud, can you give us a rough ballpark of what percentage of COGS comes from CapEx depreciation?",118
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2018",2018-04-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3913.0,1441428.0,57354566.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,7,"So maybe I'll start and then I'll have you, Amy, go into some of the numbers. One of the things, Heather, that's happening is there is growth in Azure across each of the layers. And I think I've said this before. Sometimes, when you have new workloads and new customers onboard, they start with, in some sense, the IaaS and the data, more at a Blob Storage, but then scale to higher-layer services, like our Cosmos DB or even some of our compute higher-level services like in AI. So that, I think, will continue because we're still in the early innings of the cloud transition. We're investing aggressively, whether it's on the field side or on the CapEx side to attract more customers and more workloads per customer. So they will have that same profile, which is lower-margin services first, higher-margin services over time. That's just inside of Azure. And of course, you combine that with the rest. One of the things that, I think, should be fairly clear is the high correlation between our services in Office 365 as well as Dynamics 365 around data, in particular, with Azure. So that's why we think of this as one cloud play, but that should give you a feel for how the customers are looking at it.",217
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2018",2018-04-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3913.0,1441428.0,57354567.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,8,"And I think to your specific questions, there were a couple in there, Heather. If you think about the portion of our commercial cloud gross margins that come from depreciation, it's best to think of it as roughly half. And actually, it's been going up as we begin to get scale through these services over time, actually. Some of the fixed costs, frankly, even in COGS, tend to come down as a percentage over time. So that should help you roughly to think about how much depreciation is to that number. Now if you think about sort of the dynamics that we've been going through in the Intelligent Cloud segment, in particular, the way I tend to think about that, as you've seen, our 20% growth this quarter in that server and product services KPI, 17% on a constant currency basis and are sort of confident that you should continue to see that, as I said, into Q4 and then into FY '19 as well. I tend to think about that as we'll have significant revenue growth in that segment. We'll have significant gross margin dollar growth in that segment, and you'll actually continue to see operating margin dollar growth as significant in that segment even as we reinvest into it, given the top line signal. If you think about gross margins, in particular, what you'll see is Azure continuing to be a growing percentage of the total revenue growth. So even with significant improvement again and what Satya was talking about, some of the lower level IaaS and PaaS services within Azure on the gross margin side, you'll see some gross margin percentage pressure in that segment through '19, but with significant dollar growth.",285

We know that you build out -- you significantly invested in the data center footprint ahead of demand, but you don't build out the equipment itself that far in advance. Is there a large corporate or government requirement or is it the acceleration in new data centers that ended up causing that lift? Or is there something else driving it? And as a follow-up, how should we think about that for the next couple of quarters?",91

I actually didn't think of it as a significant change in trajectory from what we expected. A year ago, Q3 was actually a little low. So on a year-over-year basis, I think it pops a little bit, Mark, when on really a sequential basis, I actually don't think, to me, it looks out of sorts especially with the type of demand we're seeing not just for Azure but across all of the cloud components.

There's really not much to pick on in this quarter. One of the highlights from my perspective was definitely LinkedIn and what seems to be an acceleration in the revenue growth in LinkedIn. So 2-parter here. One, where are we in terms of that acquisition? Is this still just LinkedIn operating better as an independent company? Are we starting to see some of the synergies, specifically revenue synergies, come to bear from maybe broader distribution channel that they get from Microsoft or product integration? So have synergies started to kick in, number one? And number two, given where we are in terms of the M&A process on LinkedIn, what's the appetite for further, like large M&A, for Microsoft on a going-forward basis?",129

Let me start and then, Amy, you can add to this. First of all, it is very important for us to ensure that we did everything to enable LinkedIn to keep their product and cultural ethos of putting members first and innovating on their behalf. I mean, that was sort of priority 1, 2 and 3. And that's what you see in their sessions growth, engagement growth, their quality member growth. And obviously, that all translates into the revenue growth as well across all of the marketing solutions, talent solutions and sale solutions. We also, during that 1 year, done integrations. You see it -- I see it every day in my Outlook mobile. I see it in Sales Navigator and Dynamics. And so you will see us -- and with Windows 10. So you'll see us continue to do these integrations that add value again to both the Microsoft 365 and Dynamics users as well as LinkedIn members. And clearly, that's increasing engagement as well. And that obviously then translates into revenue growth of those business solutions we mentioned. So yes, revenue synergies are showing up, but mostly because product synergies are showing up, and that's because of the product ethos of LinkedIn around member-first is what we have maintained throughout this integration.",219

So let me also say, after a year of working with them closely, my appreciation and frankly a lot of inspiration that I think you've seen at our own product development has been their focus on users and how important it is and how focused they are on it. In some of the products, I would urge people to look at the Outlook Mobile experience and how really meaningful the experiences for the user and the member. And I think sometimes it's harder for us to measure exactly what a revenue synergy means. But I think I look at this and say, ""At a 37% growth rate plus some of the integrations we've seen and the growth in usage and users of things like Outlook Mobile, I believe that we're probably a little bit on the front end of the revenue synergies you'll see in product over time."" When it comes to our appetite for M&A, I think it actually -- it has remained unchanged, which is when things meet our criteria and when we feel like it's in core areas for us, where markets are expanding, where the companies have a unique asset, I think that we -- our ability to both execute on those and see them both execute on their own and execute inside Microsoft, I actually feel quite good that our -- we don't worry about our ability to do them, but I wouldn't say that's new this quarter.",258

That's a big achievement for a company at your scale, and it looks like you're expecting the same for the June quarter, so congrats. So I guess, my question is in the spirit of this, to Amy, on the overall growth margin trade-off as you look into fiscal '19. Amy, when I go back to the Analyst Day you had almost a year ago, I left thinking that your messaging was really that you were going to press on revenue growth and not on big margin leverage. So I'm just wondering as we look into fiscal '19, is it correct to assume that, that's a similar framework with the focus on top line growth and not to expect much in the way of overall improvement in gross margins?",144

Yes, I think that's a fair interpretation of my commentary both last year and this, which really speaks to consistency. I do believe that the market that which we are operating, the set of assets we've picked, the team we've built, the investments we made in our sales force, even to some extent, the acquisitions we've done, these are all showing up as top line revenue growth for us. You see it this quarter. You see it, frankly, in the guide. And I think your interpretation that our focus on being a growth company, even at our scale, is certainly the right interpretation.",105

New customers, existing consumption, premium services and we're growing at eye-popping rates right now. We saw that with Office 365 in the early days. How should we expect this business to sort of level out over time as I think it inevitably will as we look to next year?",88

And it's true that we are, at this point, at scale on Azure and with very, very high growth rates. But as I said, I think the key things that we think about is differentiation of Azure at each level because that's what is super important for us as we compete in this marketplace, and more importantly, double down on areas of differentiation we have. So the first thing is on the infrastructure side itself with the combination of the edge and the cloud, I believe, between Azure Stack and Azure as well as inclusive of our servers, we have the best cloud platform for what is going to be hybrid computing and we'll continue to push on that, so you'll see growth that just got a different margin profile. The layer about that is the place which we are very excited about. You've seen lots of consecutive quarters of growth in our high-level services but we're now seeing some good scale. I, for the first time, talked about Cosmos DB. This was actually a database we just launched last year. I mean, I've been around databases for a long time. I've never seen a product that's gotten to this kind of scale this quickly. And so we're very bullish about what can happen in the higher-level services and we'll continue to build on that piece. But as I said, one of the key things is architecturally, the way we build Azure, the way we build Office 365, the way we build our gaming cloud and the way we build even Dynamics are all pretty much one architecture. And you see that even in the way customers use it. So overall to your specific question on Azure, the growth will moderate as the numbers become big, and they've already become very big. But that said, we see plenty of opportunity for total gross margin growth in terms of dollars just because of the number of markets that we participate in, which we, by the way, never participated in the old server world.",347

We're really confident in double-digit growth in that PBT segment with the components of Office 365, Dynamics 365 and LinkedIn. So if you think about that as the primary components of our commercial cloud, overall, we're certainly saying that it's a big business growing very fast at $6 billion, not counting LinkedIn. At 58% growth, it certainly speaks to having a big base and a big growth number. On Azure, you're right. It will moderate through next year. But because of the scale at which it's operating, that's why you still see that server KPI remain at that high level even as the base grows. And so you will see also some different dynamics within that Azure revenue number. Satya mentioned the layers of Azure. If you think about the IaaS and PaaS numbers, I would expect to be on the higher end of growth rates. And some of the services that are more per user like, like EMS within the Azure frame, you would expect that growth to moderate somewhat more quickly just because it's a per seat business. You will actually, over time, see us be able to continue to add ARPU and growth in those segments. Think of it almost like an Office business. Internally, we call that component part of our Microsoft 365 value. That's how we sell it externally even. And so hopefully, that helps give a little context to the number as well as our overall ability to continue to grow the sort of hybrid cloud opportunity high teens.",292

Wonder if you can talk just sort of high level and strategically about applications and enterprise applications in Azure and how you kind of see the synergy of potentially coming up between those, especially when you think about Azure AI, ML services sort of -- kind of questions is how important or how critical are applications like the growth that we're seeing in Dynamics, et cetera?",84

One of the areas of, in fact, real breakout growth in differentiation as being in Power BI, Power Apps and Flow. For the first time, in fact, in our own Microsoft history, we have an extensibility model that is the same for Office 365 and Dynamics 365. This has been a dream of mine for, I don't know, for 15 years probably. And we are finally here and we are executing super well. But the interesting thing is it's not just even for our own SaaS applications. It is the extensibility model for every SaaS application out there, including a common data model. So I think that, that's where the synergies lie because AI starts with having a data estate that can really bring data from all of your applications, silos, in some sense, together so that you can start doing, building an analytical power that you can then visualize and put in the hands of people using Power BI or run an AI model that does some prediction that you can deploy in your system, whether it's forecasting, sales lead scoring, what have you. So that workflow, we have every layer of it. We have the best deployment tools and development tools in Azure. We have this common data model. On top of this, we have the best BI visualization technology. So that's what you're seeing increasingly as the synergy. But most importantly, architectural benefit for customers because by having incoherence around these layers is where you may feel like you're making some great best-of-breed sort of choices in individual layers, but you'll bear that expense in your overall agility as well as your overall management of your data. And that's where I think we will be very differentiated.",310

Let me -- first, I wouldn't say penetration is the word for this. Let me talk about this in 2 or even a couple of components because when you think about Windows 10, what we've seen over the past couple of years is you're right, a very strong enterprise deployment cycle and real pull for that product inside enterprises because of the security value prop of the product itself. When you see that deployment for security reasons, an externality of that is people often choose to upgrade machines in that process. We've seen good demand inside commercial entities for and when they make those upgrades to buy Windows PCs and often Surface devices in that choice. I think it's benefited our OEM partners and us. The portfolio of devices that are available are incredibly compelling. I think our partners have done a terrific job on that as well. The overall economy is certainly also quite good. And the installed base had actually gotten older. And so I think what you're starting to see is a process whereby there's a great product, there's a good macro environment. And you've got customers who really want to move to a modern infrastructure. A modern infrastructure has to both be secure at its very core and that can result, as you're seeing through that confluence of events, in a very strong PC market with very strong Pro performance. And I -- and certainly, the guide for Q4 continues to imply all those factors.",251

We've gotten a strategy, which sort of really helps us articulate both the growth opportunity as well as our investments across all of the various layers. So first is the console itself is the highest engagement console out in the marketplace. So anytime a new game, whether it's first-party or third-party releases, the fact that Xbox is where the best engagement is driven, benefits us. So as a platform owner, that's a great growth area for us. But we don't stop there because now we have, whether it's Xbox Live, whether it's Game Pass or Mixer, these are all additional opportunities to really serve the gamer as they play more games or watch games on different platforms. So that's the other big opportunity. But the last one, which I think is new and is something which is already paying its dividends on the Azure growth side, is we've taken all the knowledge of what it means to go to any one of these first-party titles of ours and building it as a PaaS service in Azure for game developers, and the PlayFab acquisition speaks directly to that. So those are all the various levers we have in gaming. And you'll see it in the MPC segment and you'll see it, as I said, increasingly over time even on Azure.",241

So let me talk a bit about the components and which ones, I think, are a bit more sustainable and which ones may have a temporal nature to them. The performance in Q3 and the guidance for Q4 shows actually strong performance in a number of places that we expect to continue. OEM Pro is a terrific example for the reasons I just gave in Brad's question. Windows commercial, which is really the business inside the enterprise of selling much of the security value on a far more annuity like basis. We've seen strong double-digit billings growth there and we expect that to continue into Q4 as well. The next piece that I would say is a part of that sort of uplift in Q4 is our Surface device. The reception to Surface Book 2 as well as Surface Pro with LTE has been quite good. And you see us reflect that again in Q4, even as the comparable gets a little bit more difficult than it was in Q3 for us when you saw a very large growth rate. We're still expecting high teens there. Then you get to that gaming component and specifically what Satya was talking about, the Xbox software and services component is where I would expect to see the impact of the continuation of Q3. Part of that, I want to be very clear, is consistent, even going back a few quarters. That has been a double-digit grower. It will be a double-digit grower. There'll be some volatility in the number like anything else. And third-party hit games will move it higher as they did this quarter and we're expecting in Q4, but there's also a really strong base to that business that is the result of what Satya is talking about in terms of having a vibrant platform with fans that believe in it and come to it with all the value that's been added. So that's how -- okay, great.",357

So Satya and Amy, I wanted to ask about server products because striking growth this quarter, given the comp. And Amy, you talked about expected strength into fiscal Q4 and all of that, I guess, is testament to the strength of the kind of hybrid leadership you have. The 2 questions, though, were really, is that strength in server products broad-based across Windows Server, SQL Server, System Center, et cetera? Or is there any sort of bias in the mix, if you will, in terms of what's driving that strength? And then Satya, you mentioned Cosmos DB and that was a striking number to me as well. And I was just curious, do you think, now you have the multi-model database in market, that, that can help you take market share within the data management database space?",144

I mean, I'll take the second one. I think that yes, I mean, Cosmos DB's pretty unique capability, in combination with everything else we do in both the data layer, the AI layer and the infrastructure layer, I think we have a tremendous opportunity because, as I said, the AI era is mostly first data era. And that's where I think the opportunity lies. But to your previous question, even there, there are multiple trends, and Amy referenced it in her remarks, which is, for example, virtualization still continues to be a growth driver of server products. The other growth driver of server products is cybersecurity and the security value in our servers. So that's one. The fact that we now have SQL and, for example, when you think about SQL itself, it's a hybrid product. You can tier SQL databases with the cloud. SQL is an AI product because we are the one database that actually allows you to write Python and R in situ, store procedures right in your database. So for example, when we talk about data and AI close to data because computation will always go wherever data is, and a lot of data shows up in relational databases and we have a growth driver there as well. And then there is the hybrid choices where somebody's building a smart factory, they're now looking and saying, ""What is the server I deploy in the factory to manage the millions of sensors that are there across the factory?"" And that's where Azure Stack shows up. So multiple drivers of what is essentially the server and cloud number in combination.",273

And it's across both Windows in particular, but also SQL, which are obviously the largest products within our server portfolio. The first, exactly with hybrid demand. We have something called hybrid -- Azure Hybrid Benefits. What it does is really provide confidence to our committed customers, buying on-prem servers that their transition to a hybrid, to cloud over a period of their agreement, is really about their choices, their time lines and their confidence. And so with that right, it lets them easily transition between Windows or SQL to those same benefits in Azure with a small uplift in price. I think that has actually been a core component. The second one was the virtualization drive or data center modernization, another one, do move the premium mix up a bit. So that's -- if you wanted to break it down into 2 more sustaining things, those are the types of things we're seeing in that number.",188

In fact, everything that we do across our solution areas are all ingredients to helping our customers achieve digital transformation objectives on. For example, how do they engage their customers? When I talked about Cosmos DB growth, Cosmos DB happens to be one of the best database products to be able to capture the signals that you want around your customers from a variety of different sources. That's one example of it. The second piece is, of course, around empowering your employees. I mean, one of the things that now has increasingly become #1 priority for every CEO is to make sure that the right tools, the right products are in front of their own employees so that they can do their very best work and collaborate. So teams grow. That's a great example of how companies are modernizing their workforce with things like Microsoft 365. The third one is operational efficiency. When we see the Dynamics 365 growth or Azure IoT growth, that's -- taking every IoT project, it ends up as a field service project. So that's a classic way somebody says, ""Let me sense something, predict something and then actually fix using field service."" So that's a transformational outcome that we're very well positioned. And lastly, people are changing their business models. You take somebody like Nalco Water. You could say they're a water company, but now they're pure water service company. In other words, they put sensors that allow them to actually deliver a very differentiated business model to their customers. And so that's the transformational outcomes we see. And we feel we -- at Microsoft, we're well positioned both with the technology but also with our front-line sales capability, service capability and partner capacity to best address the digital transformation needs.",319

I'm proud of our strong results this quarter and even more proud of what we have accomplished over the last 12 months. We delivered more than $110 billion in revenue for the full year with double-digit top line and bottom line growth. And our commercial cloud business surpassed more than $23 billion in revenue for the year with gross margin expanding to 57%. 
The strength of our results reflects accelerating innovation and the trust customers are placing in us to power their digital transformation. I shared our vision for the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge a little over a year ago, a vision that is now quickly becoming reality and impacting every customer in every industry.
Everything we have accomplished this year has been about accelerating our lead in this new era and the tremendous opportunity ahead. We focus on the right secular technology trends and growing markets and follow that up with solid road map execution. We've reorganized our engineering teams to break free of the categories of the past and better align with the emerging tech stack, from silicon to AI to experiences, to better serve the needs of our customers today and long into the future. 
We reoriented our sales and marketing teams, adding industry and technical expertise to partner more deeply with our customers on their digital transformation journeys. And most importantly, we drove innovation to deliver differentiated value across the cloud and the edge.
Now I'll briefly highlight some of our innovation and momentum. We introduced Microsoft 365 to empower employees in the modern workplace. Microsoft 365 is now a multibillion-dollar business that gives our customers a path to the cloud and broadens our reach with new and underpenetrated markets, including more than 2 billion first-line workers and industry-specific workflows. 
Across Microsoft 365, we are helping people be more productive, collaborate and stay secure on any device with AI-infused experiences they use every day, and it's driving usage. We have more than 135 million users of Office 365 commercial. Outlook mobile is being used on more than 100 million iOS and Android devices, and more than 200,000 organizations are using Microsoft Teams as the hub for teamwork.
We invested to make Windows 10 the most modern, secure, always up-to-date operating system. Windows 10 is now active on nearly 700 million devices, and the growth of the enterprise deployments this year exceeded our expectations. 
It was a record year for LinkedIn, now with more than 575 million members and revenue growth of 37% in Q4, the fifth consecutive quarter of revenue acceleration. We saw record levels of engagement in job postings again this quarter, with sessions growth up 41% year-over-year. This strong engagement is driven by the quality of the feed, video messaging and acceleration of mobile usage, with mobile sessions up more than 55% year-over-year. We will continually invest to make LinkedIn the essential platform to connect the world's professionals and help them achieve more with experiences powered by LinkedIn and Microsoft Graphs. 
Dynamics 365 gives organizations an alternative to monolithic siloed suites of business applications with modular, modern extensible and AI-driven apps that unlock insights across every part of the organization, from sales to HR. It's gaining traction as our third commercial cloud growth engine with revenue up 61% year-over-year. Our investments in Power BI, Power Apps and Flow as the new analytics and application platform are gaining significant momentum with ISVs and enterprise customers.
Azure is the only hyperscale cloud that extends to the edge across identity, data, application, platform security and management. And our differentiated architectural approach drove another strong quarter of growth. We're investing aggressively to build Azure as the world's computer. We expanded our global data center footprint to 54 regions, more than any other cloud provider, and with the most comprehensive compliance coverage in the industry. We added nearly 500 new Azure capabilities in the last year alone, focused on both existing workloads and new workloads such as IoT and AI at the edge. 
We introduced Azure Stack and Azure Sphere, 2 first-of-their-kind cloud to edge solutions that are already seeing strong customer demand. We're democratizing data science and AI with Azure Cognitive Services, Azure ML and data services such as Azure Cosmos DB to help organizations of all sizes convert their data into insights and experiences for competitive advantage. The world's leading companies are running on Azure, and I'm especially proud that Walmart chose Azure and Microsoft 365 to accelerate its digital transformation for their associates and customers.
In gaming, we are pursuing our expansive opportunity from the way games are created and distributed to how they're played and viewed, surpassing $10 billion in revenue this year for the first time. We're investing aggressively in content, community and cloud services across every endpoint to expand usage and deepen engagement with gamers. The combination of Xbox Live, Game Pass subscriptions and Mixer are driving record levels of growth and engagement.
Not only are we investing to grow organically but we're also investing inorganically in opportunities that expand our total addressable market and accrue value to our platforms and our customers. 
Take LinkedIn, we have united the world's leading professional cloud with the world's leading professional network and proved that we have an integration model that works, enabling LinkedIn to accelerate growth while retaining its member-first ethos. With GitHub, we recognize the increasingly vital role that developers play in value creation and growth in the era of the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge. Our pending acquisition will enable us to bring our tools and services to new audiences while enabling GitHub to grow and retain its independence and develop a first ethos in community. 
PlayFab accelerates our vision to build a world-class cloud platform for the gaming industry across mobile, PC and console, and the addition of 5 new gaming studios bolsters our first-party content development to support our fast-growing gaming services.
Microsoft has always been a partner-led company, and partners increasingly see more opportunity on our platforms, inspiring leading companies like SAP, Adobe and GE as well as fast-growing start-ups, like InMobi, to play an even larger role in our vibrant and growing partner ecosystem, an asset that gives us scale in this new era.
In closing, our opportunity has never been greater. We will continue to innovate and invest across our solution areas and serving our customers and their unmet and unarticulated needs. With this tremendous opportunity comes great responsibility. We're relentlessly working to instill trust in technology across everything we do. It's why we will continue to lead the industry dialogue on trust, advocate for customer privacy, drive industry-wide cybersecurity initiatives and champion ethical AI. 
Our investments and business model are fundamentally aligned with our customers' long-term interests and success. This opportunity and responsibility grounds us in our mission to empower every person in every organization on the planet to achieve more. I'm proud of our progress, and I'm proud of the more than 100,000 Microsoft employees around the world who are focused on our customers' success in this new era.
Now I'll hand over to Amy, who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining you for the questions.",1215
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2018",2018-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3188.0,1504670.0,59511940.0,Presenter Speech,Amy Hood,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $30.1 billion, up 17% and 15% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 19% and 16% in constant currency. Operating income increased 30% and 24% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $1.13, increasing 7% and 3% in constant currency. As a reminder, FY '17 included a $1.8 billion tax benefit related to previously nondeductible phone losses.
In our largest quarter of the year, our sales teams and partners delivered exceptional commercial results. We saw strong performance in most of our geographic regions against a backdrop of favorable macroeconomic conditions and positive IT spending trends. 
Customer commitment to our cloud platform continues to increase. In FY '18, we closed a record number of multimillion-dollar commercial cloud agreements and more than doubled the number of $10 million-plus Azure agreements. Our annuity mix increased 3 points year-over-year to 89%. As a result, commercial bookings increased 18%, even with a strong prior year comparable. Commercial unearned revenue was $29 billion, growing 23% and 21% in constant currency, significantly higher than anticipated due to stronger-than-expected cloud billings.
Our commercial cloud revenue was $6.9 billion, growing 53% and 50% in constant currency, with strong performance across the U.S., Western Europe and the U.K. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased 6 points to 58%. In line with our commitment at the beginning of the year, we improved the gross margin percentage in each cloud service, with Azure seeing the most significant improvement. Our company gross margin percentage was 68%, ahead of our expectations, and up 1 point year-over-year from improvement in our More Personal Computing segment, driven by Surface.
FX increased revenue growth by 2 points, 1 point lower than anticipated due to a stronger U.S. dollar. At the segment level, FX had a positive impact of 3 points on Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud, and 1 point on More Personal Computing revenue. The FX impact to COGS was immaterial. 
This quarter, operating expenses grew 9% and 8% in constant currency, above our expectations, due to revenue-driven expense such as sales compensation, given the strength of the quarter, and severance expense primarily in our sales organizations, offset by FX favorability. Strong revenue growth, improved device gross margin percentage and continued targeted investments in cloud engineering, cloud sales capacity and LinkedIn created operating income leverage. This quarter, operating income increased again, up 3 points year-over-year.
Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $9.7 billion, increasing 13% and 10% in constant currency, in line with our expectations, even with the headwinds from a stronger dollar and a higher-than-anticipated mix of cloud billings in our Office commercial and Dynamics businesses during the quarter. 
As a reminder, under ASC 606, cloud revenue is ratably recognized, while annuity on-premises revenue has a component of upfront recognition. A higher mix of cloud billings is reflected more on earned revenue and less in period recognition in a quarter.
Office commercial revenue increased 10% and 8% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue grew 38% and 35% in constant currency, and Office 365 commercial seats grew 29%. We continued to see healthy installed base growth and ARPU expansion from customer adoption of premium workloads in E3 and E5. Office consumer revenue increased 8% and 6% in constant currency, driven by recurring subscription revenue and growth in the subscriber base, now at 31.4 million. Our Dynamics business grew 11% and 8% in constant currency with double-digit billings growth. Dynamics 365 grew 61% and 56% in constant currency.
LinkedIn revenue grew 37% and 34% in constant currency with strong execution across all businesses. As Satya highlighted, engagement continued to accelerate, and we also saw record levels of job postings, benefiting from a robust U.S. job market.
Segment gross margin dollars grew 13% and 10% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year-over-year even as cloud mix increased, driven by margin expansion in Office 365 and LinkedIn. Operating expenses increased 7% as we continued to invest in LinkedIn, cloud engineering and commercial sales capacity. Operating income increased 20% and 13% in constant currency.
Revenue from the Intelligent Cloud segment was $9.6 billion, increasing 23% and 20% in constant currency, with better-than-expected results in both our on-premises and Azure businesses. Server products and cloud services revenue increased 26% and 24% in constant currency, driven by continued strong Azure revenue growth of 89% and 85% in constant currency. 
Azure per user services have performed ahead of expectations, with our Enterprise Mobility installed base growing 55% year-over-year to over 82 million. Our on-premises server business grew 8% and 6% in constant currency, with double-digit growth in premium server products revenue and healthy renewals benefiting from the significant value customers see in our hybrid solutions.
Enterprise Services revenue grew 8% and 7% in constant currency, as growth in premier support services and Microsoft consulting services was partially offset by a decline in custom support agreements for Windows Server 2003. Segment gross margin dollars increased 23% and 20% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged as material improvement in the Azure gross margin percentage was offset by a growing mix of Azure IaaS and PaaS revenue. Operating expenses increased 11% with ongoing investments in cloud engineering and sales capacity to support top line growth. Operating income grew 34%, up 30% in constant currency.
Finally, More Personal Computing. Revenue was $10.8 billion, up 17% and 16% in constant currency, with better-than-expected results in Windows commercial, OEM Pro and Surface. In the commercial space, we saw an accelerating pace of Windows 10 enterprise deployments this quarter. Customer demand for modern and secure hardware and stronger-than-expected PC growth in geographies where Pro mix was high contributed to OEM revenue growth of 14%, ahead of the overall commercial market. Windows commercial products and cloud services grew 23% and 19% in constant currency, driven by double-digit billings growth as well as a higher mix of in-quarter recognition from multiyear agreements.
In consumer, OEM non-Pro revenue declined 3%, slightly below the consumer PC market, driven by continued pressure in the entry-level price category, even as we continued to take share in the premium category. Inventory levels were within the normal range. Search revenue ex TAC increased 17% and 16% in constant currency, driven by enhancements to our advertising platform and Bing volume growth across both U.S. and international markets.
Surface revenue increased 25% and 21% in constant currency, driven by strong performance of the latest editions in the portfolio against a low prior year comparable. In gaming, revenue grew 39% and 38% in constant currency. Xbox software and services grew 36% and 35% in constant currency, mainly from a third-party title. Xbox Live monthly active users increased 8% to 57 million. Segment gross margin dollars grew 21% and 18% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased, driven by new Surface editions, offset by sales mix to lower-margin businesses.
Operating expenses grew 9% and 8% in constant currency, driven by seasonality, changes in advertising spend versus the prior year and investments in engineering across search and AI. Operating income grew 38% and 32% in constant currency.
Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $4.1 billion and increased on a sequential basis in line with expectations. Cash paid for property, plant and equipment was $4 billion, reflecting investments to support growth in our cloud business as well as a $250 million real estate acquisition.
Free cash flow was $7.4 billion and down 15% year-over-year, reflecting higher capital expenditures in support of our cloud business. Cash flow from operations grew 4% year-over-year and included tax payments related to the adoption of ASC 606 and TCJA as well as an earlier start to the hardware inventory build for holiday than in the prior year. Excluding the impact of these items, operating cash flow grew approximately 13%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections.
Other income and expense was approximately $300 million, lower than expected due to FX remeasurement. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 18%, higher than anticipated due to the geographic mix of our revenue. And finally, we returned $5.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, an increase of 16%. Our Q4 share repurchase was $2.1 billion, up 31% year-over-year but down sequentially, given the suspension of share repurchase activity in advance of the announced GitHub acquisition.
Now let's move to the outlook. My commentary for both the full year and next quarter does not include any impact from GitHub, which we still expect to close by the end of the calendar year. Overall, the key drivers and trends of our business through the next fiscal year remain largely unchanged from April and assume a consistent macro environment.
First on FX. Assuming that rates remain stable, we expect no impact to full year revenue growth, with any FX benefits in H1 offset in H2. FX should decrease COGS and operating expense growth by 1 point.
Second, our commercial business. Given corporate IT spend optimism and increasing demand for cloud services, our strong competitive product position and consistent sales execution, we expect another year of strong revenue growth and higher annuity mix across commercial business. As customer commitment to our cloud increases, we are seeing larger and longer-term agreements. As a result, we may see increased quarterly volatility in commercial bookings growth and commercial unearned revenue. 
Productivity and Business Processes should continue to grow double digits, driven by Office 365, Dynamics 365 and LinkedIn. Customer demand for our hybrid offerings should drive high teens growth in our server products and cloud services KPI. 
And in Azure specifically, we expect an increasing mix of IaaS and PaaS consumption-based revenue. In Windows, we expect strong business fundamentals in our OEM Pro and Windows commercial businesses, though the rates of revenue growth will slow through the year against a strong FY '18 comparable.
Third, commercial cloud gross margin percentage. We expect continued improvement in each commercial cloud service as well as in the overall commercial cloud gross margin percentage. The rate of improvement will moderate relative to FY '18 as revenue mix continues to shift to Azure IaaS and PaaS consumption-based services and we realize less year-over-year improvement in our per user services. We will continue to increase our investments in CapEx to meet growing demand for our cloud services, although, we do expect the growth rate for the year to moderate.
Next, operating expenses. Given our strong execution, we will continue to invest in the trends and growing markets we believe are fundamental to long-term shareholder value creation. Investment in commercial cloud, LinkedIn, gaming and AI should result in operating expense growth of roughly 7%. 
Even with these strategic investments and the continued shift to our cloud businesses, we expect operating margin to be up slightly year-over-year. Other income and expense should be slightly negative, in line with prior guidance and with quarterly variability, primarily due to changes in FX remeasurement, interest rates and valuation changes with the adoption of the new accounting rules for financial investments. 
And finally, tax rate. We've refined our estimates of the impacts from TCJA, the mix of service versus license revenue and the geographic mix of revenue and now expect our FY '19 effective tax rate to be roughly 17%, with quarterly variability.
Now to the outlook for first quarter. First, FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by approximately 1 point and decrease COGS and operating expenses by 1 point.
Second, our commercial business. We expect another healthy quarter with commercial unearned revenue down approximately 10% sequentially, in line with historic seasonality. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage will improve slightly on a sequential basis.
Third, we expect another quarter of sequential growth in capital expenditures as we continue to support growing global customer demand.
Now to the segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $9.25 billion and $9.45 billion, driven by double-digit growth in Office commercial and Dynamics. LinkedIn revenue growth should remain high on a stronger prior year comparable. 
In Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $8.15 billion and $8.35 billion. Azure revenue growth should reflect a balance of continued strength in our IaaS and PaaS consumption-based services and a moderating growth -- rate of growth in our per user services. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $9.95 billion and $10.25 billion. In OEM Pro, we expect revenue growth in line with the commercial PC market. And in OEM non-Pro, we expect similar dynamics as seen in Q4.
In Surface, we continue to expect strong performance from our latest editions, including the new Surface Go, to drive growth similar to Q1 of the prior year. Search ex TAC should see another quarter of mid-teens growth, with consistent execution against rate and volume growth opportunities. 
In gaming, we expect mid-teens revenue growth with continued strong user engagement on our platform. The software and services growth rate will moderate due to strong third-party titles launched a year ago. We expect COGS of $9.5 billion to $9.7 billion and operating expenses of $9.2 billion to $9.3 billion. Other income and expense is expected to be approximately negative $100 million. 
And finally, we expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be slightly lower than our full year rate due to the volume of equity vests that take place during our first quarter. Mike, let's go to Q&A.",2238

I think growth overall in Azure this quarter is probably ahead of most people's expectations. And it sounds like the type of business that's being done on Azure is becoming more strategic and changing a little bit. So Satya, I was hoping you could talk to us a little bit about the types of workloads, the type of sort of services that are being used on Azure, how that's evolved over the past year. And Amy, for you, maybe there's a new KPI, I believe, you gave us sort of the growth in the Enterprise Mobility up 55%. Was that in line with your expectations because I know you were sort of tempering our expectations on growth in that part of the business? Is that growing in line with kind of the slowdown you were expecting? Or is that better than you had imagined?",153

Overall, in terms of the workload mix, it's been fairly stable, which is our hybrid value proposition really is -- continued to resonate, so that means there is a bunch of workloads that are migrating to the cloud. People use both Azure Stack plus Azure, so that continues to drive a lot of IaaS growth for us as people are sort of looking basically to lift and shift a lot of their current data center workloads. Then, on top of it, we even have a modernization of apps that is accelerating, and that drives a lot of the higher-level services, in particular, our data services as well as our AI services when AI services are essentially compute, but what happens is all of this compute then requires storage and data, and that's another place where we see increasing acceleration. The one thing that I would say that I'm increasingly seeing is Tier 1 workloads. In some sense, when we think about some of the commitments being made by some of the biggest brands in the world in terms of what they're doing, one, it's very core to their operation. And two, they're running it in the cloud. And so that's one thing that definitely is a market difference for us.",228

And really, the driver of these per user services such as EMS actually is the value proposition that Satya refers to and we refer to as Microsoft 365, and we saw strength broadly. And if you think about that, it's the Windows commercial, it's Office 365 commercial and EMS. And really that, I think, what we've heard a lot was the value of the security and management continuing to add more supported endpoints offer really tremendous value to customers, and we did see a bit more strength than I was anticipating in Q4.",117

So when you look out into fiscal '19, how would you compare the degree of renewal activity versus fiscal '18 and fiscal '17? It sounds like you're still constructive, but I'd love to hear some color, whether it feels as good as the fiscal year you just ended?",70

Let me break up that question a little bit because you actually asked a couple of things that are important. Number one, the unearned strength that we saw at the end of Q4, you're right, was very good execution on renewals on a reasonably large renewal base. But there was also very good execution of adding new workloads, adding new opportunity in Q4, things such as Azure, as an example, or Dynamics 365, as an example. So really, Q4 wasn't just renewal activity, it was also new workloads and new value. So when you look into '19, I am optimistic on both of those fronts, good execution continuing on renewals as well as adding new value and new opportunity. And the third component of your question was really how did the renewal base correlate to FY '18. The answer is it's a little bigger but it actually has the same amount of volatility quarter-to-quarter. So Q1's renewal base is actually almost equivalent to last year.",167

And I know you were kind of a little bit touching on that with Karl, but is there any way to help think about how that, in particular, might be helping the expansion rate to those accounts? And can you help us think about how this might be -- how that might be helping drive growth in your existing contracts? And then, the other question would be, you mentioned that you're moving from per user consumption that you're going to see more growth in consumption-based services versus per user Azure workload growth. And I'm just kind of wondering if you could share with us, is there any gross margin impact there? Does one have higher gross margins than the other? Is there anything that we should be taking from how you're parsing those comments about how we think of Azure's gross margin progression going forward?",180
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2018",2018-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3188.0,1504670.0,59511951.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,14,"Thanks, Heather. So on the first one, I actually think that these hybrid use benefits have been sort of the best kept secrets. So I'm actually hoping that going into this next fiscal year, we do a much better job and customers do a much better job for their own benefit because the advantage Azure has because of the hybrid use benefits across the entire workload are pretty phenomenal. And we had a good set of sessions at our partner meetings this week, just really making sure everybody understands those benefits. So I don't think that, that has really played out. If anything, all the growth we have seen is in spite of that not being broadly really driving growth. But to your second question, I'll even say the following, which is that I think there is clearly a difference in GM between the per user and consumption. But the key is even the consumption services come in different forms. There is the IaaS services, there is the data services and some of the higher-level services. Some of these IoT services now even have SaaS components to it. So therefore, I think that the mix will be different by quarter by quarter. But increasingly, our strategy is, in many times, to get customers to get going with what is core storage or core compute but then they scale into these higher-level of services.",233

But it really was more in Windows. And the value, as we continue to see in SQL next year, I do think there's some opportunity for customers to realize real value from these hybrid benefits. And so it sort of adds confidence to my high teens KPI growth for the year is that this is a very customer value-oriented offer. To your question on GM, Satya's obviously correct on that one. And I would say, the way we think about it is actually more -- when you talk about Azure per user, it really does move more with M365 per user. It's almost better to put that in your mind as behaving more and having margin structures more like Office 365 and behave quite similarly. It tends to have good quarters when we do good execution on Office 365. And so my comments were more and continue to be around having people understand that sales motion and that it tends to move in that direction.",205

The first is if you look at, this quarter, at Intelligent Cloud revenue, it grew 23% and the gross margin dollars grew the same, 23%. Given the fast-growing lower-margin Azure business, we're not seeing any longer negative margin impact. Have you reached the point where the incremental dollar of Azure revenue is close to the overall Intelligent Cloud gross margin? And then, a second, I apologize, slightly long question. CapEx spending in the quarter and the full year were both strong. We could argue 2 possibilities, it's driven by all the capacity of the demand or you're having to spend a lot of it on replacing equipment as they're aging out. How should we think about the mix in CapEx between building demand and replacing what's there?",133
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2018",2018-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3188.0,1504670.0,59511955.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,18,"Let me take both those. On the first one, in terms of the GM this quarter, you're right. The improvements, particularly in the IaaS and PaaS gross margin of Azure did offset the cloud mix to Azure within the segment. Going forward, continuing to see that. I think we'll see more pressure on gross margin just because the amount of Azure in the mix at the rate it's growing, we're still not at that point where $1 of gross margin in the cloud is equivalent to $1 of on-prem. That being said, we have a lot, as you saw this quarter, room to grow gross margin dollars in that within -- even within that frame going into FY '19. On your second question in terms of capital spend, if you think about it at a high level, our capital expenditures are growing at a lower rate than our overall cloud revenue is growing. And that's why you're starting to see leverage, right, flow through the P&L. And I think that the rate of CapEx growth, as I said, in FY '19 will moderate. That happens because, of course, we're doing some replacement but we're also adding regions and seeing a lot of global demand. And so, we're actually -- and improving margins. So I think that's -- when I put it at very high level as you ask the question, I tend to think revenue's growing faster than my capital, you're seeing leverage through the P&L., and we'll see a moderating rate in FY '19 even if Q1 is a big quarter. It's just going to be volatile, as CapEx tends to be, quarter-to-quarter based on both supply chain and demand.",281

It's the lowest you've seen. I know 606 drives some volatility in that business. Could you help us understand what drove that in the quarter? And I know you're making some changes like to support and so forth as we get into the out years. Is there any impact that you expect to the growth rate in that business as we look forward from those changes?",84

The entire impact in that KPI, I actually feel very good about that number because, if you think about the $1 billion-plus beat we had to the unearned, it was partially due to the fact that we had very good mix shift to Office 365 in terms of billings in the quarter. Almost very little of that gets recognized in quarter. It almost all goes to the balance sheet. So my confidence for FY '19 in that number being the double digits we talked about in the full year guide only gets raised by seeing that execution. So it is really 606-related is the way to think about it, plus a mix of billings and billings strength. So I don't really think about that as being a negative. And you saw the exact same behavior in Dynamics, so it is a pretty similar in-period, in-quarter impact.",148

You commented on the positive spread that you're seeing in the Windows OEM business, both overall but particularly on the commercial side. When you start to think forward over the next, call it, couple of quarters, obviously, you told us what the positive drivers were. But how do you see those sort of playing out? And can we maintain that positive spread? And if so, why? And if it does maybe narrow, just sort of how do you think about the narrowing?",87

Let me frame it first as the things that I and we are seeing really customer-driven, which is, if you start with Windows 10 and the value that customers see and what we are seeing is accelerating enterprise deployment of Windows 10. When that happens, it does create demand for new devices and modern devices that improve security. So that then, in turn, results in a better and stronger overall OEM PC commercial market. In addition, because the macroeconomic conditions are actually quite good on this front and with some business optimism creating some wind at our back, I also think people look and say, ""If security and value are important, this is a great time to invest in modern PCs."" And particularly in markets where Pro mix has been strong, I continue to expect to see all of those things happen through the course of next year. Now what you will see, however, if all those things even do remain true, which I expect them to if the economic environment stays the same, H2, where we've had really strong revenue growth and a really strong market, will, I think, moderate growth-wise just because the base it was coming off of in '17 was just a lot lower. So even if I see all the good things and good trends happening that I feel really create a great opportunity for us to sell Microsoft 365, you will see growth rates moderate in H2.",244

You're right. The first one was the benefits that we saw from hybrid, in particular, with an outsized impact on Windows Server. The second has been a trend we also have talked about a little bit before. We saw strong double-digit growth in premium.

I'm curious how large do you think edge computing will become relative to centralized cloud computing?",30

So we don't split this into there's an edge computing, there's a cloud computing. The need for computing is, on a secular basis, going to increase. And as you need to reason over large amounts of data, you need not only storage and compute to be colocated all over as the world gets embedded with computing. That's what we are building for. So if you think about our real competitive advantage and differentiation is, we have one programming model, one identity model, security, management so that modern developers as well as IT can use the compute available from Azure Sphere to Azure. And the reality is these modern workloads, in fact, use it all. So it's not like I just build an Azure Sphere application. I build an application that's fundamentally distributed that also happens to run some compute on Azure Sphere. That's, I think, the future, which is distributed computing going back to what needs to be truly distributed, event-driven, server-less even versus this thing about let's just have onetime migration to something new.",197

I'd like to understand how you view Dynamics' current positioning compared to the market opportunities? And the context of the question is Dynamics remains a fairly small part of Microsoft revenues. As well, if you look at the market share of where Dynamics serve, it's a fairly small part of the market served. So what do you think Microsoft needs to do to have a larger impact against the market opportunities?",82
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2018",2018-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3188.0,1504670.0,59511972.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,35,"Yes. Overall, we are very committed and very bullish about the opportunity in Dynamics. With Dynamics 365, for example, what you've even just seen in the last fiscal year, which has been the first full fiscal year where we had this modern modular approach to business applications. I think it's very disruptive in the marketplace because it brings a very different value proposition. It has a price advantage and a value advantage for customers and in what is fundamentally a fragmented market, this is not business applications, never was and never will be a winner-take-all. I know folks think about it that way, but it's not. I mean, it's about one small category in one segment called enterprise. There is a share. High share is considered 20%, 35% or what have you. So in some sense, this one has always been about being able to serve customers, especially in an increasing digitization world, right, which is the need for more business process automation is increasing. Take an IoT project, translate into a preventive maintenance in Azure and then ends up as field service in Dynamics. That's been one pattern we've seen a ton of traction with. So to me, us going, in fact, to these new secular growth opportunities while being disruptive to the status quo of anyone who has high margin and very high-priced monolithic products today is basically our strategy going forward.",234

But this quarter, that seat growth actually accelerated about 1 point to 29%. And when we look back on it, the trajectory really isn't too different than where it was even a year ago. So I'm just curious, is there some underlying driver there that would keep that deceleration relatively manageable going forward? Or would you continue to see that slowing in a way that, over time, would exert a little drag on Azure through those per user Azure services?",102
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2018",2018-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3188.0,1504670.0,59511975.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,38,"This is one where, over time, there certainly is going to be a deceleration just because this is a per user business. M365 has that characteristic and Office has it, EMS has it. And so this quarter, actually, what we saw was actually some strength in education was added a good amount of seats this quarter as well as good execution across our other segments. So we did see a bit of growth that we're excited to see, frankly, in a segment where we've been working hard to make additional progress and add value. The team has actually done a nice job in that segment of creating some really modern offers to get that into the hands of that market as well. But over the long term and as we continue to move aggressively, we will continue to see seat growth dissipate. But I would also say, this is going to take longer than I think maybe people would have thought. There are lots of users as we continue to redefine what Office is that you add to the base, whether that's first-line workers, whether that's an increasing number of small businesses who finally have access and value that we're creating for them across things from scheduling all the way to being able to work through minor business process adjustments like Satya has talked about. So really, as we continue to redefine what Office means from something that people have always associated with Word, Excel and PowerPoint to things that mean mobile or video with stream or collaboration with Teams, I think we have opportunity to continue to add those new users, new types of users that we haven't had access before and new capabilities even to users we have.",290

We're off to a very strong start in fiscal '19, delivering record revenue and profit. Every organization today needs tech intensity to compete and grow in an increasingly digital world.
There are 2 aspects to this. Think of it as a simple equation. First, every organization needs to be a fast adopter of best-in-class technology. Second, they'll need to build their own proprietary digital capability. Our cloud platforms and tools enable our customers to build tech intensity while ensuring we're addressing their tough questions around trust, both trust in technology and trust that they have a partner whose business model is aligned to their success. No customer wants to be dependent on a provider that sells them technology on one end and competes with them on the other. Getting this equation right is key to their success going forward. Microsoft is uniquely positioned to help.
Now I'll briefly highlight how we're innovating across our solution areas. A little over a year ago, we introduced Microsoft 365 to help organizations of all sizes empower their employees in the modern workplace. Today, it's a multibillion-dollar business that gives our customers a path to the cloud and broadens our reach with new and underpenetrated markets. Customers from large multinationals like Eli Lilly to Rio Tinto first-line field workers to small businesses are all choosing Microsoft 365.
Cybersecurity is a central challenge. Microsoft security differentiation is based on 2 things: first, our unparalleled operational security posture; second, our comprehensive product suite spanning identity, information, application and device protection. We analyze more than 6.5 trillion signals each day, process 4 -- 50 billion authentications monthly and scan 400 billion e-mails for malware and phishing each month. These massive signals generate insights that fuel security innovations for customers. New capabilities in Microsoft 365 detect, investigate and remediate sophisticated cybersecurity threats across every endpoint, saving IT professionals thousands of hours.
Microsoft Security Score gives organizations a dynamic report card on their security posture. In identity management, Microsoft is already a leader with Azure Active Directory, and we are innovating with new capabilities to eliminate passwords for the hundreds of thousands of Azure AD-connected apps that businesses use every day.
The future of productivity and collaboration will be defined by AI innovation. And new AI-driven features across Microsoft 365 from automated slide design to proactive Cortana reminders to enhanced search experiences and real-time meeting transcription to org analytics are all augmenting human capability, making it easier for people to focus on what matters most.
Another differentiator is Microsoft Teams. Microsoft Teams is the only enterprise-grade solution that brings together messaging, video conferencing, meetings and web-based collab into a single integrated user experience scaffolding. It eliminates the need for discrete single-point solutions that only increase an organization's security and compliance exposure. Customers recognize this value. Teams is now the hub for teamwork for 329,000 organizations, including 87 of the Fortune 100. And we are adding automated translation support for meetings, shift scheduling for first-line workers and new industry-specific offerings, including health care and small business.
Windows 10 continues to gain traction in the enterprise as the most secure and productive operating system, and more than half of our commercial device installed base is now on Windows 10. Surface continues to set the bar for the industry for -- with 5 new category leading Surface devices, including the new Surface Go. Microsoft 365 and Surface are inspiring our OEM ecosystems to innovate, and we have the strongest line of devices going into the holiday season.
Moving to business applications. AI-powered digital feedback loops that connect products, operations, customers and employees to create predictive power, automate workflows and ultimately, improve outcomes are key to all organizations. Dynamics 365 uniquely addresses this need. We expect Dynamics to deliver more than $2.5 billion in revenue this year with half of that total coming from Dynamics 365. And this quarter, we introduced Dynamics 365 AI, a new class of AI applications built for an era where the systems of record and engagement are converted into intelligence.
Dynamics 365 mixed reality digitizes the physical spaces and interactions. Companies like Chevron and ZF Group are already using it to transform training and design for their first-line workers. And H&M, the world's second-largest clothing retailer, is relying on Dynamics 365 to digitize its critical business processes.
These customers and others recognize the advantage of our modular extensible approach over the traditional SaaS model of monolithic suites or siloed apps. And our investments in our analytics and application platform spanning Power BI, Power Apps and Flow are driving momentum with customers and have made us a leader in no-code app building and business analytics in the cloud.
Our open data initiative, a strategic partnership with Adobe and SAP, takes this even further, delivering on our vision of one unified data model to provide unparalleled business insight from behavioral, transactional, financial and operational data. Together, we'll enable data to be exchanged and enriched across systems, making it a renewable resource that enables new intelligent customer experiences.
LinkedIn continues to be an essential platform to connect the world's professionals with sessions growth of 34% year-over-year and record levels of messages sent and content shared. We're innovating with new experiences that leverage the LinkedIn and Microsoft Graphs such as the ability to e-mail LinkedIn connections directly from Microsoft 365. Strong engagement across the platform is fueling demand for sponsored content and marketing solutions and Talent Solutions, which saw record job postings again this quarter.
Talent Insights is a new self-service analytics solution that gives HR professionals competitive intelligence and labor market trends for an increasingly competitive jobs market. And the pending acquisition of Glint brings employee insights alongside LinkedIn's workforce insights to create a powerful solution to help customers attract, retain and develop the best talent.
Now turning to Azure. Customers from multinationals like Volkswagen, Anheuser-Busch InBev, MasterCard to fast-growing startups like Grab are recognizing the architectural advantage of a consistent computing stack from the cloud to the edge. Azure is the only hyperscale cloud that extends to the edge across identity, data, application platform as well as security and management. We introduced 100 new Azure capabilities this quarter alone, focused on both existing workloads like security and new workloads like IoT and edge AI. With Azure Confidential Computing, Azure is now the first cloud to provide a secure platform for protecting the confidentiality and the integrity of data while in use, adding to our existing security protections to encrypt data in transit as well as in rest.
Every company needs a strategy to take advantage of the billions of IoT devices entering the market each year. Azure Sphere, our end-to-end solution for securing microcontroller-powered devices, is now broadly available and seeing strong customer interest. Azure Digital Twins is a new service that models relationships and interactions across people, places and devices.
We're investing to make Azure the best cloud for enterprise data. Our data services spanning SQL Database, Cosmos DB, Data Warehouse and Data Lake provide the most comprehensive data platform needed for enterprise data estates. Azure ML builds on this foundation to further democratize data and AI to unlock insights, helping data scientists build and train AI models faster, then deploy them with the -- through the cloud or to the edge.
Across industries, our customers and partners are using services like these to transform. BMW introduced an agent to redefine how people interact with their cars. Bühler, which processes 65% of the world's grain, is relying on Azure Cognitive Services to improve food safety. Shell is applying AI across its enterprise to optimize deal productivity and keep workers safe. And this week at Sibos Conference, the Microsoft Cloud is front and center, powering financial services transformation for organizations such as SWIFT, which is enabling secure payment transfers on Azure.
Finally, our pending acquisition of GitHub, which we expect to close shortly, recognizes the increasingly vital role developers play in value creation and growth across every industry. I'm excited about the opportunity to bring our tools and services to new audiences while enabling GitHub to grow and retain its developer-first ethos.
Now I'll turn to gaming. We continue to broaden our reach with more than 2 billion gamers worldwide and expand our opportunity from the way games are distributed to how they're played and viewed. We are investing in content, community and cloud services across every endpoint to expand usage and deepen engagement.  First-party content is key to our approach, and we now have 11 Game Studios in our portfolio to deliver differentiated content for our fast-growing services like Game Pass. Xbox Live now has 57 million monthly active users, and Mixer usage growth is accelerating. This loyal high-value community is our strongest asset, creating expanding opportunity for monetization of first- and third-party games. Fortnite is a good example of that, and all up, we are seeing record software and services revenue and engagement being driven on our platform.
Earlier this month, we announced Project xCloud, a breakthrough game streaming technology that puts gamers at the center of their gaming experience, enabling them to play games in high fidelity wherever and whenever they want on any device. And it will empower game developers to scale through hundreds of millions of new users across devices. It's early days, but I'm excited about our road map.
Across our businesses, we are accelerating innovation, picking the right secular trends, investing in large growing markets, many of which are still in their infancy. Additionally, every one of our solutions is reinforcing our core intelligent cloud and intelligent edge platform. Not only are we optimistic about the opportunity for us and for our customers, we also recognize our responsibility.
We were one of the first companies in the United States to require suppliers doing substantial business with us to provide paid time-off for their employees. And this quarter, we took a further step to ensure that these suppliers also provide their employees with paid parental leave. We're ensuring that our enterprise-class security innovation not only helps our largest customers but also protects small businesses and consumers who are often the most vulnerable to attacks.
Finally, we are putting AI into the hands of change-makers to address society's most pressing challenges with initiatives like AI for Humanitarian Action, which supports critical disaster recovery efforts around the world and more. This recognition of our broader responsibility, coupled with our bold innovation, makes me incredibly optimistic about our opportunity ahead.
With that, now I'll hand over to Amy, who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining you after for questions.",1785
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2018",2018-10-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3193.0,1590918.0,62815296.0,Presenter Speech,Amy Hood,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $29.1 billion, up 19% and 18% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 18%. Operating income increased 29% and 28% in constant currency, and earnings per share was $1.14, increasing 36% and 33% in constant currency. Another quarter of double-digit revenue and operating income growth drove a record start to the fiscal year. We saw strength across each of our segments with strong sales execution by our partners and sales teams. Customer demand for our hybrid and cloud offerings drove the quarter, and we continued to benefit from favorable macroeconomic and IT spending trends.
Now to our commercial business. As a reminder, starting this quarter, the commercial portion of LinkedIn is included in these metrics. Our commercial annuity -- our commercial revenue annuity mix increased 1 point year-over-year to 90%. Commercial unearned revenue was $27.3 billion, growing 22% and 21% in constant currency, in line with expectations. 
On an expiry base that was roughly flat year-over-year, commercial bookings were better than expected and increased 15% and 16% in constant currency, benefiting from larger long-term Azure contracts, growth in Azure consumption overages and pay-as-you-go contracts and strength in on-premises revenue. These contract types impact bookings, reported revenue and unearned revenue in different ways. Let me explain.
First, under ASC 606, hybrid and on-premises offerings drive bookings growth and more in-period revenue recognition. Therefore, there's less impact on unearned revenue. Second, growth in Azure consumption overages and pay-as-you-go contracts drive bookings growth and in-period revenue but have little impact on unearned revenue. And finally, long-term Azure contracts drive significant bookings growth but have a smaller impact on in-period revenue and unearned revenue. The inclusion of LinkedIn results was immaterial to the growth rates of commercial unearned and commercial bookings.
Commercial cloud revenue was $8.5 billion, growing 47% and 46% in constant currency with strong performance in the U.S., Western Europe and the U.K. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased 4 points to 62%, driven again by significant improvement in Azure gross margin.
Company level, gross margin percentage was 66%, down slightly year-over-year with sales mix shift to gaming and commercial cloud. FX increased overall company and Productivity and Business Processes revenue by 1 point, in line with guidance. The impact to Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing revenue was immaterial, 1 point less favorable than expected. FX impact was immaterial to COGS and operating expenses, about 1 point less favorable than expected. Even with that headwind, operating expenses grew 8%, in line with expectations.
Our engineering and sales capacity investments in large growing markets continue to deliver differentiated value for our customers while generating material operating income leverage. This quarter, we increased operating margin nearly 3 points year-over-year.
Now to segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $9.8 billion, increasing 19% and 18% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by both the on-premises and cloud businesses. Office commercial revenue grew 17% and 16% in constant currency, driven by continued Office 365 commercial growth and approximately 3 points of growth from increased demand ahead of a price increase with the launch of Office 2019.
Office 365 commercial revenue grew 36% and 35% in constant currency with installed base expansion across all customer segments and ARPU growth as customers shift to E3 and E5 workloads. Office 365 commercial seats grew 29% and, in line with last quarter, benefited from strong performance of our Microsoft 365 academic offers.
Office consumer revenue increased 16% and 17% in constant currency, driven by growth in Office 365 subscription revenue and approximately 5 points of growth from increased channel demand ahead of a price increase with the launch of Office 2019. Office 365 consumer subscribers grew to 32.5 million.
Dynamics revenue grew 20%, including a few points from a greater mix of contracts with higher in-period recognition under ASC 606. Dynamics 365 grew 51% and 49% in constant currency.
LinkedIn revenue increased 33% with strong execution across all businesses. Segment gross margin dollars grew 18% and 17% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage declined slightly year-over-year as cloud mix offset LinkedIn and Office 365 margin expansion. Operating expenses increased 7% and 8% in constant currency with ongoing investments in LinkedIn, cloud engineering and commercial sales capacity to support top line growth. Operating income increased 29% and 27% in constant currency.
Revenue from Intelligent Cloud was $8.6 billion, increasing 24%, better than anticipated driven by demand for our hybrid offerings. Server products and cloud services revenue grew 28%. Azure revenue increased 76%, in line with our expectations with strong growth across both consumption and per user base businesses. Our on-premises server business grew 10% and 9% in constant currency, driven by continued demand for premium versions and hybrid solutions as well as increased demand ahead of Q2 price increases for certain versions of our server products.
Enterprise Services revenue grew 6% as growth in premier support services and Microsoft consulting services was partially offset by a decline in custom support agreements for Windows Server 2003. Segment gross margin dollars increased 28% and 27% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased year-over-year as material improvement in Azure gross margin percentage offset the growing mix of Azure IaaS and PaaS revenue. Operating expenses increased 19% and 20% in constant currency, driven by ongoing investments in cloud and AI engineering and commercial sales capacity. Operating income grew 37% and 35% in constant currency.
Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $10.7 billion, increasing 15% with significantly better-than-expected results in gaming. Gaming revenue increased 44% and 45% in constant currency with better-than-expected results across both software and services and hardware.
Xbox software and services revenue grew 36% with continued strength from a third-party title. Xbox hardware revenue grew 94% and 96% in constant currency with earlier-than-expected sell-in of holiday hardware bundles.
In Windows, we saw healthy Windows 10 commercial deployments as the OEM ecosystem continued to benefit from customer demand for modern and secure software and hardware. OEM Pro revenue grew 8%, a few points ahead of the commercial PC market from a higher mix of premium licenses. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 12%. In consumer, OEM non-Pro revenue declined 5%, below the consumer PC market with continued pressure in the entry-level price category. Inventory levels were within the normal range.
Search revenue ex TAC increased 17%, driven by Bing rate growth and increased volume in U.S. and international markets. In Surface, revenue grew 14%, driven by Surface Book 2 and Surface Go. Segment gross margin dollars grew 10%, and gross margin percentage decreased due to sales mix to our lower-margin gaming business. Operating expenses declined 1%. As a result, operating income grew 23%.
Now back to our total company results. As expected, capital expenditures, including finance leases, were up sequentially to $4.3 billion, driven by ongoing investment to meet demand for our cloud services. Cash paid for property, plant and equipment was $3.6 billion.
Free cash flow was $10.1 billion and decreased 2% year-over-year due to higher capital expenditures in support of our cloud business. Cash flow from operations increased 10% year-over-year with strong cloud billings and collections partially offset by our first annual TCJA payment of $1.5 billion. Excluding the TCJA payment, free cash flow grew 12% and operating cash flow grew 22%.
Other income was $266 million, higher than anticipated, due to realized gains and the recording of mark-to-market gains under the new accounting rules for financial investments. Our effective tax rate was 14%. As a reminder, Q1 and Q3 rates are impacted by the volume of equity vests during those quarters. This Q1, the impact was a bit more than expected due to the movement of our share price within the quarter. And finally, in line with our continued commitment, we returned $6.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, an increase of 27% year-over-year.
Now let's turn to our outlook. Given that we expect the GitHub acquisition to close shortly, my commentary includes the full impact of the deal, including purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related expenses based on our current understanding of the purchase price allocation and related deal accounting. We continue to expect the deal to be minimally dilutive to FY '19 and FY '20 EPS on a non-GAAP basis and accretive to FY '20 operating income on a non-GAAP basis.
For Q2, first, FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect no impact to revenue growth. FX should decrease COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point.
Second, our commercial business. We expect another quarter of healthy performance with solid bookings growth. Commercial unearned revenue is expected to grow approximately 19% year-over-year even with the ongoing shift toward the cloud contracts discussed earlier. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage should continue to improve on a year-over-year basis though at a more moderated rate than prior years given the continued mix of revenue toward Azure consumption-based services. Margin improvement will continue to vary on a quarterly basis driven by revenue mix, seasonality and the timing of infrastructure spend.
Third, we expect ongoing year-over-year growth in capital expenditure as we support growing demand. Given infrastructure spend timing, Q2 CapEx should be roughly in line with Q1. 
Now to our segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $9.95 billion and $10.15 billion. Office commercial and Dynamics should continue to exhibit double-digit growth, driven by strong cloud performance but with some moderation due to the on-premise drivers discussed earlier. Office consumer will see continued momentum in new subscribers but overall revenue growth will be negatively impacted as channel inventories normalize. LinkedIn revenue growth should remain healthy though on a stronger prior year comparable.
For Intelligent Cloud, which includes GitHub, we expect revenue between $9.15 billion and $9.35 billion. In Azure, we expect healthy growth across our consumption and per user base businesses, though per user services growth will moderate given the size of the installed base.
In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $12.8 billion and $13.2 billion. OEM Pro revenue growth should be in line with the commercial PC market. As a reminder, prior year comparables strengthened throughout the remainder of the year. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, we expect continued strength as well as the benefit of a low prior year comparable. And for OEM non-Pro, we expect similar dynamics to Q1.
In Surface, revenue growth should accelerate with the impact of recently launched devices, including Surface Pro 6 and Surface Laptop 2. Search ex TAC results should be similar to Q1 with durable growth in rate and volume.
In gaming, we expect revenue growth to moderate due to a prior year comparable that included the launch of Xbox One X. Software and services growth should be similar to Q1 with continued benefit from a third-party title plus overall platform strength.
Now, back to our company results. We expect COGS of $12.2 billion to $12.4 billion and operating expenses of $9.8 billion to $9.9 billion. Other income and expense should be approximately $50 million as interest income and investment gains are partially offset by interest expense. And finally, we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be slightly above the full year estimate of 17%.
Now a few comments on the fiscal year. First, FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect a 1-point headwind to full year revenue growth with any benefit in H1 offset in H2. FX should decrease COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point.
Second, operating expenses. We remain unchanged in our commitment to invest in strategic priorities that are key to driving long-term value creation. With the addition of GitHub as a strategic priority, we now expect operating expenses to grow roughly 8%. Growth, excluding GitHub, is expected to be in line with our prior guidance of roughly 7%.
Third on operating margin. Even with the full GAAP impact of GitHub purchase accounting now included in our guidance, we continue to expect our operating margin to be up slightly year-over-year. Margin leverage is a direct result of our focused investments in the right technology trends coupled with consistent execution.
For CapEx, we continue to expect the growth rate for the year to moderate, even as we meet demand for our cloud services. Regarding the GitHub acquisition, we remain committed to an incremental share buyback beyond the normal quarterly pace that is expected to fully offset stock consideration issue in the transaction by the end of the fiscal year. And finally, we continue to expect the full year effective tax rate to be roughly 17% with quarterly variability.

And I'm just wondering if you could just give us a sense of how much maybe the pricing changes that went into effect at the beginning of the quarter that you're in now might have helped drive spending last quarter ahead of them going into effect. But also, can you share with us how the Azure Hybrid Benefit message might also be impacting Azure growth rate?",95
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2018",2018-10-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3193.0,1590918.0,62815300.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,7,"Sure. Thanks, Heather, for the question. I'll start and then, Amy, you can add. I mean, I think what you're fundamentally seeing in that overall KPI is what I think our 2 major advantages we have. One is an architectural technology advantage around hybrid, right? So we don't think of hybrid as some stopgap as a move to the cloud. We think about it's the coming together of distributed computing, where the cloud and the edge work together for not just the old workloads but most importantly, for new workloads. And that's where we're seeing some very significant good feedback loops and shaping even our future road map. And this is a place where we're leading. The second thing, as you pointed out in your question, is we have a business model advantage. The Azure benefits are things both for Windows Server as well as for SQL, which I think are very, very unique to us, and you see that. So the combination of the technology advantage and the business model advantage is what I see in the results, whether it's the stand-alone Azure growth, which is what we expected, and it's very strong. And the server KPI is even stronger. So I think that's at least how I would answer that question.",213

The overall number, even if you take a couple of points off that 28%, is a very good performance, I believe, to Satya's point, is the impact you've seen of the very aligned technology road map on the architecture plus the business model that matches it.",84

This quarter, you talked about Azure gross margins coming in sort of -- continuing to improve really nicely. CapEx came in, I mean, the growth there is slowing a little bit. Can you talk to us about sort of what's kind of driving that? Is it sort of the move to higher-level services? Do you get like better pricing against the capital? Is this sort of you're just not sort of pouring down as much cement, if you will, in terms of data expansion? Is it like better productivity of the core sort of compute stuff? Like can you help us understand sort of how capital intensity is trending in that -- Azure in particular but more broadly in the cloud businesses?",137
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2018",2018-10-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3193.0,1590918.0,62815304.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,11,"It's a great question, Keith. I would say the way we think about our capital efficiency and I, in fact, added that even to my commentary this time, which is we're building this intelligent cloud, intelligent edge platform to span everything, not only the Azure business but also the future of game streaming to what we are doing at Microsoft 365 or Dynamics 365. For the first time, what you see across Microsoft is really one platform, which spans all of these businesses and all of the margin structures that are there represented in it. So that's where, if you think about the thing that Amy and I focus a lot on is the capital efficiency end to end in that context versus getting caught up in even the capital efficiency as measured by any one of these individual pieces because we think that's what Microsoft's uniqueness long term lies. But that said on Azure, you're absolutely right. What you are seeing is 2 things: One is things like the Azure Hybrid Benefits as well as the higher-level services that create, I think, both uniqueness as well as good margins long term. I mean, especially on the database side is one place where I would say from a year-over-year worth of progress, whether it's just Azure database by itself, I mean, that service with full compatibility with SQL Server is a fantastic value proposition for our customers who have huge estates, whether it's the Data Warehouse that's become very, very competitive, the Data Lake. And Cosmos DB, I think, is very unique in its capability. So that's one place where -- as you know, any AI project first starts with data, and that's one place where we are seeing good traction.",292

Obviously, Amy, you called out some of the positives from the price increase that's coming up. But if I look at just Office 365, both commercial and consumer, just continued just strong growth on both those 2 and especially on the commercial side, there's still that gap between seat growth and revenue growth. So if you kind of just think where you are and I guess, in terms of just sort of the life cycle here and obviously, we've got multiple SKUs, maybe just kind of give us an update of how sort of you're thinking about where you stand and especially as you think about the full year here, how you sort of expect these metrics to progress.",127

The sales motion is really about Microsoft 365. And what that encompasses is both the Office 365 value proposition but also our management and security value proposition with EMS as well as Advanced Threat Protection and Windows value that shows up in that Windows commercial services KPI. So the bucket of those together, what we're seeing, is many of the workloads and movement to E3 within Microsoft 365 and to E5 continue to have good pull. There's great customer demand for the value that comes in security and analytics, in meetings, in voice, in collab. And I think when you look at the value, I think we feel good about the opportunity to continue to move these users, including new first-line or frontline users that we've not had access before. We got room on user growth, which as you -- you continue to see that number go up across segments. And we've got room in ARPU, which you've continued to see us have. So in many ways, your question shows itself in Office but the trends are the same if you look at EMS growth or if you were to look at that Windows commercial growth number.",219

With the xCloud, you kind of announced something that the whole industry has kind of been dreaming about as like the Holy Grail where you want to go, eventually have it all in the cloud, deliver from the cloud, and subscription driven. Can you talk a little bit about the innovation that is involved in you being able to -- starting to deliver that now?",75

But before I get to streaming, the thing that I'd say is most critical when you think about gaming is having a platform where the gamers are already there. That means you need to have a platform that has a community around it and monetized as well. So when you see some of the KPIs and some of the strength you saw in quarter, that's the foundation of Xbox. Xbox has the key gaming community and the monetization capabilities. Whether it's first-party games or third-party games, we are best in class in that monetization, and that's what's reflected in the results. So given that structural position, we are going to make sure that we keep increasing the strength of the community. You see that already with Minecraft going to all platforms and that increasing the intensity of the community, and you'll see us do more of that. Obviously, bringing Game Pass to even the PC is going to be a big element of that. And then streaming is just a natural sequence of it. And the advantage we have with streaming is we have a massive cloud advantage. And so we're going to bring obviously what we're doing with Azure, Azure networking all to bear in ensuring that Xbox and xCloud is one of the best workloads for it. So that's how I see it. It, of course, will increase our reach, but what I'm most excited about is the core content and community and the platform we have for monetizing that usage. And that, I think, is really what gives us even the permission to think about streaming.",270

It's obviously not closed yet. But given you've got a few months under your belt now since it was announced and an opportunity to solicit some feedback from the developer communities that maybe aren't using Microsoft technologies on a regular basis but are very active with GitHub, do you have a sense yet of what the opportunities might be to do outreach to those developers that might be working closely with competing platforms and how closely you can kind of hug them into the Microsoft ecosystem versus just leaving GitHub as sort of a self-sustaining entity now that you have a little bit more opportunity to discuss that with customers in the field?",121

First of all, thank you for the question. We're very excited about GitHub closing, and quite frankly, primarily I'm excited because, for us, is that what we said, GitHub is not a means to some other end. It's an end onto its own, which is we have always cared about developer and developer productivity and especially at a time like this when there are more developers outside of the tech industry as the world goes digital. We think this is perhaps one of the big SaaS opportunities going forward. And so therefore, that's why we want to ensure that everything we do and the #1 priority for Nat and team at GitHub will be all about maintaining that GitHub community, the ethos around developers at the core. That said, I think we will do what is necessary to make sure that our products and services that are on Azure or elsewhere, our tooling, which are already many open source projects on GitHub, we do a good job of earning that developer trust and developer adoption. But we are very grounded in the fact that it has to be earned and not something that we will inherit because of being owners of GitHub. 
The second thing I'll also mention is that, to me, the opportunity to win, I would say, new class of developers, we are making progress. In fact, this morning, I was reading a news article in Hacker News, which is a community where we've been working hard to make sure that Azure is growing in popularity, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that we made a lot of progress. In some sense, that at least basically said that we are neck to neck with Amazon when it comes to even elite developers as represented in that community. So we have more work to do, but we are making progress on all dimensions.",316

In general, the way I tend to look at this is the interactions we have with customers and the markets we're in and do we feel like they're expansive. And so when I look at the businesses that we built and the businesses we're investing in and do I feel like this need for tech intensity that Satya talked about that will ultimately drive the desire and need for customers to adopt technology, we're in the right places. And that's the signal actually we hear back from customers, whether that is Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365 and a new worldview on what business processes and business applications look like. Whether it's, frankly, our views on gaming that Satya just discussed, I feel like the signal we're hearing is that we're in the right part of the market with customer-focused value that can deliver a high ROI to them no matter what that IT budget looks like. And so I think as long as we focus on providing that value, we'll feel good about our opportunity to both grow and take share in the market.",188

I know growth rate's been a bit volatile. I think you had a pretty strong Q4, including bookings in that business. Maybe you can help us understand relative to growth we're seeing right now how you expect the Azure trajectory to play out for the year?",60
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2018",2018-10-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3193.0,1590918.0,62815320.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,27,"Sure, let me spend a couple of minutes on that. We actually saw better bookings in Q1 again on Azure, as I mentioned, just like we did in Q4. And so obviously, that's certainly encouraging as we look on a go-forward basis for the rest of the year. But as I think about -- I tend to focus, as you know, on the all-up server and product KPI because the Azure Hybrid Benefits that exist with Windows Server and SQL Server are really valuable to customers if they want to move to Azure on their own terms, it is the single best value proposition to a customer to make a commitment there. And so if we start to focus on one number or the other, I think we're missing the fact that our customer method and go to market is actually through the overall product portfolio. And so I tend to probably, as you might imagine, be more confident than I was in coming out of Q4 with a strong Q1 in that overall hybrid demand and Azure signal plus good Azure bookings when I talked about my confidence in high-teens growth in that KPI for the rest of the year.",201

But this quarter, the expiry portfolio was flattish, and yet your commercial bookings grew 16%. I think presumably, a very powerful performance with the renewals, the expansions and the new bookings. And I don't think you repeated that comment about bookings volatility in the same way. So I'm just curious, maybe could you help us connect the dots on that performance and also the potential for volatility in either direction going forward?",103
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2018",2018-10-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3193.0,1590918.0,62815323.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,30,"Sure, thank you. That's a great question. You will see volatility in the bookings number for the reasons we've laid out before, the changing expiry base but also large contracts and commitments done by Azure. And to your point, we actually saw it this quarter because we again saw quite good performance in some of these larger long-term Azure contracts, which added on a flat expiry base to that 15% bookings growth, which was good. And so what that means is you'll see some volatility in that, and you're also going to see some volatility in commercial unearned, specifically because whenever you see hybrid strength, it won't land as much in unearned. So when we -- as the business gets bigger and we do bigger and larger deals and some of them are on-prem and some of them are in Azure, you're going to see volatility, frankly, in both of those. But what I tried to do is think about the impact of all the key data points, which is how do we do in quarter, how do we do on the unearned revenue on the balance sheet and how do we do in overall bookings. And if I triangulate between all those 3 just like I did in Q4, I feel really good about our commercial performance.",218

Just first on that KPI of Azure plus server products, that high teens number was obviously a lot better this quarter. But is that still the framework for the year? 
And then actually on Windows, we've seen such elevated strength on the Pro side, I think, because of the corporate Win 10 cycle, and I wondered if you could just -- as we think about the back half of the current fiscal year and we come up against some tougher comps, I wondered if you could just help us sort of think through that and how we should think about the puts and takes on that refresh cycle.",112
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2018",2018-10-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3193.0,1590918.0,62815326.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,33,"Sure. On the first question on the server and product KPI, obviously, the strong performance this quarter gives me higher confidence in my commitment to high teens growth in that number. But I'll update that generally longer in the quarter and will get me through Q2 before I make a longer commitment. 
And then separately on Windows 10 and the strength we've seen in OEM Pro, and I will also say it mirrors -- in some ways, you're also going to see some of that growth and strength in Windows commercial, so let me answer them a bit together. The Windows 10 Pro strength and, I think, commercial strength we've seen, we continue to see good signs on the commercial refresh. Really security, manageability of modern hardware and software together continues to be a good signal for us. We continue to watch the end of support. It's really critical for us, for customers to have a terrific experience as we upgrade them and ask them to move to Windows 10 with a lot of value. That end of support is about 5 quarters away, so we'll continue to expect good signal and good demand in that Pro segment. And it should, to your point, match increasingly the market, and we do get to some slightly bigger comps in H2, which I would agree with. But I don't want to diminish the signal because the signal is demand is very good for Windows 10 and upgrade to modern hardware when they realize the benefits. And so even if you have a tougher comp, I think the demand signal and our opportunity to continue to sell Microsoft 365 in that process and then upgrade to Office 365 as they do deployments is a big opportunity for us to excel.",297

I mean, overall, I feel very good about the opportunity ahead in business applications for us, and I think about the combination of both Dynamics 365 as well as what we're doing on the LinkedIn side. They all represent our participation in business applications. And the thing that I -- what's happening out there in the marketplace is, as things become more digital, there is, in fact, more need for business process automation. At the same time, there is a need for the application suite to be built very differently, and that's where, I think, we have an architectural advantage again with Dynamics 365. It's much more modular. It's modern. It's extensible with this power platform that gives us the ability to do things for customers and serve them in ways that is very differentiated. So that's our primary focus. We'll always look at opportunities outside. But in a time when there is a real fundamental shift in the category when it comes to both business models and technology, we feel we are well positioned to ride that.",179
