I'll begin with comments in our fourth quarter financial results. Currently, 12 months free cash flow grew 114% to $2.92 billion. Return on invested capital was 66% up from 41%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends.The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 461 million shares compared with 446 million. Worldwide revenue grew 42% to $9.52 billion or 37% excluding the $354 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates.We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, fast selection and free shifting offers including Amazon Prime. Media revenue increased to $4.68 billion, up 29% or 23% excluding foreign exchange rates.EGM revenue increased to $4.61 billion, up 60% or 54% excluding foreign exchange rates. Worldwide EGM increased to 48% worldwide sales, up from 43%. Worldwide unit growth was 37%. Active customer accounts exceeded 105 million, up 19%. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 1.9 million, up 24%. Cellar units were 28% of total unit.  Worldwide gross profit was $1.98 billion, up 47%. Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing technology and content and G&A combined was $1.3 billion or 14.5% of sales, down 25 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $733 million or 7.7% of revenue, compared with 7.9%. Tech and content was $297 million or 3.1% of revenue compared with 3.5%. Marketing was $269 million or 2.8% of revenue, up from 2.5% in the prior year.Now I'll talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 36% to $4.96 billion. Zappos, which is included in our results beginning November 1, 2009 contributed approximately $200 million to our fourth quarter revenue. Media revenue grew 20% to $2.1 billion. EGM revenue grew 54% to $2.66 billion, representing 54% of North America revenues up from 48%. North America gross profit grew 50% to $1.17 billion and gross margin increased 211 basis points to 23.6% driven by increases in other revenue, improvements in inventory management, including vendor pricing and increases in 3P product sales, partially offset by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix.North America segment operating income increased 113% to $278 million or 5.6% operating margin. In the International segment, revenue grew 49% to $4.56 billion. Revenue growth was 37% adjusting for the $344 million year-over-year favorable impact from foreign exchange rates during the quarter. Media revenue grew 37% to $2.58 billion or 26% excluding FX. And EGM revenue grew 68% to $1.95 billion or 56% excluding FX. EGM now represents 43% of international revenues, up from 38%.International gross profit grew 42% to $806 million or grew 31% excluding FX, while gross margin decreased 79 basis points to 17.7%, driven by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix, partially offset by improvements in inventory management including vendor pricing and the increases in 3P product sales. International segment operating income increased 39% to $319 million, a 7% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, International segment operating income increased 25%.Consolidated segment operating income grew 66% to $597 million or 6.3% of revenue, up 91 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $31 million favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, CSOI grew 58%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 75% to $476 million or 5% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $85 million in Q4 or an 18% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $384 million or $0.85 per diluted share, compared with $225 million in $0.52 per diluted share. Now I'll discuss full year results. Revenue grew 28% to $24.51 billion or 29% excluding the $182 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. North America revenue grew 25% to $12.83 billion and international grew 31% to $11.68 billion or 33% growth, excluding year-over-year changes in FX.Consolidated segment operating income for CSOI grew 44% to $1.57 billion, or 48% excluding $40 million of unfavorable year-over-year impact of foreign exchange rates. And operating margin increased 71 basis points to 6.4%. GAAP operating income grew 34% to $1.13 billion or 4.6% of net sales. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.64 billion year-over-year to $6.37 billion. Our cash marketable securities primarily consists of cash, government and government agency securities, AAA rated money market funds and other investment grade securities. Such amounts recorded at fair value.In January 2010, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $2 billion of our common stock, replacing our previous share repurchase program. Inventory increased 35% to $2.17 billion and inventory turns were 12.2 unchanged from a year ago, even as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories.Accounts payable increased 56% to $5.61 billion and accounts payable days increased to 68 days from 62 in the prior year. Our 2009 capital expenditures were $373 million. While we were not providing CapEx guidance on today's call, we want to remind you that we're beginning the transition to our new Seattle offices this year. We will incur incremental CapEx of approximately $100 million in 2010 in support of this multi-year project.I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen today and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainties surrounding the exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It is not possible to actually predict demand. And therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that the foreign exchange rates remained approximately where they've been recently.We are prospectively adopting Accounting Standard Update No. 2009-13 revenue recognition multiple delivery revenue arrangements as of January 1, 2010. Sales of our Kindle e-reader are considered  arrangements with multiple elements which include the device, wireless connectivity and software upgrades. The revenue related to the device, which is the substantial portion of the total sales price in related cost will be recognized at the time of delivery. Revenue for the wireless connectivity and the software upgrades will be continued to be amortized over the life of the device, which remains estimated at two years.The impact of the adoption of this standard is included in the first quarter of 2010 guidance. For Q1, we expect net sales of between $6.45 billion and $7 billion, a growth of between 32% and 43%. This guidance anticipates approximately 500 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income will be between $275 million and $365 million or grow between 13% and 50%. This includes approximately $110 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $385 million and $475 million, a growth of between 20% and 48%. We remained heads down focused on driving better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks and with that Rob, let's move to questions.",1297

Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?",25
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2010",2010-01-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2040.0,47470.0,3623893.0,Question and Answer Operator Message,Operator,,Operator,5,[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Mark Mahaney with Citi.,12

Secondly, any broad comment on your ability to increasingly sell Consumer Staples particularly, momentum behind that Subscribe & Save program. And then finally, could you help us quantify it all, the Kindle impact? The difference in accounting maybe by providing an adjustment for what Kindle revenue or something would've been like last year, some way for us to parse out how much of the increase in the -- or how much of the guidance could just be due to a change in the revenue recognition?",98
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2010",2010-01-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2040.0,47470.0,3623895.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,7,"In terms of the tax rate, it was 18% for the quarter, 22% for the year. That includes certainly the reason why the change in Q4 is related to the jurisdictions that we operate in. Again, we're not providing guidance beyond 2009 for taxes. In terms of Consumer Staples, it's certainly a category that we like. It's growing very nicely. Subscribers, say, from an adoption standpoint is working. And so those are the things that we're going to continue to focus on, as well as other things to try to grow that particular category. As it relates to the Kindle change, we have provided some information in the 10-K. Essentially, the way you should think about guidance is certainly, the change is effective '11, so it's included on our Q1 guidance. So for the units that we sell, a substantial portion of the price times those units can be reflected in our revenue. In addition to that, we have approximately $500 million of deferred revenue from shipments from last year that we amortized between 2010 and 2011. So a portion of that $500 million will also be in Q1.",189

Could you just run through that because I assume that it would be a retroactive restatement to previous quarters. And then also, when you look at the Zappos benefit to 1Q at '10 revenue, is it fair to assume it's similar to 4Q '09's $200 million, given on the one hand you have a full three months for the quarter but on the other hand, it's the seasonally slower quarter?",86

So as of '11, we're not restating. Again, so it's reflected in our Q1 guidance. In terms of your other question, was in terms of Zappos, how to think about it, I think probably the best way to do it would be again, we're not giving guidance on Zappos specifically. It's reflected in the guidance that we gave for Q1. We have released the certainly, previous quarters. You can go back to Q1 of last year, make your own assumptions in terms of growth rate for year-over-year. And certainly, there'd be a range there but you can see that's probably the best way to think about it and look at what you put in for Q1.",127

I'm trying to understand whether there's some moving parts that help in driving this gross margins higher, and how should we think about the swing factors in the North American gross margins? And secondly, as we look at the Media business become more digital and we see more and more new devices come into the marketplace, could you help us understand how does Amazon's competitive advantage or competitive position change in the marketplace, i.e. obviously, physical versus web, you have some competitive advantage, but there are a lot of more devices or so that can download books electronically. How does your competitive advantage or how does your competitive position change?",123
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2010",2010-01-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2040.0,47470.0,3623901.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,13,"In terms of your first question, North American gross margins are up a little over 200 basis points as you mentioned, a number of drivers. Certainly, we had a nice increase in other revenue, which includes the Warp Services business or service business [ph], as well as other agreements that go into that line item. Inventory management, we're getting better at inventory management which also flows into our operating results as well. We're getting better prices from suppliers and partners. We had good third-party sales. So those are the key contributors partially offsetting that, we certainly get lower prices during the quarter. So those are really the drivers for gross margin. In terms of how we're thinking about in the digital and physical within media, we think we're positioned very nicely from a digital perspective. We have obviously, have some longer standing relationships with many, many different partners around the world in those particular categories. We think we're focused on the customer. And I think when you look at Kindle, that's certainly a good example of that. We think we've built a very nice book purpose device, that's purpose built for reading. And we believe that readers deserve to have a dedicated device with great selection at great prices. And so those are the things that we've worked on in the 27 months since launch. And those are the things that we'll continue to focus on. Again, we're starting with the customer.",242

And I guess if we go back domestically, we saw nice acceleration in unit growth when you hit the two year mark. Is it safe to assume that you're seeing a similar trend internationally, given the growth internationally plus the unit growth acceleration. Second question, you've got a lot of different services you've worked on over the years between Kindle, digital, music to video, cloud computing and Web services, I guess is there any sort of I guess or spent it or view that you have that maybe there's an opportunity to consolidate or integrate all these services together in a unified platform that can be licensed or OEMed to other companies to utilize while you kind of manage the background behind it?",141

And it certainly contributing to our international growth as well as the North continues to help our North America growth as well. And so and other factors, there are also helping international. Certainly, we've added a number of categories along with that those categories comes a lot of selection. We continue to prove our in-stock levels. Prime as you mentioned is helping and just making sure we have great prices. And so getting product to customer as fast is important. And Prime is one of the ways that helps us do that. In terms of your second question, I'm not sure there's a lot I can help you with there. In each of those services, our primarily focuses how we have a great customer experience and that's the one thing that's common on all of those, and we're going to continue to focus as we have in our physical business on how do we make sure that we have great experience.

We had that much in deferred revenues this year in the fourth quarter versus 162. My first question is there anything materially different besides Kindle in those numbers? Second thing, you say you have millions of Kindle users. Is it safe to assume that you have over 2 million now at least. And then finally, when you think about the category rollout roadmap, can you give us any thoughts on where you are on that? Are you 80% of all the categories you can roll out, or are there still a lot more opportunity? How would you frame that opportunity at this point in your life cycle?",125

Certainly, Kindle has been one of those and we'll have some there for sometime as we roll that off. The other it certainly Prime, as well as but those are certainly two of the bigger items and we're not breaking those out. In terms of category rollout, hard to say in percentage terms, but we have to fulfill a lot of room to add additional selections. And if you look at it on a worldwide basis, think about it this way, we have many geographies that we can enter. Some of which many that we support today from an export standpoint. But we could certainly rollout more geographies and so we can add category selection there. And we can add many new categories in all of our geographies. And then also, we're adding a selection in categories that we've been in were 10 or more years each year. We continue to grow the selection of those categories. So it is one of the inputs to growth. It's one that we're very focused on. It's one we're going to be continue to be focused on for many years to come, because there's just a lot of selection to add out there.

We continue to grow nicely in our cellar business. And we continue to look for ways to improve that experience, knowing for our customers but for our sellers which is really another customer said that we have. And one example of that is Fill by Amazon, which certainly has been helpful in terms of growing our selection from sellers and the number of sellers as well. In terms of discussions about any of the other relationships with vendors and this would be any category, not just the one that you mentioned, certainly, those any of those discussions that we would have would be between us and those particular partners. But the main focus of those discussions would always be for us, how do we make sure we can offer customers the selection that they want at great low prices. So those are things that we're always continually focused in each of our categories in each of our geographies.",168

If i recall last year you talked about in every situation leading to better pricing from the vendors and this year, it sounds like you got better pricing for vendors to any qualitative remarks were sort of what's driving your ability to get better pricing is a purely volume or are there other things there? And then just quickly a comments on the Amazon branded products. Any update there?",81

But it's in a few different pieces. One is you can take a look at our overall growth, which in the case of North America was up 36%. That was certainly helped by Zappos as part of that if you take out Zappos, the number that we gave you it would be about 31% growth, which is still a nice acceleration from where we've been recently. So that's one just overall volume. The other is when you look at North America, some of the categories that we're in that we just started a few years ago becoming more and more meaningful. And so as those become more and more meaningful, good things happen. We're able to get better prices from suppliers but also they become more attractive for third-party sellers selling our detail pages so it's a combination of those items that allow us to grow gross margins in Q4 while lowering prices for customers. So it was the combination of those factors.",171

18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2010",2010-04-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",,57449.0,4331044.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Rob. I'll begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow grew 62% to $2.32 billion. Return on invested capital was 45% up from 41%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. 
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 463 million shares compared with 447 million. Worldwide revenue grew 46% to $7.13 billion, or 42%, excluding the $185 million favorable impact from the year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and free shipping offers including Amazon Prime. 
Media revenue increased to $3.43 billion, up 26%, or 22% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM revenue increased to $3.51 billion, up 72% or 68% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 49% of worldwide sales, up from 42%. 
Worldwide unit growth was 40%. Active customer accounts exceeded 114 million. For the first time this number includes our Amazon China customer accounts. Worldwide active seller accounts were approximately 2 million, up 22%. Seller units were 31% of total units. 
Consolidated gross profit grew 42% to $1.63 billion, and gross margin decreased 62 basis points to 22.9%. We no longer present gross profit in our consolidated statement of operations as we believe income from operations is a more meaningful measure due to the diversity of our product categories and services. Our focus is on growing operating profit dollars rather than maximizing margin percentages. 
Now I'll discuss the operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, Tech and Content and G&A combined was $1.12 billion, or a 15.8% of sales, down 115 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $528 million or 7.4% of revenue compared with 8.3%. Tech and Content was $319 million or 4.5% of revenue compared with 4.9%. Marketing was $196 million or 2.7% of revenue, up from 2.5% in the prior year. 
Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. 
In North America segment, revenue grew 47% to $3.78 billion. Media revenue grew 22% to $1.6 billion. EGM revenue grew 73% to $2.02 billion, representing 54% of North America revenues, up from 45%. North America segment operating income increased 81% to $273 million, a 7.2% operating margin. 
In the International segment, revenue grew 45% to $3.35 billion. Revenue growth was 37%, adjusting for the $175 million year-over-year favorable FX impact during the quarter. 
Media revenue grew 29% to $1.83 billion or 23% excluding FX. And EGM revenue grew 70% to $1.49 billion or 61% excluding FX. EGM now represents 44% of International revenues, up from 38%. 
International segment operating income increased 37% to $234 million, a 7% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, the International segment operating income increased 26%. CSOI grew 58% to $507 million or 7.1% of revenue, up 53 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $15 million favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, CSOI grew 53%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 62% to $394 million, or 5.5% of net sales. 
Our income tax expense was $100 million in Q1 or a 25% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $299 million, or $0.66 per diluted share compared with $177 million and $0.41 per diluted share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $2.33 billion year-over-year to $5.06 billion. Inventory increased 44% to $1.82 billion and inventory turns were 12.6, up from 12.5 turns a year ago even as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 52% to $3.62 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 59 from 57 in the prior year. 
Our Q1 2010 capital expenditures were $140 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in technology infrastructure including Amazon Web Services, additional investments and support of continued business growth, including capacity to support fulfillment operations and investments in corporate office space, which we expect to continue throughout 2010. 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into the guidance of the order trends that we've seen to date, in what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters in changes to our effective tax rates, can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they’ve been recently. 
For Q2, we expect net sales of between $6.1 billion and $6.7 billion, a growth of between 31% and 44%. This anticipates approximately 100 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between to $220 million and $320 million, or to grow between 39% and 102%. The second quarter 2009 results includes the impact of our settlement with Toys""R""Usfor $51 million, substantially all of which was expense during the quarter. This includes approximately $130 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. 
We anticipate Consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expenses to be between $350 million and $450 million, a growth of between 15% and 48%. We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe that putting the customer first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.

The North America expansion was driven by a number of things. Certainly, the very strong growth and then it was also driven by us being able to leverage our overall expenses. If you take a look at our global fulfillment cost as a percentage of revenue, you can certainly see a lot of leverage there, and that's also true when you look at North America. We haven't added any significant capacity in North America since Q3 of '08. Certainly, with the growth rates that you're seeing, you should expect that we will be adding capacity over time there. But again, it was driven by a lot of different factors. And with a lot of different product categories growing very strong and us being able to leverage those expenses.

First, one of your competitors talks about seeing some weakness in Europe x-U.K. And looking at your International margins, it looks like they came a little bit under pressure. They were down about 40 or 50 bps year-on-year. Is that something you guys saw as well? And then by our estimates or the change in accounting for Kindle that you instituted in Q1 resulted, again, at least by our math, in somewhere between $80 million and $100 million of additional revenues for the quarter. Can you maybe just help us understand if we're in the right zipcode there?",103

And it was driven by a number of things. Certainly, we’ve added many new categories and a lot of selections over the past few years, and we certainly have. We’re focused on making sure that we have great and competitive low prices, which is certainly fueling growth. Prime is also a factor. Third-party growth continues to be very strong. So those are the factors that are driving the International growth. In terms of the change in accounting for Kindle, we're not breaking out any precise numbers on that. But the way you should think about it is, maybe a few different items. One is if you look at our overall growth rate and you look at on a local currency basis and we certainly have for the first time a full quarter of Zappos included in those numbers as well as the change in accounting for Kindle. And if you back out exchange in those two items and you compare it to the equivalent growth rate in Q4, you did see a few hundred basis points acceleration in growth from Q4 to Q1. So I can't give you much more of a breakout than that, but you can see that -- we did see an acceleration of growth there.",259

I understand you're running the business for operating profits and cash flow but could you provide a little bit more color on the gross margin trends, particularly in international markets, given what should be some pretty positive mix shifts and scale factors, but mix shift towards the digital goods and AWS and things like that. The trends seem a little surprising. Anything in terms of vendor terms, product mixes that may have explained the gross margin trends?",90

We continue to have lower prices, and make sure that we have great competitor prices in a challenging environment, which includes free shipping offers in Amazon Prime included in that. And keep in mind that we've launched many new categories over the past few years. And so as we’ve talked about in the past, it takes some time to get to scale in those categories, and we're seeing very broad growth across many categories, including the new categories. And so that certainly, that mix is having an impact. And all those factors are being partially offset by a very strong solid third-party growth, as well as the savings that we'll get from our vendor partners. So again, those are the key drivers.",136

So Tom, can you just talk through what the factors are, what drive operating margin down sequentially that order of magnitude. And then secondly, stock-based compensation, I think you guided to $110 million and did $87 million, and then guided to $130 million in 2Q. So what's the volatility in that line item in the first quarter and going forward?",87
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2010",2010-04-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",,57449.0,4331070.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,28,"I think I'll take the second part first. The $87 million is actually the equivalent of the stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles which is $113 million. And so it's coming from $113 million to $130 million. In terms of the operating margin, we're not giving operating margin guidance for Q2 but the implied operating margin is we do have -–consistent with what we've done in the prior periods, we have a range of operating income, and that range is $350 million to $450 million. At the lower end of the range, it's 5.7% of implied operating margin and 6.7% on the high-end. On the high-end, you'd see an expansion of operating margins of approximately 20 basis points year-over-year. And so that's the guidance based upon what we see by looking at all the factors. And so there's not much that I can help you with that. 
One thing to keep in mind though, as I mentioned in one of the earlier questions, with growth we're experiencing, we need to make sure we support that growth. And what that means is, we’ll continue to add capacity in our various businesses to support that growth whether it be our retail business, our AWS business or our third-party seller business including FBA. And so those are things that we certainly are supporting given the growth that we're having. The other thing is we'll continue, as we have in prior years -- we still think there’s a lot of opportunity in front of us. And so as we have in prior years, we'll make sure that we're judicious about where we make those additions but we will add resources to make sure we capitalize on those growth opportunities. And so those were the things that we're thinking about.",296

And then second, just broader question but in a world where we're going towards mobile and smart phones from a media-consumption standpoint, can you talk about what is the opportunity for is e-Commerce standpoint, do think that it will be just as good a kind of an e-Commerce-oriented environment on a mobile device as you see in the desktop Internet world since it's a smaller form factor, smaller screen?

We're excited about the idea that the world may shift to a place where 3G connected devices are available to browse the Net. And our view is the more Web-connected devices, whether it be tablets or smart phones, the better that is for our retail business as you're suggesting. And we'll figure out the best way to make sure that we make it as easy as possible for our customers to purchase from those devices. But we think that that’s -- it's an exciting opportunity to have a world looks like that. In terms of your unit question, as you can probably expect, given the growth that we're seeing both in North America and in International from a revenue perspective, we're seeing very good growth in units as well.

You are also seeing very strong unit growth in those two segments. And in terms of again, in terms mobile, we're going to use obviously try to make sure that we learn as much as we can and try to serve our customers as best as we can in that environment, but it's an environment that we like.

First, what you’re seeing there is we saw our accelerated growth. And when you see accelerated growth, we're able to leverage that in our Fulfillment capacity and a great way from a productivity standpoint. Also what I'd mentioned was we have added capacity. But specifically in North America, we haven't added any meaningful capacity since Q3 of '08. And if you recall, we were building capacity and then we had a financial disruption in the market, so we ended up having some excess capacity in Q4 of '08. We've been able to leverage that capacity throughout. And so that's resulting in the productivity that you are seeing. Now with the growth that we're experiencing, you should expect that we will have to add capacity over time here to satisfy that growth. In terms of your category question, we have learned a lot over the years, but it still takes us a number of years to get to scale and when we launch new categories. One of the things we have learned over the past several years is we need to make sure that we have great selection by day one. We need to make sure that we're pricing very competitively day one, even though we don't have necessarily the scale, or the buying tools to purchase well, day one. And so what that means usually is that we'll have a lower contribution profit per unit generally early on. And as we learn those categories, we get better and better at sourcing and make sure we have the right inventory in place and all that. So it takes a number of years before we get to scale in those categories and get meaningful free cash flow out of them.",295

We have a platform that's available for sellers to sell used products, which is the predominant use. We try to make that experience as good as we can both for sellers and for customers, so they can understand what the quality of the good is before making a purchase decision.

On a global basis, excluding exchange, Kindle and the accounting change, we saw a few hundred basis points acceleration in growth. So we did accelerated excluding those items. In terms of capacity, we do have high growth rates right now. We have 40% unit growth, 46% revenue growth in Q1, you see the guidance for Q2. And so as you would expect, with the growth rate, we need to make sure we have the right amount of capacity and people on hand to serve. As part of that, from a Fulfillment perspective, we're growing our Fulfillment by Amazon or FBA business, which also requires capacity to do so. So those are the things that we view as high-quality problems, but those are things that we certainly will have to add as we move forward, as well as other areas, other parts of our business that are growing in addition to those two.",160

I guess as you and the industry move towards the agency model for digital books, it shifts the ability to set pricing to publishers, and I guess our understanding is you will also have to charge sales tax also. So it would seem that your ability to leverage low price may be mitigated a little bit.

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2009. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.",200
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-22-2010",2010-07-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2450.0,69127.0,5088358.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Rob. I'll begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow grew 29% to $1.99 billion. Return on invested capital is 34%, down from 42%. ROIC is TTM-free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. 
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 465 million shares compared with 451 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 41% to $6.57 billion, or 42%, excluding the $48 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in FX. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, fast selection with free shipping offers, including Amazon Prime. 
Media revenue increased to $2.87 billion, up 18%. EGM revenue increased to $3.49 billion, up 69%, or 70% excluding foreign exchange rates. Worldwide EGM increased to 53% of worldwide sales, up from 45%. Worldwide unit growth was 39%. Active customer accounts exceeded 118 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million, up 19%. Seller units were 32% of total units. 
Consolidated gross profit grew 42% to $1.61 billion, and gross margin was 24.5%. Beginning this quarter, we no longer allocate Fulfillment costs related to third-party inventory to cost of sales. Using our prior method, gross margin in Q2 2010 was 24.1%. 
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, Technology and Content and G&A combined was $1.2 billion, or 18.3% of sales, up 50 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $558 million, or 8.5% of revenue, compared with 8.4%. Using our prior method of allocating Fulfillment costs related to third-party inventory to cost of sales, Q2 2010 Fulfillment was 8.1% of revenue. Tech and Content was $350 million or 5.3% of revenue, compared with 5.5%. Marketing was $204 million, or 3.1% of revenue, up from 2.7% in the prior year. 
Now I'll talk about our segment results and, consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate segments, our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. 
In the North America segment, revenue grew 46% to $3.59 billion. Media revenue grew 15% to $1.32 billion. The sequential decline in quarter-over-quarter growth rates was driven primarily by seasonality in textbook sales and slower rates of growth in video games and video game consoles. 
EGM revenue grew 76% to $2.09 billion, representing 58% of North America revenues, up from 48%. North America segment operating income increased 61% to $200 million, a 5.6% operating margin. 
In the International segment, revenue grew 35% to $2.98 billion. Revenue growth was 38%, adjusting for the $54 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 20% to $1.55 billion, or 21% excluding foreign exchange rates. And EGM revenue grew 59% to $1.4 billion, or 63% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM now represents 47% of International revenues, up from 40%. 
International segment operating income increased 15% to $206 million, a 6.9% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, International segment operating income increased 21%. 
CSOI grew 34% to $406 million, or 6.2% of revenue, down 35 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $10 million unfavorable impact from FX, CSOI grew 37%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 71% to $270 million, or 4.1% of net sales. Q2 2009 operating income was negatively impacted by a $51 million legal settlement. 
Our income tax expense was $88 million in Q2, or a 30% rate for the quarter. During the quarter, we recorded estimated tax expense associated with tentative agreements between the Japanese and U.S. tax authorities on the allocation of income between the U.S. and Japan for 2003 through 2005, resulting in a three percentage point increase in our effective tax rate for the quarter. 
GAAP net income was $207 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared with $142 million and $0.32 per diluted share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $1.9 billion year-over-year to $5.11 billion. Inventory increased 46% to $1.94 billion and inventory turns were 12.5, up from 12.4 turns a year ago, even as we extended selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. 
Accounts payable increased 41% to $3.55 billion, and accounts payable days were 65, unchanged from the prior year. Our Q2 2010 capital expenditures were $196 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, including capacity to support our Fulfillment operations, additional investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, and investments in corporate office space. We expect this trend to continue throughout 2010. 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and net foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. 
For Q3, we expect net sales of between $6.9 billion and $7.625 billion, a growth between 27% and 40%. This guidance anticipates approximately 300 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. 
GAAP operating income to be between $210 million and $310 million, or between a 16% decline and 24% growth. This anticipates approximately $130 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate Consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expenses to be between $340 million and $440 million, or be between 3% decline and 26% growth. 
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting the customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. 
Thanks. And with that, Rob, let's move to questions.",1060

[ :p id=""27825561"" name=""Jeetil Patel"" />
First of all, I guess as it relates to, broadly, Fulfillment. I guess can you talk about -- maybe a little bit more color on Fulfillment capacity being layered into the business? I guess, is that both Domestic and International, or just more of a U.S. kind of phenomenon? Maybe a bit more color on, I guess, how much of this incremental capacity is being allocated to your partners, seller partners out there. And I guess is this the build-up in front of the holiday season that you typically do? And then second, are you seeing consumers still buy more books in an environment where consumers have the Kindle App available on multiple devices these days?",135

On the performance expense as a percentage of revenue, we have historically reallocated some of our cost from operating expenses to COGS. And when we stopped reporting gross margins last quarter, we decided this quarter not to allocate some of our cost out of operating expenses and into COGS. And the impact of that is a little over 40 basis points as a percentage of revenue. So in other words, our operating expenses for Fulfillment are about 40 basis points, as a percentage of revenue, higher than they would have been if that we have not done this. And the offset is in COGS. So then if you take a look at it, those Fulfillment expenses, we are growing very, very fast. And so we're adding capacity to support growth. And we plan on adding 13 Fulfillment centers this year after keeping our Fulfillment center structure relatively flat. Last year, we did add some capacity, but we're certainly adding a lot more this year. And that's, again, to support that growth. That's both in terms of our retail customers as well as Fulfillment by Amazon, our partners. And your question around whether it's Domestic or International, it's across geographies. So it’s 13 Fulfillment centers across geographies. And so we're very excited about it because, again, we're experiencing a look at our overall growth rates at 42% on a local currency basis. This quarter, 42%; last quarter, 37% in Q4. So again, we're growing very, very strong. So and then in terms of your second question, could you just elaborate a little bit further? I didn't...",275

And customers can come and buy content on the Kindle, and buy it once and use it everywhere, which is great.

And in the second quarter, revenue was towards the high end of guidance, but the operating income was at the midpoint. So could you maybe talk about anything in the business that you felt that changed in the quarter? Or how we should think about your forward-operating guidance, going forward relative to now the past five quarters?",90

We’re trying to be giving you our best forecast of what's going to happen during the quarter. We have had some times where we've been on the high end of that and been over it, but certainly when we provide guidance, that's not what we're trying to do. We're trying to give an accurate description of what we think the range will be. And so we approach it the same way every time and we give the guidance that we think is appropriate. And as you mentioned, our results today are well within -- it's in the top half for revenue guidance. It's also in the top half for Consolidated Segment Operating Income as well.",126

Does that primarily reflect mix shift in terms of third-party and EGM within each market, or more for the 13 new Fulfillment centers outside North America than inside it? And to what extent are the 13 new Fulfillment centers already hitting expenses in the second quarter versus coming in, in the third quarter?",73
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-22-2010",2010-07-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2450.0,69127.0,5088371.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,15,"In terms of International. First of all, I want to highlight a couple things related to International. International saw an accelerated growth this quarter. It was 38% growth on a local currency basis. That's the strongest growth rate in any quarter that we've had in International in over five years. So we saw very good growth. And there’s a number of things that's driving it. We've added a lot of selection over the past few years. If you look back and you see just the categories that we've launched over the past few years, we continue to add selection in existing categories, but in those new categories that we've launched over the past few years. And so that growth from new and existing categories is certainly doing quite well. We're making sure that we're very competitive from a pricing standpoint, which is helping. And certainly, other things such as Prime is having a noticeable impact on the growth rate there. So that's really what's driving the growth rate. And with that accelerated growth rate in some of those newer categories, we're seeing some mix. Again, we have a number of categories that are very new there over the past few years, and they're coming up the scale. But it's still very early. So you should assume that many of those are lower gross margin categories and you can see that reflected in the EGM growth within International. So again, saw very, very strong growth there. In terms of Fulfillment centers, I mentioned this to, I think, it was to Jeetil’s question earlier. We haven't -- the plan is to add 13. You're seeing some of the cost starting in Q2 for some of those Fulfillment centers and you see more, as reflected in our guidance for Q3. But again, they’re dispersed in a number of different geographies.",307

There are one-time items in that sound like, the way you’ve described it, [indiscernible] going forward? Secondly, do you think it would be apples-to-apples North America and International gross margin under the old accounting methodologies? And then third, you talked about marketing expenses? They're due to pick up. Is there some change in your strategy or did you find marketing expense in this quarter?",67
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-22-2010",2010-07-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2450.0,69127.0,5088374.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,18,"We did mention on a tax rate standpoint, our tax rate was 30%. Yes, if there’s any one-time unusuals, I think is what you asked for, there was one that I mentioned in my opening remarks related to Japan. And we have a tentative agreement there, and the impact of that is about 300 basis points on that tax rate. So without that, it would've been approximately 27% for the quarter. In terms of marketing, you asked a question around marketing. Our approach has been consistent. The spend that you're seeing during the quarter is primarily online. If you're looking at the year-over-year growth that you're seeing in terms of basis points, certainly, we have Zappos and our quarterly numbers, which we didn't have last year. And if you -- many of you probably saw the results prior to consolidating and they were spending at a percentage of revenue, a much greater rate than Amazon was. And you should assume that they're still spending at a rate that's faster than Amazon and that's reflected in that total. You also may have noticed that we're doing some broad-skill advertising, TV advertising for Kindle, which we think is the right thing to do, and included in the number that you see there.",210

Could you explain where those people are mostly centered toward? Are they on digital initiatives, maybe helping improve the Kindle or are they more Fulfillment center-related?

The majority of those were operations people. And within that operation, the majority of those were to support new volume; I should say, the volume that we're seeing. And so that's within there. The rest of the growth rate, supporting the things that we've been talking about over the past several years. We're supporting new category growth both in North America and International.

So we're pleased with what we see there. You're right, you do have some volatility in free cash flow. Certainly, one of the things that you're seeing is CapEx was $196 million in the quarter, which is up and that's really in a few different pieces, but certainly, the incremental spend relates to capacity that's both on the Fulfillment side as well as infrastructure side and the infrastructure side to support our Retail business as well as fast-growing AWS business.",95

From a textbook standpoint, it's very seasonal. It was growing very fast in Q1. It's not as much of an impact in Q2 as you would imagine and then, the weakness in video games and video game consoles due to allocations on the console side and also a lack of major releases. But in terms of growth on the book side, if you've seen the release earlier in the week, we're seeing a very, very strong growth in both Kindle device, which is in EGM, as well as Kindle content, which is in media. So it's growing very, very fast. But our physical books business, while the Kindle books are growing dramatically, is also growing double digits year-over-year in the quarter. So we're very pleased with our overall book business, both our physical and digital business.",161

And in terms of pace, we don't give updates on inter-quarter. But again, as you can see from our overall growth rate, we saw very, very strong growth in Q2, up 42% on a local currency basis, 46% from North America, 38% for international. International was the best growth rate of any quarter we've had in a little over five years. So it's very strong. There was World Cup going on during about 20 days, the last 20 days of the quarter. And hard to say what kind of impact that had, but I'm sure it had some impact, but that was included in that 38% growth on a local currency basis. But again, we're not a bellwether for the economy, and we focus very hard on expanding selection and making sure we have great prices and making sure that we have great convenience for customers, including Amazon Prime. So those are the things that we're focused on, and it was really what's driving the growth that we see today.",194

So how should we think about the CapEx? What's driving this CapEx growth? So that's question number one. And question number two, it seems like high end, you're guiding 40% revenue growth but operating income growth rate of 24%. So what's driving the deleverage? And the third, how many Kindle Apps for iPad has been downloaded? Can you give us some sense on that?",87
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-22-2010",2010-07-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2450.0,69127.0,5088403.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,47,"Sure, I'll take your CapEx question first. The largest pieces of the increase are related to capacity, and it's capacity both from a Fulfillment perspective and an infrastructure perspective. When I say Fulfillment, it's to support our fast-growing Retail business as well as our fast-growing Fulfillment by Amazon business, where we fulfill on behalf of our partners. From a infrastructure standpoint, we're supporting, again, our Retail business but also we have a AWS business that's growing very, very strong right now, and so we're supporting that growth by adding CapEx. So that's what's included in the CapEx. 
In terms of the range of guidance, I just wanted to clarify a little bit. You said the upper end of the range was 40%. Keep in mind that, that anticipates approximately 300 basis points of unfavorable exchange rates, so at the high end of the range, it's more like 43% as well as on the bottom end of the range for CSOI, you mentioned 24%, it's actually 26%, and that anticipates approximately 600 basis points of exchange. So at the high end of the range, it would be 43% growth x exchange for revenue, 32% growth x -- excuse me, on the high end of the range, 43% excluding exchange for revenue and 32% growth excluding exchange on CSOI. And again, it reflects our best estimate for the high end of that range and the things that we see. But again, it anticipates some of the things that I'm talking about. It anticipates the capacity that will show up in CapEx as well as operating expense across a number of different fronts. And then the rest of the operating expenses in support of the things that we've been talking about, again, for the last several year, it's the growing retail business, both in North America and international, our Seller business, AWS, our Kindle business, Seller business, if I didn't say that. So again, those are the things that we're adding resources to, to support the opportunities that we see going forward.",339

We're extremely pleased with our Kindle content growth. And again, as I mentioned, our physical books also grew double digits year-over-year during the quarter. So we're very, very pleased with our overall books business as related to that. And again, we saw our sequential decline based on, primarily, the textbook sales seasonality and also some weakness in video games and video game consoles, again, due to allocations and lack of major releases. Even though we saw weakness in our video games and video game console business, we're still very pleased with that business, and we think we're doing -- the team's doing a great job in terms of the fundamental supporting customers, and we like the opportunities that we see there.  In terms of the consumer sentiment, again, I don't think we're the bellwether. What we're seeing is reflected in our Q2 results, which were from a growth standpoint, very, very strong.",170

But what I can help you with is if you take a look at some of the details that we provided earlier in the week, and I'll point you to that release where we have over 630,000 titles, 510,000 of those were $9.99 or below. That excludes the $1.8 million pre-1923 free content that we have in the Kindle. So there's just great values and great selection for customers. And we're seeing that customers responding to that great selection and the convenience of the device, the convenience of the apps.

I'll begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 16% to $2.62 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 5% to $1.83 billion. Return on invested capital was 28%, down from 50%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. 
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 465 million shares compared with 451 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 39% to $7.56 billion or 40%, excluding the $83 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and free shipping offers, including Amazon Prime.
Media revenue increased to $3.35 billion, up 14% or 15% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM revenue increased to $3.97 billion, up 68% or 71% excluding foreign exchange rates. Worldwide EGM increased to 53% of worldwide sales, up from 43%. Worldwide unit growth was 41%. Active customer accounts were approximately 121 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 34% of total units.
Consolidated gross profit grew 39% to $1.77 billion and gross margin was 23.5%. 
Now I'll discuss our operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, Marketing, Technology and Content and G&A combined was $1.37 billion or 18.2% of sales, up 122 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $657 million or 8.7% of revenue compared with 8.2%. Tech and Content was $386 million or 5.1% of revenue compared with 4.9%. Marketing was $234 million or 3.1% of revenue, up from 2.6% in the prior year.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line items.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 45% to $4.13 billion. Media revenue grew 13% to $1.59 billion. EGM revenue grew 80% to $2.33 billion, representing 56% of North America revenues, up from 45%. North America segment operating income increased 19% to $186 million, a 4.5% operating margin.
In the International segment, revenue grew 32% to $3.43 billion. Revenue growth was 35%, adjusting for the $86 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 16% to $1.76 billion or 18% excluding FX. And the EGM revenue grew 54% to $1.64 billion or 60% excluding FX. EGM now represents 48% of International revenues, up from 41%.
International segment operating income increased 11% to $215 million, a 6.2% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, International segment operating income increased 20%.
CSOI grew 15% to $401 million or 5.3% of revenue, down 112 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $15 million unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, CSOI grew 19%. 
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 7% to $268 million or 3.5% of net sales. 
Our income tax expense was $79 million in Q3 or a 27% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $231 million or $0.51 per diluted share compared with $199 million and $0.45 per diluted share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $1.88 billion year-over-year to $5.88 billion. Inventory increased 56% to $2.52 billion. And inventory turns were 11.8, down from 12.1 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. 
Accounts payable increased 38% to $4.61 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 73 from 72 in the prior year. 
Our Q3 2010 capital expenditures were $315 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, including investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, capacity to support our Fulfillment operations and investments in corporate office space. We expect this trend to continue throughout 2010.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into the guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe, to date, to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand. And therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling inter-company balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q4, we expect net sales of between $12 billion and $13.3 billion, a growth between 26% and 40%. This guidance anticipates approximately 70 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. 
GAAP operating income to be between $360 million and $560 million or between 24% decline and 18% growth. This includes approximately $140 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $500 million and $700 million or between 16% decline and 17% growth. 
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. 
Thanks. And with that, Rob, let's move to questions.",934

Typically, you are able to generate flattish margins sequentially. That's not what you're guiding to at the midpoint. Is that because some of the investments you wanted to roll out in the September quarter are being delayed? Are there new levels of investments that you're looking for in the December quarter? Are you rolling out more distribution centers there? Any more color on why the sequential decline in margins that's a little bit out of the norm?",95

We have a couple more that are coming over the coming few weeks as we get ready for our peak season. So certainly, that's part of what you're seeing in Q4. Obviously, we've been incurring some cost on those three as well prior to Q4. But again, you'll see that ramping up. The other thing too is we'll continue to add capacity for infrastructure as well during Q4. And that's both for our Retail business as well as our very fast-growing AWS businesses. So those are impacting the guidance that you see there.",106

So that's something that we think is compelling. And it follows, really, what we've done for Prime in general. We've offered a free trial for Prime members going back a few years now. And the reason why we're doing that -- again, the free trials I'm talking about, not the Students and the Mom right now. But the reason why we're doing that was we wanted to make sure that customers could see the experience real time. And we find that when customers see it real time, they become members. And we've seen that consistently. And so the other two programs that you mentioned, the Student and Mom, still very early. And we're happy with what we see, but it’s still very early.",129

In terms of -- I’ll take the North America Media; we're seeing very good growth there. We're very pleased with the business that we have there. As it relates to Books, we saw a very strong revenue growth in the quarter. In fact, from a unit perspective, we saw accelerated growth in both Physical and Kindle books in Q3 relative to Q2. So very strong growth during the quarter. We did see, in a couple of categories, some softness, particularly Music and Video, as we overlap some higher revenue in last year Q3. Specifically in the Music side, we had very strong growth last year with some of the Michael Jackson titles. We also had very strong growth with The Beatles Box Set. In video games, specifically video game consoles, there was very strong price reductions from the manufacturers and which caused great growth last year. And so we saw some softness that's in the North American Media numbers that you see. But again, we're very pleased with overall categories in Media. In terms of the equity income and in terms of how you should think about it, we did have, included in our guidance, and I'll give you the total numbers. But, sorry, excluded from the guidance that we gave approximately 90 days ago, we did not include Woot acquisition. And the impact from the quarter is roughly $30 million revenue. From a CSOI perspective, we had a few million dollar loss for the quarter. And then because we had a investment in Woot, we had to step up that investment to fair value, see how the gain that's included in the other income line, the equity income line that you're referring to, which brings our net down to about $13 million net or a little under $0.03 per share. So that's included in the numbers that you're looking at.",315

I was hoping maybe you could help provide some more color on the widening disparity between the Electronics, the EGM sectors for North America and International.

Particularly, the Zappos piece is rather sizable. So that certainly is impacting the size and the growth, because remember that Zappos isn't included in last year's Q3 results. But we're actually very, very pleased with both EGM in both segments. They're both growing very fast. And as you can see that even in Q3 for International, it grew 60% on a local currency basis. So it's very, very strong growth. We've added a lot of new categories over the past few years there, and they've grown quite nicely. And we're actually very pleased with our International growth in EGM, and we're excited about the future there.",119

It's something that -- there's not a lot I can comment about your question specifically related to the U.K. It's something that we find that's interesting. It's very early. Think of it -- you mentioned about a national rollout for the U.S. Think of it as a test for the U.S. We're testing it currently and have been testing it for a few years in Seattle.

The way that we've tried to expand the benefit to customers to date has been to try to make sure that we have more selection available for Prime customers. We do that in a number of different ways. One is we add retail offerings, additional retail selection. We've also been working very hard with our seller community for Fulfilled by Amazon. And when you list with Fulfill by Amazon and have availability in stock, those products are available for our free shipping programs, which is Super Saver Shipping in the U.S. as well as Prime. So those are the things that we've been doing to try to make Prime better. We'll continually look to look at ways to make Prime even better for customers over time.

In terms of the International gross margins, there's a number of dynamics there. Certainly, pricing is impacting it. We're getting very good traction in third-party within International. Also keep in mind, we were talking about one of the earlier questions, within EGM, we've launched many new categories over the past few years. They're growing. Those categories are growing very well. As I mentioned, the growth is up 60% year-over-year on a local currency basis in total. And what's ends up happening when you launch new categories is many of those are low gross margins at the start. And then we work very hard over time to be more efficient, to buy better. And so those categories improve over time. So again, those are the things that are impacting gross margins. In terms of marketing, a couple things to think about. One, you're right. We're a little over 3%, very similar to where we were from an increase year-over-year last quarter. The primary area that we spend in marketing is with paid search and Associates still. Keep in mind, though, as you look at year-over-year, last year we didn't have Zappos. And we continue to support the marketing efforts for Zappos, which is included in that cost. As you mentioned also, we're also doing some ads from a television standpoint for Kindle that’s included in those numbers as well.",229

Can you help us at all understand if it's margin accretive on the gross margin line, when you think about the hardware and software, or not? And then secondly, you're making a lot of infrastructure investments, a lot of headcount investments and of course, fulfillment. Can you give us any visibility if you think you're kind of caught up now, this year, given the spending last year? Or this is just something that no idea of kind of when you're kind of going to be caught up with where you need to be?",107

The first part, as you can probably appreciate, we don't break out any of our products or categories from a profitability standpoint. And so we have a long-standing practice of not doing that. And so the details that we've provided today, they're just the North America and International segment from a profitability standpoint. So I can't help you much there. In terms of infrastructure and capacity to serve, excuse me, in terms of fulfillment capacity, you're right. We added a lot of capacity to date. We have some more that we're adding in Q4. And that's to serve demand that we think is in front of us. And we'll have to see, wait and see what happens over the coming quarters to see what capacity we need to add. But what I can say is from a retail perspective, as you can see, our overall growth rates are very strong. And if they continue to be strong, we will have to add additional capacity. We're seeing very good traction for Fulfilled by Amazon, which we're also adding capacity for. And we like that part of the business, from a seller perspective, a lot. From an infrastructure standpoint, again, just with the growth that we're seeing from a retail perspective, we're adding capacity to support the retail websites that we have around the world. In addition to that, we have a very fast-growing Web Services business that has great traction. It continues to grow well, and you certainly should expect that we'll add capacity there over time to serve that growth.",261
