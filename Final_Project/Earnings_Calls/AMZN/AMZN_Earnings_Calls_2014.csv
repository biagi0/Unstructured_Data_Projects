18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2014",2014-01-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2832.0,574778.0,26143491.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Dave. I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 31% to $5.47 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $2.03 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $3.44 billion. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, consisting of additional capacities to support our fulfillment operations and investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services. 
Return on invested capital was 13%, up from 4%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 476 million shares compared with 470 million shares 1 year ago. 
Worldwide revenue grew 20% to $25.59 billion, or 22% excluding the $258 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Media revenue increased to $7.23 billion, up 11%, or 13% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $17.13 billion, up 23%, or 24% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 67% of worldwide sales, up from 65%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 25%. Active customer accounts exceeded 237 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 39% of paid units. 
Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $18.81 billion, or 73.5% of revenue compared with 75.9%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined were $5.9 billion, or 23.1% of sales, up approximately 210 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.84 billion, or 11.1% of revenue compared with 10.3%. Tech and content was $1.69 billion, or 6.6% of revenue compared with 5.7%. Marketing was $1.11 billion, or 4.3% of revenue compared with 3.9%. 
Now we'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 26% to $15.33 billion. Media revenue grew 21% to $3.51 billion. EGM revenue grew 25% to $10.65 billion, representing 69% of North America revenues, down from 70%. Other revenue grew 52% to $1.17 billion. North America segment operating income increased 19% to $725 million, a 4.7% operating margin. 
In the international segment, revenue grew 13% to $10.26 billion. Adjusting for the $244 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 15%. Media revenue grew 3% to $3.71 billion or 6% excluding foreign exchange. And the EGM revenues grew 19% to $6.48 billion, or 21% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 63% of international revenues, up from 60%. International segment operating income increased 116% to $151 million, a 1.5% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, international segment operating income increased 119%. 
CSOI increased 29% to $876 million, or 3.4% of revenue, up approximately 20 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 28%. 
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income increased 26% to $510 million, or 2% of net sales. 
Our income tax expense was $179 million, resulting in a 40% tax rate for the quarter and a 32% rate for the full year 2013. GAAP net income was $239 million or $0.51 per diluted share compared with $97 million and $0.21 per diluted share. 
Now I'll discuss our full year results. Revenue grew 22% to $74.45 billion, or 24% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. North America revenue grew 28% to $44.52 billion. And international revenue grew 14% to $29.94 billion, or 19% growth excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income, or CSOI, increased 20% to $1.99 billion, or 21% excluding the unfavorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. And the operating margin was 2.7%, consistent with the prior year. GAAP operating income increased 10% to $745 million, or 1% of net sales. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $1 billion year-over-year to $12.45 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $7.41 billion, and inventory turns were 8.9, down from 9.3 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 14% to $15.13 billion, but accounts payable days decreased to 74 from 76 in the prior year. 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and, therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we've described in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates, can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructuring or legal settlements; record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates; and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. 
For Q1 2014, we expect net sales of between $18.2 billion and $19.9 billion or growth of between 13% and 24%. This guidance anticipates approximately 30 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $200 million loss and $200 million income compared with $181 million income in the first quarter of 2013. This includes approximately $350 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expenses, to be between $150 million and $550 million compared with $441 million in the first quarter of 2013. 
We've launched Prime in the U.S. 9 years go with free, unlimited 2-day shipping on 1 million items at an annual membership price of $79. Today, Prime's selection has grown to over 19 million items. Even as fuel and transportation costs have increased, the $79 price has remained the same. We know that customers love Prime, as their usage of the shipping benefit has increased dramatically since launch. On a per-customer basis, Prime members are ordering more items across more categories with free 2-day shipping than ever before. With the increased costs of fuel and transportation, as well as the increased usage among Prime members, we're considering increasing the price of Prime between $20 to $40 in the U.S. 
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks, and with that, Dave, let's move to questions.",1137

Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?",25
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2014",2014-01-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2832.0,574778.0,26143493.0,Question and Answer Operator Message,Operator,,Operator,4,[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Mark May with Citi.,12
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2014",2014-01-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2832.0,574778.0,26143494.0,Question,Mark May,,Analysts,5,"The unit growth in the quarter, I believe, was around 25%, which was a deceleration and notable versus the last couple of quarters. I believe the comp even got a little easier. Any -- can you give -- provide any color as to the dynamics in the quarter that may have drove that? And then, I'm trying to get a sense of how to think about the magnitude of the Prime price increase. Maybe if you could give us a sense of the base of subscribers that, that would be applied to? And then lastly, on shipping demand, is there anything that Amazon will do differently next holiday season to try to smooth out the pace of demand late in the holiday shopping season?",124
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2014",2014-01-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2832.0,574778.0,26143495.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,6,"First, the unit growth, you're right, it was 25% year-over-year. It is the deceleration, a small deceleration from the last couple of quarters. Keep in mind that it is our -- certainly our biggest quarter, the most seasonal. And so, both from a revenue and from a unit standpoint, you saw a deceleration from Q3 to Q4 of 2012 also. And so we saw a deceleration not of the same magnitude we saw back in 2012 from Q3 to Q4. But if you take a look at the total growth, it's 25% on a unit basis, 22% x exchange on a revenue basis. We saw a very good growth in North America, up 26%. This is, again, on a revenue basis. It's down sequentially a little bit in the last couple of quarters, but certainly up from Q4 last year where it grew 23%. In the international, the revenue was up 15% x exchange. If you look at the pieces, certainly one of the biggest things you're seeing is if you look at the media growth and our digital categories within media at international, it's growing very fast. But as we've been talking about for quite some time, there's certainly a shift going from physical to digital. You see that reflected in our North America media growth rates. The reason why you don't see it as much in our international is because we're at the very early stages of that. So that's what you're seeing in terms of the differential, certainly where the key differential is between the international media growth rate and the North America growth rate. Also keep in mind in other revenue, the AWS revenue, which is growing very fast, is recorded in North America segment. In terms of the Prime, in terms of impact, I'm sorry, I can't help you with the impact on the U.S. What we have said is globally, we have tens of millions of customers. And we certainly have been offering Prime in the U.S. longer than international, and both segments are growing very fast from a Prime perspective, if that's helpful. And then from a customer standpoint, during Q4, we work very hard on behalf of customers to make sure that we can service them. I think the team did a very nice job. We'll continue to work on that to even get better in future quarters and in future Q4s going forward.",402

A couple of questions. If you could maybe talk a little bit about the impact of refunds or incentives given to customers to make up for some of the goods that arrived late in the holiday season? Also on Prime, with respect to the increase, will you consider phasing that in, applying perhaps just to the new members at first? And also, would you consider giving an installment option to maybe soften the blow?",83
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2014",2014-01-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2832.0,574778.0,26143498.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,9,"In terms of the refunds, we did give some in the form of gift certificates as well as refunding some shipping fees, where fees were incurred by customers, for that subset of customers who were impacted. So that's reflected in the Q4 results that you see today. And in terms of details of how we'd roll out the Prime price increase that we're considering, you'll have to wait on that. But certainly, as I mentioned, it's something that we haven't had any increase in the 9 years. Customers certainly love Prime. The available units for shipment have grown dramatically from 1 million to over 19 million. Over the last 9 years, we haven't had any price increase. Customer usage, on a per-customer basis, has gone up pretty dramatically, given the selection and the convenience of the service. So that's why we're considering. Of course, during this 9-year period, shipping costs have gone up a lot. Fuel costs have gone up a lot. So that's certainly the basis for us taking a look at it. But in terms of the details, we'll be back when we make those decisions back to customers.",191

And I was hoping, Tom, that you can give us some color on how newer Prime members -- you've obviously added a lot of them over the recent quarters, but how newer cohorts of Prime members act relative to older cohorts? And in particular, if they convert sort of as quickly? And if they're spending on a similar kind of early trajectory as your more tenured Prime members? And then also, can you just comment on the, I believe, the constrained sign-ups in 4Q on Prime?",96
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2014",2014-01-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2832.0,574778.0,26143501.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,12,"Sure. In terms of details, I can't really give you a lot of color on the more recent versus the Prime members who have been with us for a long time, except to say that there's a lot of similarities in terms of what we're seeing. So in other words, customers, when we launched Prime 9 years ago, one of the things that we hoped for was customers who would do a lot more cross-shopping, that they would buy more from us. And we're seeing that trend also in more recent Prime additions again. So we're -- the program is growing very fast. We're very, very pleased with it, and we think it's great for the business as we look forward as well. In terms of -- what was the second part of the question again?",136

It -- again, we had very fast growth. We've put a couple of statistics out in our holiday release on the 26th that you've been referred to. But we had very strong growth, and we did  constrain it a bit. And customers like it. And again, there's a lot of demand for this service. And we're going to continue to make sure that we can satisfy customers there. And we thought it was appropriate to do so, to do that during Q4.",83

You mentioned higher shipping costs being a driver of potentially higher prices in the U.S. The U.S. Prime service is also the only one that has Kindle Lending Library and video. And I was just wondering if potentially those additional services have led you to think about increasing price as well to potentially further bolster either or both. And then secondly, international CSOI has been on a glide path lower over the past few years, and as that's happened, the organic international growth rates moderated during the same period. And I'm just wondering, going back to the decision to embark on the international investment cycle, if you anticipated the current revenue growth rate that you're experiencing. And if not, where are the areas in the business where you can point to that we would begin to see growth that is not yet evident in the international business?",164
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2014",2014-01-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2832.0,574778.0,26143506.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,17,"Sure. In terms of the first part, we have added a lot of new services to Prime, beyond our -- the shipping benefits. You mentioned Kindle Owners' Lending Library, certainly video, Prime Instant Video, we're investing very heavily. And so those are certainly costly. Those aren't the reasons for the price increase that we're contemplating. Those are -- that decision, again, is just based on we haven't done a price increase in 9 years. Shipping costs have gone up. If you look back very considerably over the 9-year period, customers like the service. They're using it a lot more. We have a lot more selection. They're using it a lot more. And so, that's the reason why we're looking at the increase. In terms of the international growth, we -- the growth was solid with revenue x exchange at 15%. The unit growth was considerably faster than that, primarily because third-party growth was very strong, and certainly, FBA, is a component of that. And when you think about the capacity that we built it for, not only for our retail but also for our third parties, and we're able to offer our FBA items through Prime as well. So we're very happy with the capacity that we've built across the world, including our international operation, and that's reflected in the results that you're seeing. Certainly, one of the reasons why you're seeing the growth of operating income, up over 100% in Q4 for international, is because of the mix of third party certainly helping that. So it's a combination of a number of factors, but certainly, that's one that's a significant call-out.",272

In terms of Fresh in L.A. and the Bay Area, it's very, very early. We like what we see. Customers like the service. There's been good adoption. There's been good conversion from the Prime trials. And so we're very pleased with what we're seeing there. But it's still very early and so we'll have to -- you have to stay tuned on that one. But, again, it's very early, but we like what we see. In terms of international Kindle stores, yes, absolutely. We're -- to be very clear, if you look at the Kindle content growth in Q4 in international, it's very strong. It's just, again, we're at the early stages of this cycle from physical to digital. So the growth rate is very strong.

But our retail business is very good. It -- the combination of our retail business and our third-party business on our platform works for us. We think it's very important to have both offerings for a number of reasons. One is, from a customer experience standpoint, we like the fact that customers come to our detail pages on our respective websites around the world and they see competitive offerings. They know that we're very excited about making sure we get great values for customers, and that we price our products appropriately, competitively low. And so, having third parties on our website certainly helps do that. It also adds additional selection that we don't have. And so it's a combination of being able to make sure we have a competitive marketplace as well as add a great unique selection from both retail offerings and third parties that make it work. And so -- and that's why we don't talk necessarily about first party or third party in terms of margins, but it's the combination of those working together on our platform that makes it work.",204

We have a great pattern of doing that over the 9-year period. We've also offered other services, as you mentioned, in terms of Prime Instant Video, as well as Kindle Owners' Lending Library. So it's a great value for customers, and we plan on keeping that a great value for customers, even with the price increase that we're considering in the U.S.",132

You're right, it did decelerate from Q3. Keep in mind that a number of the categories within EGM, there's certainly a seasonal impact. If you look back to last year, Q4 growth rate in North America was 24%. So we actually saw an acceleration from Q4 last year to Q4 this year, slightly. And so that's that.

Your CapEx was just slightly higher than last year's in the same period, if you correct for the real estate purchase, even though the business overall grew 22% and you said AWS grew very fast. Does this relative decrease in CapEx signal an expectation that AWS is going to grow slower? And secondly, on, again, the Prime price increase, you have tens of millions of Prime users, an increase in price of at least $20 with no incremental expense, that is quite a good chunk of money. Do you have specific plans to reinvest that money?",99

No, it's not. Actually, we're very pleased with the AWS business. It's growing very fast. The team is doing a fantastic job from a product and service standpoint, and we're very excited about that business. So I wouldn't form any opinions about what CapEx might be in the future related to the growth rates in AWS. It's going very, very well. And then the price increase on Prime, anything that we would invest would be an independent decision from that. Again, I think in the opening remarks, I talked about the rationale as to why.

18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2014",2014-04-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2754.0,616645.0,27810106.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Dave. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 26% to $5.35 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $1.49 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $3.85 billion.
We continue to make additional investments in support of business growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, and additional capacities to support our fulfillment operations. Return on invested capital is 9%, up from 1%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets, minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5-quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 476 million shares compared with 471 million 1 year ago.
Worldwide revenue grew 23% to $19.74 billion or 23% excluding the $10 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Media revenue increased to $5.47 billion, up 8% or 8% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $13.02 billion, up 27% or 27% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 66% of worldwide sales, up from 64%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 23%. Active customer accounts exceeded 244 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 40% of paid units.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $14.06 billion or 71.2% of revenue compared with 73.4%. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $5.18 billion or 26.2% of sales, up approximately 240 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.24 billion or 11.3% of revenue compared with 10.8%. Tech and content was $1.82 billion or 9.2% of revenue compared with 7.9%. Marketing was $843 million or 4.3% of revenue compared with 3.8%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 26% to $11.86 billion. Media revenue grew 12% to $2.82 billion or 13% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 28% to $7.83 billion, representing 66% of North America revenues, up from 65%. Other revenue grew 60% to $1.2 billion. North America segment operating income increased 23% to $562 million, a 4.7% operating margin.
In the international segment, revenue grew 18% to $7.88 billion. Adjusting for the $24 million year-over-year favorable foreign change impact, revenue growth was 18%.
Media revenue grew 4% to $2.64 billion or 4% excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 27% to $5.19 billion or 26% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 66% of international revenues, up from 61%.
International segment operating loss was $60 million compared with $16 million loss in the prior period.
CSOI increased 14% to $502 million or 2.5% of revenue, down approximately 20 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 10%.
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 19% to $146 million or 0.7% of net sales.
Our income tax expense was $73 million. GAAP net income was $108 million or $0.23 per diluted share compared with $82 million and $0.18 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $771 million year-over-year to $8.67 billion. Inventory increased 24% to $6.72 billion. And inventory turns were 9.1, down from 9.5 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 19% to $10.59 billion. And accounts payable days were 68, consistent with the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including the high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand. And, therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements; record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates; and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q2 2014, we expect net sales of between $18.1 billion and $19.8 billion, a growth of between 15% and 26%. This guidance anticipates approximately 160 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $455 million loss and $55 million loss compared to $79 million in income in the second quarter 2013. This includes approximately $455 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which exclude stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between 0 and $400 million compared to $409 million in the second quarter of 2013.
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks. And with that, Dave, let's move to questions.",895

And then a specific question on Prime Pantry. Is one of the motivations to get the customer on that program, it might make it easier to convert them to AmazonFresh? And if so, would you want to run this operation as a breakeven like you do with Kindle to enable a bigger business?",86

North America, we saw similar growth rates in Q1, as we saw in Q4 of last year, as well as Q1 of last year, all at 26%. In international, we saw the growth accelerate a little bit on an exchange-adjusted basis from 15% to 18% from Q4 to Q1. But what we've really seen is -- we're pleased with the overall fundamentals. We continue to add new customers. In-stocks continue to be healthy. Third-party units, as a percentage of units, are about 40%, so still very strong. FBA adoption continues to be strong around the world. We continue to add new selection. We saw strong growth in many different areas, including Web Services. And so again, a lot of different areas contributed to the growth rate that we saw in Q1. In terms of Prime  Pantry, we just think it's an exciting option for Prime members. It's available only to Prime members, so they can get their everyday non-bulk items in one box, and we think that's -- it's interesting for customers. And again, it's a great way that we can add the selection and have the selection for those customers.",215

We want to offer great value to customers. And so we work very hard to make sure that we can offer and afford to offer great prices for customers. And so that's something that we've been working on very hard over the years. That's certainly one of the reasons why you've seen the growth rates that we've experienced, along with getting closer to customers from a shipping perspective, make sure we have great in-stocks and other service attributes. In terms of price increases, we certainly have increased the price on Prime. But again, that was after many years of not raising the price, even though the cost of -- transportation costs certainly had gone up, and the fact that we certainly added a lot of selection, going from a little over 1 million items in the first year to over 20 million items. And so it's still an incredibly great value for customers, and that's why we did that. So again, we're all about making sure we have great values for customers, and we'll continue to do that.",186

First, I think everyone will agree that AWS is a vast opportunity. And so given how large the opportunity is, why is it that you are not hiring more people, launching more products and growing faster? What are the limiting factors for growth of AWS? And second, you have a long history of cutting prices for a few specific AWS products. But you did some things so much in usually late March when you've cut prices across EC2 and S3 products in one shot. Why did you only cut your prices after Google cut theirs?",102

We are adding a lot of resources. So we've grown our employee base there dramatically over the years and continue to add people there. And that's the way we've been able to launch all the new services that we've had over the past several years. And we've continued the pace of acceleration in terms of new things that we're doing is increasing and we've published a lot of statistics around that. In terms of pricing, we think this is our 42nd price increase that we've had in AWS -- sorry, price decrease in AWS, and we're very excited on behalf of our customers to be able to do that. The team works very hard to be able to afford those lower prices, and we're excited to do that. And so in terms of the timing of when we launch these price decreases, they come at different times and it happened to come in the presentation that we're giving around that time. So -- but again, we're very excited about the opportunity, and we continue to invest in that business, given the big opportunity that we have there.",198

Certainly, we're trying to estimate what the usage is of those -- of all the content that we launch, and we have a number of different ways that we do that. We do have certainly for some of the content that we've been selling, both in terms of physical format, as well as selling on the transactional side, we certainly see what the -- what those sales are, what those unit sales are, so we have that as a benchmark. We also have other models to look at that help us guide to what we think the usage that will be of those.

Just over the last several weeks, our Prime subscribers continue to grow week-over-week. New trials, the adoption of new trials, again post the increase, are growing very nicely. So those customers accepting new trials is growing very fast. We only have a few days of information related to conversion, and we're encouraged by what we see there. So overall, we're very encouraged. And the reason why is that customers, we believe, are responding to just a great service. And so we're continuously being reminded of -- for customers in terms of the offering we have on the physical side, as well as the offerings that we have on the digital side as well. So very encouraged there. In terms of the North American media, we did see a -- from a growth standpoint, it's 13% year-over-year for North American media. That compares to 14% in Q1 of last year. It is down a little bit sequentially from Q4, the Q4. Keep in mind, we do have video games and video consoles in that number in Q4. And there's certainly a number of different factors, but that's certainly one that's impacting the Q4 numbers. And it's certainly seasonal, as you would expect, but there's some great launches of consoles in Q4 that are impacting that number.",230

As you mentioned, unit growth was actually decelerated a little bit from Q4 and also from last year. It was 23% year-over-year in Q1. One thing to keep in mind is that our Web Services business is growing at a faster rate. We don't incorporate any units from AWS in that metric. But overall, you're right, we continue to -- from a growth standpoint, we had a small acceleration of growth from Q4 to Q1 from a revenue standpoint, again on a local currency basis, growing from 22% to 23%. We're very pleased with a lot of the fundamentals that I talked about earlier that's impacting that growth rate. So -- again, overall, we're pleased. And again, we think that we see a nice growth rate. And third-party units as a percentage of total units was 40%, which was consistent with what we saw last year.

The first one just, Tom, to go back to the unit question. Even if we exclude North America and international other from gross profit, gross profit growth held in there pretty steady at 28%. I'm just kind of curious, is there anything that we should think about of why gross profit growth and unit growth is decoupling? And is unit growth really a good way to measure the health of the business? And then the second one is on international media. One of the factors you guys have flagged in the past, holding that international media is more limited local language content. Can you just help us better quantify the difference in English-language digital content compared to foreign language? And what steps are you taking to improve that?",131

The growth rate was 4% in the quarter. And as I've talked about in prior quarters, certainly, one of the things that's happening is we see a conversion from physical to digital. And for example, in North America, we're now selling -- in North America media, we're now selling more digital units than physical units. So over the past 12 months, we sold more digital units than physical units. We're not at that point yet in international. And so certainly, that's an opportunity for us as we look at growing international media. And so again, it's certainly something that we're working very hard on and certainly a good opportunity for us. In terms of unit growth, it's certainly just one measure that we want to -- that we've thought has been helpful, and that's why we've continued to provide it. It is just one metric.

Just the footprint we have from a capacity standpoint enables us to be closer to customers and getting great selection even closer to customers. So we continue to work.

And now it looks like you're losing money and maybe for the whole year. Could you talk about some of the drivers that are driving the losses this quarter internationally; what the company's patience for losses are internationally; and when you come out of this, how your business will be different and how -- what your margin outlook is for the international profits?",104

In terms of what you're seeing in Q1, and you've been seeing this certainly for a few-year period here, is we're investing very heavily in international. And we're doing that in a number of different ways. Certainly from a geographic standpoint, we continue to invest in new geographies. And Italy and Spain were certainly the most recent, and you should assume that we're investing in those geographies. We continue to invest in China, and certainly that's in investment mode. And then also, as we've continued to grow in international, we've invested in terms of capacity, both fulfillment capacity, as well as infrastructure capacity to support those. So what you saw -- you will see some, certainly, variation over time in the period that you're talking about. We certainly had, particularly coming out of -- going into late 2008 and also 2009, we had extra capacity globally. We still did continue to invest but not near the rates that we're investing now. And that's why you saw some of the results that you've seen. But again, one of the things that you see now in international within our total results is we continue to invest very heavily into the business because of the opportunities that we see.",207

But the biggest one is we had built -- we think we've built a great service, and we saw that the -- just particularly the transportation costs since inception have grown dramatically. We hadn't -- we just hadn't done any price increase during that long time period. And that's really the big reason why we decided to do that. We've launched the program with over 1 million items, and we have over 20 million items now. Customers are using that service. In addition to having the transportation costs being higher, they're using that service more, and that's really what led to it. And beyond that, there's not a lot I can comment.",135

You need more rights? You just need more devices in the market? What's the drag there?

We're investing in our Web Services business both from new services, as well as pricing. So again, we're investing in a lot of different areas across the company. I'm sure there's a number that I'm not mentioning. So again, we're investing. So that's really what you're seeing in the range of guidance that we see in Q2.

Given the comments that customers would see hundreds of millions of dollars of savings in Q2 from the price cuts, I just want to understand or clarify if we should be expecting moderating growth rate in the other segments, at least temporarily. And then lastly, just Amazon's position on the ability of ISPs to add a toll for fast lane network access. Is this scenario a situation that would change the company's approach or strategy with regards to -- in video? Or is this more of a nonfactor for you guys?",99

He didn't say specifically the second quarter. So certainly, that's impacting second quarter and is reflected in the guidance that you're seeing there. But again, we're very happy to do that on behalf of our AWS customers. We've done many different price decreases over time, and we think that's great on behalf of customers. And we think our teams -- and we're positioned very well in that business, and we'll continue to invest in that, given the large opportunity that we have there. In terms of your other question, it's not -- there's not really a lot I can comment there.",130

One, on customer adds, you didn't add quite as many new customer accounts as you did in Q1 2013. And so I assume based on your comments that wasn't related to the price increase around Prime. And so I don't know if you can add any context there. And then the second question is just around mobile, obviously, the mobilization throughout the world is an important trend, and you guys haven't talked a lot about it. I wonder if you can give us any context around your strategy there or any metrics.",97

And then also week-over-week, as we look at the metrics over the last several weeks, continues to grow week-over-week. So we're very encouraged by what we're seeing there. In terms of mobile, it's certainly a tailwind for our business. We have a number of different things that we're working on in mobile, and we'll continue to make it easier and easier for customers to shop from a mobile perspective. Our traffic continues to increase from a mobile perspective, and we're excited about what we see there and we're continuing trying to find ways to make that even better from an experience standpoint for our customers.",119

Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
                  
                  The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 24, 2014 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.
                  
                  As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press releases in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
                  
                  During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.

I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 18% to $5.33 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $1.04 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.29 billion. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, consisting of additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services. 
                  
                  Return on invested capital was 6%, up from 2%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 480 million shares compared with 474 million 1 year ago. Worldwide revenue grew 23% to $19.34 billion or 22% excluding the $237 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Media revenue increased to $4.84 billion, up 10% or 9% excluding foreign exchange.
                  
                  EGM revenue increased to $13.28 billion, up 27% or 26% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 69% of worldwide sales, up from 66%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 23%. Active customer accounts exceeded 250 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 41% of paid units.
                  
                  Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $13.4 billion or 69.3% of revenue compared with 71.4%. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $5.54 billion or 28.6% of sales, up approximately 260 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.28 billion or 11.8% of revenue compared with 11.2%. Tech and content was $2.02 billion or 10.4% of revenue compared with 9.1%. Marketing was $911 million or 4.7% of revenue compared with 4.1%.
                  
                  Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 26% to $12 billion. Media revenue grew 13% to $2.46 billion or 14% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 29% to $8.37 billion, representing 70% of North America revenues, up from 68%. Other revenue grew 38% to $1.17 billion. North America segment operating income increased 7% to $438 million, a 3.7% operating margin.
                  
                  In the international segment, revenue grew 18% to $7.34 billion. Excluding the $246 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 14%. Media revenue grew 7% to $2.38 billion or 4% excluding foreign exchange, and EGM revenue grew 25% to $4.91 billion or 20% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 67% of international revenues, up from 63%.
                  
                  International segment operating loss was $34 million compared to 0 in the prior period. CSOI decreased 1% to $404 million or 2.1% of revenue, down approximately 50 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, CSOI decreased 9%.
                  
                  Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income or loss includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating loss was $15 million compared to operating income of $79 million in the prior year period.
                  
                  Our income tax expense was $94 million, and this includes approximately $90 million of discrete tax items primarily attributable to audit-related developments. GAAP net loss was $126 million or $0.27 per diluted share compared with a net loss of $7 million and $0.02 per diluted share.
                  
                  Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $523 million year-over-year to $7.99 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $6.64 billion. And inventory turns were 9.1, down from 9.4 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 16% to $10.46 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 71 from 73 in the prior year.
                  
                  I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand. And therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
                  
                  As we describe in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have material effect on guidance.
                  
                  Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements; record any further revisions to the stock-based compensation estimates; and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
                  
                  For Q3 2014, we expect net sales of between $19.7 billion and $21.5 billion or growth of between 15% and 26%. This guidance anticipates approximately 120 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating loss to be between $810 million loss and a $410 million loss compared to a $25 million loss in the third quarter of 2013. This includes approximately $410 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between a $400 million loss and 0 compared to $267 million of income in the third quarter of 2013.
                  
                  We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. 
                  
                  Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move to questions.",932

Tom, you mentioned in the past that China is an eye of investment. Can you say a little bit about what are the main drivers of investment there, whether it's marketing, pricing, fulfillment? And how do you decide on any given year how much you invest in China, just given the size of the potential market and opportunity? And secondly, we saw a material deceleration in the North America order revenues. Was this primarily driven by an AWS deceleration? And is the deceleration on meaningful contributor to the losses implied in your next quarter guidance?",99
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2014",2014-07-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2746.0,663362.0,29521250.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,6,"Sure. I'll take the second part of the question first. Yes, North America other includes a number of things, including Amazon Web Services. Amazon Web Services is the largest part of North America other. As we talked about on the last call, we had very substantial price reductions for customers starting in the second quarter. They range from 28% to 51%, depending on the service, but AWS continues to grow very strongly. In Q2, we had usage growth close to 90% year-over-year for the quarter. So the team is doing a fantastic job, and we put in some price reductions that were very substantial that are saving customers hundreds of millions of dollars over the next several months, as we mentioned 90 days ago. But again, we love that business. It's doing great, and we're very pleased to have the opportunity to invest in it. The team is innovating very quickly. In fact, so far, year-to-date, they've released 250 significant service and features, and that's at a pace that's much, much faster than last year's pace, which was faster than the year before. So again, they're continuing to innovate on behalf of customers. And so we're investing, and so that's certainly impacting both the pricing decisions we've made and certainly impacting the guidance. Also, the large amount of CapEx and infrastructure for that business is certainly impacting the guidance, along with a number of other things across the business that we're investing in, but we're very pleased to do that. In terms of China, we'll continue to invest on behalf of customers there, obviously trying to make the experience even better for customers in terms of improved in-stock levels. We've spent -- certainly added a lot of fulfillment capacity over time in China, and we're doing a lot of interesting things to better serve customers in China. In terms of some of the other parts of your question, there's not much more I can add to that.",327

In terms of unit growth, we had 23% unit growth year-over-year. It is down from last year's growth rate, but it's consistent with what we've seen recently, including last quarter. And in terms of the unit, the third-party units, so the potential of total units, you're right, that's 41% this quarter. It's up about 100 basis points, and we're not breaking out the digital versus physical on that. But again, very strong third-party growth. A number of factors, but certainly, FBA is helping third-party growth.",86

But you're right, we're -- one of the ones that I just mentioned, we're investing in various parts of the business, but certainly for Amazon Web Services, that's both from an infrastructure standpoint to support the very fast usage growth that we're experiencing. Again, we have usage growth close to 90% year-over-year in the second quarter for Web Services. In addition to that, we've -- over the past year, we've added thousands of people in Web Services, so again, ramping that up. And then across a number of different other investment areas, we continue to add great technical resources to do the things we're doing in digital and many other parts of the company. So again, it's -- we have a lot of opportunities to invest in, as you can see from a lot of the releases that we've had over the past 12 months, and you're certainly seeing that reflected in our actual results as well.",172

I'm wondering if you could just talk about the deceleration in your international EGM line. And then separately, now that you've had the Prime price increases in effect for about 3 months, wondering if you could just talk about any changes you've seen in sign-ups or conversions there.",55

In terms of international EGM, and this would really relate to total international growth as well, we saw 18% growth on a dollar basis, 14% growth on a local currency growth basis, which is down a little bit sequentially from what we saw in Q1. There's -- obviously, there's variability from quarter-to-quarter in each of the geographies that we operate in. One call out, which impacted certainly EGM and our total international growth rate is Japan. We saw on April 1 the consumption tax increase. Consumption tax was increased from 5% to 8%. Leading up to that, in the latter part of Q1, we certainly saw accelerated growth. And so that was reflected in the Q1 results. In Q2, we saw some corresponding softness in Q2 following that. Hard to know how much was related to consumption growth. But certainly, as you've probably read elsewhere that others are seeing that too, so it's not probably reflects the consumption tax increase. But if you take out Japan out of both Q1 and Q2, the growth rates on a local currency basis were very similar within approximately 100 basis points of each other. In terms of Prime, Prime subscribers are growing very nicely year-over-year. In fact, we added more Prime subscribers in Q2 of this year than in Q2 of last year. So we're very pleased, and customers are responding to continue to -- would continue to get new subscribers, as well as existing customers responding to the great value they're getting out of Prime.",254

And common sense would also suggest that given the significant volume gains that you're seeing in that business that Q2 might be the most impacted quarter from that, yet the third quarter guidance suggested it's having an even greater impact on Q3. Just wondering if you could help us think through that. Is there some timing issue related to the impact of that? Or is there something else going on within the core retail business or maybe some other onetime items that might be impacting your Q3 outlook?",139
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2014",2014-07-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2746.0,663362.0,29521262.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,18,"Sure. In terms of -- we're not quantifying the impact of the price changes on our Q2 and Q3. But it is fair to say that the impact -- it certainly did impact our Q2 results in a meaningful way, and that's reflecting the actual results that you're seeing. Another thing to keep in mind as you look out relating to AWS is we'll continue to invest in that business. And with the great, strong usage growth rates that we're seeing, we're also investing in CapEx and infrastructure to support that growth. So again, we're -- the team is doing a fantastic job in innovating on behalf of customers. And as I mentioned earlier, the new releases both from a service and feature perspective was about 250 year-to-date, which is at a pace that's much faster than we've seen over the last few years with very high mark, given all the innovation that's happened from that team in that space. So again, those are certainly things that are impacting Q3 guidance. There's a number of other things. When you look at Q3, keep in mind, if you look back over the last several years, we're getting ready for our Q4 seasonal quarter. And when that happens -- if you look back, certainly, you've seen our CSOI has been at the lowest point for the year during Q3, particularly during these high-growth years. And so we've added or announced that we are adding 6 net new fulfillment centers. And we've also announced that we'll have 15 or more sortation centers. And the sortation centers helps us get closer to customers, so that we can have faster delivery speed, as well as deliver on Sundays, which is a big deal for us in the U.S. So we're very pleased to be able to do that. On top of that, other investment areas that are certainly impacting our Q3 guidance is -- we like what we see on the content side. So video content, for example, we're ramping up the spend from Q2 to Q3 significantly, and so there will be also a significant growth year-over-year. Keep in mind, we have 2 types of content. We have license content. We also have original content. A lot of you have probably seen a lot of the announcements that we've greenlighted, a number of pilots. We're going to be in heavy production on those pilots during  -- sorry, in those series that have been greenlit during Q3. We've also announced a number of pilots that will be in production on. And so that original content that's a portion of our total content will be over $100 million in Q3. Keep in mind that, just as a reminder, that we do not capitalize that portion of our content, of our original content. It's expenses incurred, so that's over $100 million in Q3. And again, that's ramped up considerably both on a sequential and on a year-over-year basis. Other areas that we're investing in, certainly, with the launch of some new devices more recently over the past couple of quarters between Fire phone and Fire TV and others, over time, we've invested in devices. So that's certainly an area we're investing in. We're investing in a lot of different areas, including geographic expansion. We talked about China on one of the earlier questions. But certainly, India, we're investing very heavily. We're seeing some very positive results there. The team is doing a fantastic job. We're also investing in other geographies as well, like Italy and Spain and others. So again, we're encouraged by the -- just the sheer magnitude of opportunities we have, and we're investing in those opportunities.",612

And then, Tom, to the extent that you're talking about sort of AWS volume increases on a year-over-year basis, can you give us a sense of how that may have trended over the course of the quarter as your AWS customers were able to sort of adapt to the price reduction in March?",105

In terms of content, we've seen just more and more customers are streaming -- more and more Prime members are streaming free content. We're seeing through our pipeline, as customers join Prime, we're seeing that we have more and more customers taking free trials.and then converting those customers. Our great customers, they're -- in addition to streaming free content, they have great purchasing patterns, doing a lot of cross-shopping on physical products, as well as converting to paid digital video and other digital products as well. So we're very pleased with what we're seeing there. And if -- when you look at the service that we have today, it's improved dramatically over the past 12 to 24 months. And we really think it's a great service, and that's why we're investing in it. In terms of AWS, there's not much I can help you with on that. But again, just to reiterate, we saw very strong growth during Q2 and with usage growth rates close to 90% year-over-year for the quarter, and we're extremely happy with what we see there.

First, on AWS, just wondering your take on the competitive environment, and public cloud has it intensified over the past 6 to 12 months? And just given the investments in AWS, how do you view AWS's competitive positioning? And then if you could just touch on the key drivers of EGM growth in North America. And are those the same drivers of growth internationally? Or are there different drivers on North America versus international?",79

But the team is certainly used to operating in a very competitive environment. They work hard to be able to afford lower prices for customers. That's something that is instilled in all the Amazon and something certainly that instilled at our Web Services team. And they're focused on what they do best, which is innovating on behalf of customers, operating these services at the highest quality levels. And they'll continue to work on getting more efficient, so that we can have great prices for customers. And so that's what the team is focused on, and they're doing a great job. In terms of EGM growth, both between North America and international, there's not a lot I can call out there. It has many different categories across many different geographies, many different ASINs both first party and third party. So it's hard to comment. The other thing I would call to attention is the comment I made earlier around international growth rates related to EGM, and that was the consumption tax increase in Japan that we saw a lead in. In Q1, we saw a very strong growth leading up to that point, and it softened after the rates went into effect. But other than that, there's not a lot to call out.",243

Think of it as almost a proxy similar to unit growth on our retail business. It's a proxy to, say, how fast the physical volume is growing. And so that's what it's a proxy for. In terms of the phone, there's not a lot I can help you with on that. We're extremely pleased to get it in customers' hands. We think it's a premium product and it's also a great value to -- you get a 32-gigabyte phone, premium product, 1 year free subscription to Prime, along with all the other features that I'm sure you've read about.

If I take out AWS, it looks like you're up nearly 200 basis points. What are the drivers of that e-commerce margin increase? Are you seeing it primarily on the first-party margin expansion?

We don't actually focus on total company gross margins because of the mix of the business. We focus more on operating profit and, obviously, ultimately, free cash flow dollars. But in terms of things that would be impacting COGS as a percent of revenue and that change to be helpful, you mentioned AWS is certainly having an impact there. Our third-party business continues to have an impact there. We have offsets, as we lower prices to customers, having an impact there. This mix of products, our various products and geographies has an impact on those results. So again, a large number of items that are impacting that.",108

When we've seen prior investment cycles, such as distribution build outs or devices, with certainly the Kindle reader, we did see an impact on units and accelerating growth in some of the categories. This time around, you've been investing for a couple of years, and I guess we're not really seeing the acceleration that some are looking for. So maybe you could talk about what gives you confidence in investing in devices, like the Fire TV and the phone and all the content you're doing? And are you seeing some underlying signs that say activity is picking up? Maybe you could walk through that.",114
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2014",2014-07-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2746.0,663362.0,29521280.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,36,"Sure. Just a couple of things to call out. One is when we look at our unit growth, you hear the 23% unit growth, keep in mind that there are parts of our business that are not included in that unit growth. So when we talk about investing in Web Services and the usage growing close to 90%, that number is not included in the 23%. So that's obviously a large investment area for us that we're excited about that is not included in that. The other is, think about the base of business that we have versus where we were just a few years ago. And so you've seen very strong growth on the base that we have, and we're excited to see that. And so those are the things. When we look at the opportunities that we're investing in -- in terms of video, you mentioned, we're seeing that certainly in the number of Prime members that are subscribing. And so that has some short-term impact but great long-term impact as we retain those Prime members. And as they start to do more cross-shopping over time, so it's more of a trailing -- we have a lot of investment in front of that demand, if you will. So those are some of the things that I would call out that maybe -- to try to be helpful.",229

The assumption here is it will only go up. So is that $100 million a good level to work off of? And then going back to the Fire phone, just trying to understand the strategy around the product longer term. Is it, again, just to try to further build the Amazon ecosystem with all its benefits? Or do you think this is a -- this could be a self-funded business?",111

We're very excited about what we see and the pilots that we had and the series we had. And so we're happy to greenlight the series that we've released -- that we've talked about in releases over the past few months. We're also happy -- you'll be seeing many new pilots, and so that's reflected in the over $100 million that I mentioned earlier. So we're extremely excited on behalf of customers to be able to do that. We think that's the right thing to do. But in terms of what we'd do in terms of spend beyond Q3, I can't comment on today. In terms of the Fire phone, we're very excited about it. You mentioned 2 different areas. One is can it exist on its own; and whether it's part of our family, if you will, to help drive other usage. And the answer is we certainly think it can be both. And so we think it could be a great product on its own. We're very excited to offer it to customers. It's very integrated into our -- certainly, our various video services -- our various digital services, including video and games in our app store and e-books and certainly Prime music. So those are all very interesting things on behalf of customers. It's also a great way to do physical shopping as well. So again, it's certainly integrated into our business as well.",254

The first one is around CPG, consumer packaged goods. I was wondering, Tom, can you talk to some learnings in CPG so far, what's working and what you think is still holding back faster CPG adoption? Do you think you need a same-day delivery offering at this point for CPG kind of given Google and given the traditional retailers push into that category?

In terms of the usage growth, that business is growing very, very fast. Beyond data point, there's not a lot I can help you with. In terms of CPG, and this really relates to many of our categories, we're working on behalf of customers to provide fast delivery. It's something that we've improved on over the years and we're going to continue to work on. There's a number of different things we're working on. One of the things that I mentioned earlier in the call is certainly sortation centers. That's an attempt on our side, which we think we have in a small way -- and tested it, and we've seen that it's a way to get product to customers even faster. And so we're excited about that. It also helps us deliver on Sunday, which we think is great, too. So again, those are the things that we're working on, as well as others to help customers get product faster.

There's a lot of mix factors that you correctly pointed out. But that's a record high gross margin for you, 30.7%, ever, and it's in the context of a quarter in which AWS clearly was -- came in because of the price cuts. And so there's something else that happened there that really caused that gross margin to gap up. Could you give us any color? I understand there are lot of puts and takes in there. But something must have happened that was unusual to have that kind of result with a weak -- or with a slowing down AWS contribution.",126

Once again, we don't focus a lot on gross margin as a business. Obviously, individual product lines, we would look at gross margin. But across the business, we don't, for the very reason you mentioned. There's a large mix impact. You have a Web Services business, you have a third-party business, you have a retail business, you have categories within retail. There's a whole host of things that would impact that. And so that's why we don't focus on a total company basis. Certainly, on individual SKUs or ASINs as we call them, we certainly would look at it.

It was running close to the 2% to 3% last year. Could you help us understand what's driving that, whether it's Prime particularly? Or any color on that?

So that's the net additions to total members. So again, we added net more Prime members in Q2 of this year versus Q2 last year, even with the price change. In terms of revenue per x customer, there's not a lot I can say there. The one thing -- a few things to think about: One is certainly Prime customers buy more than non-Prime customers, and we're seeing great growth on Prime. That certainly have an impact on that number. And certainly, there'd be other factors, too. Our Web Services business would be included in the numerator that you're talking about as well. And so those are factors you should be thinking about. But again, the biggest factor would certainly be -- in terms of looking at our retail business, Prime is becoming much more meaningful. And that's also why we think about how we make Prime better on behalf of those customers. We just like the long-term benefits that we see for those customers.",171

18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Oct 23, 2014",2014-10-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2766.0,708815.0,31301858.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our third quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 15% to $5.71 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $1.08 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.63 billion.
The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, due to investments in technology infrastructure, including web -- Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. Return on invested capital was 6%, up from 3%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 481 million shares compared with 475 million 1 year ago.
Worldwide revenue grew 20% to $20.58 billion or 20% excluding the $13 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Media revenue increased to $5.24 billion, up 4% or 4% excluding exchange. EGM revenue increased to $13.95 billion, up 26% or 26% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 68% of worldwide sales up from 65%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 21%. Active customer accounts was approximately 260 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 42% of paid units.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $14.63 billion or 71.1% of revenue compared with 72.3%. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $6.09 billion or 29.6% of sales, up approximately 350 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.55 billion or 12.4% of revenue compared with 11.5%. Tech and content was $2.22 billion or 10.8% of revenue compared with 9.2%. Marketing was $961 million or 4.7% of revenue compared with 3.9%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we did not allocate the segments, our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 25% to $12.87 billion. Media revenue grew 5% to $2.73 billion. EGM revenue grew 31% to $8.79 billion, representing 68% of North America revenues, up from 65%. Other revenue grew 40% to $1.34 billion.
North America segment operating income decreased 70% to $88 million, a 0.7% operating margin. In the international segment, revenue grew 14% to $7.71 billion. Excluding the $21 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 13%. Media revenue grew 4% to $2.51 billion or 3% excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 20% to $5.16 billion or 19% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 67% of international revenues, up from 64%.
International segment operating loss was $224 million compared to international segment operating loss of $28 million in the prior period. Consolidated segment operating loss was $136 million compared to consolidated segment operating income of $267 million in the prior period. Consolidated segment operating loss includes charges of approximately $170 million primarily related to the Fire phone inventory evaluation and supplier commitment costs.
Unlike CSOI, GAAP operating income or loss includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating loss was $544 million compared to operating loss of $25 million in the prior period. Our income tax benefit was $205 million. GAAP net loss was $437 million or $0.95 per diluted share compared with a net loss of $41 million and $0.09 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities decreased $806 million year-over-year to $6.88 billion. Inventory increased 21% to $7.32 billion and inventory turns were 8.9 down from 9.2 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 18% to $11.81 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 74 from 75 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation, estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q4 2014, we expect net sales of between $27.3 billion and $30.3 billion, a growth between 7% and 18%. This guidance anticipates approximately 250 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $570 million loss and $430 million income compared to $510 million of income in the fourth quarter of 2013. This includes approximately $470 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense, to be between $100 million loss and $900 million in income compared to $876 million in income in fourth quarter 2013. We remain heads-on focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareowners. 
Thanks. And with that, so let's move to questions.",934

In terms of back-to-school, the -- certainly the results are reflected in the Q3 results that you see today. There's a number of different impacts back-to-school has. One thing I would like to call out, as you look at our North American media growth rates, one thing that we are seeing is certainly a shift from a textbook standpoint from purchase to rental, and so we see a lot more customers renting, so you see that impacting the growth rate of the North American media. But in terms of Q4, as in any Q4, when we look at it, there's a wide range of outcomes. We're giving a wide range of guidance. What we feel good about is we have a team that's been improving customer experience over the past 12 months. We're very excited to serve customers. We've got a lot of unique selection. We've got an inventory closer to customers. Many, many different things that we're doing on behalf of customers. So we're very excited about the holiday season and look forward to serving customers. In terms of Twitch, we're very excited to have Twitch as part of our overall team. We've been in video games for quite some time, and we think that it's a very creative team. They're doing some very innovative things on behalf of their customers and our customers. And so we're excited to have them be part of Amazon, and look forward to working together with that team.",246

International CSOI margins this quarter were the lowest they have been in years, maybe ever, I don't know. We know you have been investing internationally, but has something changed fundamentally? And if yes, what? Secondly, I wanted to ask you about a vast difference in revenue growth rate between your international and domestic business. What is fundamentally different between the U.S. and your main international markets? And is this difference fundamental or temporary?",77
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Oct 23, 2014",2014-10-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2766.0,708815.0,31301865.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,9,"Thank you. Thanks for the questions. In terms of the consolidated segment or the segment operating for international, certainly versus what you would have seen last quarter, there's some notable changes. One is we're certainly getting ready for the holiday season. So as we get ready for the holiday season, we are expanding from a capacity standpoint. We do see we've gotten great penetration in fulfilled by Amazon customers. So you'll see that our -- actually, our growth rate -- our unit growth rate is actually higher than our revenue growth rate. And so that's what we've been experiencing. So we're certainly adding capacity from a fulfillment perspective, adding capacity from an infrastructure standpoint. If you look at our overall operating expenses, we're certainly investing, and with the slow growth rate, you're not seeing as -- certainly not seeing as much leverage. We understand that we do have to get leverage over time, but we are investing right now. We're also investing in newer and emerging geographies, including India and Italy and Spain and continue to invest in China. And then one of the callout we had mentioned in my opening remarks, there was approximately $170 million impact related to inventory valuations and supplier commitment costs. The vast majority of that was in North America, but there's about $25 million in international, just to let you know that's there. In terms of the growth rates, it has been softer across a number of geographies. If you look back over the past, really, 4 quarters, we've seen a little bit of volatility between the quarters, but it's been softer. We continue to focus on the inputs. And we still think international is a very big opportunity for us in terms of growth. More recently, if you look at the growth rate for Q3, and you see the 13% excluding foreign exchange, you may remember, on the last call, about 90 days ago, I talked about Q2, what had happened was we had seen -- in late Q1, we had seen a ramp-up in Japan before the consumption tax increase happened on April 1. We saw a pretty sizable drop off in Japan growth rates from Q1 to Q2, which brought that down. The only update, again, there's a number of different puts and takes about geographies, but the only other comment I would say is that we really haven't seen Japan growth rates improving since Q2. So that's something that's there. But in terms of the fundamentals, long term, we're very excited about international, as well as North America. We think it's a big opportunity. We continue to focus on the inputs. Some of those inputs are certainly on the media side, working on the conversion from physical media to digital media. We continue to work on that in a number of different ways. We continue to add new selection in those geographies, and work on the retail basics. And so again, we're very excited about the opportunity.",497

A lot of the capital that's been deployed in planting seeds in new businesses have worked out very well. But given what's happening right now in terms of the deterioration in margin structure as growth is slowing, I'm just wondering, and I think a lot of investors have this question as well in terms of when things don't go as anticipated in some of the bigger projects where there's not a revenue stream like areas, maybe like the -- some of the hardware projects in China and other markets. What's the process for determining whether to plow ahead or turn back capital and redeploy in other areas?",113

With anything new that we do, and obviously, we've done, as you mentioned, we've done a lot of new things. There's certainly a wide range of outcome and we certainly understand that. We try to learn from everything that we do as we launch new opportunities. And so that's something across things that go great and things that don't go as well as others. We try to learn from that. And so the way I would describe it is from a looking-forward standpoint, we still think that we have a lot of opportunities. That said, we need to be very selective about what opportunities we pursue. And so that's, again, the way we're thinking about it, and probably not much more I can add to it than that.",133

That $170 million in charges related to the Fire phone, where was that put in the P&L? In which of the OpEx lines, or was it a COGS? And then secondly, in the media side, you talked about maybe seeing a negative impact or definitely seeing a negative impact from the switch towards owning to renting. Do you think that's a broader trend just beyond just textbooks that affects all media retailers, including Amazon? Could that have been -- could that be one of the issues behind the slow media growth in international markets? And if so, is there really a solution to that, other than your own rental models?",113
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Oct 23, 2014",2014-10-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2766.0,708815.0,31301871.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,15,"Sure. In terms of the first question, the $170 million, it's predominantly in COGS. And so, it's -- the very vast majority is in COGS. And then in terms of the split, about $25 million of that is in international, and the remainder is in North America. In terms of the growth, we certainly are seeing that in textbooks. We do see, in other digital media, we're certainly seeing rentals being part of our portfolio more than we had probably during -- certainly, with physical. But in terms of some of the recent growth rates, the one that I called out related to book rentals is certainly impacting North American media. One of the other things that's certainly impacting it too is we just had some things last year Q3 that were overlapping, that were positive in Q3 last year from a demand standpoint. One was -- and certainly in physical books, we had very heavy discounting, which helped our growth in Q3 last year. We're overlapping that in Q3 this year.",172

We're looking at a number of different metrics over a long period of time. And certainly, our goal is to maximize free cash flow over the long term. We don't focus on individual margins, but we do focus on the inputs that are going to help drive free cash flow and operating income. We certainly will look at making sure that we're using our capital wisely so that over time, we get good returns on invested capital. And we certainly have been in several years now of what I would call an investment mode. And because of the opportunities that we've had in front of us, and as I mentioned earlier, there's still lots of opportunity in front of us, and -- but we know that we have to be very selective about which opportunities we pursue, and -- but we're encouraged by the opportunities that we have.",149

In terms of original content, we're excited about it. We're investing, as we talked about last quarter, we spent approximately $100 million in the quarter. Keep in mind that, that's expensed in the quarter, and so that's included in the results that you see in Q3. We're very excited about it. We have a number of pilots as well as a number of series launched, Transparent, you mentioned, is one of them. It's gotten very good reviews. The streaming on that series has been great. So we're very excited about it. And we think it's an interesting area for customers. We continue to invest heavily in video content, including originals. And there's a number of different metrics we're looking at, certainly from a Prime standpoint. But we are seeing so far is we -- those customers who are streaming are renewing at considerably higher rates, at a rate that's already high. So it's -- we like what we see there. When customers come in for new trials and free trials, and they engage from a video content standpoint, we see the conversion being higher, so we see that we're adding new Prime members as a result of that. And when those Prime members -- when those new Prime members become Prime members, the other thing we're seeing is they're buying physical product, which is a great impact for us. We see very similar patterns in terms of how much physical product that they're purchasing from us. And so we're still certainly in investment mode there, but we like what we see and we have a long way to go there. But we're concentrating on building a great service, and we see that customers are rewarding us with engagement on the content, both original and licensed. And they're buying more from us on the physical side and becoming Prime members when they do and renewing at high rates. So those are the -- some of the early signs and we'll continue to monitor it very closely. But we're excited about what we're seeing there. In terms of some of the international comments, and I would say this for not just international, but I'd say it for the U.S. as well. One thing that's not new is it's a very competitive environment. We have a lot of competitors, both online and offline. That's not anything that's new. We're used to operating in that environment. We've been in that environment for, really, for 19 years. And so but we are seeing a lot of competition, and again, that's not new.",428

Was wondering if you could give us a sense of what you've seen so far this quarter? And then, in the highlights section of the release, the first 6 bullet points or so that you have there are all related to the hardware side of the business. If you can just sort of give us, now that you have a little bit more time on the hardware side of the business behind you, if you can give us a sense of what you're learning in this category and where you think Amazon's long-term position in hardware is ultimately going to be?",115

From a usage standpoint, it's very similar to Q2, close to 90%. And so the team's doing just a fantastic job. You can see our other revenue in North America went up a little bit sequentially. And AWS is certainly the largest piece of that and it's the vast majority of it, and they're growing at a faster rate than that other line item. So again, the team's doing a fantastic job not only serving customers, but launching many, many new features and services. And you can see some of the detail on that in the highlights section of our release today. So we're very excited about it. In terms of devices, I can't speculate what we would do going forward, but we just launched a number of new tablets and e-readers that we're excited about. And there's some really great price points for customers on the tablet side. We also launched the kids tablet, which is the first time we've launched. We've launched the new Kindles, including our premium Kindle and it's a terrific product. We think it's the best Kindle we've made to date for sure. So we're very excited about that. And we're excited to have these offerings for customers.",219

And so that's the way we're thinking about it, and I apologize, I can't give you any more certainty in terms of timing, but certainly, that's the way we're thinking about it.

But when you look forward to Q4, looks like you're guiding to about 15% to 16% growth x FX, and again, profits maybe below some expectations. Is the phone having an impact on profits in Q4 as well? And also, when you think about the Q4 guidance, are there any events or things you want to call out, or are you being especially conservative in Q4, given recent trends? Anything different this year in the holiday?",96

In terms of the holiday season, Justin, if you look back the last several years, I've been giving wide ranges because it's, again, our most seasonal quarter, always challenging to predict precisely where we're going to be. So in terms of a dollar range, I gave a $3 billion range last year, I'm giving a $3 billion range again this year from a revenue perspective. Again wide range. At the higher end of the range, excluding foreign exchange, it's approximately 21%, so it's a little bit higher than what we saw in Q3. And then you can see we are on the low end of the range. In terms of -- but in terms of the season itself, we're very excited about it. And in terms of -- to serve customers, we feel great about the selection that we have added and are continuing to add for the holiday season. We think, from an operations standpoint, each year we try to get better, and we believe that we'll be even better this year than we have in previous years. And so we're super excited to serve customers. In terms of the phone, the only other thing that I can comment on is at the end of the -- at the end of Q3, we had approximately $83 million worth of inventory on hand. And so I can't comment on how that would impact guidance or not, but that's the amount of inventory we had on hand at the end of Q3.",252

And then on, as I mentioned earlier, in the U.S., we'll have 15 sort centers by the end of -- more than 14 -- more than 15 sort centers by the end of the year. In terms of -- sorry, the other part of the question was on Fresh? The team's doing a great job from a customer experience standpoint. As you can see, we're in a few cities today. The team is just heads-down focused on making sure that experience is great for customers. We continue -- customers like the service, so we're seeing good pickup there.

In terms of what we do going forward, I certainly wouldn't speculate, we had a price point since our initiation of -- since the launch of Prime at $79 and so it took us a long time, and we're very careful with that to increase it to $99. But since we've increased to $99, we've had great retention. We're very pleased with the retention we've had from customers. The program is growing very fast. We're very excited about it, and so we do think it's really good for customers and it's really good for us and shareowners over the long term. You're correct in that we're investing in Prime in a number of different ways, including video content, as I talked about earlier. That is certainly the way we'll get a return on that investment principally will be customers buying more, including and especially physical products. So again, we're very excited about Prime globally.",155

The first one, so fulfillment x stock-based comp was the highest it's ever been as a percentage of gross profit in the third quarter. Can you just talk to the drivers of that? Is that sortation centers or international growth? What's driving that? And then, as we think about the sortation centers, what's the impact of those over the next few quarters to fulfillment? Are they -- do they take a while to kind of get the inefficiencies out of the system, like a standard DC would?",91

We added -- we'll have over 15 sort centers at the end of the year. Certainly, one of the drivers for that is certainly the growth that we're experiencing. But in addition to that, what we're seeing is the FBA adoption continues to get better. We get further penetrated with sellers adopting filled by Amazon. We think that's really good for sellers and for us and for customers over the long term. And what you're seeing is we're -- several years ago, in terms of fulfillment center planning, we were adding less of them, and it was much closer to the holiday season, with the sheer amount of capacity that we're adding, you're seeing more of that come in even before Q4. So you're seeing that impacting us earlier. And the benefit of coming in earlier is we get to serve customers, get up to the productivity rates that we want to, to serve customers in Q4 by having that capacity in a bit earlier than in past. So you've seen that trend happen over the past few years, where that's coming in earlier than, certainly, historically we've been able to do.",210

But in terms of the Prime referral fee, no, you should not read into that, that Prime isn't growing well. In fact, just the opposite.

Sellers are -- we're doing, we think, a great job for sellers. We continue to add a lot of unique selection throughout the year, in terms of -- in behalf of customers, we see FBA for sellers getting further, further penetrated.
