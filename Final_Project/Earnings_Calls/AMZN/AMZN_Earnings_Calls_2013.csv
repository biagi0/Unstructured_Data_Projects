18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2013",2013-01-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2214.0,406567.0,19192454.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 7% to $4.18 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 81% to $395 million. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $3.79 billion. This amount includes $1.4 billion in purchases of our previously leased corporate office space, as well as property for development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle, Washington, which we purchased in the fourth quarter. 
The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, consisting of investing in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. 
Return on invested capital was 4%, down from 22%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 470 million shares compared with 468 million shares 1 year ago. 
Worldwide revenue grew 22% to $21.27 billion or 23%, excluding the $178 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. 
Media revenue increased to $6.51 billion, up 8% or 10%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $13.93 billion, up 28% or 29% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 65% of worldwide sales, up from 63%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 32%. Active customer accounts exceeded 200 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 39% of paid units. 
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $16.14 billion or 75.9% of revenue compared with 79.3%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $4.45 billion or 20.9% of sales, up approximately 293 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.2 billion or 10.3% of revenue compared with 9.3%. Tech and content was $1.22 billion or 5.7% of revenue compared with 4.5%. Marketing was $833 million or 3.9% of revenue compared with 3.3%. 
Now I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 23% to $12.17 billion. Media revenue grew 13% to $2.9 billion. EGM revenue grew 24% to $8.5 billion, representing 70% of North America revenues, up from 69%. North America segment operating income increased 114% to $608 million, a 5% operating margin. 
In the International segment, revenue grew 21% to $9.09 billion. Adjusting for the $183 million year-over-year unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, revenue growth was 23%. Media revenue grew 5% to $3.61 billion or 7%, excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 35% to $5.43 billion or 37%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 60% of international revenues, up from 54%. 
International segment operating income decreased 61% to $70 million, a 0.8% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, International segment operating income decreased 56%. CSOI increased 47% to $678 million or 3.2% of revenue, up approximately 54 basis points year-over-year. 
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income increased 56% to $405 million or 1.9% of net sales. 
Our income tax expense was $194 million in Q4, resulting in a 58% rate for the quarter and a 79% rate for the full year 2012. GAAP net income was $97 million or $0.21 per diluted share compared with $177 million and $0.38 per diluted share. 
Now I'll discuss the full year results. Revenue grew 27% to $61.09 billion. North America revenue grew 30% to $34.81 billion, and International revenue grew 23% to $26.28 billion or a 27% growth, excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income or CSOI increased 6% to $1.67 billion or 7%, excluding the unfavorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. And operating margin decreased 54 basis points to 0.7%. GAAP operating income decreased 22% to $676 million or 1.1% of net sales. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash from marketable securities increased $1.87 billion year-over-year to $11.45 billion. Inventory increased 21% to $6.03 billion and inventory turns were 9.3, down from 10.3 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 20% to $13.32 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 76 from 74 in the prior year. 
In Q4 2012, we issued $3 billion of senior nonconvertible unsecured debt in 3-, 5- and 7-year tranches, with proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes. 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into the guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and, therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material impact on guidance. 
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments or settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. 
For Q1 2013, we expect net sales of between $15.0 billion and $16.6 billion or growth between 14% and 26%. This guidance anticipates approximately 122 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $285 million loss and $65 million positive income compared to $192 million of income in the prior period year. This includes approximately $285 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other expense, to be between $0 and $350 million compared to $398 million income in the prior period. 
We remain head-sound focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. 
Thanks. With that, Sean, let's move to questions.",1070

Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?",25

And so the question is, is this something that we should expect to continue now on the back of this meaningful fulfillment center expansion ramp? And then separately but on the same topic, we're also wondering, are there other parts of the business in which you can make this transition to more of a fixed cost in the future?",104

And you're seeing that reflected in our transportation costs. You can obviously see the fulfillment expense is certainly not fixed in terms of -- in absolute terms. But you can see that we had the 20 fulfillment centers last year, and that's reflected in the operating expense that you're seeing. But that is a benefit of adding to our fulfillment center network. We move closer and closer to our customers with a lot of great selection. And so you're seeing that reflected in the individual business gross margins, which shows up as benefits of transportation cost. In terms of other opportunities, certainly, there are a number of opportunities as we invest in individual customer experience areas across the business, many of those would be on our website. We have a relatively fixed expense as we've launched those, and we're able to amortize those costs over our full customer base. So as they grow and become more effective on a per unit or per customer base. So there is a number of opportunities that we have had and will have going forward to do that.",217

Our overall unit growth rate for the quarter in total was 32%, and our third-party growth rate was in excess of 40%. So again, nice growth. It is -- you're certainly seeing it in a number of areas. You see it certainly in our EGM business. If you look at our North America growth rates, you can see that our revenue was up 23%, but our third-party -- our total unit growth rate was substantially faster than that. And our third-party units were growing very fast there as well. So there's a number of different areas that you're seeing that, but certainly you're seeing it there.",141

That paid unit growth deceleration to 32%, it seems a bit of a disconnect versus an active customer growth that didn't decelerate as much on a per customer basis. Are you seeing some sort of change in overall activity? Is that the impact of newer international markets? And then just on the investment cycle, the last couple of calls, you've consistently called out future investments, whether the $1.4 billion for Seattle or distribution center expansion. You didn't do it this quarter. I don't want to overread into it, but does that mean that we're at the end of a major investment cycle?",105

We did see very strong -- we saw substantially high unit growth and revenue growth in terms of paid unit growth in Q4, which we're seeing very strong third-party growth as well, was up over 40%. In terms of investment cycle, yes, I wouldn't read into anything related to that. We will still be adding capacity during 2013 in terms of the levels of how much we'll add.

Obviously, the sales tax issue has been one that's come up a good bit. But here, you've touched on the impact of being closer with faster delivery in those same states. Net-net, what do you see as being the impact on -- I'm not asking you to give us a kind of state-by-state breakdown, but the impact of rolling out the fulfillment center footprint, taking both of those things into account?",99

I mean, we certainly have expanded pretty dramatically over the past, really coming out of 2009. So between, 2010, '11 and '12, we've rapidly increased our footprint globally. Your comment was more directed towards the U.S., but we've also rapidly increased our footprint in the U.S. As a result of that, we're able to carry selection, a much broader selection, closer to customers just with the -- as you would expect with this rapid increase. We've also expanded selection during that time period. So we continue to be in the locations we'd like to be in, and we'll continue to expand our footprint over time and become even closer and closer to customers. Beyond that, there's not a lot I can add.",133

Eugene Munster,,Analysts,20,"From a high level, can you remind us the margin difference between 1P and 3P? I know in the past, you've talked about you being agnostic between the 2, but the growth in 3P and what your CSOI margins would imply that 3P adds a little bit higher margin. Is that the correct read-through?",54

That's certainly how we run the business. Again, this is on a third-party versus a retail. And then we've always also added certainly a lot of other services over the past year in terms of fulfillment. So it really depends upon where we are in the investment cycle, what our utilization is. As you know, certainly as you look at the last few years, we've been very heavily expanding in terms of fulfillment capacity because of the growth that we've been experiencing. That certainly would put pressure on our overall cost structure certainly as -- on a per unit basis because we're not getting the productivity. We don't get the full productivity for a number of years after expanding. So depending on what type of customer is, whether it's a retail unit, a straight third-party unit or an FPA unit. But again, we're certainly attempting at least on a product basis to be roughly agnostic.",180

But I think one thing certainly to look at that doesn't give you an attach rate but it gives you at least a sense of the health of the business is the number that was in the release today. We show we have a multibillion dollar e-book business growing, approximately 70% year-over-year. That's the total year last year, and that's growing at that rate after a -- it's really just launching the business approximately 5 years ago. So it's a pretty good, healthy growth rate 5 years in. And we're seeing good, I can't give you specific numbers, but we've seen very good progress on a number of our other digital media categories. Video, I talked about a little bit earlier. We're seeing Prime customers. Certainly, the percentage of Prime customers who were watching free content through Prime Instant Video has gone up dramatically year-over-year. We've also increased Prime membership dramatically year-over-year. They were also purchasing paid content. Those customers that are using the service, they watch free but they're also paying for new content which is great. We've launched a number of new services on the music side, most recently, certainly, our CD with free MP3, which we have on many titles. It's still very early, but we certainly like that service and pleased to offer it to customers. So I can't give you specific for attach rates but the business is making good progress on the video content side. And again, it's still very early.",262

As you guys build out the Prime membership and the SKUs available through FBA, you run into the challenge of increasing your unit volume of tail items. And at the same time, you need to get products to customers in much shorter shipping cycles. So can you talk about how the new fulfillment footprint helps on that front? Is your reliance on air going down as a percent of total items shipped? And then if I remember correctly, you guys reclassified some FBA revenue in early 2012. Can you just remind us how that flows through the shipping revenue line and what could happen as you comp that in the beginning of '13?",117

Just in terms of overall selection, as we added to Prime, what I was talking about earlier in terms of having a -- just a more expanded footprint is there's no question that's helping us add additional selection more economically to Prime. And so that's both in terms of third-party selection as well as retail selection. And so that's something that we continue to have the benefit of as we get more and more members of Prime and have a bigger and bigger concentration of 2-day shipping in the U.S. for that. So we did add the shipping portion of FBA fees in Q1 of 2012, and we see some benefit year-over-year. But we're still seeing leverage in terms of our x the FBA fees, quite a bit of leverage there. So we don't have the specific number for you there, but we're still seeing quite a bit of leverage there x that re-class that you're referring to.",159

Any reasons why revenues were kind of in the lower half this quarter? And then if you look at gross profit growth, it clearly has accelerated to 40% growth but unit growth decelerated to 32%. Can you describe what's driving that kind of accelerating gross profit in the face of lower unit growth? And is it possible maybe you're letting the third parties handle some of the maybe less profitable categories for Amazon? Can you talk about that at all?",105

In terms of some of the things that we saw, we -- again, there's -- we saw solid growth across many different categories and geographies year-over-year. Certainly, some things to call out in terms of things that may have been a little bit softer. A few examples would be, we did see some of the higher average selling price items, particularly the items that are created in $1,000 a little bit softer. A few of the consumer electronics subcategories, like TVs, MP3 players, digital cameras, to some extent, were softer. But again, with the base that we have in Q4, still very solid growth. Another one, we certainly -- we're thrilled to have Paperwhite in our lineup. It's certainly the best e-reader and that's out there. And we're very pleased with it, but we couldn't keep up with the demand. We would have had more sales in Q4 if we were able to keep up with demand. And so the team is working very hard to make sure we have good in-stock going forward on that product, but we certainly could have sold more in Q4.",225

We have a long-standing practice of not talking about trends within the quarter and -- but in terms of year-over-year growth or anything like that. Obviously, the Q4 is very seasonal. December is by far the largest month, followed by November. But in terms of individual growth rates, I don't have a lot of comments there. In terms of international, yes, there certainly are geographies that we're investing in heavily. Certainly, China would be one.

In Q4, international declines is 260 basis points. So my question is should we read this as a beginning of a trend that we saw how international -- how domestic margins increased over the last 4 quarters, whether international should follow a similar route over the next foreseeable future?",101

But in terms of the difference between the 2, keep in mind, that a couple of factors: one, mix of business is a little bit different. Our AWS business is in the North America segment. You also have some newer geographies or geographies, I shouldn't say, that are necessarily newer but geographies that we're investing in heavily, that have a longer-term horizon for returns, so the ones I mentioned earlier.

18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2013",2013-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2156.0,448260.0,20979468.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 39% to $4.25 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 85% to $177 million. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.07 billion. This amount includes $1.4 billion in purchases of our previously leased corporate office space, as well as property for development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle, Washington, which we purchased in the fourth quarter of 2012.
The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, consisting of investments in technology, infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
Return on invested capital was 1%, down from 12%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 471 million shares compared with 464 million 1 year ago.
Worldwide revenue grew 22% to $16.07 billion or 24% excluding the $302 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers.
Media revenue increased to $5.06 billion, up 7% or 10% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $10.21 billion, up 28% or 30% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 64% of worldwide sales, up from 60%.
Worldwide paid unit growth was 30%. Active customer accounts exceeded 209 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 40% of paid units.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $11.8 billion or 73.4% of revenue compared with 76.1%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $3.83 billion or 23.8% of sales, up approximately 289 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.74 billion or 10.8% of revenue compared with 9.5%. Tech and content was $1.26 billion or 7.9% of revenue compared with 6.5%. Marketing was $616 million or 3.8% of revenue compared with 3.6%.
Now we'll talk about our segment results and, consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments, our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 26% to $9.39 billion. Media revenue grew 14% to $2.51 billion. EGM revenue grew 28% to $6.13 billion, representing 65% of North America revenues, up from 64%. North America segment operating income increased 31% to $457 million, a 4.9% operating margin.
In the International segment, revenue grew 16% to $6.68 billion. Adjusting for the $301 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 21%. Media revenue grew 1% to $2.54 billion or 7% excluding foreign exchange, and EGM revenue grew 28% to $4.09 billion or 32% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 61% of international revenues, up from 56%.
International segment operating loss was $16 million, a 0.2% negative operating margin compared with income of $49 million. CSOI increased 11% to $441 million or 2.7% of revenue, down approximately 27 basis points year-over-year. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 6% to $181 million or 1.1% of net sales.
Our income tax benefit was $80 million and includes $46 million of discrete tax benefits, primarily resulting from the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research and development credit that was enacted in January 2013. GAAP net income was $82 million or $0.18 per diluted share compared with $130 million and $0.28 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash from marketable securities increased $2.18 billion year-over-year to $7.89 billion. Inventory increased 27% to $5.4 billion, and inventory turns were 9.5, down from 10.4 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 29% to $8.92 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 68 from 62 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and, therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance.
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments or settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q2 2013, we expect net sales of between $14.5 billion and $16.2 billion or growth of between 13% and 26%. This guidance anticipates approximately 275 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates; GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $340 million loss and $10 million income compared to $107 million income in the prior year period. This includes approximately $340 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between 0 and $350 million compared to $360 million in the prior year period.
We remain heads-down-focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks. With that, Sean, let's move to questions.",961

I understand that AWS is mostly booked in the U.S., so that's a piece of the delta. But you've talked in the past quarters about the investments international driving margin to at least breakeven levels in international. I was wondering if you can just talk through the deceleration in the revenue growth in those markets and whether that's comp-related, Europe, macro or otherwise? And then secondly, in the shipping cost on a net basis is again leveraging. I think that's the second consecutive quarter. I just wonder if you could refresh us in terms of when the accounting change occurred in terms of the shipping revenue calculation for FBA to just -- to understand if that's an organic number now.",146

In terms of your question international, we're seeing still very solid growth, 21% on a local currency basis. As you've read, certainly, there's some softness from a macro standpoint that others are seeing. Hard to know whether that's impacting us and how much. We're not a bellwether for the economy, but we're very pleased with the growth that we're seeing. Again, 21% on local currency basis unit growth is actually growing substantially faster than that. So again, that's what we're seeing. In terms of investing, you're absolutely right. We're investing in a number of geographies, including certainly China. We've been investing for several years, we continue to invest there. We think it's a great long-term opportunity, but we're in investment mode.

Last quarter, I think you talked about consumer electronics at the high end, are there any particular categories there you would want to call out as maybe driving that low -- that could produce the low end of the range outside of negative FX?",125

We give -- as we've been consistently doing, we're giving a wide range. We think that's appropriate given all the factors, that's not something new that we're doing. That's something that we have been doing for some time. And you're right, the growth rate guidance for Q2 is 13% to 26%. Certainly, foreign exchange having an impact, that includes approximately 275 basis points of foreign exchange, so it's approximately 16% to 29% on a local currency basis. So again, it's a wide range, and there's probably not a lot to add there but it takes into account all the things that we think we need to take into account as we give guidance. And in terms of the absolute dollar range, it's very similar to what we would have in terms of the dollar range we would have given for Q1. I think it's maybe a $100 million difference in terms of the absolute value of that range that we gave. So again, a wide range, we think that, that's appropriate.",172

It compares to approximately 49% of -- in Q1 of last year, so it's certainly -- we're certainly overlapping a pretty strong growth last Q1. In terms of the physical and digital, certainly, one thing that we're seeing is certainly digital is growing at a much faster rate. And where you do see that a little bit is in our third-party units as a percentage of total units. You'll see that, that's approximately 40% this quarter. That compares to last year, up about approximately 100 basis points. But what we are seeing is because the digital units are growing at a faster rate and they're mostly first-party, you're seeing that number impacted our -- that percentage, as a percentage of our total, is not growing as fast as it has the last few quarters. And again, that's largely driven by the digital units growth that you're seeing. So again, that's -- if you were to back out, for example, and just look at our physical units, our physical units as a percentage of total units this year versus last year is up over 300 basis points. Yes, again, that's 3P growth as a percentage of total units.",224

It's certainly one of our digital offerings, and we have a number of different -- a few different services. We have certainly content that we're using as part of our Prime offer, that we have a lot of free content for customers. We think that's a great service for customers, along with our express shipping offers, as well as other content that we have free. For example, our Kindle owners Lending Library for books. So again, we think it's a great -- Prime's a great value for customers and it's part of that value proposition.

In terms of the ecosystem, you're certainly seeing that in our results that you see today. For example, if you look at our Media growth, we're certainly -- that ecosystem is more penetrated there than it is in international, and you see that reflected in those associated growth rates. Another way you see it is if you take a look at our top 10 best-selling items worldwide in Q1, the top 10 are all either digital or Kindle-related. Paperwhite is our best-selling product worldwide. But again, all 10 spots in the Q1 were either Kindle or digital items. And I believe that, that's the first time that we've seen that. We've been looking at that from a quarter results standpoint for some period of time, and we've had various levels of the top 10, but I think this may be the first quarter we've had all top 10 being either Kindle-related or digital-related.

We certainly see adoption of the service in terms of free content, but those same customers are purchasing content as well. And so there is a good attachment to it, which we like. And what we see Prime members doing not just within video content but we see them doing a lot of cross shopping, so it's not surprising. We see them do -- maybe a customer comes and has been traditionally purchasing the pre-Prime in a few categories. We find that they do a lot more cross shopping. Same thing with digital content. As they use the service, they might start with free content and then they will also continue to view and stream free content but also purchase paid content.

Our ecosystem isn't as developed, I would say, as it is in the U.S. And so when you compare the 2 geographies for a second, that's one of the more meaningful differences that you see between the 2. As you see that both are growing digital content very fast, it's just the ecosystem is more built out in North America. But again, certainly, we see very positive signs, but given the growth that we're experiencing in international, it's just on a lower base, so that's again to be helpful there. In terms of the unit growth, we said that our overall unit growth was 30% for the quarter.

18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2013",2013-07-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2533.0,490099.0,22647607.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 41% to $4.53 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 76% to $265 million. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.27 billion. This amount includes $1.4 billion in purchases of our previously leased corporate office space, as well as property for development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle, Washington, which we purchased in the fourth quarter of 2012. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, consisting of investments in technology, infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
Return on invested capital was 2%, down from 11%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 474 million shares compared with 468 million shares.
Worldwide revenue grew 22% to $15.7 billion or 25% excluding the $392 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers.
Media revenue increased to $4.4 billion, up 7%, or 11% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $10.42 billion, up 28% or 30% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 66% of worldwide sales, up from 64%.
Worldwide paid unit growth was 29%. Active customer accounts exceeded 215 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 40% of paid units.
Now we'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $11.21 billion or 71.4% of revenue compared with 73.9%. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content, and G&A combined was $4.09 billion or 26% of sales, up approximately 275 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.76 billion or 11.2% of revenue compared with 10.1%. Tech and content was $1.43 billion or 9.1% of revenue compared with 7.6%. Marketing was $651 million or 4.1% of revenue, consistent with the prior period.
Now we'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments, our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 30% to $9.49 billion. Media revenue grew 16% to $2.17 billion. EGM revenue grew 31% to $6.48 billion, representing 68% of North America revenues, up from 67%. North America segment operating income increased 19% to $409 million, a 4.3% operating margin.
In the International segment, revenue grew 13% to $6.21 billion. Adjusting for the $391 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 20%. Media revenue decreased 1% to $2.22 billion, or grew 7% excluding foreign exchange. In EGM, revenue grew 22% to $3.94 billion, or 29% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 63% of International revenues, up from 59%.
International segment operating income was 0, down from $16 million in the prior-year period. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, International segment operating income increased 11%.
CSOI increased 14% to $409 million or 2.6% of revenue, down approximately 20 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 19%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 26% to $79 million or 0.5% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $13 million. GAAP net loss was $7 million or $0.02 per diluted share compared with net income of $7 million and $0.01 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $2.49 billion year-over-year to $7.46 billion. Inventory increased 24% to $5.42 billion, and inventory turns were 9.4, down from 10.1 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 27% to $8.99 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 73 from 68 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date, and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements; record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates; and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q3 2013, we expect net sales of between $15.45 billion and $17.15 billion or growth between 12% and 24%. This guidance anticipates approximately 300 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating loss to be between $440 million and $65 million compared to $28 million in third quarter 2012. This includes approximately $340 million of stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between a $100 million loss and $275 million in income compared to $232 million of income in third quarter 2012.
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks, and with that, Sean, let's move to questions.",961

We did a number of -- the team's done a great job inventing on behalf of customers. It's a very good customer experience. The challenge that we've had over the past several years is how to make it economically viable. And so that's -- the team's done a lot of different experiments and invented well on behalf of customers to see what works. And we took a lot of that knowledge, which enabled us to launch Fresh in L.A. And it's very early there, still in the trial period. It's a good customer experience, and we like what we see so far, but it's very, very early. And so it's something that we'll continue to work on and -- both from a customer experience and from an economic standpoint.

One thing to keep in mind though is our digital units are growing at a faster rate than physical, and those digital units are primarily first-party units. So if you take out digital units out in both periods, we're actually up approximately 300 basis points. So our physical seller business is growing very nicely.

It's still early. As we did in prior -- last few years, we gave you updates kind of as we went along, and so we can update you a little bit later in the year to see how that progresses. But we certainly are adding new capacity, and that's reflected in the guidance that you see in Q3 as we get ready for our Q4 seasonal quarter. In terms of growth in International media, what you're seeing there is, on local currency growth basis, you see a 7% growth. That's consistent with what you've seen in the last couple of quarters. We're at the very early stages. We're excited about what we're seeing so far in digital, but we're in that early stage of transformation from digital -- from physical to digital within International. And so you see from the release that we've launched a lot of new things related to digital over the past 90 days, and even prior to that. So we're very excited about those launches and excited about the transformation. We're also excited, if you look at our total International business, we've got a lot of opportunities to invest in. I talked about the conversion from physical to digital. We also have selections still to add within existing categories, new categories, new geographies.

We have a good customer experience there. We continue to look at ways to make that even better. We're adding selection across many categories right now. It's in a very interesting geography. And so we'll continue to work on that experience for customers. You should expect us to be in investment mode for some time, and -- but it's a very sizable segment, a very interesting long-term growth opportunity, and we'll continue to work on making that better for customers and for investors over time. In terms of AWS, the business is growing very, very strongly. We've got a great team that's innovating on behalf of customers, launching new services, becoming more productive, which allows us to be able to lower prices. We've had many price reductions since we started with AWS, and we share that very visibly. And so we're very excited about that business.

In terms of the way we're looking at them, certainly, is based on the free cash flow potential, and we have a -- we're in some really interesting great businesses that have a lot of potential from a free cash flow generation standpoint, with good and high ROICs, which is exciting. From a margin standpoint, always challenging to predict where that will come out in terms of absolute numbers. But what we will do is we want to make sure that we try to maximize free cash flow. That's something that we've always said. So our strategy hasn't changed. Our outlook hasn't changed in that regard. Frequently, we'd be asked historically, is double-digit operating margins possible? And I still think it's possible. But also, if it means -- if a good high single-digit operating margin gets us to better, higher free cash flow over time, that's fine, too. So again, our goal is to -- we don't focus on individual margins. Our goal is to make sure that we generate free cash flow, large amounts of free cash flow and use that capital efficiently. So those are goals that we have, and we certainly think that the opportunity is there in each of the businesses that we operate in.",210

In terms of the Prime, we recognize it over the life of the subscription. And then in terms of third party versus first party, certainly, we have had some shift within digital media. But again, digital media is primarily a first-party business and happens to be one portion of our business. But you're absolutely right. And in terms of our third-party business, which from a unit perspective is 40% of our total units this quarter, we recognize the share of that revenue, the rev share, if you will, as revenue. Whereas the other parts of our business, largely, we're recognizing that as first-party revenue. And so we're recognizing the full amount of the revenue in the current period.",119

So we're very happy to serve customers in Spain, and we'll continue to -- as we've done in other geographies, that we'll continue to serve customers and continue to expand selection and get service levels even better over time, and so very excited about that. In terms of Brazil, we do have a Kindle store, and we have devices at physical retailers. So from a Kindle perspective, that's what we're doing in Brazil.",113

We saw an acceleration in both North America media as well as North America EGM. Within EGM, it was very broad in terms of growth. We saw very strong growth across many different categories, and so very pleased with that. I called out a couple that were notable in terms of apparel, as well as in consumables. Certainly, those are getting larger and still growing very fast, which is why I've called those out. In terms of competitiveness, it's been -- it's very competitive. It is today, it has been since our inception. We have many different competitors online. We have many competitors offline. As you go to your home or office, you pass our competitors every day. That's an environment we're used to dealing in. It's something that's not new. It's something that we see in all of our geographies across many different categories.",163

So I think on that one, you'll just have to stay tuned. But in terms of as we get closer and closer to customers with fulfillment, we have seen growth due to that, and it's manifested its way -- in a few different ways. But most notably, you see it in Prime. We've -- because of our fulfillment logistics capability, we've been able to offer Prime broadly. And we just have selection that's just closer and closer to customers. And if you look back over the last several years, there's been different reasons why we've grown the way we've grown, in terms of adding new selection and making sure that we have really sharp pricing. But certainly, Prime, which includes speed of delivery, has certainly been a notable -- has had a notable impact. And we're very pleased with the Prime program. Customers like it. We're adding -- we see very strong growth in Prime subscribers. We see very good retention of Prime members. So it's a great program for us and certainly, again, delivery speed is certainly impacting that program and our overall growth.",202

And because of where we are, we're further penetrated in North America, you're seeing a bigger impact on our growth rate than you are in International, and we certainly see that, but not a lot of other callouts there. But again, we're very pleased and certainly, customers are responding to many things, including selection and great prices and everything else within those digital offerings. But also, they're responding to unique selection that we have. And we -- if you take a look at our release, you'll see the specific numbers related to some of the exclusives we have and certainly, that's having an impact. So there's many, many different things that are working for us in that space as part of our overall ecosystem for digital that we're pleased with. In terms of our device plan, we're very pleased with the devices we have and to offer customers. We think we have a great offering, both in terms of Kindle and Kindle Fire.

One is, certainly, keep in mind that the infrastructure related to our very fast-growing web services business is included in tech and content. So certainly, as we ramp up that business and it's becoming more sizable and growing very fast, you're seeing that impacting that line item. We're also investing very heavily in digital, and that's across many different parts of our digital offerings there. That's also included any of the tech teams that are working on customer experience across Amazon as we grow. So as we support both our seller businesses and our retail businesses, they're included in that line item. So certainly, that's what you're seeing there. In terms of Fresh, we're not breaking out the financials, and -- but keep in mind that Fresh was designed as a pilot. And certainly, the economics have improved over time through invention on behalf of the team there, as well as operating efficiencies.

We're inventing. You see a lot of different inventions, both on the hardware side as well as on the software side from a device standpoint. You also see a lot of invention around the content side. And we think, for example, in our Prime Instant Video, which combines video and our Prime membership, is very compelling and we're investing heavily in content. It's still very early there, but we're finding that customers, certainly existing Prime members, are more and more streaming content. We're having new Prime members come to Amazon largely because of video in terms of one segment of that population that's coming -- for new Prime members is because of Prime Instant Video, and we can see that based on the free trials and the conversion of those free trials from -- related to Prime Instant Video. And so that's certainly one portion of our growth in Prime memberships which we find exciting. For us to be able to offer exclusive content on the book side is very interesting. So again, we're inventing a lot of different -- across a lot of different areas, and yes, there are a lot of different dynamics, but we think we're well suited for both device, software and content side of those businesses.",225

I'll begin with comments on our third quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 48% to $4.98 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 63% to $388 million. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.59 billion. This amount includes $1.4 billion in purchases of our previously leased corporate office space as well as property for our development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle, Washington, which we purchased in the fourth quarter of 2012. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of our continued business growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
Return on invested capital was 3%, down from 10%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 475 million shares compared with 469 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 24% to $17.09 billion or 26% excluding the $332 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates.
We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. Media revenue increased to $5.03 billion, up 9%, or 13% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $11.05 billion, up 29%, or 31% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 65% of worldwide sales, up from 62%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 29%. Active customer accounts exceeded 224 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 40% of paid units.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $12.37 billion or 72.3% of revenue compared with 74.7%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $4.46 billion or 26.1% of sales, up approximately 250 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.96 billion or 11.5% of revenue compared with 10.5%. Tech and content was $1.58 billion or 9.2% of revenue compared with 7.8%. Marketing was $671 million or 3.9% of revenue compared with 3.8%.
Now we'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 31% to $10.3 billion. Media revenue grew 18% to $2.61 billion. EGM revenue grew 33% to $6.73 billion, representing 65% of North America revenues, up from 64%. North America segment operating income increased 1% to $295 million, a 2.9% operating margin.
In the International segment, revenue grew 15% to $6.79 billion. Adjusting for the $327 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 20%. Media revenue increased 2% to $2.42 billion, or 9% excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 23% to $4.32 billion, or 28% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 64% of international revenues, up from 59%. International segment operating loss was $28 million, compared to a $59 million loss in the prior period.
Consolidated segment operating income increased 15% to $267 million or 1.6% of revenue, down approximately 10 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 18%.
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income or loss includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating loss was $25 million compared to a $28 million loss in the prior year period. Our income tax benefit was $12 million. GAAP net loss was $41 million or $0.09 per diluted share compared with net loss of $274 million or $0.60 per diluted share. The third quarter 2012 included a loss of $169 million or $0.37 per diluted share related to our equity-method share of loss as recorded by LivingSocial, primarily attributable to its impairment charge of certain assets, including goodwill.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $2.44 billion year-over-year to $7.69 billion. Inventory increased 20% to $6.07 billion, and inventory turns were 9.2, down from 9.7 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 20% to $10.04 billion and accounts payable days were 75, consistent with the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand. And therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances from foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements; record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates; and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q4 2013, we expect net sales of between $23.5 billion and $26.5 billion, a growth between 10% and 25%. This guidance anticipates approximately 125 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates; GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $500 million loss and $500 million in income compared to $405 million income in the fourth quarter of 2012. This includes approximately $350 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which excludes stock-based compensation and other expense, to be between a $150 million loss and $850 million income compared to $678 million income in the fourth quarter of 2012. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks, and with that, Sean, let's move to questions.",1003

And I believe, if you read it, it says it -- that happened in the last 90 days. I'm wondering if you ever commented on a time period like that before. And is that a normal run rate to add millions of Prime users in 90 days, or is there something special on this quarter that drove Prime?",74

I don't believe that we have. And in terms of beyond that, there's nothing more that I can add to that. But we are very excited. Prime is growing very fast, very excited for the service that we offer customers, both in terms of physical and digital goods. So it's exciting, and I'm certain that's why we put it in there today in the release.",77

First on the Kindle family, it seems like the timing of device launches, the e-book library size and local language content could be drivers of different levels of penetration of digital media in the U.S. relative to what you've been able to attain outside the U.S. to date. And I was wondering if there's anything else notable that you would highlight that helps explain the different dynamic that seems to be playing out within the media revenue line domestically versus international, and whether you think any of those issues are structural or they just work themselves out with the benefit of time and your execution. And then secondly, if you could talk a bit about how you think about the lifetime value of a non-Prime customer versus a Prime customer, and what the intended outcome may be as it relates to the increase in Super Saver pricing in the U.S. market.",155

In terms of content, both -- you're really referring to mostly e-book content, both growing very fast. The base is different, as you mentioned. We have a higher base in the U.S. just based on when we launched. So you're absolutely right, it's a -- you do see that difference in the media line between North America and international. And so it's just, again, both are growing very nicely right now in terms of digital Kindle books, in this case, as you referenced. But it's just different base and so we're excited about the opportunity that we have in both segments there. But we're further ahead right now in North America. And then could -- I'm sorry, could you repeat the second part of your question again?",143

In terms of the Prime customers, we've seen not only a very strong increase in Prime membership, but we've seen very good retention of Prime members. And so certainly, when you look at that in terms of lifetime value, we have a customer base that's certainly staying with us longer. They're doing more cross-shopping, and they're getting the benefits of Prime that we're offering, that we continue to add to. And then we still have a very good customer base that's non-Prime. The -- you mentioned the threshold change. We did change. We have different thresholds in various geographies around the world for Super Saver ship and our Super Saver delivery in those geographies. And in the case of the U.S., we've had the $25 threshold for over 10 years. And we changed to $35 and during this time frame, we've certainly increased our selection that's eligible for that by millions of items. And certainly, as you would know, during this rather lengthy time frame, transportation costs and fuel prices have changed significantly over that time period. So we have changed it, so we just thought that was the right thing to do.",194

I guess it's the second quarter in a row you've had acceleration. When I asked you about it last quarter, I think you singled out fashion apparel and consumer staples. But the growth is -- the acceleration really seems to be in line with easing comps. Is there something in there that to you indicates that you're getting real critical mass with your customers in those 2 particular categories? And then just real quickly on the Kiva robots, is there a reason you would call that out? Is there -- should that have some sort of a material impact over time on leverage in the fulfillment cost line?",118

In terms of our growth in EGM, you highlighted a couple of categories that are growing very nicely, that we mentioned last quarter as well, what you're seeing there, and actually, the growth is very broad. We've added a lot of unique selection, both our hardlines and softlines categories, including consumables and apparel, as you mentioned. The experience is getting better on the site. Unique selection has increased dramatically over the past few years. So there's just a number of things that are coming together in those categories. So when I look at it, it just seems very broad, which we like. And there's just a lot of new selection with great category expansion too over the last several years. So that's really what you're seeing there. In terms of Kiva, we have launched in a few FCs. We think it's an interesting opportunity. I think as I mentioned last quarter at this time, we're ahead of the schedule that we had set forth at the time, that we joined with Kiva. And we're excited with what we see. And certainly, we'll still be adding associates certainly over time in those FCs. But there certainly will be productivity with Kiva and we'll have to stay tuned to see what that looks like. But we're certainly excited about that opportunity in the rollout.",223

It's hovered around 20%, 30%, 40% range throughout the quarters of 2010, 2011. It's obviously been depressed over the past several 1.5 years due to investments. Maybe you can help us with the timing of when you expect ROIC to return to levels we saw in 2011. And second, you are investing a lot in video content for Prime Instant Video. Are there any hard numbers you can share in terms of conversions from the Kindle devices? And in the past, there have been talk about converting Prime Instant Video into a standalone product, maybe you could share your thoughts there.",110

Keep in mind, when the -- as you mentioned, we are investing very heavily on the business. We think that's the right thing to do. We have a lot of good long-term opportunities, which is why we're doing it. It is depressing ROIC. Just keep in mind that from a pure metrics standpoint, just as a reminder, the way we measure ROIC is free cash flow divided by average invested capital. So total assets minus current liabilities, and that's over a 5-point average. And so when you do that first in the numerator, we do have -- keep in mind, there's about $1.4 billion in our cash flow number that relates to the purchase, it goes back to Q4 last year but it's on our TTM free cash flow, that relates to the purchase of our campus here in Seattle and some nearby lands, so it's $1.4 billion of that. So that brings the free cash flow down. Also keep in mind, in the invested capital, we do include cash and marketable securities, which is certainly the largest piece of our invested capital. We think that's the right thing to do until we either deploy that capital or return it in some way. But just keep in mind that, that's included in the metric. So in terms of Prime Instant Video, we're getting great usage from a broad set of customers on Kindle as well as other devices, and the adoption is going very well. I apologize, I can't share any specific metrics today, but we like what we see. It certainly -- we think it's certainly helping the Prime numbers, the Prime membership increases that you're seeing. And it's -- we think it's interesting and we are investing there. We included it in both our Q3 results as well as the Q4 guidance, our assumptions around additional content that we'll be acquiring, including original content, so very excited about that opportunity.",323

But this year, it looks like it's -- you're growing at about 10 percentage points above the midpoint of your range. Is there anything that's different this year that is driving that? And then second question on pricing. There have been numerous reports recently, and I think there are for a while now, that the multichannel competitors are competing more fiercely with Amazon in terms of price parity, et cetera. What impact are you seeing or do you think you could see from that, and sort of how are you addressing it?",112

We're getting ready for an exciting holiday season. And that includes having to make sure that we have the right amount of employees as well as seasonal help during that period. It also includes making sure we have the right capacity in place, making sure we have the -- we've added a lot of selection over the past couple of years and particularly over the past 12 months, and making sure that we have good in-stock levels related to that selection. We're making sure that we have people to help us with not only serving customers with our retail inventory, but also Fulfilled by Amazon has grown certainly very strongly over the past year, and that impacts the capacity or the number of employees that you see there. So that's clearly what you're seeing in that number. In terms of pricing, we operate at a very competitive arena. That's not something that's new. That's something that we've been doing since our inception. We have many, many different competitors. You will pass those competitors on your way to work, on your way home. They are offline, they're offline, very competitive marketplace. It's something -- pricing is something we worked very hard at over the years. We want to make sure we have great values for customers. And it's something that we spend a lot of time on and work very hard to make sure that we can offer that to customers. So I wouldn't say that it's anything new. It's something that we've been dealing with since our inception, but it is a very competitive environment.",281

First, how do you see your competitive position versus Alibaba in China? And what gives you confidence that you have a chance of being a relevant player there even in the long term? And secondly, in the U.S., you have a service similar to subscription video on demand, that's a feature of Prime, which is Amazon Prime Video, while in Europe, you have a full-blown standalone service with LOVEFiLM. Why is your strategy in Europe so different from the strategy in the U.S. when it comes to video on demand?",93

There's certainly room for many winners. It's a very large segment. And we've seen -- we have a good business there in terms of top line, that's growing. And we continue to look for ways to make sure that we satisfy customer demand. We work on a lot of the same inputs that we work on in our other geographies, making sure we have great prices, good selection, speedy delivery. We worked very hard in terms of putting in a lot of capacity close to customers. And so those are the things that we work on to try to ensure our success there. In terms of individual competitors, we have a long-standing practice of not talking about other companies. But again, there's room for a lot of winners. And in terms of video content, there's not a lot I can add to that question, I apologize. But certainly, we have been ramping up our content in the U.S. on Amazon.com as part of Amazon Prime. It's something that we've been looking at very carefully. We like what we see so far, and we think it's interesting.

In terms of Q3 specifically, Q3, just because of the, as I would call it the Q4 readiness, the seasonal readiness, you see this often in Q3 where both our total and our segment operating profit is lower than other quarters. And that's certainly what you're seeing in Q3 in North America. So that's in terms of the investments we're making to get ready for the season. We talked about, you saw [ph] in Jeff's quote, the capacity that we're adding is certainly in multiple geographies. But certainly in the North America is impacting that as well. You can see it in our fulfillment line item as a percentage of revenue being up. You can see it in our tech and content. So we're certainly investing. The other part too that I mentioned earlier is we're investing in video content for Prime in the U.S., and you see that certainly in these results as well.",156

And so what that means is if you were to take that as a percentage of our total fulfillment centers, you'll certainly get a number that's less than the square footage that we're actually adding if we're adding square footage that would be significantly higher than that. In terms of lockers, it's early. It's another way to get closer to customers, to make it convenient for customers, and it's interesting. We have it in a few different geographies right now and -- but it is limited. We don't have it broadly across our full network. And so it's something that we are learning and it's an interesting experience. And it's certainly something that over time, we'll continue to take a closer look at and certainly expand if it makes sense to do so on behalf of customers.",180

First, Tom, can you give us some color on where you are on the shift from third party to first party e-books, and how much of a factor that's been in reaccelerating media revenue? We've seen a reacceleration in media the last 3 quarters, I think, in North America. And then secondly, it looks like there's 6 fewer shopping days this holiday season between Black Friday and Christmas. I'm just curious what you do, if anything, differently to prepare for that? And do you think that could actually even drive more holiday shopping online?",100

In terms of your second one, second question, there are fewer days. There's not a lot that we do different. We'll certainly see, when that happens, there is some behavioral differences on behalf of customers just because of the shorter time period, that we have certainly some more sizable days during that period. But there's not a lot to add to that. In terms of the transition for e-books, in terms of our total growth across Amazon, both North America total or global total, it's not a significant or a meaningful impact to the overall growth rate. And certainly, this transition's been going on for some number of quarters now. So there's not a lot I can help you with there.",122

I would look at it more from a turns perspective. And if you look at it more over an average turns basis, it has gone down. And the reason is unique selection. We keep having growth in unique selections. Certainly, it has increased over the past year. In-stock levels have gotten better. And so those are the things that are really driving it. In terms of end points for any particular quarter, they can be a little bit lumpy. But I would look to the turns.",87

First, is it a priority to offer 1-day or same-day delivery at some point? There are some competitors who are offering same-day delivery in large markets for certain brick-and-mortar retailers. And then secondly, can you talk about the prospects for the Login and Pay program. How many online merchants are signed up for it, and what is Amazon getting out of it, either economically and/or from getting -- maybe getting data out of the purchases?",77

As a result of that, we have selection that's, by default, increased amount of selection that's closer and closer to customers. As a result of that, our speed of delivery has improved. And certainly for Prime customers, depending upon the geography, in the case of the U.S., express, 2-day shipping for free. And then for small fees, you certainly can get it faster than that. That's something that -- so you've seen that improvement gradually over the past 10-plus years. You've seen it's certainly gotten even better the last few years as we've rapidly increased the number of fulfillment centers. So that's something that we think is important. And we'll continue to work on behalf of customers to give them those options and to make sure that they get the product when they want it. In terms of Login and Pay, it's something that we think is interesting. Because of our large customer base and the credentials that we have and the secure payments that we have, we think it's an interesting opportunity. And we think that there's certainly interesting ways to monetize that over time and -- but again, we think it's an interesting opportunity.",232

We have a few different models in India, and we -- from a -- we have a marketplace model which we offer, Fulfilled by Amazon, which as you mentioned, certainly the infrastructure is not as advanced as some geographies. But we also view that as an opportunity, and we're happy to help sellers with Fulfilled by Amazon. So it's an interesting opportunity. It's very, very early. We're in investment mode there. That's a long-term opportunity, but it's a very exciting opportunity. We have a very strong team that's working on that opportunity. So we are excited about it.",99

I'll take the second one first. In terms of AWS, it's growing very, very strong. It's an area that's very early for us. It's growing very, very strong. We have a great team that's working on it, servicing customers, and we're very excited with the long-term opportunity. In terms of you mentioned the trends in North America, what you've seen is really a nice, steady acceleration of growth since Q4 last year. So if you look back to Q4 last year, for North America specifically, and you just trace that back over the past 4 quarters, you see a really nice sequential increase from quarter to quarter. And again, that gets back to -- it went from 23% in Q4 last year to 26% to 30% and 31%. Those are the year-over-year increases by quarter for North America revenue, and so -- and a lot of it is what we talked about earlier, it's focused on a lot of the retail basics as well as also improving seller performance as well. And so those are the things that are driving it.",182

It was 31% growth. Again, we've seen a nice, steady increase over the past 4 quarters. That's overlapping a quarter from Q3 of last year. That was 33%. So again, we like what we see from a growth perspective in Q3 for North America. In terms of total growth, we're giving a wide range for Q4 and that reflects our view for Q4. But we're excited about the quarter and about getting ready for customers during this heavy seasonal quarter. So we're excited about what we see there. In terms of LivingSocial, there's really not a lot I can add to your question, I apologize. They're doing a good job in terms of local. We also have a local offering.
