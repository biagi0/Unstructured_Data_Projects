Joining us today to answer your questions are Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. 
Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 30, 2020, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. 
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. 
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. 
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.",328

Really appreciate this. Just on the AWS business, as you look sort of at the strength that you saw in the quarter, particularly represented by the amount of dollars added quarter-over-quarter, is there anything in particular that you would call out either in terms of specific types of workloads, regions, specific customer types that you felt like drove the strength, particularly relative to the directional -- direction of growth that we were seeing in the earlier parts of the year?",81

I think it's been pretty broad-based. And it's kind of the combination of a lot of work on adding new products and features, adding to our sales and marketing teams and having better penetration in enterprise customers and hitting a lot of varied and different industries. So I think that's what you're seeing. We feel that our product set is -- leads the market, and we add to it at a quicker pace than our competition. So actually, the gap on capacity and features is growing as we speak. 
We also think that there's a real network effect when you use AWS with the millions of active customers and tens of thousands of global partners. And we continue to expand. We're now in 69 availability zones across 22 geographic regions. So I think it's the combination of increased sales support, more and better products that hit customers' needs and also the geographic expansion is what you're seeing.",171

It was strong on a unit basis. But -- and as you said, there's probably additional strength in FBA, which has higher fee set than MFN does. So -- but in general, if you step away, I think what you're seeing is more and more participation of third-party sellers in our 1-day delivery program as we move through the year. That was particularly strong in Q4, and I think you'll see that more as we move into 2020.",101

Anything there that you'd really call out? And then on the AWS investments, obviously, you just talked about investments starting in 3Q. Where are you in that investment? Your margins are still below peak. Where are you kind of in that investment cycle?",66
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2020",2020-01-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2011.0,1899235.0,74490405.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,10,"Sure. Well, as I said, on revenue, we came in at $87.4 billion, which exceeded the high end of our range of $86.5 billion. $400 million of -- roughly $400 million of that was due to foreign exchange. But what we saw was essentially very strong holiday performance from the middle of November on. We also had a very big uptick in response to the 1-day availability that's been building through the year. 
I think Prime has been very strong. We have mentioned that we have more than 150 million paid Prime members globally now. And we mentioned that we have more people join Prime in Q4 than any other quarter before. So a lot of good momentum there built up on the aggregation of benefits that we continue to add to the Prime program, most recently the 1-day -- expansion of 1-day shipping. 
On AWS, where are we in the cycle? I talked more in 2018, when the margins in AWS were -- it's closer to 30%, about the efficiency of infrastructure spend and -- versus prior years. So we continue to -- since that point, we've continued to add infrastructure capability and -- to support our global expansion as well. But what you're seeing probably more in the margins is the expansion of our sales and marketing effort at some of those costs as well as price decreases and longer-term contracts that we've signed with some of our customers. You'll notice on our balance sheet that our future commitments on the multiyear deals now stands at $30 billion at year-end, and that's up 54% year-over-year. So there's a lot of good momentum on the enterprise side as well.",280

So maybe just talk about how you're reacting. You did talk about spending on sales and price cuts, but just any more you can talk about the competitive environment.",63
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2020",2020-01-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2011.0,1899235.0,74490408.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,13,"Sure. I would probably argue a bit with the growth comments. As we see it here, we grew from a $30 billion revenue run rate at the end of 2018 to a $40 billion revenue run rate at the end of 2019. So we continue to be happy with our top line growth. The -- in dollar terms as opposed to percentages, we had a larger dollar increase in revenue, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. So we're very happy with the progress of the revenue and our adoption and acceptance by customers. 
As far as competitive set is concerned, we -- again, we think that we have -- start with a very big lead in this space because of our many years of investment, not only in capacity but also in services and features that we provide to customers. We learn from customers. We just had a great re:Invent conference in December, where all of our -- it was a great aggregation of partners and customers and developers. And at those events, we not only get to present our new products, and there were over 100 in -- that were launched in December, but we also get to hear customer issues and help -- that helps sign our -- educate our forward road map. 
So it's a great shared learning. I think customers react to it. Customers will be at different stages of their adoption curve. There's always different phases: first, moving to the cloud, then organizing on the cloud and then growing further. So there's a lot of movement. I said that repeatedly, I think, in this setting, that any quarter -- quarter-to-quarter movement is going to be a little bumpy. But generally, what you're seeing is the convergence of a lot of investment, a lot of operational efficiency and a lot of innovation on behalf of customers.",308

I guess you guys called this out in your press release, but I'm wondering if you could talk about your efforts to get the SMBs and the micro SMBs online in India. What exactly is involved from a practical perspective? Do you need to have door-to-door sales folks? And what can you do to reduce friction between logistics, payments and some of the other factors there? And second, what are these SMBs selling? Is it like long-tail inventory? Is it merchandise that you can get to exports to global buyer base? And do you think this could be content that could be exclusive to Amazon?",114

Stephen, hey, this is Dave. Thanks for the question. As you said, I think as we mentioned this in the release, we're definitely continuing to improve the experience in India for customers and sellers, excited by some of the response we've seen. We are continuing to invest meaningfully in digitizing those, say, MSMBs, micro, small and medium-sized businesses. We did pledge to invest $1 billion to help digitize traders and those micro and small businesses across India. And we've got a goal of bringing more than 10 million online by 2025. So this $1 billion investment will help to enable $10 billion in cumulative Indian exports by 2025. 
A lot of different facets to those types of investments. I won't go into too much for specifics, but a lot of work being done there. We're also focused on job growth, job creation over there. Since we launched over in India in 2013, we've created over 700,000 direct and indirect jobs. So -- we also recently announced plans to create additional 1 million jobs in India by 2025. So a lot of, I think, innovation, ideas, investment. 
That team over there continues to do a great job locally of taking a lot of the tenets that we've had at Amazon around innovation building and really run with that over there and done a great job of coming up with some interesting and new services and features that I think are specific to that region. And hopefully, as we continue to do that, we'll keep identifying areas over in India and tool sets and features over in India that we can bring back to other regions to help benefit other sellers and the other websites more broadly.",286

Just the first one, Brian, I think on one of the media interviews, you talked about how you're becoming more efficient with 1-day and you continue -- with next-day delivery and continue to do so and talked about $1 billion of cost in that current quarter. Maybe just sort of talk to us about some of the largest qualitative fix in variable cost sort of still associated with 1-day and the processes and the opportunities for efficiency to really get that number down as we go throughout 2020. And then maybe any specific product categories or good categories where you've seen an acceleration in demand from 1-day that you'd call out?",114
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2020",2020-01-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2011.0,1899235.0,74490414.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,19,"Sure. Let me make sure the numbers are understood. We had talked about -- last year, about an initial step-up in cost of close to $800 million in the second quarter. We -- that carried into Q3, slightly higher in Q3. And then in Q4, last time we're on this call, I mentioned that we estimated Q4 would be $1.5 billion penalty, was slightly under that despite the higher volumes and revenue growth than is in our guidance. 
And looking ahead to Q1, we estimate approximately $1 billion of additional costs year-over-year. And again, in Q2, we'll start to lap this. And that doesn't mean the delta goes to 0. It means that there'll be a step-up as we grow and expand on a volume basis, and then we'll see where our rates are on actually delivering and fulfilling 1-day. So I will keep you posted on our results and guide in the future as to where we see those costs going. 
If you look at the efficiency or the -- first, the cost, they generally fall into a few buckets. It's obviously transportation, where you're building out new transportation modes, you're adding new deliveries, partners are adding new routes. Many times, they start with subscale volumes, and you build them out, you get more efficient, you get more volume, more package density. And that creates efficiency. 
When we started this, again, Q2 of last year, we also had an abrupt change to our fulfillment network in that when it's tuned for 2-day delivery, on the most part, and you move to 1-day, in a lot of cases, it's advantageous from a cost and transportation standpoint to have that inventory closer to the customer. So we've -- last year, we're in the middle of that transition. We still are, as we shift inventory to be more local, to enable local deliveries to hit shorter cutoff times. So that will continue to become more efficient. 
We do see a -- we look to scale our fulfillment center network further. We grew the square footage for fulfillment and transportation by 15% each of the last 2 years, and we look ahead and see a step-up in that this year as we start to build more capacity for the 1-day. I haven't guided beyond Q1, but that's certainly something that will step up. But we get efficiencies as we learn and grow and handle more 1-day volume.
The third area is foregone ship revenue, just simply because we're having free shipment and no longer charging for it. That, unfortunately, doesn't leverage, but it -- we do start to lap after a while. So I would say that -- just as we've had other shocks to our warehouse system over the years from going to -- from media to almost every product you can imagine, to having a cycle of increased third-party presence in the FBA program now to 1-day, we have a history here where we can look for opportunities to be more efficient and lower the -- any cost penalties as we move forward.",512

You noted that you begin to lap the beginning of the initiative here in the second quarter and that, naturally, costs can flow up with volumes. But just to be clear with you, is the idea here, as we anniversary at that sort of incremental expansion of 1-day shipping, either regionally or certain SKUs, is functionally finished? I just want to make sure I understand that properly. 
And then just -- we can see the other number reported. Just any color within there on the advertising business and, in particular, would love to hear an update just a bit on some of your brand initiatives there. I know that probably wasn't the focus in the holiday season, but it seems to be an important growing part.",134

Let me start on the 1-day. So yes, we do see expansion of the 1-day program as we move through the year. We've been expanding since we started this effort in Q2 of last year. Expansion means additional cities, additional routes, additional ZIP codes. But more -- I think what you'll see more in 2020 is also an -- more effort internationally, more costs internationally. We have greatly improved our selection of 1-day in -- particularly in Europe and Japan. We started with higher 1-day percentage of our shipments in those geographies, but we do have to take steps and are taking steps to increase that. And we expect that to be -- it's starting to be a little more balanced cost globally as we move into 2020.",129

Dan, in terms of your question around brands, we're focused on certainly brands as an advertising customer set and a lot of focus on providing the products and tools that are going to help customers and really inspire them. So things that we're really excited about our stores, so a brand can customize and curate a multipage store. It allows them to better tell customers who they are and share their story. So we can help deepen the brand engagement and the customer loyalty through that type of option. 
Some other things like posts, which helps customers discover products and brands. And it's through a curated feed that features the brand's lifestyle content, and it's on a mobile detail page. And there's international expansion in some other areas. I think, broadly, with advertising, so much of this is about having -- developing great relationships with these advertisers because I think they appreciate the fidelity we can provide around shopping outcomes. We're uniquely positioned to do this, given our retail business. 
On the advertising business -- I rather -- I should say, other revenue, that line item grew about 41% year-over-year. Advertising is the biggest piece of that. That line item is growing at about the same rate. Advertising revenue is, as a subset, been growing at about the same rate year-over-year in the fourth quarter than it did in the third quarter.",233

You called out the depreciation change with respect to AWS going forward. Just wanted to better understand some of the decisions that were made on useful life that drove that decision and how to think about that from a modeling perspective going forward. And then the second part would be, what does that mean in terms of the way you're thinking about forward CapEx cycles for the AWS business, if you're assuming useful life is moving out maybe than prior assumptions?",91

Thanks for bringing that up. So we, as a practice, monitor and review the useful life of our depreciable assets on a regular basis to make sure that our financial statements reflect our best estimate of how long the assets are going to be used in operations. In Q4 -- and we've been looking at it in both the FCs, fulfillment centers, and also AWS annually. As we look in Q4 of 2019, we believe it's -- there's enough trend now to show that the useful life is exceeding 4 years. We have been -- for servers, and we had been depreciating them over 3 years. So we are going to start depreciating them on a 4-year basis. It doesn't unwind any depreciation that's already been booked. It just takes the asset from its current status and extends the depreciation period, and then new assets will be put into play. It will extend out for 4 years instead of 3, and we'll continue to revisit this. 
I do want to point out it's not just an accounting-related change. It's rather a reflection of the work that we've done to make our server capacity last longer. We've been operating at scale for over 13 years in this business, and we continue to refine our software to run more efficiently on the hardware. It then lowers stress and extends the useful life, both through the servers that we used in the AWS business and also the servers that we use to support our own Amazon businesses. So -- and despite that, we give AWS customers and -- actually, because of this, AWS customers continue to get access to the latest technologies more quickly than ever before. 
So we are essentially reflecting the fact that we have gotten better at extending the useful life here and now building that into our financials moving forward. Yes, you're right, it should also impact our need and our timing of capital. I would say that it's also been part of the reason that we've been able to keep capital relatively under in check the last 2 years in the infrastructure area. But it's $800 -- excuse me, $800 million lower depreciation expense in the quarter, and it will be consistent. It will change quarter-to-quarter. We will update you. But as you can see in our financial statements, it's about $2.3 billion impact, Q2 of 2020.",400

And just kind of the modeling point, too, on that. The $800 million is in Q1. We do think that the -- for that accounting impact, effectively, we expect that, that amount will decrease as we go through the year. And it's tech infrastructure assets.

I mean it doesn't seem like much, just given the better results in online sales and retail third-party seller services. But is there any way to think about the 6 less days? And then also, you mentioned last quarter an impact from the Japanese consumption tax. Any sort of impact? Did that go according to plan? Or any thoughts there would be helpful.",101

First of all, on the -- there were 2 items we discussed last quarter with the Japan consumption tax, raising from 8% to 10% effective October 1. The net result was a pull forward of some purchases by Japanese customers into Q3 and also some negative elasticity effects post October 1. The other item was Diwali timing, the Indian holiday, which has a very large swing factor on international revenues, is -- it moved more into the third quarter this year versus -- in 2019 versus 2018. So it was a help to Q3 and a penalty to Q4. Those 2 items impacted the Q4 growth rate negatively by about 300 basis points. That was our estimate, and we believe that was the actual outcome.",126

The -- sorry, the first question was, oh, the holiday season. Yes. We don't see that as a factor actually. And I mentioned that last call as it wasn't incorporated into our guidance in a negative fashion. The way we look at it and the way we believe it works, at least in our business, is that customers will have a holiday budget, and they will spend it between generally the middle of November. It's creeping up to the early part of November through the holiday season. And we do see obviously spikes in Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and we also see relative tick-up in trends as we get closer to the holiday and before the shipping threshold cutoff. So there's a polarization of -- tends to be a polarization to early shipping -- or excuse me, early purchase and late purchases. 
As far as the 6 days sort of time period between Thanksgiving and the Christmas holiday, we don't see an impact on that. Perhaps it's a bigger issue for stores and just foot traffic, but we don't notice it in our business.",192

Then I'll throw off 3 quick ones. Just talk a little bit more about gross margins in the quarter. You had -- the year-over-year trend was negative last quarter, but it turned, reversed and was up this quarter. So if there are any unusual factors you'd want to call out there. Second, the -- I don't want to read over a lot into your guidance, but every year, for the last 5 years, you've always guided to operating profit down sequentially. And then you maybe delivered better than that, but you always guided down. This year, your high end of your range is actually above what you obviously did in the fourth quarter. Are you just trying to remind people, tell people, educate people on how the mix shift in the business towards AWS and advertising is just changing the profit profile of the business?

So I don't think there's anything too surprising you caught there. I think we continue to see some good growth in the third-party business. You saw that accelerate some. We're continuing to see that trend of more FBA sellers signing and taking a larger percentage of the total 3P mix of units that are sold through, so that continues to do well. And as Brian mentioned earlier, we think some of that has to do with the program keeps getting better with faster shipping and whatnot. We've invested many billions of dollars in that program to make it even better for sellers. AWS had a strong quarter, of course, so that helps on the gross margin side as well. 
And then on transportation, I think you saw the outbound shipping costs to grow around 43% year-over-year. So certainly, up a good deal versus the trend line we saw in 2018. But of course, that's reflective of 1-day and overall relative to our expectations. As Brian said, with the $1.5 billion we guided to, we came in a bit under that. So some of that was certainly part of some better-than-expected trends, efficiencies.",193

But if you actually look back to Q1 of last year, it was the highest operating income quarter on record, and that's one of the -- makes a difficult comp this year because we had the, if you remember, the slowdown in expenditures in 2018 in things like fixed -- adding of head count, warehouse space, infrastructure costs, not to 0 but like down off of prior investment levels in 2016 and into 2017. A lot of that continued -- that cost baseline continued into Q1 of 2019, and it actually was a super efficient quarter from a cost and profit standpoint. 
Q2 of last year, we started to again make larger investments, particularly in 1-day. And so that's now something that is lapping in Q1 of this year because we didn't really have 1-day in Q1 of last year. But -- so I think there's -- it's hard to draw those parallels between quarters anymore. I will, though, mention the guidance that we do have the $800 million of lower depreciation from our extension of our server -- useful lives, which is part of the range that we gave you of $3 billion to $4.2 billion.",247

Joining us today to answer your questions are Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 30, 2020, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic conditions and customer spending; world events; the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services; and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including the duration and spread of the pandemic; actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and consumer spending patterns as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
And now I'll turn the call over to Brian.",443

What we've all seen transpire in the past 2 months has been gut-wrenching and unprecedented. But it's also been a time of heroic action by health care workers, government officials, police and emergency personnel and all essential workers in our communities. This includes frontline Amazonians, including our Whole Foods team and our partners around the world. They've provided a lifeline of groceries and other critical supplies to the doorsteps of all of us at this critical time.
I'd like to give you some insight into what we have seen in Amazon and how we are responding to this crisis. Beginning in early March, we experienced a major surge in customer demand, particularly for household staples and other essential products across categories such as health and personal care, groceries and even home office supplies. At the same time, we saw lower demand for discretionary items such as apparel, shoes and wireless products. This large demand spike created major challenges in our operations network and with our seller community and our suppliers.
While we generally have experience in getting ready for spikes in demand for known events like the holiday season and Prime Day, we also generally spend months ramping up for these periods. The COVID crisis allowed for no such preparation. We took quick action to react to the higher order levels while continuing to provide for the safety of our workforce. We established rigorous safety and cleaning protocols, including maintaining 6-foot social distancing, procuring 100 million masks, tens of millions of gloves and wipes and other cleaning supplies. We began requiring temperature checks across our operations network.
In our Whole Food stores, we added plexiglass barriers between cashiers and customers and reserved special hours for senior customers to shop. We temporarily raised wages and overtime premiums, we funded a new Amazon relief fund and we allowed employees to take unpaid time off at their discretion. To deal with the unprecedented demand, we hired an additional 175,000 new employees, many of whom were displaced from other jobs in the economy. We took steps to dampen demand for nonessential products, including reducing our marketing spend.
Our network pivoted to shipping priority of products within 1 to 4 days and extending promises on nonpriority items. Our independent third-party sellers, most of whom are small and medium-sized businesses, worked tremendously hard to serve our customers, and we are grateful for their efforts. Third-party sellers continue to see strong growth in our stores as more than half of our units sold are from third-party sellers.
We increased grocery delivery capacity by more than 60% and expanded in-store pickup at Whole Food stores from over -- from 80 stores to more than 150 stores. And other Amazon teams shifted their focus to directly helping customers in the overall effort to fight the COVID virus.
AWS has created data lake to assist health care workers, researchers, scientists and public health officials who are working to understand and fight the coronavirus. Many of our AWS products are helping in the government response to the crisis and are there for customers who are seeing their own demand spikes, companies enabling videoconferencing, remote learning and online health services, for example.
Amazon Flex is supporting food banks by donating delivery services of groceries to serve 6 million meals in Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C. with plans to ramp this up to 25 cities across the U.S. And Alexa is helping customers access important CDC guidance and help them evaluate their own COVID-19 risk levels.
How is all this impacting our business? While customer demand remains high, the incremental revenue we are seeing on many of the lower ASP essential products is basically coming at a cost. We've invested more than $600 million in COVID-related costs in Q1 and expect these costs could grow to $4 billion or more in Q2. These include productivity headwinds in our facilities as we provide for social distancing and allow for the ramp-up of new employees, investments in personal protective equipment for employees, enhanced cleaning of our facilities, higher wages for our hourly teams and hundreds of millions of dollars to develop COVID-19 testing capabilities. In Q1, we also had another $400 million of costs related to increased reserves for doubtful accounts. On the flip side, we did see a drop in travel, entertainment and meeting costs as well as lower marketing as a way to dampen our demand for nonessential items.
While we can't have great certainty about what the next few quarters will look like, I'm humbled by the efforts of my fellow Amazonians in delivering essential goods and services to so many people. We take this responsibility seriously, and we're proud of the work our teams are doing to help customers through this difficult time.
With that, let's open up for questions.",822

First, I just wanted to ask, within the $4 billion of COVID-related incremental costs in 2Q, you talked about spending hundreds of millions on your own testing capabilities. Can you just talk about the strategic thinking there underlying, trying to build this in-house versus sourcing from elsewhere? And does this potentially take you into a new business path over time? And then how do you think about the spending here in 2Q and whether over time, does that change your margin structure for an extended period of time beyond just the next quarter?",94

First, on testing. So we estimate the testing will be about $300 million in Q2 if we're successful. We've put some of our best people on it. I think everyone is trying to get testing. It's not readily available on the scale that we need it for -- to test our scale of employees. So we are working to do that ourselves and to build protocols and to -- and again, we'll see how we do that differently. And I don't know, again, about future business opportunities. Our main concern is getting testing in the hands of our employees. And then potentially as we have excess capacity, perhaps we can help in other areas. On the spending, the -- a lot of the costs that we're seeing are tied to this COVID response. Most of it is hitting in people costs, both in productivity and also in wages and relief funds and all. So we can't really tell how long that will last. It's probably good that I'm only giving -- we're only giving guidance for Q2 at this point. We're going to probably learn a lot more in the next few weeks, next few months, and we'll continue to update this. But for now, most of what we see are temporary costs in the scheme of things but certainly very expensive temporary costs and also ones that we're not sure how long that will last.",239

The first one is the current situation is sort of, I think, in many ways, sort of showcased the ability of your network to provide goods for people and the value of Prime and Amazon to customers. So I guess in light of that, can you talk to us at all about the impact you've seen on the Prime customer account from the current situation? Any color on how you've been able to expand Prime's reach into new customers or demographics from this? Then the second one, I know there's a lot of changes going on in logistics and things, but Amazon is always a learning company. So any learnings you've had so far on the logistics side about how you actually may be able to learn some new best practices to run more efficiently post-COVID from the current fire that we've been going through?",149

So that's not something we want to keep learning, but we're doing our best to maintain and provide key services for -- and essential items for our Prime customers and all our Amazon customers. On the Prime -- excuse me, Prime program, what we're seeing is, again, we're seeing a lot of pickup in Prime shopping benefits. We see our Prime customers are shopping more often and they have larger basket sizes. We're also seeing a lot more use of our video benefits and our digital benefits. So in March, the first-time viewers nearly doubled, which is, I think, a good time for people to -- when they're -- a lot of them are staying at home to stay entertained and see our video collection.
It's also beyond kind of Prime Video, it's also our channels and video rentals also went up as I'm sure others in the entertainment business saw it as well. I think people are finding more benefit from Alexa when they're at home. They're listening to more music, asking questions, particularly questions related to COVID and issues around it. They're using it in education with their children. And I think we're seeing a lot more on the communication side using it -- people using Alexa Calling and Drop In. So I think the Prime story is that shopping is really important for people now, especially when they -- those people can't leave their houses. I think the digital benefits are scaling well. I think they're handling the additional demand, and it gives people a good time and reason to use all of their Prime benefits that maybe they hadn't used as much in the past.",329

First, could you just talk about where you are in terms of fulfillment efficiencies, the way you track it? Pre-COVID, Amazon was able to had some sort of level of standard of meeting demand within a certain period of time, how low that got given the surge in demand and where you are in terms of the recovery. In other words, when are you going to be -- how long will it take for Amazon to get back to a point where you'd have the same sort of service efficiency levels on the retail side that you had pre-COVID? How far are you away from that? And then the second one is can you talk about the AWS business? And I guess I would have expected -- maybe the growth rate is really robust, but maybe even a kick up in the growth rate is -- what are you seeing there in terms of -- I assume there's much greater usage of AWS now. Is that something that would show up in the P&L maybe on a delayed basis? Just talk about what's happening to that side of the business in this crisis.",195

Well, we're happy with the growth in Q1 on such a large base. Again, we're -- now it's a $41 billion run rate, and that's grown 33% year-over-year. But what we're seeing kind of post-COVID is it varies by industry. I think -- we think what is -- probably where we're a bit well positioned is that we have such a breadth of customers. There's millions of active customers from start-ups to enterprises to public sector. So there's a lot of variance and, again, in what individual industries are seeing right now, things like video conferencing, gaming, remote learning, entertainment, all are seeing much higher growth and usage. And things like hospitality and travel certainly have contracted very severely, very quickly. So I think there's going to be a mixed bag on industries. And of course, this would be tied to general economic conditions for the country and the world, quite frankly. So right now, we're -- we want to be there for our customers. We want to be able to scale up when they need us. We want to be there and support them regionally around the world. And we've been doing a good job with that, I believe.
On the fulfillment efficiency, I think you're talking about 1-day probably is the heart of your question, when will we get back to what we have seen in levels of 1-day. So a little bit on that. So again, as I mentioned in my introductory comments, we had to kind of absorb this shock of top line demand and also ability to stabilize our operations. And we had to take the step to focus on essential items, extend the shipping period from 1 to 4 days and then further on nonessential items. Had to restrict things that were coming into the warehouses and focus on essential products. So we think that is still the -- was the right course of action. And as we add capacity, we're trying to resume more normal operations as far as the shipping of nonessential items and the speeding up of 1-day shipments.
I will explain a bit on the 1-day shipping cost because it's aligned with this. So we had originally thought we would spend $1 billion roughly on 1-day shipping in Q1. And what we're seeing is we pretty much spent about that same amount because it's -- in the old days, we would have perhaps had the option to shift things 2-day, 3-day, 4-day and seen a break on rates for the actual shipment. But most of our 1-day costs are really what we've done to our logistics networks to allow for 1-day shipping, things like putting inventory closer to the customer, things like building up our AMZL network and delivery network and also having multiple pull times and shipping windows during the day. So those are actually coming in. All those things are coming in very handy to us to help get more capacity out of what we currently have, and we're glad we've made that investment. But we don't actually see a savings because we're still shipping things once they're available very quickly to customers.
So it's really a combination of how long it takes to get things in stock picked, packed and shipped. The shipping is still pretty fast and is still coming quickly. It's just it's taking longer to get things into our warehouse and out of our warehouse. So that's really the challenge right now is to speed that up, and that will -- when we do that, we'll see a resumption of more 1-day service. But right now, things are still so up in the air that I can't really project when that day will be or at what point in Q2 or Q3 or beyond.",631

I did want to dig just a little bit deeper into your comments on AWS. Yesterday, during Microsoft's call, they mentioned that they had seen 2 years' worth of digital transformation in the cloud in 2 months. I'm curious if you -- how you would characterize sort of what you have seen as we've gone into August or into April in terms of cloud adoption and what this is, what this has meant for AWS and the adoption of the -- rate of adoption or acceleration in that business, maybe more broadly? And then as we look at the guidance, the $4 billion for the expenses in the second quarter, if we adjust for that, that implies a pretty material increase in profitability quarter-over-quarter. Any sense of -- or any sense that you can sort of share with us of just what the drivers behind that profitability is? How much of that is annualizing the 1-day investments and the efficiencies that you're seeing there versus anything else in particular that you would call out?",175
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",2020-04-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2382.0,2028568.0,79363143.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,14,"Yes. So first on AWS. I mean I don't have comments that -- you may have heard also about digital transformation. I think what I would say is we've continued to see a healthy adoption of our business and healthy usage, not only in the United States but globally. Our backlog of future contracts continues to build. And I still think the basic value proposition of AWS that we've always pointed to, things like having the largest -- most functionality, the largest in those vibrant community of customers and partners, having really proven operational and security experience and building what customers need in the areas of machine learning, artificial intelligence and other really key areas is -- has not been impeded by this COVID crisis yet. And yes, we're seeing different performance in different industries, but our sales force is still there to help not only with current capacity but also to transition to new and -- as people make that journey on to the cloud and then expand their use of the cloud.
On the $4 billion -- or sorry, on the Q2 guidance, I think the question is, perhaps if -- how do we have a range that's above 0 if we have $4 billion of cost, is that pretty much the essence of your question? I think there's -- there are some efficiencies that we'd leverage, that we get on fixed cost on higher volumes, even if they are somewhat breakeven on a contribution profit basis. There's some improvement in our cost structure when we have high volumes. There's also been a resumption of seller volume, especially from third parties using direct shipments to customers as companies are -- you get more capability, both in this country and other countries. We will continue to moderate our marketing in the time period when we have -- again, pretty much the demand we are trying to fulfill is there, and there are some products that are still out of stock. So it doesn't make sense to always do marketing, especially variable marketing in those situations. And we continue to -- we believe, we'll be saving travel and entertainment costs through the quarter. That's in the, I would say, in a couple of hundred million dollar size ranges on the cost. So there's a lot of moving parts here. But certainly, the investment we're making in the COVID response is pretty significant.
On the 1-day, I would remind you that the 1-day started in earnest Q2 of last year. So we're starting to lap that investment. It's not as large on a year-over-year basis as it's been in the past 4 quarters. And then the other thing that I would just point out is the -- remember the impact of our change in the useful life of our servers mostly hitting in the AWS business. That was an $800 million benefit year-over-year in Q1, and that will continue into the rest of the year. And that, again, is the benefit we're seeing from being able to use our server and infrastructure assets for a longer time period. We've been working on the ability to run them longer, and it's both a hardware and a software challenge. And as we have had success there operating at scale for over 13 years now, we've been able to extend our useful life for assets or recognize that we have been extending the life. So that's a benefit that we've seen in Q1, and we'll see it remaining from here on out.",588

One on demand and the revenue side, any difference in behavior you saw in various shelter-in-place geographies across the world, whether it be Europe versus the U.S. or Asia and the U.S. or India in terms of consumer behavior or certain elements of adoption of certain product categories as we went through the month of March? I'm curious what differences you saw on a global scale, including on Prime adoption in response to COVID-19. And one quick one on the cost side of the equation. The cost of energy and oil have come down dramatically. I wanted to know if there was any way you would be able to call that out or an element of that in your overall cost structure as you do more of your own logistics over time.",137

I don't have much for you on the second point. Certainly, we would look to see lower shipping costs, although I would -- a lot of -- I mean there's certainly things that we do long haul. There's things that we reposition with the airplanes. There's things that we do on long-haul trucking and that's where probably the fuel component would be larger. And we've -- but we haven't quantified that or not for -- it's in our guidance, but I can't break it out for you right now. On the -- how this may have played out differently in different geographies, we're actually seeing a lot of consistency, I would say, in the types of products that people are buying and the stay-at-home restrictions and the -- so it's been pretty consistent. There's obviously timing differences between countries on when it's hitting certain countries and when it's -- maybe when it's -- where they are in their curve and flattening their curve and all that.
I think the biggest impact internationally has been in India where, of course, we -- similar to all companies in India, we were -- we're now only fulfilling our essential goods such as grocery. So that's cut back a lot on our offering. And we will further expand when the Indian government announces that we're allow to resume operations. So we're in a bit of a holding pattern, except for grocery in India. And in France, there's been restrictions placed on us by the French courts. They did not impact Q1 business because it essentially led to the closure of our French fulfillment centers in the middle of April. French customers are still able to order many millions of products from the selling partners we have who can ship directly to customers and through our global fulfillment. And we're continuing to appeal this court decision, but that's also a different experience than the other countries internationally.",325

And the second thing, for the revenue guidance for 2Q, does that assume a slowdown in growth in May and June related to the crisis?",84

Yes. I think on some of the consumer behavior, I'd certainly point to grocery. If you look at the -- as a reminder, the online grocery is up on our online sales. So it's not isolated like you can see for physical stores. But we have seen an increased demand in online grocery shopping, and we have a number of ways for customers to do that, Prime Now, Fresh and then, of course, Whole Foods online for delivery or pickup. And really beginning in March and continuing now through April, seeing that increased demand, so that's continued. And a lot of our focus is on working around the clock and offering as much delivery as possible. We've increased delivery order capacity more than 60%, and our stores have gone up -- Whole Food stores that offer pickup capability has gone from roughly 80 stores before the events to more than 150. So a lot of work being done there.
On the physical stores, which you can see the growth there, it increased year-over-year about 8%. That is predominantly Whole Foods, but it's the Whole Foods in-store shopping experience rather than the online order. So that's up quite a bit from the run rate you've seen in some recent quarters. It's, again, similar that you saw a lot of folks that were, when stay-at-home measures were not yet in place, were shopping in large volumes and stocking up at our stores. Since that time, more recently, we have seen some of those growth rates for the in-store shopping moderate some. Still a lot of work being done there, both in -- for the workers that are doing the delivery and the workers that are in the stores, a lot of focus on our part to make sure that they're safe and healthy and able to accommodate customers and make sure customers are comfortable however they choose to shop.",320

I think the changes we've seen in the digital offerings will make people accustomed to those benefits and maybe advance their knowledge of what's available through music, video, Alexa, certainly, communication features on our devices. We launched Prime Video Cinema in U.S., U.K. and Germany where movies are going direct to pay-per-view because of lack of theaters. And that was a good move by the team, and that's been very well received. We've also made a lot of kids and family content available free to watch on Prime Video. So I think people are getting a better look at what's available with their Prime memberships.",112

Demand has been strong. And the biggest questions we have in Q2 are more about ability to service that demand and that -- the products that people are ordering in a full way, not blocking or making it hard to find nonessential items, increasing marketing and everything else. So I think the challenge is really on everything besides the top line. Top line is certainly not to be taken for granted. There's always the importance of having attractive offerings in stock for customers. But usually, things that you can count on, the cost structure, the ability to get products, your capacity for shipping and delivering, those are usually things that you can take for granted and in this quarter, you can't. And that's really where the uncertainty is driven.",161

Thanks, Stephen. I would say that, yes, it's a little off during this period because it's not so much we're restricting and favoring 1P or anything, it's we're prioritizing essential items. And a lot of those tend to be, especially in the consumable area, tend to be retail supplied items from vendors. So I would say that, that is the reason that FDA would have not been as high as it normally would be. MFN is picking up a lot of the opportunity, though, to -- and sellers are taking that opportunity to ship direct because then it doesn't have to come into our warehouse, obviously. So it's a bit of a different type of 3P mix right now. We're trying to minimize the impact on FBA sellers as we open up our warehouses as well. Many of them are also MFN or direct shippers to our customers. So it's -- the ability to satisfy demand of our customers from our seller community has never been more important. And we're very grateful to our third-party sellers because they've been through a lot as well.",185

Any way to quantify? And does this hiring replace kind of the seasonal hiring that you typically do at the end of the third quarter?",78

Let me start with that second one. I don't have more for you on that. I think we'll announce -- as we change any thresholds on hiring, we'll announce that at the time. Right now, we've fully hired the 175,000 people that we had discussed prior. 80,000 of them were in place at the end of the quarter. So the other 95,000 have been hired in April. On advertising, what we've seen is it's been a very strong quarter in ad revenue. And your comment about other revenue accelerating, there's some other things going on in that other revenue account. The majority is revenue, but there's other -- some other things. What I can tell you underneath it is that advertising growth rate has stayed consistent with last quarter. And we're very happy with the progression of that offering for not only sellers, authors, vendors and impact it's -- positive impact it's had on customer selection.
But we did start to see some impact in March, some pullback from advertisers and some downward pressure on price. But advertisers continue to advertise at a high clip. It wasn't as noticeable as maybe with some others we're seeing, and it's probably offset a bit by the continued strong traffic we have to the site. So it's a bit of a mixed bag. We have, again, as I said, downward pressure a bit on pricing. But I think we have -- a large portion of our advertising relates to Amazon sales, not things like travel and auto which -- off-site which may have been disproportionately impacted, at least early on here in the COVID crisis. And I think our advertising will prove to be very efficient as well, and it can be directly measured. So even as people are cutting back perhaps on advertising or their costs, I think this will be one area that will prove its value as it has in the past.",324

Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 30, 2020, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During the call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC, and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence; actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and spending patterns as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain.
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

I'd like to start by thanking and recognizing the contributions of hundreds of thousands of Amazon employees and delivery partners and hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized businesses who are working hard to serve our customers all around the world in these uncertain times.
Amazon's second quarter was another highly unusual quarter. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, we began to see a significant increase in customer demand beginning in early March, and demand remained elevated throughout Q2. Strong early demand in groceries and consumable products continued into Q2, while demand increased during the quarter in our other major product categories like hardlines and softlines.
At the same time, we continue to focus on stepped up employee safety, particularly in our fulfillment and logistics operations, to help ensure the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. In Q2, we incurred more than $4 billion of COVID-related expenses, getting products to customers and keeping employees safe. The largest portion of these costs related to compensation for our frontline employees, including higher hourly wages through the end of May and a more than $500 million Thank You bonus in June.
We also experienced productivity headwinds in our facilities. This included changes to over 150 of our processes to provide for social distancing as well as costs to onboard and train over 175,000 new employees who are hired to meet the higher customer demand. This $4 billion also included investments in personal protective equipment for employees and enhanced cleaning for our facilities.
Our consolidated revenue and operating income significantly exceeded the top end of our guidance range. Strong top line performance was driven by increased consumer demand, led by Prime members. We continue to see high Prime member engagement throughout the quarter. Prime members shop more often with larger basket sizes. Worldwide streaming video hours doubled year-over-year driven largely by Prime video. We're reaching more customers with our grocery offerings. Online grocery sales tripled year-over-year. Existing Prime member renewal rates improved, and the Prime member growth rate accelerated both in the U.S. and worldwide.
Our 3P sellers, who are largely comprised of small and medium-sized businesses, also stepped up to help make more selection available for customers. And as a result, these small and medium-sized businesses have seen significant growth in their sales.
Our third-party seller services revenue grew faster than online stores revenue in Q2, with strong growth in both fulfillment by Amazon and merchant fulfilled or MFN seller sales. Third-party units continue to represent more than half of overall unit volume, helped by improved quarter-over-quarter growth in active sellers.
We are more committed than ever to supporting the success of the hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized businesses to sell their products in Amazon stores. We were able to meet this heightened demand because we were also able to open up more fulfillment network capacity as the quarter progressed with faster delivery across more selection.
I'd point to a few capacity improvements that have allowed us to enhance throughput. First, our regular headcount grew 34% year-over-year as of the end of Q2 and continues to grow. We welcomed more than 175,000 new employees in March and April, many of whom were displaced from other jobs in the economy. As we've seen demand remain high, we are in the process of bringing 125,000 of these employees into regular full-time positions.
I would also note that Amazon has created more jobs over the last decade than any other company, and we are proud that we're continuing to create good jobs with industry-leading wages and great benefits during this challenging time. Our combined number of regular and seasonal employees is currently over 1 million.
We've also been able to expand the output in our existing facilities as we've had time to implement, learn and iterate on the new process paths we put in place. Additionally, as a reminder, Q2 is typically our lightest volume quarter for the retail business. That's not the case this year, but what that's meant is that we can flex into space normally used for second half peak demand. This led to strong operating leverage in Q2. As we move towards peak in the second half of the year, we will ramp up our space needs even further, and we'll be adding significant fulfillment center and transportation capacity in the second half of the year.
Turning to AWS. This is now a $43 billion annualized run rate business, up nearly $10 billion in run rate in the last 12 months. Customer usage remains strong, although growth varies across industries as a result of the COVID-19 crisis.
Lastly, I'll touch upon our Q3 guidance, which we provided as part of our earnings release. A few additional data points on this guidance. We expect to incur more than $2 billion in COVID-related expenses in Q3 to help keep employees safe, including continued investment in social distancing, PP&E and testing. Costs are expected to be lower than in Q2 primarily due to better cost efficiency at the high demand levels we are seeing.
In addition, I'll remind you that the third quarter is typically when we open the majority of our new fulfillment network capacity, and we expect the same this year. We continue to invest meaningfully, including $9.4 billion in CapEx and finance leases in Q2 alone, an increase of 65% year-over-year, primarily driven by investments in our fulfillment and logistics footprint. Once these buildings open, they are a headwind to profitability as they ramp up and we prepare for Q4 peak.
In 2019, we increased network square footage by approximately 15%. This year, we expect a meaningfully higher year-over-year square footage growth of approximately 50%. This includes strong growth in new fulfillment center space as well as sort centers and delivery stations. We expect the majority of this capacity to come online in late Q3 and into Q4.
Lastly, we plan to host Prime Day in Q4 this year rather than Q3 as it has been in prior years. The one exception is Amazon India, which will host Prime Day on August 6 and August 7.
In summary, we know that people are relying on online shopping more than ever during this unprecedented time, and we are working hard to add capacity to serve customers. We're extremely grateful to our employees across Amazon for continuously stepping up to meet the needs of customers.
With that, let's move on to Q&A.",1080

You made a push into essentials and deemphasized nonessentials, as we talked about in the last earnings call. Where are we in terms of the company getting the mix between essentials versus nonessentials right in terms of offering to customers? Where are you in terms of returning to normal on next-day and 2-day shipping initiatives to drive Prime? If there was any color on the state of affairs with either of those by geo or region of the world, that would be great.",104

Thanks for your question. So first, on the trend. So if you remember, we exited Q1 and spoke at the end of April. We had taken a lot of steps in March and April to, first, limit the incoming nonessential products into our warehouses, and then we reversed that or eliminated that decision in mid-April.
So we started to normalize on our channel mix. And I would say, as we moved into late April and early May, we expected that because a lot of the sellers can toggle between MFN or FBA sales that we would see MFN drop as FBA picked up. But to a large extent, MFN remained strong even as FBA picked up. So we had a very favorable mix, if you will, coming from March on. It started to normalize a little bit more to normal levels towards the end of the quarter, but MFN still remains high.
On the product side, a lot of what we saw in March and early April was sales of consumables and groceries and safety items. And we talked a lot about the fact that, that was coming at pretty much 0 cost -- or excuse me, 0 profit when you factored in the COVID-related costs. We've got better on our cost structure, and we also resumed a more normal mix in, I'd say, early part of May.
So since then, I would say it's getting closer to what we call a more normal mix. Demand is still super high. What we're seeing on -- it's driven by Prime members and Prime member engagement. They're shopping more often. They have larger basket sizes. There's still a heavy component of grocery -- online grocery sales tripled year-over-year in the quarter as we added capacity there.
So well, there's shifts in the mix based on what customers want. It's looking a little more normal, and it's staying at a very high level. On 1 day, we realize that our first priority is to keep our employees safe, and the second is focus on getting our capacity increased. Once we've done that, we are working very hard to get faster shipments. And we've seen the 1-day and 2-day recover through the quarter, but it's still probably considerably behind the going in rate before any of this happen. So we'll continue to work on that. But again, first priority is definitely keeping employees safe, and second is increasing our capacity.",408

And this is just David. I think just from a geographic perspective, Brian's opening comments there, a lot of these order trends and activity, you can see that both the North America and the International segment are growing well. So a lot of those kind of trends in category performances and first-party and third-party seller growth, whether it be merchant fulfilled or FBA sellers, we're seeing a lot of growth across the board, kind of similar-type broad trends when you think about the U.S. and North America as well as our international regions, in particular, our more established international regions.",101

18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2280.0,2078690.0,81579955.0,Question,Mark Mahaney,,Analysts,8,"Okay. So 2, just a quick follow-up on Eric's question. Brian, when do you think you'll get back to par in terms of 1 day being 1 day? And then secondly, these profit levels are super high now. They're becoming super high at the company if you ex out the COVID costs. Is Jeff aware of how profitable the company is becoming? Is he happy about it? And I'm kind of being facetious, obviously, when I asked that.
But what I also want to ask really is when you think about new investment areas, and at the top of the list, maybe some new international launches are really building out some of the markets that you've -- like India, Brazil and Mexico or the business-to-business operations, like there's a ton of new investment areas, and it seems like the Amazon historically, and I'm sure it's the same now, would be using this kind of revenue surge and really investing aggressively in these new areas. So just talk about that. I know you've got spend on COVID, but as you think about the next 3 to 5 years, you've got these really profit surges. How can you deploy those? Or how do you want to deploy those into some of the newer investment areas?",213
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2280.0,2078690.0,81579956.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,9,"Sure. Thanks for your questions, Mark. First, on when we get back to par, we don't know yet. We're getting progressively better, but we're also balancing what is going to be very stepped up demand and capacity in Q3 and Q4. So if you look at our historic run rates and can see how big a quarter Q2 was, Q2 was actually higher revenue than Q4 of last year, which is unheard of. And Q3 is now forecast to be also higher than Q4 of last year.
So we've kind of moved the peak forward, and for different reasons, we're trying to, mainly, like as I said, first priority is getting -- is making sure our employees are safe and that we continue to do social distancing and keep everybody safe and healthy. Second priority is getting capacity online because we do not have -- in Q2, we generally have lower revenue. And in Q2, like I mentioned, we were able to use the excess capacity that did exist to serve the higher demand.
Now as we move into Q3, we're starting to -- we need to build the inventory more for Q4, and we've run out of space. So we've got our hands full on that challenge, but we've got a really good team that's been working very hard probably since late February on this issue.
And when you talk about profitability, we'll also mention that there are a couple of expenses that have gone down in the interim. Marketing, we cut marketing probably by about 1/3 in Q2 as -- mainly because we're trying to manage demand. It started to normalize and get back to somewhat normal levels in -- at the end of Q2, but -- and therefore, we'll see a higher level in Q3. But certainly, marketing costs were lower. You probably saw it in a lot of companies. Travel expenses have almost drawn to a halt. Meeting costs, even medical costs in some examples or in some cases have been delayed as people don't go to the doctor or don't go there as quickly. We think that will normalize over time.
And as far as investments, we've got a lot of investments already in play. So I don't think it's a matter of necessarily accelerating investment or -- we're always looking for new investments that make sense to us. But during this time, I would say we've actually accelerated our ops investment. We pulled in capacity that we probably didn't think would be needed until 2021, maybe later. On grocery, we've also greatly expanded our grocery delivery capacity, and that's probably ahead of schedule.",439
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2280.0,2078690.0,81579957.0,Answer,David Zapolsky,,Executives,10,"Yes. This is Dave. Just to add to that, I think Prime is such a big focus, and some of the growth statements that Brian talked about at the opening of the call, whether it was strength in Prime membership and the acceleration we saw in the U.S. or worldwide or some of the usage stats like the grocery momentum or the doubling of video hours, for us, it's just another encouraging sign. We think there's still a lot more value we can add to that program. And that's not just in the United States where we've got sort of a broader set of services than some of the other regions, but really focusing on supporting in some of those other regions. And so we've got places like Australia, the Middle East. We've talked about India many times, but a lot of focus on building that out.
I think what's great about a place -- all geographies with a place like India is we're really focused on digitizing the Indian sellers. A lot of micro, small and medium-sized businesses there. We launched some new features there to help support the digitization efforts with some of those brands and just a lot of work, great work being done by that team. They have some goals there around getting more sellers on board and hiring many more people as well. So a lot of focus there.",234

The first one, Brian, is going back to the investments, and you're often making multiyear investments for customers and customer offerings, and you're the man behind the capital allocation plan. I guess I'd be curious to hear about can you give us some examples of areas of investment that may have been pushed out this year because of shelter in place and the higher demand that you've been seeing? So what were areas where you thought you were going to spend more at the start of the year than you actually have now in the current 2020 plan?
And then the second one, the international strength, I appreciate the color on Europe and Japan. Nice to see the profitability. Maybe just talk to us sort of qualitatively about some puts and takes around your core international markets, Europe and Japan? And how to think about whether or not they could be more or less profitable than the U.S. long term?",163
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2280.0,2078690.0,81579960.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,13,"Sure. I think you'll -- starting with that second one. You'll notice that the International segment was profitable this quarter, and that's a great sign. It is heavily driven by the pickup in demand that we saw, as I mentioned, I believe, in multiple calls. What's going on internationally is we have some very healthy established countries that we've been in a long time. And we have probably accelerated their adoption of Prime benefits. We've pushed video and devices and music and other things to those countries probably earlier in the life cycle than you would have seen in the U.S. So there's a bit of a forward investment on Prime benefits in many of those countries.
But what you also see are investments in new countries. Obviously, India is the biggest one, but also, to a lesser extent, the Middle East, Brazil, Turkey and Australia are recent addition. So there's always an element of expansion going on there. Advertising is growing, so that's a good source of profitability. But if you look at what happened in Q2, it was essentially just the much higher volumes than we had anticipated or had on a run rate. So our fixed costs were leveraged to the hilt. Obviously, we will add some capacity and things in transportation and fulfillment centers, but all other fixed costs were pretty much leveraged on that higher demand. The U.K. in particular, was very strong because there's probably more stay-at-home orders and the way the economy was developing in the U.K. We had a very, very strong quarter there.
So I would say that the surge in demand internationally also helped drive that profitable, maybe a little earlier than the trajectory would have shown. And I'm not sure that, that is going to continue for the next couple of quarters, but it's a good sign that we could leverage that. And a lot of the same trends in the U.S. were apparent internationally, higher Prime -- more frequent Prime purchases and higher basket sizes. So all good signs, and perhaps we got a glimpse of the future on the demand curve.
Your second question on slowing investments. The list is very short on what we've had to slow down. It's mostly -- it hasn't been done necessarily for cost reasons, it's been done for people reasons. The one I'd point to is studios. We've had to delay production. I think most studios have. And that's been augmented by some new things like our Amazon cinema where we're having first run movies. And so I think in this time, when people want entertainment, people are having trouble creating new content across the board. And that's a bit of a challenge, but it's not something we're doing intentionally. We're doing it to protect the actors and film crews, and we think that's the right decision.
As I said, a lot of the investments are being pulled in, especially on the upside and grocery delivery, same-store pickup. A number of whole food stores that you can pick up deliveries on tripled this quarter. So the list is short on things that we're slowing down on, I would say. It's just we're adapting and probably looking at whether some things have changed and creating some things for the new environment, especially in the entertainment area.",554

Brian, first, just curious about your overall thoughts on how the e-commerce adoption curve has been shifted here over the next few years. And anything you can share around behavior for new and existing customers. And then separately, on AWS, the $43 billion run rate obviously slowed some in the quarter, but hoping you could comment just on the pace of IT decision-making in this environment, whether you're still impacted by some clients more highly exposed to challenged verticals? And due to those factors, is it possible that AWS can accelerate growth going forward?",97
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2280.0,2078690.0,81579963.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,16,"Yes. Let me start with that second one. Thanks, Doug. So in the AWS segment revenue, what we see are companies are working really hard right now to cut expenses, especially in the more challenged businesses like hospitality and travel but pretty much across the board. We're helping them. We're actively, with our sales force, looking for ways that we can help them save money. This includes things like scaling down the usage where it makes sense or benchmarking their workloads against our architectural best practices. So that's not going to help our usage growth in the short run, but it will help those customers save money. And we think that's the right thing to do, not only for their success and so they can come out of this at a better shape but also for the long-term health of our relationship with them as an AWS provider.
But we're also seeing a lot of companies that are really wishing that they had made more progress on the cloud because they're seeing how companies that are on the cloud can turn into a variable cost and either scale up or scale down depending on their particular situation. They realize their on-premise infrastructure is not really flexible to go up or down. And especially in the time of sinking demand, it's a big fixed cost for them. So we expect -- we're seeing migration plans accelerate. They're certainly not going to happen overnight, but we see companies moving more in that direction. We think that will be a good long-term trend. And there's certainly winners in this area right now, things like video conferencing, gaming, remote learning and entertainment. All are seeing usage growth. And it's a bifurcated world out there.
So the -- on your e-commerce adoption, I think it's hard to tell. We're super encouraged by the fact that grocery delivery has picked up, and that's been accelerated versus what we would have thought. We certainly are glad to be there for our Prime members who are shopping more frequently and buying more. We do know that there's reasons that there are other options are limited. I mean there are always retail options out there, especially to go pick up in store, but less people want to go into stores perhaps now. So we're going to have to see what is maybe a step-up in the curve and getting to a point quicker versus what are some onetime sales and things like -- hopefully, things like masks and gloves and cleaning supplies in the fullness of time become onetime purchases, but we'll see.
And sorry, your last point was on new customers versus existing customers. We're seeing similar trends. We're seeing good pickup in frequency and basket size for new members in Prime as well, certainly not the same as people have been Prime members for a number of years. But it's encouraging. And as you saw, Prime growth retention has increased. We've accelerated the number of -- the growth of Prime members, both in the U.S. and internationally. So that's a good sign that we're happy about. And we hope that, that has long-term ramifications.",527

Just a follow-up to that last comment. So the Prime behavior for international Prime members, you guys have talked about how like in the 16, 17 countries, the overall service levels are a little bit behind, selection is a little bit behind. So has the last few months in the pandemic closed that gap meaningfully in terms of GMV per Prime member for international versus what you see in the U.S.? Any comment there?
And then on the 3Q guidance, you pushed Prime day for western markets into 4Q. So how much of the deceleration -- it's obviously a really strong number for 3Q, but the growth rate is decelerating a little bit. Is that mostly from Prime Day? Or can you just talk about what kind of behaviors you're seeing right now as you go into 3Q?",139
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2280.0,2078690.0,81579966.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,19,"Right. Well, we ramped up through the quarter in Q2 and ended up with 41% year-over-year growth in FX-neutral -- on an FX-neutral basis. A lot of those trends are continuing into Q3. You see our revenue range is $87 billion to $93 billion coming off of $89 billion quarter. So I would say that the -- if you look at the growth rate, that translates into somewhere in the 24% to 33% growth rate in Q3. So I can't break out exactly the Prime impact because there's -- but suffice to say, it's a big driver on why 41% growth in Q2 turns into 24% to 33% growth in Q3 on what turns out to be higher revenue volume.
And then on Prime behavior, it's -- I can't really give you more on that because it is actually a very localized set of staff by country. In international, aggregate does not matter that much. And what I would say is, generally, what we're seeing is similar trends in international in response to COVID purchasing patterns. I wouldn't say it closed the gap. I said -- I would say they both went up. And we'll see how it goes from there. I think there's definitely any differences in selection or differences in shipping. There's a myriad of factors that go into a Prime member's decision to be a Prime member and to what they buy and what they use as far as our benefits that we give them. So I don't want to make too many sweeping comments on that right now.",262

We do think probably the U.K. was very -- grew very strongly in Q2, and that, I believe, is starting to moderate a bit but still stronger than normal. So I don't want to go by country, but I think those trends will start to perhaps become evident. But the -- from our vantage point, the Prime members still continue to order more frequently and in larger basket sizes.",88

And then, Aaron, just on your second question on Zoox, I mean, it's -- there's not too much to say at this point. It's still pretty early, but I think it probably goes without saying it's a tremendously forward-thinking team, which resonates with us. And they really do kind of pioneer in that space, the ride-hailing space.
So a lot of cool work they're doing, designing autonomous vehicles and focused on the passenger, right, in front of mind in that. So I think, again, just as we think about kind of the innovation components and commitments to solving kind of problems and challenges for customers, it's pretty exciting for us to be able to work with them and bring that vision to fruition in the years ahead.",128

A couple of questions. Obviously, a great cost quarter on the leverage side. Any changes in e-commerce gross margins to call out? Is scale and getting size, improving gross margins or anything on the mix shift there that's interesting?
And then secondly, we talked about a lot about 1 day investment last year. Obviously, the shipping times were impacted by COVID, but are you back to kind of normal times? And where are you on the 1 day investment?",80
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2280.0,2078690.0,81579978.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,31,"Sure. On 1 day, again, we're first prioritizing employee safety. We have a lot of effort in that regard. We've changed over 150 process paths. We've instituted social distancing, cleaning, temperature taking, both with our warehouse employees and also our transportation employees. So that's really still priority one.
And second is capacity expansion, especially as we head into the second half of the year, which generally sees a step-up in volume even over the first half of the year. So we will -- we are improving the percentage of 1 day. We're not back to where we were pre-COVID. We don't think we're going to be back in the short run, but we will continue to improve it. And hopefully, it'll be less noticeable for our consumer base.
On the gross margin side, it's very much a mixed bag right now. There's -- before the COVID outbreak, the positives were generally AMZL costs -- delivery costs were becoming more efficient. Advertising was -- and AWS were certainly a strong component of gross margin increases. Product mix could go either way depending on the country. But as this COVID has played out, consumables and grocery, which are lower margin, have started to -- have been a negative impact on gross margin. But the -- we feel good about where we are. Gross margin for the quarter was 40.8% and was down 200 basis points from last year. It's probably more tied to the addition of 1-day shipping. And even if we didn't do as much 1-day shipping as we've been doing post-COVID, the costs of 1-day shipping are already built into our structure. We've already reconfigured our network. We've already created the capacity to be able to ship. It's just a matter of whether or not we can get it out through the warehouse and to you in 1 day or not.",311

Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. 
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 29, 2020, only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. 
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. 
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. 
This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC, and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence; actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity; and our significant and continued spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas and consumer demand and spending patterns as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors and third party sellers, all of which are uncertain. 
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Brian.",439

I'd like to start by extending a big thank you to all the folks who worked hard to make this year's Prime Day a great success, not only for our more than 150 million Prime members around the world, but also for the hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized businesses who sell on our Amazon store, many of whom are facing their own challenges during this pandemic. These businesses thrived on Prime Day, with third-party sellers recognizing more than $3.5 billion in sales over the 2-day global event. That's a 60% increase compared to Prime Day last year. 
I also want to thank and recognize the contributions of the more than 1 million Amazon employees and delivery partners who are continuing to work hard to serve our customers all around the world. We will continue to spend what it takes to help ensure the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. 
Now let me share some highlights from the quarter. Our Q3 results largely reflect the continuation of demand trends we saw when we exited the second quarter, with strong demand and sales growth across our major product categories globally, including hardlines, consumables, softlines and media. 
We also continue to see strong Prime member engagement. Prime members continue to shop with greater frequency and across more categories than before the pandemic began. They continue to expand their usage of Prime's digital benefits, including Prime Video. Internationally, the number of Prime members who stream Prime Video grew by more than 80% year-over-year in the third quarter, and international customers more than doubled the hours of content they watched on Prime Video compared to last year. 
We're also reaching more customers with our grocery offerings. In Q3, our year-over-year growth rate of online grocery sales continued to accelerate, and we've continued to offer more convenient options for customers, including grocery pickup, which is now available from all Whole Foods market stores. And just as we saw in Q2, Prime member renewal rates improved in Q3 year-over-year. 
3P sellers, who, as I mentioned, are largely comprised of small and medium-sized businesses continue to be an important part of our offering to customers. Our 3P seller services revenue continued to grow faster than online stores revenue, with particularly strong growth this quarter in FBA as we return to a similar mix of FBA as a percentage of total 3P units as we've seen prior to COVID. 3P units continue to represent over half of overall unit volume, increasing to 54% of the total unit mix in Q3. We're investing heavily to support sellers and are pleased to report that over 0.5 million sellers are seeing record sales in our stores this year. 
We continue to focus on stepped-up employee safety, particularly in our fulfillment and logistics operations to help ensure the safety and well-being of our employees and partners as well as the employees and customers shopping in our Whole Foods market and other stores. This, of course, has added incremental cost to our P&L. The largest portion of these costs relate to continued productivity headwinds in our facilities, including process revisions to allow for social distancing and incremental costs to ramp up new facilities and the large influx of new employees hired to support strong customer demand. This also includes investments in PPE for employees and enhanced cleaning of our facilities. In total, we have incurred more than $7.5 billion in incremental COVID-related costs in the first 3 quarters of 2020, and we expect to incur approximately $4 billion in Q4. 
Our consolidated revenue and operating income exceeded the top end of our guidance range. As demand remained strong in the quarter, the extra volume and operating leverage helped us to achieve higher-than-expected profitability. And we saw another strong quarter of revenue growth and operating income performance in AWS and advertising. We had good leverage with our fulfillment centers as well as in Amazon Logistics, our transportation network, despite the higher COVID-related costs that I mentioned. 
Although we had strong growth in our network in Q3, some of our fulfillment network expansion shifted out a few weeks and will happen in Q4 rather than Q3. Once new buildings open, they are short-term headwind to profitability as they ramp up and we prepare for Q4 peak. More of this headwind will be felt in Q4 rather than in Q3, and this is reflected in our Q4 guidance. 
We're able to meet the heightened demand in Q3 because we opened up more network capacity, particularly in our transportation network. I point to 2 important drivers of this. First, we hired a lot more people to support the strong customer demand. We welcomed 250,000 permanent full-time and part-time employees just in Q3 and have already added about 100,000 more in the first month of Q4. I will note that these are permanent jobs with industry-leading pay, including Amazon's $15 minimum wage and great benefits such as health insurance, 401(k) plan and parental leave. 
Secondly, this has been a big year for capital investments. We've invested nearly $30 billion in CapEx and finance leases through the first 9 months of 2020, including over $12 billion in Q3. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect to grow our fulfillment and logistics network square footage by approximately 50% this year, which includes significant additions to our fulfillment centers as well as our transportation facilities. Majority of these buildings opened in late Q3 and into Q4. About half of this square footage growth will be on the transportation side to the opening of more sorting centers and delivery stations. 
And finally, in AWS, customer usage remains strong. We continue to see companies meaningfully growing their plans to move to AWS. And we are busy gearing up for our annual re:Invent conference. This year, re:Invent will be a free 3-week virtual conference running from November 30 through December 18. 
We are extremely grateful to our employees across Amazon, who have delivered an unprecedented demand for several months now as well as a strong Prime Day in October. We are ready to go and looking forward to meeting the needs of our customers this holiday season. 
With that, let's move on to Q&A.",1039

Just the first one, you mentioned the fulfillment center saw good leverage in the quarter. Can you just talk to us about some of the qualitative drivers of this improvement you're seeing in fulfillment cost per fulfilled unit in the quarter and sort of year-to-date? And how to think about the durability of that over time? 
And then secondly, I think throughout the summer, Amazon Logistics launched the third-party delivery service in the U.K. Curious just to hear about sort of early learnings from that product and how you think about scaling that to other countries and maybe globally.",103

Thanks for your question. So yes, the fulfillment center cost is going to be a blend of the COVID-related -- part of the COVID-related costs that I've mentioned and itemized, offset by some really strong leverage. I would say that we've been running very consistently high levels really since all of our employees were -- came back in the first or second week of May. And it's a -- some of them had been on unpaid leave. 
The -- so that demand is very consistent and strong and has created a lot of favorable leverage because, again, the order pattern being high and consistent is leveraging our fixed cost assets. Things like our delivery routes are more dense at high volumes so we see even transportation, some increased efficiencies. 
Offsetting that, again, is productivity elements that we've articulated, things like social distancing, extended breaks, other steps we're taking to keep people safe and distanced in our facilities in our delivery network.",163

Appreciate your thoughts there. Just trying to dig a little bit deeper in terms of how you're thinking about it kind of beyond the $4 billion in COVID costs. It still feels like maybe there's some more in there that we're not thinking about, perhaps beyond the square footage increases and the incremental head count. So if you have any comments there. 
And just curious, I know it's early on 2021, but you've obviously done a ton of investment this year and with the 50% square footage increase, and you tend to cycle at times in terms of CapEx investment. Just how do you think about digesting that kind of build-out as you go forward?",127
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2020",2020-10-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2200.0,2154203.0,84652001.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,9,"Sure, Doug. One last comment I forgot to mention to Brian on his last question is the fact that a lot of that heightened demand so far come in Q2 and Q3 when we tend to have excess capacity before Q4. So that's another source of leverage, especially in non-peak quarters. 
As far as guidance is concerned, again, I think the -- there's a lot of uncertainty certainly in Q4. We generally have a lot of uncertainty around the holiday, things from holiday spending to what our cost to fulfilled normal orders would be, weather issues that can come up. This year is an election year, we saw some disruption in 2016. So there's a whole host of issues that generally come to bear in Q4. I think the fact that COVID is dwarfing all of those is causing us a lot of uncertainty on our top line range. 
We do see continuation -- we saw a continuation in Q3 of some really good trends from Q2, and we projected those into Q4. Some of the negative factors that you mentioned as far in profitability is, again, the -- we'll see more of the capital investment and the people investment. We had added a lot of people in the last quarter, and then we added another 100,000 people in October so far. So there's that. 
There's -- generally, the dynamics of Prime Day, because it's a deal-oriented time period, that's usually not the highest margin period, and that is shifted into Q4. But generally, we have -- really, because of the calendar this year, we have really built our capacity both in facilities and people and are carrying it through the entire quarter. We carried it through Prime Day, and now we're carrying it through into the rest of the quarter. I think in other quarters, you might have seen a more gradual buildup that would have occurred through October and been probably maximized in November and December. 
So that is the -- that's what I would tell you on holiday. Again, we have a normal caveat, so there's a lot of uncertainty and things that could go right and wrong. So that's why we put a range around it. And I'm sorry, could you repeat your second question?",379

18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2020",2020-10-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2200.0,2154203.0,84652003.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,11,"Sure. I think some of the investment, things like grocery delivery and that capacity, are things that we would have invested in over time, and they're being matched by higher order volumes. So our intent is to continue to deliver a great grocery delivery experience for our customers. So that is a little bit of a pull forward. 
Yes, on -- we did expect to build out our logistics capacity a lot this year, especially as we had been -- excuse me, as we had been rolling out 1-day delivery the middle of last year. That was setting us up for a big build this year. 
So we pulled forward a bit from 2021 into this year to satisfy the demand. I think we have a -- the logistics team is really good at one way locking up long-term commitments on space and buildings, but on the other hand, being able to adjust the time line in or out to match capacity and demand. I think at this point, we are not trying to cut it close, and we are erring on the side of having too much demand -- or excuse me, too much capacity. And we think that's the right call. It has been this year. And we'll adjust as we get through the holiday, we'll learn a lot more. Hopefully, the pandemic -- we'll be in better shape as a country and globe in Q1 of next year, but it's very reactionary at this point. We've got to play the hand that we're dealt, and we're trying to anticipate and keep the customer insulated from any variability. But it's challenging, certainly.",274
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2020",2020-10-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2200.0,2154203.0,84652004.0,Question and Answer Operator Message,Operator,,Operator,12,Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.,10

When you look at 3Q of the environment, can you help us kind of understand the best you can quantify how much of the incremental unit sales do you think are being aided by COVID? Or how much is it just a natural recurring shift online that could recur and continue to grow next year? Any thoughts on that? 
And then same type of question for the cloud. With -- I'm guessing there's some headwinds of lower transaction volumes for some of your customers, and then maybe there's more demand from the work-at-home environment. So if you could give us any thoughts on both retail and cloud and how COVID is impacting it. And could there be -- how that will impact next year?",125
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2020",2020-10-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2200.0,2154203.0,84652006.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,14,"Sure. It's hard to predict. I would say that there's been phases of this year last -- or excuse me, early on, there were a lot of stock ups of groceries and other household supplies followed by a wave of people buying gloves and disinfectant wipes and masks, and that may be a bit of a bubble that people are not going to buy as much next year. Hopefully, that would be a good problem to have if those demand -- that demand went down. 
But otherwise, we're seeing Prime member engagement. So it's strengthening our Prime program. We're adding -- the renewal rates are going up, and the engagement is going up. And so people are buying more frequently and across more categories, they're using more of our digital benefits. So we like the trends on kind of connectiveness to our Prime program, and we think that will have lasting value. 
When things open up a bit more and there's more store options for people to buy from, there will be leveling of volume back to the stores, I would imagine. But so we think the trends are good. They've been pulled forward probably a bit from our -- the adoption curves have been pulled forward from our pre-COVID thinking, especially on things like grocery delivery. 
So your second question on the cloud. Cloud is a mixed bag right now because, I mean we're very happy with the cloud performance, and we're seeing a lot of customers who are now moving to cloud at a faster pace. They've accelerated their plans. There's anomalies in different industries going on this year. Things like travel and hospitality are down. A lot of companies are in a holding pattern in middle, and some are doing really well, things like video conferencing and gaming and remote learning and things tied to entertainment. 
So I would say the majority of the companies, though, are looking for ways to cut down on expenses. Going to the cloud is a good way to cut down on expenses long term. They're trying to cut down on their short-term costs in the cloud by tuning their workloads, and we're helping them do that and doing the best we can to help them save short-term dollars, and again, tune their usage against some of our benchmarks. So we think that is good for the customer, and that's -- therefore, it would be good for us long term. 
But even despite those actions, we had strong growth. The year-over-year growth in absolute dollars this quarter were the largest we've ever seen, and we feel good about the state of the business and the state of our sales force and their ability to drive value during this period. We've seen a lot of companies extending their contracts with us. The backlog of multiyear deals has gone up quite a bit. So it's good from a customer connectiveness standpoint. Certainly, each industry is going through different dynamics right now.",497

I just want to add to that. You can see a number of those significant new commitments of customers called out in the release of carrier, global payments, a number of others. They're also seeing some good engagement with governments. They're recognizing the need to transform tech -- get their technology more nimble and innovative. Schools and universities are planning for online learning. So a lot of help we can work with customers to provide there. 
And on the -- kind of from a product perspective, we're seeing significant momentum with our AWS design Graviton2 processors. So you've got customers like SmugMug and Netflix and there's many others, but they're realizing up to 40% better price performance from the newer Amazon EC2s, the MRCT instance families, so when you compare that to the x86-based instances. So those Amazon EC2 instance families are all powered by our -- the newer AWS design Graviton2 processors. So really pleased with what we're seeing there in that engagement as well.",174

Just a couple of things I want to -- kind of related. How should we think about where capacity utilization of the fulfillment infrastructure is at this point with the wave of growth that we've seen and the wave of new warehouse announcement? What kind of CapEx is going to be necessary to sort of bring you back to what you would consider normal levels that you're -- that you'd be growing from? 
And then there's obviously been a lot of discussion around the capacity limitations that third-party shipping networks are going to see this holiday season, given demand. How much of an issue do you see that as being -- and given your investments in your own delivery capacity, does that become a competitive advantage for you during the holiday?",132

I'll start with that last one. Yes, I know they're all intertwined here. So the third-party shipping, we rely on third-party shippers. We have great partnerships around the globe with third-party shippers, and we know that their capacity will be tight, as well ours. We do feel good that we've invested quite a bit in our own capacity. And you just mentioned that about half of our Ops CapEx is going to expand in transportation. A lot of the people that we're hiring are also focused on transportation. So we feel good that we've been able to develop that capability a lot this year because we've needed it, and we're going to need it in Q4. 
Having said that, it's going to be tight for everyone. And I think it's -- we'll all be stretched, and it's advantageous to the customer and probably to the companies for people to order early this year. But regardless of the order pattern, we're going to do our best to get the usual excellent service to our customers. 
On CapEx levels, again, we've grown our infrastructure -- excuse me, our fulfillment and logistics infrastructure 50% this year. We'll see again what that implies for next year. We do see continued expansion and CapEx specifically in our transportation area. So that will be the start of probably a multiyear period where we're higher on CapEx for that. But we'll see. We're -- right now, we're just focused on Q4 and giving the guidance for Q4. 
Your question on capacity utilization, it's been very tight this year. Certainly, we were able to fill up a lot of our -- any excess capacity in Q2 and Q3 that might have seasonally been excess. As we get into Q4 and everything stepping up, we're adding it and using it simultaneously. We had a really good test for Prime Day, and we feel good about the performance of the network, and we continue to add on top of that. So lots of excitement around the holiday, and -- but we feel we're in good shape and ready to go.",353

How should we think about these $4 billion expenses in the fourth quarter, the $7 billion year-to-date? Like, do you view them more as onetime-ish or just overall increases as you build out the network? Are they structured or onetime-ish? I really want to get at that. 
Secondly, international segment has been nicely profitable or reasonably profitable for 2 quarters in a row. Is there some reason to think that, that's sustainable? 
And then, I'm sorry, a third question. The other revenue growth accelerated to 49%. Can you give any color behind that?",96
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2020",2020-10-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2200.0,2154203.0,84652013.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,21,"Mark, thank you. Let me start with the COVID question. So we have -- again, our expenses in Q3 were estimated to be 2.5 -- around $2.5 billion, and we're seeing closer to $4 billion in Q4. The majority of that is due to the expansion of our operations. So things like productivity that -- there's productivity drags for things like new hire ramps, social distancing, extending break periods. Things that we can quantify that say, look, this is a change in our process that has hurt productivity. We also have costs related to -- there's more -- so those are calculated a bit. There's more direct costs around cleaning and supplies, testing. And those are the main things, I would say. 
So what we're trying to do by capturing these costs is to show what is, we believe, is incremental. And the intent is that these -- for our own knowledge as well that these will -- once the pandemic is over, hopefully that soon, that these should be costs that don't recur, okay? 
We know, though, simultaneously, there are some benefits going on right now. There's things like in Q2, we had lower marketing expense. You see that in our trends. It's starting to come back in Q3 and Q4 to more normalized levels. But certainly, everyone -- there was not a lot of requirements or need to do marketing this year, for parts of the year. We've saved nearly $1 billion in travel this year because travels ground to a halt, internal travel, travel and expenses. So there's things like that, that will resume at a later date and maybe not get to the same levels as the past, but they will be -- they won't be as artificially low as this year. 
So we're trying to be transparent as best we can on the cost we're seeing. We're always netting against some of the favorabilities from demand and some of those other costs that might be offsetting all, but they're not offsetting to the extent that COVID costs are sitting there. 
And then I will point to the fact that we are -- because we're running at such a high level and a consistently high level really in off-peak periods, we have been able to run these warehouses very efficiency -- efficiently. You have to split the discussion kind of between the cost penalty on the COVID-related issues, but then there's certainly been some favorability from running assets at more full-out condition, okay? So hopefully, that gives you some color on it. 
International segment profitability, yes, I would say -- and I think we discussed this a bit last quarter. We're seeing an advancement of volume and very strong volume, if you will, in -- especially in our countries in Europe and Japan, that so we may be putting away future volume onto this year's cost structure. So that is probably why you're starting to see -- that is why you're seeing profitability in international. 
I would say generally, we are still investing ahead of the U.S. in a lot of dimensions internationally, things like Prime benefits, things like the devices, things like international expansion. You might have seen that we just launched in Sweden yesterday. So there's a lot of competing factors going on right now internationally. But I think right -- because of the high volumes and the leverage we're seeing, particularly in places like the U.K. and Germany, that it's creating profitability ahead of schedule, if you will. 
But we feel good about the level of investment. That's continued, and we see that we're committed to continuing that even after the pandemic. And included in the international segment, of course, is India where we've had -- we had a very strong Prime Day, and Diwali is off to a good start. 
And so anyway, the third comment was on other revenue. Yes, that is essentially going to be mostly advertising, and we had a very strong advertising performance in Q3, so a continuation of the trends that we saw in Q2. We start to see advertising budgets increase from some of the contraction that has occurred earlier in Q2. And we just had a lot more traffic, and we do a good job of turning that traffic into valuable real estate for our advertisers and for our customers to get -- to find out more about selection and brand discovery. So most of that is -- it was a strong quarter in advertising, and that's what you're seeing in the other revenue line.",760

One following up on Mark's question on the advertising side. We continue to see you guys innovate a lot on the product side, especially with programmatic advertising, video advertising. Can you just give us a little bit of a sense of how you see the advertising offering both on Amazon and off Amazon sort of evolving years ahead? 
And the second question would be coming back, Brian, to your comments in the opening remarks around Prime Video and all the consumption you've seen globally in the recent past. How does help inform what you think about in terms of the opportunity to invest against original content to continue to drive that sort of media consumption loop within the Prime membership?",125

Eric, I'll start off with the questions on advertising. So I just agree on you, I think our main priorities here with this space, and some of these probably aren't too surprising, is we're focused on making our tools easier to use. So both on the sponsored ads, sponsored brand side, updating sponsored product targeting, working on just simplifying registration for agencies and marketers, getting them set up. 
But we're also very focused on being smarter about servicing more relevant ads to customers, making display ads easier and then increasing usability of the Amazon demand-type platform. So we've been working on a number of those areas. And then developing new products. And a lot of that is focused around how are we serving brands from various areas, Twitch, sponsor brands, the stores, of course. So other interesting areas. So it's -- we're certainly in a unique position to be able to provide measurement services that help all these brands sort of understand the impact of other advertising in ways that are going to help them grow their business. 
Video, you mentioned, I think video is one that we're working hard on with some of the OTT video advertising opportunities there. I'm seeing some good momentum with that. We offer inventory in the IMDb TV ad-supported space and on some 3P apps, both on and off the Fire TV. So a lot of, I think, good momentum there and a lot of good learnings on some of those initiatives there. I probably won't say too much about what will look like next year in the future, but that gives you kind of a sense of priorities where we're spending our time and focus on.",285

So step back, our goal is to deliver high quality and fresh content to our global Prime base member base. We're doing that by producing top-tier U.S. content that we show globally and then we augment that with local originals in each region. If we do that job well, we've seen it as a very significant acquisition channel for new Prime members, especially in many smaller countries around the world. You see higher free trial conversion rates, higher membership renewal rates and then higher overall engagement, as I mentioned, in Q3 specifically. And when they do that, the more engaged they are, we know that, that turns into more sales on Amazon. And that's -- it's a self-reinforcing loop. 
So we're very happy with the video performance, particularly during this period. I think people have gotten a really good chance to test out the content. Maybe people hadn't used -- Prime members hadn't used that benefit as much in the past, given it another look and have really found value in it. We're in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide. And again, we're seeing some really interesting localized content developing in places like India, Brazil, Mexico, Australia, U.K. and Spain, which I think the customers in those countries really appreciate.",217
