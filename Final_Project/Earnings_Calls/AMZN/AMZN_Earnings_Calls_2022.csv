Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2020. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, February 3, 2022, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now I'll turn the call over to Brian.",358
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2022",2022-02-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2538.0,2484864.0,94245650.0,Presenter Speech,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,2,"Thank you for joining us today. Let me start by once again acknowledging and thanking our employees around the world for their efforts. This was the second holiday season during this pandemic, and it required exceptional collaboration and coordination among our employees and business partners to prioritize both safety and customer experience. The team did a great job of delivering for customers this holiday.
Now let's discuss our fourth quarter financial results. For the fourth quarter, net sales were $137.4 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We continue to focus on offering the best experience for our customers across our businesses. On the consumer side, we welcomed millions of new Prime members in both the United States and international during the quarter, while continuing to see consistently high member renewal rates across geographies. Our third-party sellers, in particular, benefited from strong customer demand this holiday season. 3P sellers provided 56% of all unit sales in the quarter, the highest fourth quarter mix ever. And AWS saw a continuation of the strong usage and revenue growth we've seen throughout 2021. AWS added more revenue year-over-year than any quarter in its history, and it's now a $71 billion annualized run rate business, up from $51 billion run rate 1 year ago.
Even on a large base, revenue increased 40% year-over-year. As I've mentioned in prior calls, we also encourage you to look at the multiyear compounded annual revenue growth rate since the onset of the pandemic to better put this revenue growth in perspective. Despite lapping 2020's extraordinary sales growth, we continue to see an increase in customer demand and sales during the remainder of 2021, even as the economy opened back up. For Q4, Amazon's 2-year annual compounded growth rate was 25%, excluding impacts from foreign exchange, consistent with our rate in the third quarter. We've invested significantly to keep pace with this demand, including nearly doubling our operations capacity in the past 2 years, expanding our fulfillment center footprint while adding significant transportation assets to ensure fast on-time delivery. There are now 1.6 million Amazon employees worldwide, also doubling in the 2-year period. Our fourth quarter operating income was $3.5 billion.
As we mentioned in the last earnings call, we did see more than $4 billion in costs from inflationary pressures and loss productivity and disruption in our operations. The inflation primarily relates to wage increases and incentives in our operations as well as higher pricing from third-party carriers supporting our fulfillment network. Loss productivity and network disruptions were driven primarily by labor capacity constraints due to challenges in staffing up our facilities for peak. This is driven by the very tight labor market in the second half of 2021 and more recently by the emergence of the Omicron variant. We do expect these cost challenges to persist into Q1, albeit adjusted for lower seasonal volumes relative to the fourth quarter.
Our results also include approximately $1 billion year-over-year negative impact from lower fixed cost leverage in our fulfillment network. Recall that we saw very high unit volumes for most of 2020 and the first half of 2021 and that fulfillment network was running at close to 100% capacity during this time. Now with more normal fulfillment capacity, our operating leverage decreases versus the comparable prior year periods. We expect to continue to see some negative year-over-year impact from this in Q1 of 2022. While we navigate these near-term headwinds, the fundamentals of our retail business are strong and we are optimistic about a number of growth businesses and a strong innovation pipeline. AWS delivered another strong quarter of growth as enterprises and developers continue to look to AWS for critical innovative cloud solutions.
Now to $71 billion annualized revenue run rate, AWS revenue grew 40% year-over-year in Q4, our fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth rate acceleration. We hosted our Tenth re:Invent conference in the quarter, welcoming 26,000 in-person attendees and hundreds of thousands who attended virtually. Re:Invent remains a highlight of the year for us because it's a great opportunity to introduce new services while engaging with customers and partners to better inform where we should be focusing next. We announced more than 115 new services and features during the event as businesses spanning all major industries continue to choose AWS as their technology provider to speed up innovation in their organizations. 
In the past quarter alone, NASDAQ announced a multiyear partnership to migrate North America markets to AWS, including their matching engine. Best Buy selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider for cloud infrastructure services. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp selected AWS as its long-term strategic cloud provider to accelerate artificial intelligence research and development. Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler Dodge, Fiat, Jeep and Ram selected AWS as its preferred global cloud provider for vehicle platforms to accelerate new digital products and upskill global workforce. You can find more examples in our earnings release of how the world's largest companies such as Adidas, Goldman Sachs, Pfizer, Rivian and more are using AWS to transform their businesses.
Overall net income was $14.4 billion in the fourth quarter. While we normally focus our comments on operating income, I'd point out that this net income includes a pretax valuation gain of $11.8 billion related to our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive, which completed its initial public offering in November.
Before we move to Q&A, there are 3 additional items I'll mention related to our disclosures. First, we are now separating advertising services revenue from other revenues as part of our revenue disclosures by groups of similar products and services. This updated presentation is provided in the supplemental financial information included in our earnings release. We're excited to continue innovating in areas like sponsored ads, streaming video and measurement. Of course, advertising only works to be making -- useful for Amazon customers. When we create great customer experiences, we deliver better outcomes for brands. Second, we're prospectively updating the useful life of our servers and networking equipment, beginning in January. As a practice, we monitor and review the useful lives of our depreciable assets on a regular basis to make sure that our financial statements reflect our best estimate of how long the assets are going to be used in operations.
We are increasing the useful life for servers from 4 years to 5 years and network equipment from 5 years to 6 years. As a result, our first quarter guidance includes an approximate $1 billion of lower depreciation expense. We expect the quarterly impact of this change to decrease throughout the year. Although we're calling out an accounting change here, this really reflects a tremendous team effort by AWS to make our server and network equipment last longer. We've been operating at scale for over 15 years, and we continue to refine our software to run more efficiently on the hardware. This then lowers stress on the hardware and extends the useful life, both for the assets that we use to support AWS' external customers as well as those used to support our own internal Amazon businesses.
And finally, we will increase the price of Prime in the United States in Q1. We continue to make Prime better. In recent years, we've added more product selection available with fast free unlimited shipping, more exclusive deals and discounts and more high-quality entertainment, including TV, movies, music and books.
Since 2018, Prime Video has tripled the number of Amazon Originals. In this September, Prime Video will also release the highly anticipated The Lord of The Rings, The Rings of Power and become the exclusive home of Thursday Night Football as part of an historic 11-year agreement with the National Football League. Since 2018 in the U.S., availability of same-day delivery has expanded from 48 metropolitan areas to more than 90. Items available for Prime free shipping have increased over 50%. And members have saved billions of dollars shopping on Prime days.
This is all on top of new program benefits like prescription savings and fast free delivery from Amazon Pharmacy and the continually growing Amazon music catalog for Prime members as well as Prime Reading and Prime Gaming. With the continued expansion of Prime member benefits, and the increased member usage that we've seen as well as the rise in wages and transportation costs, Amazon will increase the price of a Prime membership in the United States with the monthly price going from $12.99 to $14.99 and the annual membership going from $119 to $139. This is our first price increase since 2018.
For new Prime members, the price change will go into effect on February 18. For current Prime members, the new price will apply after March 25 on the date of their next renewal. With that, let's move on to Q&A.",1473

18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2022",2022-02-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2538.0,2484864.0,94245652.0,Question,Eric Sheridan,,Analysts,4,I want to come back to the comments in the release by Andy on same-day delivery. Can you talk a little bit about how many of those investments might be behind you versus ahead of you with respect to same-day delivery and how that sets the company up with respect to either consumption behavior by consumers versus the competitive dynamic you're seeing against elements of like omnichannel and last mile delivery competitors.,73
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2022",2022-02-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2538.0,2484864.0,94245653.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,5,"Eric, sure thing. So on same-day, again, there's multiple levels of fast shipping here from ultrafast, which is essentially our grocery business in 1 to 2 hours to same day and less and then 1 day and 2-day Prime. We feel good about where we are. We're continuing to build capacity that enables us to hit those cutoffs. I think his comments were more around getting us back to our pre-pandemic levels for 1-day delivery and improving upon that and then getting same-day to more and more metropolitan areas. We're doing that globally as well, but we really think that, that combination of speed for different product levels or product line, excuse me, really resonates with customers.
And there's a lot of new offers for free -- or excuse me, generally free shipping on a fast basis. But we know how hard this is. And our goal is to do it and do it at a price that we can make money on as well and our cost structure commensurate with that. So that's where the difficult work comes in, but we like the progress we've made developing our Amazon Logistics capability over the last few years. And what we've been adding, as we've mentioned, we've doubled the capacity in the network over the last 2 years. That is not all just to handle today's volume. It's also to handle getting closer to the customer and being able to ship faster. So we like where we stand. We know there's work to do on improving our customer service. We like the progress we've been making lately, but we think the future is bright in that dimension.",276

Brian, the first one, there's a lot that's changed within the retail business, sort of pre-pandemic, post-pandemic more same-day, more grocery, more last mile investments in an ad business. Curious to hear, as you sort of you think about the long-term profitability of the retail segment, has your view about how you think about long-term profitability or cash flow retail fallen at all post pandemic because of the higher required investments is the first one. 
Then the second one, like the new disclosure, I'd be curious for any other disclosure about the number of engineers or the size of the teams you are working on a lot of the innovation that you talked about that are sort of more around early-stage nonrevenue-generating projects, we can better understand that investment in Amazon.",134
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2022",2022-02-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2538.0,2484864.0,94245656.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,8,"Sure. On the second one, we have a history of making long-term bets for customers, and some of those fall into very small short-term revenue businesses. They'll generally roll up into other revenue, which you see as very small after we've separated out advertising. So I think that you do see it in our revenue disclosure generally. But a lot of our profitability is shown at the segment level, and we'll continue to do that with the revenue disclosure. 
You asked about the business model. I think it's a good question. And we are -- as we reflect over the last 2 years, we are encouraged by a lot of things. You ticked them off there, the adoption of digital benefits, the use of grocery and how valuable that's become to customers, not to mention the acceleration of companies going to the cloud. The ability to double our fulfillment capacity over that time period, including making major strides in our Amazon Logistics sets us up well for the future. And -- but we've been also dealing with a lot of disruption during this time period.
So the early wave disruption was handling volume without the capacity to handle it. And then quickly playing catch-up. And as that was starting to improve, labor took a turn in the United States, especially labor availability, and we've really had to scramble to add workers.  We've been successful at it. We added over 273,000 employees in the last half of last year. But I think if you look at the prior year, it was over 400,000. So there's a lot of expansion that's been going on in the network. And we feel good about the basic contributors of profitability.
There's -- if you step back, there's procurement margin and working with vendors and sellers as well. There's fees in some cases, for 3P services and Prime, as we just mentioned is going up. Advertising has certainly added a layer of contribution over the last few years. But again, that only works and is only successful if we make it a good customer experience. So we're really working hard to do that. And that becomes a part of our ability to offer lower prices, better selection and more convenience.
So if you take those, those are all stable and strengthening areas. It's really the ones -- our onus is to get our operational efficiency back in all of our areas of cost. We have, again, built a lot of capacity. We've hired a lot of people. Some of those people are still -- our teams are all battling Omicron right now. But we do see the sun coming out and getting better here over the next number of quarters, and that's going to be where we're going to put a lot of our effort.",469
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2022",2022-02-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2538.0,2484864.0,94245657.0,Question and Answer Operator Message,Operator,,Operator,9,Our next question is from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.,9

I believe you're about 2.5 years into this investment cycle. Where is Amazon in terms of emerging from this investment cycle, can you see a slowdown in that big investment spending this year?",48
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2022",2022-02-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2538.0,2484864.0,94245659.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,11,"Yes. Let's talk a little bit about capital expenditures. And I'm going to do this with the inclusion of equipment finance leases, which is the residual that we sometimes lease on our infrastructure assets. We're doing less of it now, but we still do some and have done it historically. 
So when you look at those numbers and how they've grown over the last few years, I'll give you the proportions, which I'm not sure we've initially shown before is about 40% -- just under 40% of that CapEx is going into infrastructure, most of it's feeding AWS, but also certainly, Amazon is a large customer of that as well as we build infrastructure for ourselves directly or through AWS. About just under 30% is fulfillment capacity building warehouses -- warehouse only, not transportation. And then just under 25% is transportation capacity and building out our AMZL network, principally globally. The remaining 5% or so is small things like offices and stores and other capital areas. But those are the 3 main areas.
If I look to the future, we're still working through some of our plans for 2022, but it's coming into focus a bit. We see the CapEx for infrastructure going up. We still have a very fast-growing business this growing globally, and we're adding regions and capacity to handle usage that still exceeds revenue growth in that business. So we feel good about making those investments.
On the fulfillment center side, that's about 30% of the spend in the last 2 years. We see that moderating and that will probably now match growth of our underlying businesses. I think there's always things that can tick up that growth rate, things like expansion of our FBA business, expansion of cube that maybe not be different than the square footage. So there's -- we want to have capacity to have a healthy retail and FBA business because that fuels prime in 1-day delivery and 2-day delivery and same-day delivery. So that's very important. But we see the FC piece likely moderating this year. 
And then the third piece is transportation. We still see additional levels of investment in that in 2022.  So if you wrap that up, we expect CapEx including equipment finance leases to increase year-over-year. I can't give you the exact percentage, but hopefully, it gives you a little more dynamic on what -- how we approach it.",401

Just talk to whether there are any real surprises to you. So it looks like you had a little bit greater leverage than you may have thought. And then use that to help us think about what the -- I think you said the sun is coming out. Financially, does that mean that we're going to have a kind of nice improvement in operating margins as we go through the year as some of those temporary costs get temporized and you get to absorb some of the more fixed costs? So just talk about where the surprise was in terms of those costs that you laid out for the December quarter, the $6 billion? And how should -- we should think about those playing out as we go forward?",147
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2022",2022-02-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2538.0,2484864.0,94245662.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,14,"Okay, Mark. Just remember that I'm sitting in Seattle. So my view of the sun coming out is a little different than perhaps where you are. But we do see things improving. We do -- let's step back to Q4. We had said that we would have about $4 billion of additional costs due to labor shortages and the inefficiencies of that cause as well as increased labor rates and shift differentials of premiums and external transportation costs. We came in just slightly over that $4 billion. I think things went as expected. I would say that the hiring was strong, but we could have done better. We could have had more people, so we had to cover a lot of -- there was additional overtime. There are some higher cost on third-party transportation.
But all in all, the challenge in Q4 was to staff raise or excuse me, increase the staffing and we said we wanted to add 150,000 people or more. We added net-net of about 140,000 in the quarter, 273,000 in the second half of the year.
So as you turn the page into 2022, we feel good -- better about labor except Omicron has kicked up, and now you have a different type of labor issue where there's a lot of people who are on leave of absences and short term as they work to have a positive test on COVID and can get back into the workforce and protect their fellow workers. So there's instances where you're paying twice or 3 times for the same labor hour if someone is on leave you're paying them and you're also paying potentially for someone who's covering the shift on over time.
So there's cost pressure in Q1. I think the good news is that the labor challenge is not as great in Q1 as it is in Q4 -- Q3 and Q4. So we're hopeful on that. We have to work to now make our operations more efficient as we get staffing levels up. And we're going to plow a lot of our effort into increasing our transportation speeds and beating our pre-pandemic levels. So there's a lot of different challenges going on right now. The team has been working heads down for over 2 years now. So they need -- we've got a great team, and we have confidence that we will -- things will improve as we get through the year. So hopefully, that answers your question.",412

Wondering if you could talk about maybe more specifically the drivers, that acceleration. Is the application layer maybe now large enough where you're seeing that contribute incrementally to growth. And I think in the release, you also highlighted infrastructure expansion globally. I think it might be interesting to add some context around the scale or distribution of the AWS business internationally outside of North America, if you could put some context around that.",85
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2022",2022-02-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2538.0,2484864.0,94245665.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,17,"Sure, Colin. Thanks for your questions. On the growth rate, I think it's a combination of things. We've been adding resources in sales and marketing over the last few years, and that is starting to pay off. There was some cutback in spending in the early parts of 2020 that we're lapping as people -- different companies have different COVID experience, some their volumes went through the roof, some their volumes went through the floor. 
So as things have stabilized, I think the lasting thing is that a lot of people made the commitment to go to the cloud, better understood the benefits of that and probably accelerated their internal time lines for that. And we're there to help, and we're working very hard to make that journey a successful one and we have a strong team of sales and marketing professionals to help as well as technical advisers. 
So that is what we're seeing, and we're pleased with the acceleration in the business the last 4 quarters.  We will see -- we're also pleased with the efficiency of the infrastructure investment, as I mentioned, the expansion of useful life is not done on an accounting basis unless you have proof that it's actually -- we're seeing it in real life. So very positive indicators in AWS.",217

Just following up on the international point, what we're seeing outside of the U.S. I mean we are -- as part of that overall strong growth, we are continuing to see considerable momentum really around the world. It's customers moving their workloads over to AWS at different phases. And so as you look at the release, some of the other announcements, there's a good diverse list of companies, Adidas in Germany migrated its SAP environments to AWS, in the Netherlands, Stellantis selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider. There's a number of really great companies examples doing different big things at different stages of that migration.
What's been important to us, amongst many things is continuing to expand our global infrastructure footprint really to support this momentum we're seeing. So just this last quarter in the fourth quarter, we opened the Asia Pacific region over in Jakarta. And we've got announcements for plans to launch in Canada in the Calgary region next year or perhaps I think it's 2023 or 2024. So a lot of work and a lot of momentum. Those are just a few examples. But where we sit now, it's AWS has 84 availability zones in 26 regions around the world right now. And just in terms of the forward-looking road map, we have announced to launch 24 more zones in 8 more regions, and those will be here in the next couple of years.",242

The growth slowed there even on a 2-year stack. So maybe if you could talk about some of the factors that you think could be weighing on that? And then just on AWS, you kind of laid out some color there. Is there any bottlenecks to growth that you're still seeing? I mean you talked about why this was a very good quarter and having to do with some of the comps, but any bottlenecks to grow, either supply chain or employee related?",97

No, we don't see bottlenecks on the capacity side or -- probably the limiter in that business is our ability to work with customers to accelerate their time lines. So we're investing and working hard to do that. So -- but operationally, we continue to add capacity, as I mentioned, on the capital section -- capital discussion, and we expect that to increase year-over-year in 2022.
On 3P, the -- I think what you're seeing is a decreasing growth rate, much like the rest of the business, as I mentioned earlier, we're dealing with the very high growth period from Q3 of 2020 through Q1 of 2021. So -- but on a 2-year basis, you're still seeing 31% compounded annual growth in the 3P sellar services revenue. Granted that was in the -- it was 34% last quarter, but it's maintaining. I think the bigger point is that sellers were definitely big winners in Q4. The percentage of units up to 56% was a record for 3P. We continue to invest a lot to make sellers -- help sellers be successful on our site. They're a big consumer of advertising as well because they use it to build their brands and add -- enable customers to see their selection and make purchases. So we're very happy with the third-party seller services businesses and again, looking for ways to help sellers to be successful.",240

Maybe I'll talk about advertising services. What -- maybe tell us why you decided to break it out, if you haven't already? And then how much Prime Day might have been a factor in the deceleration. But bigger picture, how much room does that line have to grow bigger than GMV growth? How do we think about where you are on penetration on that?",65
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2022",2022-02-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2538.0,2484864.0,94245674.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,26,"Yes. Let me start with why we broke it out. We've looked at the proportion of other revenue that is advertising services. And we got to a point where I had been pretty much mentioning every quarter that for the majority of that line item was advertising revenue. And we feel to a certain size that we should break it out and split the other half of that. So that was really the impetus for the change and we look at those things every year and end of year was a good time to do it as we start 2022. 
So hopefully, that's helpful for you to understand the growth rate without having to impute it from the other revenue. The growth rate in the quarter is 33%. It was down from 66% in Q4 of last year. Q4 last year obviously had Prime Day in it for first time. And Prime Day carries a lot. I can't scale it for you, but there's a lot of advertising tied to Prime Day, obviously.
So when that moves quarters, it generally has an impact on the run rates. We saw that a bit in Q2 of this year when we did have Prime Day, it was lapping -- Q2 2021 was lapping, the 2020 period that didn't have a Prime Day in it. So that will move around a bit. But I think the bigger story here is the success we're having with sellers and vendors and making that a useful product for customers.",253

We think there's great feedback loops with customers, as Brian mentioned, they keep building and making that better. That results in building more relevancy and better engaging experiences.  And again, the more we can interact with the advertisers, the customers and learn and have more opportunities to hear from them and understand that we can build better analytic tools, provide better measurement, give them better insight to performance. So really focused on serving brands. 
And it's in the sponsored ad space, but we've talked about video advertising is certainly a great opportunity.  And as we've got properties like Fire TV, IMDB TV, Twitch, live sports, a lot of exciting things that have been going on in the live sports and certainly to come this year as well, both in the NFL here in the U.S., but overseas in a number of properties, really excited to kind of work with folks.  And again, this is about delivering good recommendations to customers and helpful when they're making their purchase decisions and giving them information around that.
And that, in turn, of course, helps the advertisers as well and have a great result. So I think that's one area that we're excited about. Longer term, demand-side platform opportunities with Amazon's DSP is something that we're continuing to work on and refine and again focus on the customer as we always do.",252

First, could you discuss how supply -- the supply chain affected the business in 4Q and how we should think about perhaps impacts from supply chain issues in 1Q '22 and for the year? And then the second question would be, do you expect to increase Prime pricing in non-U.S. markets?",53
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2022",2022-02-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2538.0,2484864.0,94245678.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,30,"John, thank you for your question. First on the Prime question. We evaluate each country differently. We look at the relative price to the customer versus our cost to supply of that and the usage and the value that we're creating for customers. We felt, especially after not raising the price in the United States since 2018 that the time was right to raise it. And we think it's a much more valuable program today than it was in 2020, let alone 2018. So other countries, we'll continue to evaluate every year and nothing else to announce right now.
On supply chain, there's specific things that I think we all see in the supply chain where we're waiting for products. But as far as Amazon is concerned, we did a lot to combat the supply chain issues we saw in Q4 or anticipated in Q4. We bottled product ahead. We work with vendors to secure inventory early, some cases paid earlier, which had a working capital impact. We also worked very hard to open up channels of -- existing channels of input into the country, whether it was port capacity or vessel capacity. So we did everything. We knew how to as far as trying to get more capacity in a constrained market. And we think it worked for our customers in Q4 as challenges remain in '20, I wouldn't say we've totally passed that, but we don't expect it to be a big issue in Q1.",247

Anything you add could be great. And then just second, Brian, you mentioned the exclusive broadcast of Thursday Night Football and is one of the reasons supporting a higher price increase for Prime.
Dave, you mentioned it as an element that is a dynamic new one for the advertising business. Maybe could we just return to that point as the sort of importance of live sports in the video space is incredibly important. It is that one that you see kind of taking the business to a new level at this stage?",133

Let me start with that second question. So I didn't want to leave you with the impression that we raised prices because of Thursday Night Football. I just use that as an example of great new content that we've been investing in for Prime members to make the Prime membership more valuable as well as international sports, we had one of the highest rated games in the Q4 with, I believe, is Manchester United and -- I'm going to mix up the team, sorry.",85

Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2021. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 28, 2022, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. 
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
And now I'll turn the call over to Brian.",358

I'd like to start with a few comments on what we're seeing as we're coming out of the pandemic, both on the customer experience side and on the operating cost side in this current inflationary environment.
Let's start with demand and customer experience. Worldwide net sales in Q1 were $116.4 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This is the top end of our guidance range of $112 billion to $117 billion. Our compound annual growth since before the pandemic stands at 25%, a growth rate higher than what we were seeing before the pandemic. 
Our Prime members continue to be a key driver of growth. Prime members have meaningfully increased their spend since the start of the pandemic, and we continue to see consistently high member renewal rates. We also added millions more new Prime members during the quarter.
Throughout the past 2 years, we've seen stronger usage of Prime benefits by Prime members and a greater reliance on Amazon for their shopping and entertainment. In the first quarter, we made encouraging progress on key customer metrics. Delivery speed performance is now approaching levels not seen since the months immediately preceding the pandemic in early 2020. And we now have the widest selection ever available for Prime's fast delivery.
We have worked to protect and enhance the customer experience despite a sharp increase in costs, particularly over the past 3 quarters. We've seen a large cost to keep up with demand these past 2 years. During this period, we doubled the size of our operations and nearly doubled our workforce to 1.6 million employees. Labor and physical space are no longer the bottlenecks they were throughout much of 2020 and 2021. However, we continue to face a variety of cost pressures in our Consumer business.
We'll break these into 2 buckets: externally driven costs, primarily inflation; and internally controllable costs, primarily productivity and fixed cost deleverage. The externally driven costs are a result of intensifying inflationary pressures throughout Q1. Line haul air and ocean shipping rates continue to be at or above the rates in the second half of last year, which were already much higher than pre-COVID levels. Some of this is due to the impact of the Omicron variant in China and labor shortages at point of origin, and the start of the war in the Ukraine has contributed to high fuel prices.
For example, the cost to ship in overseas containers more than doubled compared to pre-pandemic rates. And the cost of fuel is approximately 1.5x higher than it was even a year ago. Combined with the year-over-year increases in wage inflation, these inflationary pressures have added approximately $2 billion of incremental costs when compared to last year. While we will continue to look for ways to mitigate these costs, we expect they will be around for some time. 
The next bucket of costs related to productivity and fixed cost leverage, which we consider to be more within our control and are working to reduce. These additional costs correspond to the state of the labor force and fulfillment network following 2 years of disruption and large demand variability. We now look forward to more predictability in our consumer order patterns and greater stability in our operations.
Let's start with labor. As a reminder, in the second half of 2021, we were operating in a labor-constrained environment. With the emergence of the Omicron variant in late 2021, we saw a substantial increase in fulfillment network employees out on leave, and we continue to hire new employees to cover these absences. As the variant subsided in the second half of the quarter and employees returned from leave, we quickly transitioned from being understaffed to being overstaffed, resulting in lower productivity. This lower productivity added approximately $2 billion in costs compared to last year. In the last few weeks of the quarter and into April, we've seen productivity improvements across the network, and we expect to reduce these cost headwinds in Q2.
The last issue relates to our fixed cost leverage. Despite still seeing strong customer demand and expansion of our FBA business, we currently have excess capacity in our fulfillment and transportation network. Capacity decisions are made years in advance, and we made conscious decisions in 2020 and early 2021 to not let space be a constraint on our business.
During the pandemic, we were facing not only unprecedented demand but also extended lead times on new capacity. And we built towards the high end of a very volatile demand outlook. Now that demand patterns have stabilized, we see an opportunity to better match our capacity to demand. We have lowered our operation's capital expenditures for 2022 and are evaluating other ways to increase our fixed cost leverage. We estimate that this overcapacity, coupled with the extraordinary leverage we saw in Q1 of last year, resulted in $2 billion of additional costs year-over-year in Q1. We do expect the effects of the fixed cost leverage to persist for the next several quarters as we grow into this capacity. 
When you combine the impacts of the externally driven costs and the internally controllable costs, you get approximately $6 billion in incremental costs for the quarter. Approximately 2/3 of these costs are within our control, and with demand normalizing, we remain focused on rightsizing our cost structure and driving out any cost inefficiencies.
Our guidance includes an expectation that we will incur approximately $4 billion of these incremental costs in Q2. We saw another strong quarter of innovation and customer engagement in the AWS segment, where net sales were $18.4 billion in Q1, up 37% year-over-year and now represent an annualized sales run rate of nearly $74 billion. 
Developers at organizations of all sizes, from governments and not-for-profits to start-ups and enterprises, continue to choose Amazon Web Services.  Companies like Telefonica, Verizon, Boeing, MongoDB, Amdocs, Bundesliga, Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, the NHL and THREAD announced new agreements and service launches supported by AWS. 
We also continue to build support infrastructure to best serve AWS' millions of customers. We recently completed the launch of our first 16 Local Zones in the United States with 32 more to come across 26 countries. Local Zones extend AWS Regions to place our services at the edge of the cloud near large population, industry and IT centers, expanding our infrastructure footprint and enabling customers to build with single-digit millisecond latency performance.
Last quarter, I provided some detail on our overall capital investments. So let me add to that with our current thinking. First, as a reminder, we look at the combination of CapEx plus finance leases. Capital investments were $61 billion on the trailing 12-month period ended March 31. About 40% of that went to infrastructure, primarily supporting AWS but also supporting our sizable Consumer business. About 30% is fulfillment capacity, primarily fulfillment center warehouses. A little less than 25% is for transportation. So think of that as the middle and the last-mile capacity related to customer shipments. The remaining 5% or so is comprised of things like corporate space and physical stores.
For full year 2022, we do expect infrastructure spend to grow year-over-year, in large part to support the rapid growth and innovation we're seeing within AWS. We expect infrastructure should represent about half of our total capital investments in 2022.
For the Consumer business, as I said earlier, we currently have some excess capacity in the network that we need to grow into. So we've brought down our build expectations. I'd note again that many of the build decisions were made 18 to 24 months ago, so there are limitations on what we can adjust midyear.
That said, we expect fulfillment dollars spent on capital projects to be lower in 2022 versus the prior year. We also expect transportation dollars spent on capital projects to be flat to slightly down.
Finally, I'll highlight a few additional items. We reported an overall net loss of $3.8 billion in the first quarter. While we primarily focus our comments on operating income, I'd point out that this net loss includes a pretax valuation loss of $7.6 billion included in nonoperating expense from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive. You may remember that we had a $12 billion gain on Rivian in Q4.
We also provided our second quarter financial guidance as part of our earnings release. As a reminder, our comparable period of Q2 2021 included the continuation of extraordinary net sales growth through roughly the first half of that quarter. That began to moderate in the second half as vaccines became more readily available in many countries and people started getting out of their homes.
In addition, note that this year's Prime Day sales event will occur in the third quarter, in July to be specific. Last year, in 2021, Prime Day occurred in the second quarter. Prime Day contributed about 400 basis points to our Q2 2021 year-over-year revenue growth rate.
Lastly, as you look at our Q2 operating income guidance, a reminder that we will see our seasonal step-up in stock-based compensation expense as our employees receive annual restricted stock unit grants in the second quarter. This year, we expect to see stock-based compensation expense of approximately $6 billion, up from $3.3 billion in Q1, largely reflecting wage inflation as we continue to hire and retain employees in high-demand areas, including engineers and other tech workers.
With that, let's move on to your questions.",1586

In terms of the revenue guide for the June quarter, I think it sort of implies about 3%. And if you look sequentially, if you look back at the last couple of years, the non-COVID years, the growth has been between 4% and 6%. Are you seeing signs of consumer softness or weakening? Is there any particular factor that would be -- cause your sequential growth to be lower than typical?
And then briefly on the margins for Q2. So you got $4 billion in kind of these incremental costs versus $6 billion in the March quarter, but yet your guidance year-over-year implies kind of the same sort of year-over-year margin decline, about 500 bps. Could you just explain that a little bit?",131

Customer demand does remain strong. We're seeing, again, continued strength in Prime purchases, Prime commitment levels of usage -- benefits being used, et cetera. And the big part of the year-over-year comp is that we're comping the last part of the very elevated year-over-year step-up that lasted about half of last year's second quarter, and then we move Prime Day to Q3.
So we're not seeing softness. We're cognizant of the current inflationary environment and the impact it has on consumer -- or excuse me, the household budgets. A lot of times that is the time when people come to Amazon because they know we have great prices and selection and convenience. So it can go 1 of 2 ways. But we don't see any macroeconomic factors generally in this forecast on the demand side. We definitely see it on the cost side though.",165

So as Brian said, it's the first time we've given the guidance for the second quarter, but he detailed a number of pieces. But like you said, expect to see, in aggregate, about $4 billion of pressure for the 3 buckets that Brian talked about: higher inflationary pressures, lower productivity and some fixed cost deleverage persisting into Q2. So that will be at some lower levels as we aim to and kind of expect to see some improvement in productivity, some of those other areas. We're also committed to just generally reducing variable cost per unit and working to delever our fixed costs, specifically where we have those controllable cost buckets Brian spoke about. 
The other thing -- again, Brian mentioned it towards the end there of his opening, to see that seasonal step-up in stock-based compensation expense. So recall that our employees received those RSU grants in the second quarter. This year, we expect to see the expense of approximately $6 billion. And so that's up from about $3.3 billion in the first quarter.",195

Amazon hasn't really been around during a period of high inflation. How do you think about passing through the higher input costs through pricing? When you look at your units, they're flat and you're just not seeing any price increases in there. I know FX is a headwind, but how do you think about passing that through? And when can we start to see that?
And then second question. It looks like your shipping costs are up 14% versus units flat. Probably makes sense with the input costs. But we would expect some savings as you bring a lot of that transportation in-house, a lot of the delivery in-house. Is -- are you seeing savings there? And how do you think about shipping costs versus units?",128
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2022",2022-04-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2134.0,2591535.0,97873494.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,9,"Sure. Let me make a comment on units first. If we step back, the first year of the pandemic from -- essentially from our world, from the middle of May 2020 to May 2021, we saw high growth. We went from a 20% growth rate in revenue to a 40% growth rate almost overnight and held it for a year. And then we started to lap that for the last year that will essentially end in the middle of this next month. And we -- so noted step-downs in the run rate as soon as the middle of May hit last year. 
So on the units though, units grew during that -- instead of jumping from -- to 40%, they jumped to the mid-40% to 50% range, mainly because of the product mix. People were buying a lot more gloves and cleaning agents and all the things tied to the pandemic. So there's a lot of -- you have to look at the unit data with -- keeping that in mind because there's a mix -- heavy mix issue. 
But putting all that aside, you asked the question about transportation, shipping rates. Our shipping rates are very competitive, and we are seeing savings versus what we would get from external carriers. And it's beyond that. We would not even necessarily have had the capacity to -- from external third-party providers to handle the transportation loads that we've seen in the last couple of years. 
So we're really glad that we have our -- we built our AMZL network. We would not be able to have a 1-day program, same-day, 1-day shipments if we try to deliver it with third-party shippers. It just would not be cost effective. So what you're seeing there in the growth in shipping costs versus the unit growth, a little bit on the unit side, but essentially a factor of inflation and productivity that I've mentioned to you on the component that hits in the transportation area.",331
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2022",2022-04-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2134.0,2591535.0,97873495.0,Answer,Dave Fildes,,Executives,10,"Justin, on your second point regarding inflation, of course, we've talked about we're not immune to inflationary pressures on the cost side. And with the ongoing supply chain disruptions and the start of the war in the Ukraine since our last quarter, we see larger impacts of inflation, some line haul shipping rates, fuel, shipping supplies and wages, which we talked about in some recent quarters as well. And we also see some volatility in utility pricing for some of the energy costs in operating the AWS data centers.
Now when you look at cost for customers and sellers in terms of product pricing, I'd just reinforce our pricing philosophy hasn't changed. We aim to offer low competitive pricing and try to stay on top of that pricing environment and make sure we're delivering a great price for customers. For our 1P business, that means continuing to be really competitive in that space with low prices relative to the reputable competitors out there and staying really close to that on the data. 
For third party, we don't control that price that's set by third-party sellers. So they're running their own businesses, and we'll adjust the pricing to account for inflationary costs in their environment as well. And of course, on pricing and another -- other many other services with sellers, we offer services to help them not only handle with logistics but also get better pricing information to make sure that they're staying on top of that as well. So wherever we can help them, we do that. 
We did increase some fees effective, I believe, today related to the FBA sellers and some surcharge there. We're focused on, of course, addressing permanent costs and ensuring our fees are competitive versus those charged out there by their sellers. But it's still unclear if the inflationary costs will go up or down and for how long they'll persist. So rather than a permanent fee change, we implemented that fuel and inflation surcharge for the first time. And it's, of course, a mechanism that's broadly used across the supply chain providers that are out there already, but it's the first time that we've done something like this.",365

First one, Brian, I want to ask you about 1-day, same-day. Now that you're getting inventory selection, SKU selection in some cases, back to where it was pre-pandemic, what are you seeing from a demand or an elasticity perspective as you get more inventory available for 1-day, same-day? Is it really leading to incremental sales based on your data?
And the second one, I want to ask about tech and content. It came in a little higher despite AWS costs coming in lower. Is there anything else we should sort of be thinking about in our modeling in tech and content, whether it's Kuiper or other items that are moving through that line item for the year?",120

Yes, we're approaching the service levels that we had pre-pandemic, and that's a positive sign. But this doesn't -- it doesn't turn on a dime. I think as a consumer, I noticed it myself, I see more things in stock. And I -- it opens up the consideration set for things that I may have had to run to the store to get in a short period of time. And that trust -- and you see more and more that you trust it, and you continue to order. And you then go to Amazon first and say, okay, well, it's maybe my first stop before I even think about going to the store. 
So it's a -- it has to be built over time. It doesn't take years. It takes, hopefully, weeks and months. But we're hopeful and expecting that, that will add to good elasticity, the same elasticity is that we start to see pre-pandemic.",168

Just as a reminder, the components in there is you got the Amazon tech and the AWS infrastructure, so everything from servers, network equipment, data center-related depreciation, rent utilities, those types of things, the AWS tech employee costs and costs to support the dot-com website and a number of other technology initiatives that we're working on.
For Q1, it was up about 19% year-over-year, which was down a little bit less than what you see for year-over-year growth throughout 2021. That growth rate, though, does, of course, include an offset Q1 2022 related to -- a partial offset, I should say, related to the change in estimated useful lives for servers, which was a little under $1 billion of impact in the first quarter. 
In terms of just the investment areas, I'd just reinforce it's continued investment in the tech infrastructure. One of the bigger pieces remains AWS, of course, there. And then just broadly speaking, inclusive of AWS, the headcount to support the build-out and support that the AWS team is doing as well as some consumer tech teams, Alexa and Echo devices and certain other areas there.",197

Well, let me start with productivity. We began and ended the quarter with essentially 1 billion -- excuse me, 1.6 million employees, 1.6 million employees. Most of them, of course, are in operations. During the quarter, we had a peak of 1.7 million, and we were able to work that down by the end of the quarter. So we have certain ability with contractors and all to adjust headcount. But for the most part, our employees are what we call blue badges or permanent Amazon employees. 
And now we work on getting productivity up. It's a combination of productivity at the employee level, but it's also a matter of productivity of the -- and harmonization of the network, having the right demand in the right -- excuse me, the right capacity and the right demand matched at the warehouse level and the transportation node level. 
So that's what we're working on. And we've made good strides in the last month, and we're -- we see a line of sight to getting back, not all the way to pre-pandemic rates in the next quarter or 2, but a good bit of the way. And that's what we're firmly focused on and working on, and that's in the warehouses and also in transportation. Is there a second half to that question?",221
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2022",2022-04-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2134.0,2591535.0,97873503.0,Question and Answer Operator Message,Operator,,Operator,18,Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.,10

Maybe if I could just stick on the capacity issues for a minute. In terms of the $4 billion number you're calling out, maybe the first part of the question would be, is that entirely the additional issues that are now front and center versus the issues we talked about from Q4 into first half of '22 from a logistics and supply chain standpoint, where we had talked about permanent versus transient cost nature of that $4 billion as you move through the first half of the year? So is this above and beyond that and above and beyond some of the lingering COVID costs that you had called out in prior periods? Just wanted to unpack some of the stack build of the $4 billion versus thing we already knew before. 
And then maybe following up on Doug's question and asking it a little bit differently. When you look out to the back part of the year, not asking for how you might guide, but there's a typical cadence to fulfillment expense build and employee build and headcount build into the back part of the year as you build the capacity towards the holidays. Will that have a very different cadence to it this year because you find yourself with this much excess capacity at Q1, Q2 versus prior years? Just so we can keep that front of mind.",236
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2022",2022-04-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2134.0,2591535.0,97873505.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,20,"Sure thing. Good questions, Eric. Let me start with the cost penalties. In Q4, we did mention $4 billion of cost penalties and drag on that quarter. And $1 billion of that was fixed cost deleverage, principally a combination of having enough space and having super high leverage in the prior year when we were chasing volume and had less space. And we indicated that, that would be carrying over into 2022, and it has. 
From a productivity standpoint, our issues in the second half of last year were different. They were -- we didn't have as much labor, even though we added, I believe, 200 -- I have it right here, 270,000 workers in the second half of last year. We were chasing labor, and it was creating much disruption within our network. Long zone shipments, half full trucks, all kinds of negative consequences of not having labor. But we made it through Q4 with the anticipation that we'll be able to hold our labor for Q1 and labor certainty would be a lot better and certain in our network. 
That is still the plan, and we're probably a couple of months late on that because of some of the issues with Omicron in January. And our reaction to it was that in an uncertain labor environment where a lot of people were out on leave, we hired more people and then found ourselves overstaffed when the Omicron variant subsided rather quickly, at least from our standpoint in warehouses. So the issue is switched from disruption to productivity losses to overcapacity on labor, and we believe that, that will dissipate. It will take time in Q2, but it's -- so that's not the full -- we don't get the full $2 billion back in Q2, but we will make great strides on that. 
Inflation has been in both periods. Inflation was in the transportation costs, especially in wage inflation last year. It remains there. It's been amplified a bit by the fuel costs following the Ukraine conflict, which has happened since we last spoke. So it's more a factor of -- those costs will now -- we believe, will persist a little longer than we were hoping at the beginning of the year. And I mentioned some of the per unit rates for transportation, cargo shipments and also fuel costs. Those are real, and we have to find ways to offset those or use less of high-cost things like transportation and fuel. 
So we're working on that. As we progress -- there's only guidance for Q2. But what we see is that the fixed cost deleverage will narrow as we go through the year, and we'll be really glad we have this capacity in Q3 when Prime Day hits because that's always a big surge of both inventory and orders and then definitely in the holiday season. So we will -- the way we see it is we've come out of a very tumultuous 2 years. We are glad we made the decisions we made over the past 2 years. And now we have a chance to more rightsize our capacity to a more normalized demand pattern. 
So what's left there is really inflation, and that's what we're working on and evaluating and finding ways to mitigate and, in some cases, having to pass some of the costs through to third-party sellers as well so that we're not subsidizing sales there. And then we will see. So we expect the year-over-year revenue comps to improve in the second half of the year because, again, we're passing this year of super high growth that I mentioned before from May of 2020 to May of 2021. 
But it's not like the volume has receded. Like in Q1 literally, revenue was 61% higher over 2 years from 2020. So the way to think about it is it went up and stayed up, and now it's -- it will resume a more normal growth pattern. But I wouldn't be fooled by the revenue growth rates in this difficult comp period.",677

We had what we consider to be a very strong March. It's very hard to compare year-over-year because March last year was the height of some stimulus payments in the United States. But from kind of a sequential period, we thought March was strong. So there's no indicators that we're seeing of weakness in consumer demand, but we're wary of it as probably all companies are because household budgets are tightened when fuel costs are doubling and a big part of your -- it ripples through food. It ripples through everything else. 
So we're cognizant of that. But what we'll focus on is the customer experience, continue to get our delivery times to be better and increasing selection, which is better than pre-pandemic time period, and you're making the customer experience great on a lot of dimensions.",151

Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2021. 
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 28, 2022, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. 
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. 
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services. And therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

Before we get to questions, I'll make some comments about our Q2 performance and the outlook for Q3. Let's start with Q2. 
During the quarter, we saw improvement in many of our key operational metrics, including in-stock levels and delivery speed, and saw a subsequent step-up in consumer demand. For the quarter, worldwide net sales of $121.2 billion exceeded the top end of our revenue guidance range and represented an increase of 10% year-over-year, excluding approximately 320 basis points of unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. This was a larger foreign exchange headwind than the 200 basis point impact we had incorporated into our Q2 guidance. 
As a reminder, our revenue growth accelerated to over 40% growth from the period between May 2020 and May 2021. While demand has remained strong, the lapping of this high-growth period depressed our revenue growth rate for the following 12 months, ending in May of this year. Our growth rates going forward will no longer require this historical explanation. Q2 of last year was also when vaccines have become more available, particularly in the United States, and we began to see more normal shopping patterns. Prime Day also occurred in Q2 last year and contributed about 400 basis points to our Q2 2021 year-over-year revenue growth rate. This year's Prime Day sales event occurred on July 12 and 13 and is incorporated into our third quarter guidance. 
As the impacts of the last 2 years are normalizing, we're happy with how we've served customers and how they have responded. Our compound annual growth since the start of the pandemic stands at 25%, a growth rate higher than what we were seeing prior to the pandemic. Prime members have meaningfully increased their spend since the start of the pandemic. Over that period, we've seen stronger usage of Prime benefits by Prime members and a greater reliance on Amazon for their shopping and entertainment. 
We continued to improve the customer experience in Q2, including quarter-over-quarter improvements in delivery speed and inventory in-stock levels. We have also moved quickly to adjust our staffing levels and improved the efficiency of our significantly expanded operations network. We have slowed our 2022 and 2023 operations expansion plans to better align with expected customer demand. While there's still work to be done, we made good progress in Q2. 
Our Prime membership program remains a key driver of our worldwide stores business, and we continue innovating to make the membership even more useful and valuable. That includes the upcoming premier of The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power on September 2 and exclusive access to NFL Thursday Night Football games starting September 15. 
Our seller community also had a strong Q2. Third-party sellers represented 57% of all units sold on Amazon in Q2, the highest percentage ever. Selling partners help to expand the selection we can offer customers, while Fulfillment by Amazon provides sellers the ability to offer fast delivery. 
Operating income was $3.3 billion in the quarter, above the top end of our guidance range. Last quarter, I discussed several cost pressures facing our worldwide stores business: inflationary costs, fulfillment network productivity and fixed cost deleverage. Recall that these amounted to approximately $6 billion of incremental costs in Q1 when compared to Q1 2021. We've made solid progress in reducing these costs. For the second quarter, incremental costs were in line with our expectations at approximately $4 billion when compared to Q2 2021. Inflationary pressures remained at elevated levels in Q2, similar to what we saw in Q1. These include pressures from higher fuel, trucking, air and ocean shipping rates, which we expect will continue into Q3. 
We made strides to improve fulfillment network productivity in Q2. Staffing levels were more in line with rising Q2 demand, and we saw better optimization of our fulfillment network. On the transportation side, we continued to improve delivery, route density and improved package deliveries per hour. We are encouraged by the progress during the quarter and see opportunity to further improve in the second half of the year. 
Lastly, the year-over-year negative impact of fixed cost leverage was relatively consistent with Q1. There are 2 main drivers when talking about fixed cost leverage. First is the unfavorable comparison to very high holiday-level utilization rates that we saw in the first half of 2021, and second is the normal step-down in volumes off of our Q4 peak that we saw in the first half of 2022. 
On the first point, we expect this challenging year-over-year comp will have ended in Q2. On the second point, we expect fixed cost leverage to improve in the second half of the year as we continue to grow into our capacity. We have also taken steps to slow future network capacity additions. 
Let's turn to AWS. We saw another strong quarter of innovation and customer engagement in AWS, where net sales were $19.7 billion in Q2, up 33% year-over-year, and now represent an annualized sales run rate of nearly $79 billion. AWS continues to grow at a fast pace, and we believe we're still in the early stages of enterprise and public sector adoption of the cloud. We see great opportunity to continue to make investments on behalf of AWS customers. We continue to invest thoughtfully in new infrastructure to meet capacity needs while expanding AWS to new regions, developing new services and iterating quickly to enhance existing services. 
Developers at organizations of all sizes, from governments and not-for-profits to start-ups and enterprises, continue to choose Amazon Web Services. Companies like Delta Air Lines, Riot Games, British Telecom and Jefferies Investment Bank, to name a few, announced new agreements and service launches supported by AWS. 
AWS operating income was $5.7 billion in Q2. As a reminder, this includes a portion of our seasonal Q2 step-up in stock-based compensation expense. AWS results include a greater mix of these costs, reflecting wage inflation in high-demand areas, including engineers and other tech workers, as well as increasing technology infrastructure investment to support long-term growth. 
Now let's talk about capital investments. As usual, we will discuss the combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. In 2021, we incurred approximately $60 billion in capital investments. About 40% of that is comprised of technology infrastructure, primarily supporting AWS as well as our worldwide stores business. Another 30% of the $60 billion was fulfillment capacity, and a little less than 25% was for transportation. The remaining 5% was comprised of things like corporate space and physical stores. 
For full year 2022, we do expect to spend slightly more on capital investments than last year, but the proportion of capital spending shifts among our businesses. We expect technology infrastructure spend to grow year-over-year, primarily to support the rapid growth in innovation we're seeing with AWS. We expect infrastructure to represent a bit more than half of our total capital investments in 2022. For the worldwide stores business, we've continued to moderate our build expectations to better align with customer demand. We expect the fulfillment and transportation dollars spent on capital projects to be lower in 2022 versus the prior year. 
Finally, I'd highlight a few additional items. We reported an overall net loss of $2 billion in the second quarter. While we primarily focus our comments on operating income, I'd point out that this net loss includes a pretax valuation loss of $3.9 billion, which is included in nonoperating expense from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive. In the U.S., we have started making customer deliveries using the Rivian electric delivery vehicles. This rollout is the start of what we expect to be thousands of EDVs in more than 100 cities by the end of the year and 100,000 vehicles across the U.S. by the year 2030. Additionally, note that all of our share and per share information included in our financial materials has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the 20-for-1 stock split, which was effective on May 27. 
We also provided our third quarter financial guidance as part of our earnings release. Again, a reminder that this year, our Prime Day sales event occurred on July 12 and 13 and is incorporated into our third quarter guidance. Prime Day occurred in Q2 in 2021. For revenue, note that our guidance includes an estimated approximately 390 basis points of unfavorable impact from year-over-year change in foreign exchange rates. The estimated FX impact to operating income is not significant. 
Our third quarter operating income guidance range is $0 to $3.5 billion. This compares to Q2 operating income of $3.3 billion. This third quarter guidance assumes we see approximately $1.5 billion in quarter-over-quarter sequential cost improvement in our fulfillment network operations, which we expect will be largely offset by investments in AWS and additional digital content for Prime members. 
For AWS, these quarter-over-quarter increases are primarily driven by higher infrastructure investments to support continued strong customer growth, including larger depreciation on a growing fixed asset base. We also expect increased energy costs as we continue to see volatility in utility prices around the world in operating our AWS data centers. Quarter-over-quarter increase in digital content primarily relates to new Prime video content in Q3, including Thursday Night Football and The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.

The first one, Brian, I wanted to talk a little bit about the bridge from 2Q to 3Q EBIT guide a little bit. It sounds like you're going to have revenue up nicely. You talked about the efficiencies of the $1.5 billion quarter-over-quarter and some of the incremental investments in content, et cetera. Where are the other areas where you're sort of investing more to grow? And is any of that associated with merchandise margin or step-ups in discounting? That would be the first one. 
And the second one is kind of going back to your comment about you -- how you slowed '22 and '23 operations expansion plans. How should we think about the fulfillment and transportation CapEx sort of looking into the fourth quarter into next year? How far ahead of this build have you gone through for the last, call it, 9 months?",149
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2022",2022-07-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2348.0,2608370.0,98387298.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,5,"Sure. Thanks, Brian. Let me start with your second question. So in any particular year when we're spending capital, a good portion of it, we estimate about 40% this year is being spent in support of warehouses or transportation capacity that will be opening up and effective in 2023 and beyond. So there's always a pre-spend to keep the -- again, the pipeline moving. So when we make adjustments to the time horizon, the impact is not as great as you might expect in the year 2022. But again, we have moved things out, and capital is coming down in those areas, as we just mentioned. We just have to keep you posted as we go quarter-to-quarter on what our expectations are. 
On the bridge to Q2 to Q3, so again, you have the -- mentioned 3 items, the ops improvement that we see of $1.5 billion, and offsetting that is increased costs in AWS as we build out depreciation. We also are adding -- continuing to add people in that space, product engineers, sales people, customer support. Speaking more broadly, we know AWS is a huge opportunity. It's early days in the adoption curve for companies and governments, and we invest with that confidence in mind. And customers have responded, and we're going to keep investing there. 
And your comment on discounting, we're not seeing some of the pressures that other people are seeing right now. Our macroeconomic issues are principally on inflation, and we've been pretty transparent on that. I think the new thing this quarter is additional pressure on the energy, electricity rates in our data centers because of the ramp-up in natural gas prices, if you've seen that. So that's probably the new information. And then the other inflationary factors, well, some of them are coming down slightly. There's still significantly a penalty year-over-year. 
Other cost pressures are principally on our costs in employees. If you look at our stock-based comp as a percent of revenue, it's gone up 150 basis points quarter-over-quarter as we stepped up from Q1 to Q2. We see that pattern every year, but we don't see that magnitude. And that's where a lot of our wage inflation is for, particularly our technical employees. 
So there's a certain amount of conservatism always built into this because we are in a very difficult macroeconomic state potentially. Again, it's not -- we're not seeing it hit our businesses directly. In fact, we're seeing strong growth in sales through the quarter in Q2. But we're cognizant that things could change quickly. And we'll see and monitor, and that's how we set our forward guidance.",439

Some of your peers in the cloud space have talked about some slowdown in booking rates just as customers take longer to work through deal terms and duration. I was hoping you could comment on whether AWS is seeing similar dynamics. 
And then also, when you think about margins, the 35% for AWS in 1Q going to 29% in 2Q, what are some of the puts and takes that we should think about going forward just given decreasing server life benefits and tougher macro environment?",92
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2022",2022-07-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2348.0,2608370.0,98387301.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,8,"Sure, Doug. I'll start with the second question. So on margins in AWS, yes, as you mentioned, it is dropping sequentially. The margin rate is going to fluctuate in this business. It's going to be always a factor of new investment and things like the sales force and new regions and infrastructure capacity, offset by infrastructure efficiency gains that we see, pricing issues as we extend contracts. We've seen really good progress with our customer base, longer and longer commitments, really committing to the cloud. Some of that comes with credits to help them make their conversion to the cloud. And so the revenue pattern can be -- and the margin on that revenue can fluctuate quite a bit quarter-to-quarter. But see a lot of strength in the business right now. We're very happy with the growth rate, happy with the adoption of the cloud. 
As you hit a potential rough patch in the economy, I think the last time we saw this was back in 2008-ish and started to draw lessons from that. But we did notice that it did help our cloud business at the time because, again, when you're trying to launch a new product or service and you have to -- faced with building your own data center and getting capital for a data center and building it yourself or moving to the cloud and essentially buying incremental infrastructure capacity, cloud computing really shows its value. 
So we're prepared. Just like when the slowdown in 2020, we are prepared to help customers optimize their costs. And we'll help them -- any who are scaling down. But we'll also, again, continue to sign new customers in new industries, including government agencies and happy with that. And if you looked, again, where our investment has been over the last few years in the growth of our sales force and our sales support, it is starting to -- it is showing benefits, and we expect that to continue. 
On your -- sorry, your other question was -- is that it?",341

I mean, I think just the longer-term vision that Brian talked about here, we're, right now, with 84 availability zones. So that's 26 geographic regions, and we've got plans for -- to launch 24 more of those availability zones across 8 regions. And this is Australia, Canada, India, Israel, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland, U.A.E. That's a lot of different spots. 
And so I think continuing to focus on building out, building out the customers, working on that pipeline and building longer commitments, finding customers that are making longer commitments is really important to that. And just to that point, I know the backlog figure that we've discussed in the past and disclosed on a quarterly basis in our filings, it's up 65% year-over-year or about 13% quarter-over-quarter. And the weighted average remaining life of those long-term commitments that we're talking about here continues to grow. So it's about 3.9 years on a weighted average remaining life basis. 
So again, good -- a lot of good work, a lot of still good opportunity out there to come. And as Brian talked about, we're working hard and building fast and investing in that to make sure we're in a good position to serve folks.",216

Is there any way to give us an update of how much of the advertising services line at this point is driven by North America e-commerce versus international e-commerce and how you think about the relative growth rates in advertising going forward between North America and international? 
And the second part would be away from the e-commerce-driven parts of advertising, how are you feeling about the positioning and the investments you need to make around things like connected TV and programmatic advertising where, from the outside in, it looks like you're continuing to make greater levels of investment in increasing your exposure to a wider array of advertising products?",121

Eric, thanks for your questions. I would say on the geographic split, we haven't broken that out. The majority of advertising revenue is in North America. But having said that, we are making great strides in international as well.

Dave, did you want to take the second part of that?",73
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2022",2022-07-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2348.0,2608370.0,98387308.0,Answer,Dave Fildes,,Executives,15,"Yes. I think it was -- Eric, it was a question around kind of the interactive work. I mean, we've got -- one of our main priorities is building relevant and engaging ad experiences. And so we, of course, introduced interactive ads last year for streaming video content, things like Freevee. We've got Amazon Music's ad-supported tier as well for audio ads. So looking for opportunities like that where customers can more easily engage with brands while streaming content. So I think there's a lot of good opportunity for that. But it's great. Video advertising, as you mentioned, it's still early in that space. It's increasingly becoming mainstream, and I think viewing behaviors have really shifted away from some of the more traditional cable or kind of traditional viewing. And advertisers are using our ad-supported content to reach those viewers. 
So things that are ongoing, we've talked about around Freevee, around Twitch and then, of course, some things. We're obviously excited about Thursday Night Football and Amazon streaming TV ads, capabilities that we're going to continue to work with these partners and work with our own kind of technology capabilities to keep building out.",194

Right now, we still see strong advertising growth. Again, it's got to be a positive both for the customer and for the brand. I think our advantage is that we have highly efficient advertising. People are advertising at the point where customers have their credit cards out and are ready to make a purchase. It's also very measurable. And when people are looking -- if companies are looking to potentially streamline or optimize their advertising spend, we think our products compete very well in that regard, in addition to maybe longer-term things like brand building and bringing new selection to bear in front of customers.",130

So I'd challenge the premise a little bit there about incenting mix or I believe that is how I interpreted your question. We are relatively indifferent as to whether some customer buys a third-party or a first-party product from us. What we're all about, obviously, is price selection and convenience. And 3P, it particularly helps us with selection. And when it's part of FBA, it can also help as being more Prime eligible and available to ship in 1, 2 days or whatever the Prime offer happens to be. 
So we're happy with the selection that we've added from third-party sellers. And I think that shows in the percentage mix that you see. We're proud of the investment we've made to build tools and products that allow sellers to be successful on our site, and it's a great partnership. And it's worked really well. Sellers and vendors are also some of our larger advertising customers as well and helps -- that advertising helps them surface new selection to our customer base. So it's a very strong partnership, and it's been getting stronger. And I think you'll see also that they had a very big part in our Prime Day earlier this month.",209
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2022",2022-07-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2348.0,2608370.0,98387313.0,Answer,Dave Fildes,,Executives,20,"And Jason, on your second question related to the international and the profitability there reported, there's a foreign exchange exposure there on that segment with the operating income. There's included in there about $231 million of unfavorable impact to that segment included in that $1.7 billion loss for the quarter. 
Just looking, broadly speaking, on what's going on with that business and the losses that we're seeing there and the investments, I think it's important to remember, it's early in many of our international countries, particularly in some of our emerging or more recent launch countries, places like India, Brazil, the Middle East. There are others as well, of course, but where we've been operating, in many of those cases, considerably shorter than the tenure we've had in the U.S. 
In our established international locations, U.K., Germany, Japan, over time, we've continued to improve the profitability of that business as we build out and establish stronger customer relationships and work on the cost structure and how we serve folks. A lot of that, of course, is driving improvements through our key pillars with price selection and convenience and working with vendors on commercial terms. 
In our emerging locations, there's a healthy amount of investment we've done to drive expansion, and we expect to continue to do that given the strong competition across many of these markets. And that's investments in Prime Video, not just in some of the flagship shows that are kind of sourced here in the U.S., but also you've seen us continue to push for opportunities for in-country and local language video content that resonates with customers and can be a meaningful reason people sign up for the Prime program, engage and renew. And we're also investing, depending on the regions and kind of the local structure, infrastructure, for lack of a better term, whether that's building out payment methods, third-party transportation services, even in some cases the Internet and the telecom infrastructure. So we're playing a role along with others. It's not just us investing in ways to create and enable that infrastructure to be successful. 
So those are some of the opportunities and challenges that as you think about kind of where we are in the U.S. versus international that are out there, the network complexities, of course, there are some regulatory hurdles and other differences out there. But we think it's important to continue to invest in those opportunities and learn from what we're -- not just in what we've done in the history with the U.S., but also in many of these countries and keep that flywheel spinning and continue to serve customers in more efficient ways.",444

One, can you discuss the impact the price action you took on Prime, on merchant fees, et cetera, ahead on retention during the quarter? And do you feel that, that's enough to offset the inflationary pressures we're seeing to date?
And then on Buy with Prime, I know it's early, but how do you see the rollout of this initiative from it being by invitation only today to whole merchants using FBA to off-Amazon merchants, et cetera, and just kind of the implications on -- broader implications on the business from that initiative?",97

Thank you, Youssef. So first on the -- let's take them one at a time. So on the Prime fee increase earlier in the year, we're happy with the results we're seeing in the Prime program. Prime membership and retention is still strong. I think that change has been above our expectations positively, and I think the benefit of the program continues to get better and better. And as I mentioned, in-stock has never been higher. Delivery speed is increasing. So -- not to mention a lot of the new content, especially on the video side, that will be coming in the fall. So we feel good about the program and the state of the Prime members after a very rough couple of years of pandemic turmoil, and we think it's a good base to build upon. 
So on the seller fee, again, we added that fee grudgingly in May to compensate for some of the inflationary pressures we're seeing. I don't want to give you the idea that either of those fee increases came close to covering our costs. You can see from our operating results, some of it's internally related, but a lot of it's external factors that they're -- we are not passing through that at 100% to external groups. And it's -- we've got to work our way out of the condition we're in. And we're making good progress in Q2 and expect to keep pressing on that in the second half of the year. But saw strength in the seller results in Q2, as we mentioned on the percentage mix. So I think sellers are -- sellers business remains strong and an integral part of our customer offering.",284

On your Buy with Prime question, yes, I mean, it's -- right now, it's allowing U.S.-based Prime members to shop directly from merchants on the online stores. And it's with the experience they expect and kind of come to expect with Amazon. And that's the fast, free delivery, the seamless checkout and free returns on orders that are eligible. It is -- right now, the program is available, as you mentioned, invitation-only for merchants that are already using FBA. And it will expand throughout this year as we'll extend more merchants to invite and participate in the program. 
I think it's -- we're interested in learning and working with FBA sellers that we've known and had good trust with but also expanding it. And I think as you think about it, our merchants, they obviously have a lot of choices on where they're going to sell products. And we have a long history of empowering and helping merchants. We've invested a lot in tools and capabilities and, of course, the delivery capabilities and all the things that go along with that.

So Brian, I think you just reported a quarter-on-quarter decline in head count, which was by design after what happened last quarter. But it won't be too long before you are gearing up for the holidays. So how do you think the environment is going to fair for you? Will you be adding head count? 
And also, the stock-based compensation came in below where you had guided for the second quarter. So is this a matter of not hitting the hiring goals you were hoping for? Or do you think the environment for the hiring of technical and engineering talent is loosening up a little bit?",107

Thank you. On the head count, yes, I think it was more, as we mentioned last quarter, last year in -- or excuse me, in Q1, we added -- to give you a flavor for it, we added 14,000 workers in Q1. Prior year, we had reduced our net head count by 27,000. So we're pretty transparent about the fact that we had hired a lot of people in Q1 for the coverage of the Omicron variant. Luckily, that variant subsided, and we were left with a higher head count position. We've -- that has come down through adjusting our hiring levels and normal attrition. And it's pretty -- was pretty much resolved by the end of April or early part of May. So that is dominating the quarter-over-quarter reduction in head count. I would note that we're still up 188,000 year-over-year and nearly double the head count of what we had heading into the pandemic in early 2020. 
So you're right, there will be adjustments to that as we move forward into more holiday-level demand. Right now, we see a stabilization in the workforce. I think we see good hiring rates. And so I think -- if you remember, it was a very difficult labor period in the second half of last year. And it didn't -- it arrived kind of quickly out of nowhere. So we're certainly diligent on that and making sure we have a good workplace and an environment that will attract employees.",249

And as we always remind you, employee annual RSU grants do occur in the second quarter. And as a result, we typically see a step-up in the SBC expense from Q1 to Q2. And of course, you saw it this time around. The growth in the line is impacted overall also on the step-up by continued head count. We've grown our workforce over the last few years and as Brian talked about, hiring in a number of areas of the business, including engineers, other tech workers. And there's some component of the wage inflation as we look to continue to hire and retain employees there. 
In terms of the -- coming in at the 5 -- a little over $5 billion for stock-based comp, the main driver was -- there was primarily driven by fewer employees stock awards vested -- fewer employee stock awards we're vesting in Q2 than we expected.

Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2021. 
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's view as of today, October 27, 2022 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. 
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. 
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions; and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. 
This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Brian.",369

Before we move to questions, I will make some comments about our Q3 performance and the outlook for Q4. 
For the third quarter, worldwide net sales were $127.1 billion, representing an increase of 19% year-over-year, excluding approximately 460 basis points of unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. As the dollar continued to strengthen during the quarter, the foreign exchange impact was higher than the 390 basis point impact we had incorporated into our Q3 guidance. This represents a headwind of approximately $900 million, more than we initially guided to. 
Throughout the quarter, our worldwide stores business continued to stay highly focused on our customers and driving the inputs that matter most, which helped to accelerate sales growth in the quarter. We now offer our widest selection ever. We've taken actions that have driven strong recovery of in-stock rates, and we continue to work on improving delivery speeds, all while ensuring our pricing remains sharp for our customers. 
Third-party sellers and the products they offer remain an important strength of our offering for consumers, representing 58% of total paid units sold in Q3, the highest percentage ever. It's up from 56% in Q3 of last year. And we're working with these partners, most of whom are small- and medium-sized businesses, to build an even stronger offering. We recently hosted Amazon Accelerate, our U.S. conference for selling partners, where we introduced new tools, including new e-mail marketing capabilities, free-to-use shipping software that offers discounted shipping rates and new features and analytics to help sellers better understand and act on conversion-driving content. 
This was a big quarter for Prime members. We celebrated our eighth Prime Day in July, which contributed approximately 400 basis points to our Q3 year-over-year sales growth rate. Prime members purchased more than 300 million items worldwide, making it the biggest Prime Day net sales event in Amazon's history. As a reminder, Prime Day occurred in the second quarter of 2021. 
We also debuted the 2 largest Prime Video releases ever. The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power attracted more than 25 million global viewers on its first day. And in the first 2 months since its launch, Rings of Power has driven more Prime sign-ups globally than any other Amazon Original. NFL Thursday Night Football also premiered in September, averaging more than 15 million viewers during its first broadcast, and driving the 3 biggest hours of U.S. Prime sign-ups in the history of Amazon. Our next broadcast, the seventh of the 15-game schedule, kicks off in a few hours, with the Ravens visiting the Buccaneers. 
We also saw good growth in our advertising offerings where sales grew 30% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange as vendors and sellers have embraced our portfolio of products, which allow advertisers to build general awareness and/or drive sales of a specific product. 
In AWS, net sales increased to $20.5 billion in Q3, up 28% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and now representing an annualized sales run rate of $82 billion. With the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, we've seen an uptick in AWS customers focused on controlling costs. And we're proactively working to help customers cost optimize, just as we've done throughout AWS' history, especially in periods of economic uncertainty. The breadth and depth of our service offerings enable us to help them do things like move storage to lower-priced tiers options and shift workloads to our Graviton chips. 
Graviton3 processors delivered 40% better price performance than comparable x86-based instances. And our teams across AWS continue to work relentlessly to expand that breadth and depth, including recent launches of new EC2 machine learning training instances in AWS IoT FleetWise. And we continue to expand the AWS infrastructure footprint to support customers with the launch of the AWS Middle East region in August and the recent announcement to launch AWS Asia Pacific region in Thailand. 
Now let's shift to operating income. During the quarter, we reported $2.5 billion in operating income. Turning first to our North America and international segments, during the quarter, we generated over $1 billion in operations cost improvements driven by higher leverage of our fixed cost base and continued productivity improvements in our fulfillment and transportation networks. This represents a solid improvement in productivity quarter-over-quarter, though not quite as much as we had planned. We are encouraged by the progress made during the quarter, but we recognize there's still a lot of opportunity to continue to improve productivity and drive cost efficiencies throughout our networks. We have identified initiatives that the teams continue to work hard on, and we expect to see further improvement in the quarters ahead. 
Another impact to operating income was the step-up in Prime Video content and marketing costs in Q3, primarily driven by the global premiere of the Rings of Power and the launch of the NFL Thursday Night Football package in the United States. Our results were also negatively impacted by nonrecurring charges related to the closure of certain businesses and products such as Amazon Care, Fabric.com and Amazon Explore. 
We continue to ramp up our investments in AWS, adding product builders and sales and professional services headcount to help customers save money, invent more quickly in their businesses and transition to the cloud. We're also continuing to invest in new infrastructure to meet capacity needs, expanding to new geographic regions, developing new services and iterating quickly to enhance existing services. 
Overall stock-based compensation expense was $5.6 billion in Q3, up from $5.2 billion in the second quarter. This increase was primarily driven by a reduction in the estimated forfeiture rate on certain unvested stock awards. 
We reported overall net income of $2.9 billion in the third quarter. While we primarily focus our comments on operating income, I'd point out that this net income includes a pretax valuation gain of $1.1 billion included in nonoperating income from the common stock investment in Rivian Automotive. As we've noted in recent quarters, the impact of this investment to our income statement is driven by quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in Rivian's stock price. 
Now let's discuss capital investments, which is the combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. For the full year 2022, we expect to incur approximately $60 billion in capital investments, which is broadly in line with what we spent in 2021. This represents an estimated reduction in fulfillment and transportation capital investments of approximately $10 billion compared to last year as we've continued to moderate our build expectations to better align with demand. And this is offset by an approximately $10 billion year-over-year increase in technology infrastructure, primarily to support the rapid growth, innovation and continued expansion of our AWS footprint. 
We also provided our fourth quarter financial guidance as part of our earnings release. While we are encouraged by our progress across the business, macroeconomic environment remains challenging worldwide. The continuing impacts of broad-scale inflation, heightened fuel prices and rising energy costs have impacted our sales growth as consumers assess their purchasing power and organizations of all sizes evaluate their technology and advertising spend. 
As the third quarter progressed, we saw moderating sales growth across many of our businesses as well as the increased foreign currency headwinds I mentioned earlier, and we expect these impacts to persist throughout the fourth quarter. As we've done at similar times in our history, we're also taking actions to tighten our belt, including pausing hiring in certain businesses and winding down products and services where we believe our resources are better spent elsewhere. We aim to strike the right balance between investing for our customers for the long term while driving operational efficiency improvements and accomplishing more with less. 
When faced with an uncertain economy or some kind of discontinuous event, customers tend to double-down on companies that they believe have the best customer experience and that take care of them the best. And that is where our efforts remain focused. As we head into the fourth quarter, we are ready to make this a great holiday season for our customers. We kicked off the season a few weeks ago with our first-ever Prime Early Access sales event where tens of millions of Prime members shopped and ordered more than 100 million items from Amazon's selling partners. We remain heads-down focused on driving a fantastic customer experience, and we believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. 
Thanks. And with that, let's move on to your questions.",1417

Can you help us better understand some of the comments you made around the exit velocity, specifically with respect to the U.S. e-commerce business or the AWS business and how that might inform some of the lower-than-seasonal trends that seem to be implied in the Q4 guide, specifically with respect to either optimizations on the AWS side or changes in consumption behavior on the U.S. e-commerce side?",82
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2022",2022-10-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2010.0,2675071.0,100650149.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,5,"Sure thing, Eric. Thanks for your question. As I look ahead to guidance for Q4, I think the biggest individual factor is still going to be foreign exchange. This guidance includes 460 basis points of unfavorable impact year-over-year. FX is a bigger issue for us on our revenue growth in dollars than it is on our income. It actually has a slight favorability due to the investments we're making internationally. But put that aside for a moment. 
What we saw in Q3 was a really strong July with a great reaction to Prime Day globally. And the resumption of things like in-stock rates are starting to come back, and delivery speed was coming back. And that continued through the quarter, but growth rates started to slow a bit. And primarily in the consumer stores business, it was in international. North America, obviously, it was strong, but it started to slow a bit. But it was mostly in international where we saw the biggest impact, and we think that is tied to a tougher recessionary environment there. Compared to the U.S., it's worse in Europe right now. The Ukraine war and the energy crisis issues have really compounded in that geography. 
But when I talk about enterprise customers in AWS, yes, we've been working with customers to lower their bills. Just like all companies, they want to lower their spend when they're faced with uncertainty in the market. I would say one that's real valuable points about cloud computing is that it's turning fixed cost into variable for many of our customers, and we help them save money either through alternative services or Graviton3 chips. There's many ways that we have to help them lower their spending and still get great cost performance ratios. 
So what we're really excited about the business, both in the long term and even in the short run, you noticed we've added $4.5 billion to the $16 billion base we had of revenue last Q3, so the business is growing in absolute dollars at a really good clip. We do see some of the consumers are cutting their budgets and trying to save money in the short run. I would say that although we had a 28% growth rate for the quarter for AWS, the back end of the quarter, we were more in the mid-20% growth rate. So we've carried that forecast through to the fourth quarter. We're not sure how it's going to play out, but that's generally our assumption. 
We're excited about the re:Invent conference that's coming up in late November. We expect to have over 40,000 people in Las Vegas and many more tuning in virtually. So continue to drive value for customers with new products, new services and, lately also, additional ways for them to manage their budgets and optimize in what is shaping up as a tough economy.",478

Can you just talk about the path to restoring meaningful free cash flow? And do you think that CapEx tied to data centers and the AWS ramp can ultimately step back, similar to what we've seen recently with fulfillment and transport?",66
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2022",2022-10-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2010.0,2675071.0,100650152.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,8,"Yes. I think if you look at our free cash flow, there's multiple factors here. One is the drop-off in income for the trailing 12 months versus the 12 months before it, and a lot of that is driven to things that we've talked about on these calls. Ops cost, we're still not in a -- our network doubled over the last 2.5 years. While we're making strides in productivity and network optimization, we still have work to do there. So we have to get our cost structure back to pre-pandemic levels in a lot of areas of the company and mostly in operations. 
There's a unique thing going on with inventory right now because we have a lot of weeks of cover mainly due to supply chain issues coming out of Asia primarily and we're seeing with our sellers, too. We just have additional weeks of cover. We think our model reacts quickly to customer demand. This is more about the other side of the equation, the supply chain and having more in stock. So what the issue there is that we generally have a favorable working capital impact from accounts payable that is more days than our inventory. That's been flipping the last year, and we expect that to normalize as we move into 2023. 
And then CapEx is a big driver. We had, again, a doubling of the network, had very high CapEx the last 2 years. You'll see that we've lowered CapEx year-over-year. We probably cut about 1/3 of our budget from what we originally thought for 2022 while still focusing our capital dollars really on the AWS business and increasing customer demand or capacity for increasing customer demand in our stores business. 
So we're working hard on all those dimensions. And we expect, as we see a recovery in income generation, normalization of the inventory versus accounts payable cycle and efficiency in our CapEx spend, we intend to flip those numbers around.",327

AWS margins were a little lower than we would have thought. Is that just a reflection of the full quarter impact of that kind of stock-based compensation granted to those employees earlier in the year? Any commentary on if that's the new normal for AWS margins? And then international losses also were a little bit heavier than we thought, just talk about what drove those losses. And is that also the new normal for that segment?",82
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2022",2022-10-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2010.0,2675071.0,100650155.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,11,"Sure. Let me start with AWS. So we did see a deceleration or a drop in op margin sequentially quarter-over-quarter. The broad disclaimer on AWS margins is that they will fluctuate over time as we balance investments versus renegotiating pricing with the long-term customer commitments, all as headwinds to the business, offset by increasing productivity and efficiencies in our data centers, which drive profitability. So there's moving parts there. 
I'd say what's happening lately is, yes, the stock-based comp. We have seen inflation in our wages this year and particularly on our Czech employees, is heavily concentrated in AWS. So that's one element of it. We're also seeing energy costs that are materially higher than they had in pre-pandemic, electricity and the impact of natural gas pricing. So those prices up more than 2x over the last couple of years and contribute to about 200 basis point degradation versus 2 years ago. So we're fighting through some of that as well, which is a new thing for the AWS business. But we'll continue to look for ways to optimize our operations to use less energy. And as we scale, we'll outrun that growth trajectory. 
On international, international is always a mix of profitability in more established countries of Europe and Japan, offset by emerging countries and investments in Prime benefits. I think the biggest issue quarter-over-quarter, the increase in losses versus Q2 was tied to some additional operating costs in Europe. We've seen higher fuel costs there, even more certainly in the United States. And Prime Day always has lesser profitability because there's just a lot of deals. And it's a bit of margin from Prime Day in both North America and international. So we offset a big -- a big part of that is device sales. And again, we sell a lot of devices during our Prime Day events. We don't make money on the device. We make money on the use of the device. So that always can end up hurting profitability in the quarter. So there are some contributing things. 
As far as new normal, we're working very hard to make sure that current profitability is not the new normal, and we'll see how quickly we can make improvements. A lot of the improvements that I talked about on a macro level, capital efficiency, operations improvements are as important internationally as they are in North America.",399

Backlog has been running 60-plus percent, so the divergence between revenue and backlog is pretty large. Everyone's asking, how do you describe that divergence?",76

So I think our current backlog balance for Q3 is $104 billion. So it's about a little less than 60%, I think about 57% up year-over-year. And the new customer pipeline is healthy. I think with a lot of enterprises and customers, they're continuing to put plans in place. I think Brian will talk a little bit about some of the cost optimization in a second. Backlog growth, this figure, it can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter because it is dependent on the commitments that you sign in the period and how those adjust but, yes, $104.3 billion for the end of Q3.",104
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2022",2022-10-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2010.0,2675071.0,100650160.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,16,"Yes. And your first question about cost optimization, first, there are some industries that have lower demand that's showing up in our volumes as probably like other companies as well, things like financial services, the mortgage business being down, cryptocurrencies have been down. We're very strong in some of those industries, and that's part of it. But basically, what we see is customers are looking to save money versus their committed spend. We have options for them to do that. They can manage workloads better. They can switch to lower-cost products that have different performance profiles. They can switch to Graviton chips that have higher cost performance ratios. So all really good things for the customer and for Amazon long term. 
Again, we think the benefit of cloud computing is really showing up right now because we allow customers to turn what can normally be a fixed expense into a variable expense, and they can let us manage the highs and lows of inflation and other cost of electricity and everything else. And they can get about to do their business using our services in a very highly secure way. 
So I think just like in 2020, these time periods are good for long-term adoption on cloud computing. But the offset in the short run is that some companies have demand that drops. I think what was different in 2020 was there were companies that went down and there's companies that went up quite a bit that were servicing high volumes during the pandemic. So that dynamic is not in place right now, and I think everyone is just cautious and they want to, again, watch their spend. And as CFO, I appreciate that, and we're doing the same thing here at Amazon.",293

First, could you provide some more details on the cost structure initiatives and when we could see those initiatives hitting the P&L? And then second, on the holiday season. It's a bit implicit in your guide and remarks thus far, but just curious of your expectations for consumer demand this holiday season versus last year.",57

Let me start with the holiday. So we're ready to roll. We've got the best selection we've ever had. In-stock levels are really high. Delivery speeds are getting very close to where we want them to be. And we're ready to have a really good holiday season with our consumers this year. And the Prime Early Access sale, I think, created great value for consumers. It allowed them to get a jump on some of their purchases for the holiday and also just find some great deals. So we're happy with that effort. And the teams that put that together worked very hard this year to hold 2 large Prime events within 4 months. 
So we're very optimistic about the holiday. But we're realistic that there's various factors weighing on people's wallets, and we're not quite sure how strong holiday spending will be versus last year. And we're ready for a variety of outcomes. But we know the consumers when they're looking for good deals, and that positions us well. Advertisers are looking for effective advertising. And our advertising is at the point where consumers are ready to spend. So we have a lot of advantages that we feel that will help both consumers and also our partners like sellers and advertisers. So the seller in-stock is very high. We've had great in-stocks from our FBA sellers. And so we're ready to go. And we're very optimistic about the fourth quarter, just realistic about whether we may have a range of outcomes that we just have to be ready for when we are. 
On the cost structure initiatives, I think you're primarily talking about the operations world. There's 3 large buckets there, as I've said in the past, productivity, fixed cost leverage and inflation. On productivity, made good strides, but there's still a lot of work to do there and we know the job ahead of us. It's hard to improve productivity much in the fourth quarter because it's just a period of like maximum stress on the operations, and we're trying to fulfill every order in a very quick way. But our goal is to leave ourselves in a really good, strong condition for a fast start on a lot of initiatives in Q1 of next year. 
On fixed cost leverage, we've taken steps to alter our forward plan and take CapEx out. A lot of the CapEx we spend in any given year is feeding future years' capability. And we've tightened that up. We feel good about the arc of demand versus supply that we have in our fulfillment and transportation area. Inflation is a wildcard. We do as much as we can to save money in an inflationary environment. We've looked to make sure that our trucks are fully utilized as best we can, preventing long-zone shipments, things that like use a lot of fuel or use a lot of trucking or use a lot of shipments from other parts of the world. 
So we're working under the umbrella of not having it impact the customer. We're working very hard to save that. Those challenges will be there through the end of the year, and we'll be working on them definitely in the first half of next year as well. So we'll keep you posted as we have these quarterly calls on our progress and where we see opportunities.",563

So first, on retail, you did see some good efficiency gains in 3Q, and you talked about $1.5 billion. As we look forward, if those 3 areas you just mentioned do turn favorable, how quickly do you think you could get back to kind of historical North America retail operating margins? Is that 1 year, 2 years? Any time frame on that? And then on AWS, you said the back half of 3Q was a mid-20s run rate. One of your prominent peers was talking about incremental macro weakness in 4Q. So could you just talk about, are you expecting the same thing in 4Q? Or are some of the price concessions you already made in 3Q kind of getting in front of that?",132

Let me start with the efficiency. I just outlined a lot of it in the prior answer. But just to clarify, we were aiming for about $1.5 billion improvements sequentially versus Q2 and Q3. We feel like we came up about $0.5 billion short on that. Mostly in our productivity, with the Prime Day and the preparations for the Prime Early Access event, we have been running with very high inventory levels in our warehouses. But our inventory and our sellers, as we get ready for those events, paid off in the events themselves. In-stocks have been at really high levels. 
But in that environment, it's a little harder to work on. There's blockages to making improvement in productivity. There's a lot of extra work when you have space constraints. But we will continue that fight. And while I can't forecast into 2023 yet, and I'm not really only talking about Q4, my message is that we have work to do in 2023 that we are aware of and working on today. 
Dave, do you want to take that question on AWS?",183

Ross, you were just asking around AWS. There's nothing really I'd add to what Brian had already said other than he's spoken about. We've seen the year-over-year growth rate come down as the third quarter progressed and exited in sort of the mid-20s growth rate. And so that's informed how we're thinking about the guidance ranges heading into the fourth quarter, but nothing else to add on that. 
Thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least 3 months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.",116
