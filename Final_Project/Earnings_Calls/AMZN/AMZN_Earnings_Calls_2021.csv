Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, February 2, 2021, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you'll find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC, and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence; actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity; and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and spending patterns as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain. 
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
And now I'll turn the call over to Brian.",437

I realize that you may have questions about the news, which we announced today in our press release, but I would like to begin with some comments on Q4 results, and then we can proceed to your questions.
First, I'd like to start by thanking the nearly 1.3 million Amazon employees who have risen to the challenge of serving customers around the world during this pandemic. We're proud that more than 500,000 people chose to take new jobs at Amazon in 2020. We're committed to providing all employees with great jobs, including $15 an hour starting pay in the U.S., health insurance, 401(k) matching, leading parental benefits and upskilling opportunities. We remain focused on the safety of our employees and delivery partners, particularly in our fulfillment and logistics operations and stores as well as the customers shopping in our Whole Foods Market and other stores.
Our Q4 results include approximately $4 billion in COVID-related operating costs including additional employee pay during the holidays. We continue to see productivity headwinds from physical separation and training of new employees, and of course, investments in PPE for employees and enhanced cleaning for our facilities. This Q4 spend brings our total COVID-related costs for the year to more than $11.5 billion.
Our teams worked hard in 2020 to ramp up in-house COVID-19 testing capabilities that are incremental to those already available to the general public. More than 700 employees are now being tested every hour, and globally, we've built hundreds of COVID-19 testing sites and 2 labs. We are encouraging essential employees working at Amazon fulfillment centers, AWS data centers and Whole Food Market stores across the country to receive the COVID-19 vaccine at the earliest appropriate time. We are also working at the federal and state levels to support the vaccinations of frontline employees and those in the community who are providing essential services throughout the pandemic, including enabling pop-up clinics in Washington State and Florida with more on the way.
Now some comments on Q4 results. Our fourth quarter holiday season has always been the busiest time of our year. This year presented additional challenges for our teams as we work to meet strong customer demand while simultaneously growing our operation's footprint and welcoming far more new employees than any prior Q4. We welcomed nearly 175,000 new full- and part-time employees in Q4 alone. This compares with 50,000 in Q4 of 2019. We also continue to add buildings in our fulfillment and logistics network, with square footage growing about 50% year-over-year in 2020. And unlike in a typical year when new buildings are mostly in place by the end of Q3, this year, a significant number of them came online in Q4 as our teams pulled out all the stops to be ready for customer demand. And it turns out we needed that capacity in order to fulfill the strong customer demand in Q4. Revenue for the quarter was $125.6 billion versus our guidance range of $112 billion to $121 billion. 
You'll remember that we kicked off the holiday season early for customers with Prime Day in October versus its usual timing in Q3. We then saw strong seasonal holiday demand through Q4. Our Q4 results also largely reflect the continuation of demand trends we have seen since the early months of the pandemic, particularly as people are staying at home, including for households, staples and other home products. We saw sales growth across our major product categories led by strong Prime member engagement. Prime members continue to shop with greater frequency and across more categories than before the pandemic began. Prime members also continued to expand their usage of Prime's digital benefits, including Prime Video and Prime Video channels. Amazon Music launched podcast in September; and in Q4, Prime members listened to millions of hours of podcasts each month.
We're reaching more customers with our grocery offerings. In Q4, we had another strong quarter that largely reflects the continuation of demand trends from Q3, and we saw strong growth in new Prime member sign-ups. As demand remained strong in the quarter, the additional volume leverage helped to achieve higher-than-expected profits. We saw strong order volumes throughout the holiday season with good sales growth not only in our peak sales days, which include Prime Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but also throughout the remainder of the quarter. We had good operational performance within our fulfillment centers and transportation network even as we added significant capacity.
Third-party sellers also stepped up as never before to serve customers. The 2020 holiday season was the best ever for small- and medium-sized businesses selling in our store, with their worldwide sales growing over 50% year-over-year in Q4. Third-party units represented 55% of total paid units during the quarter, the highest 3P unit mix we've ever had since we invited businesses to sell on Amazon more than 20 years ago.
Lastly, AWS' efforts were headlined by our ninth annual re:Invent conference. This is the first time in our history that the event was virtual and free. We had over 570,000 registered attendees during the 3-week-long event. AWS continues to innovate at a rapid clip announcing more than 180 new services and features at re:Invent across compute, storage, database, machine learning and more. You can read more about this in our earnings release.
The team also announced significant customer momentum with new commitments and migrations from JPMorgan Chase, Thomson Reuters, ViacomCBS and Twitter, just to name a few. We continue to see companies meaningfully growing their plans to move to AWS.
In Q4, AWS saw a continuation of strong usage and revenue growth. AWS added more revenue quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year in any quarter in its history and is now a $51 billion annualized run rate business supporting millions of active AWS customers. And just as they have all year, sellers, partners and employees across Amazon stepped up to deliver on unprecedented customer demand, and for this, we remain extremely grateful.
And today, we announced that our founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos, will transition to the role of Executive Chair in the third quarter this year and that Andy Jassy will become Chief Executive Officer at that time. Those of us who know Andy are excited to see him take on this greater responsibility. He is a visionary leader, a great operator, and he understands what makes Amazon such a special, innovative company.
We're also excited that Jeff will retain a very important role at the company that he founded and has guided for over 25 years. He has created a culture of invention and innovation that drives us every day, and we remain bound by our common focus and obsession on the customer.
With that, let's move on to Q&A.",1129

Obviously, pandemic aside, wondering if you could help us sort of break down the pieces of what drove that, specific regions, specific initiatives that drove that level of acceleration.
And then just on the AWS business, a bit more of a housekeeping question. Could you -- would you mind going through just where the backlog stands? And any material drivers of change in the math to the extent there has been any.",90

Thank you, Heath. I would start on international segment results. So yes, it was sequential growth jumped from 33% in Q3 to 50% in Q4. Part of that is the timing of Prime Day. But in the U.S., it was less pronounced. Sequential growth was 39% to 40% in the North America segment, so there was something else going on in international in Q4.
I would attribute it really to the government actions and lockdowns that we saw, especially in the U.K. and Europe. I think that increased during the quarter unfortunately for the economy. But it did drive higher sales on our site. We also saw probably a larger impact of moving Prime Day from Q3 to Q4 in international just because it's a little more nascent there. It's still ramping up but very strong performance.",138
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2021",2021-02-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2508.0,2188888.0,85626223.0,Answer,Dave Fildes,,Executives,6,"Yes. Heath, this is Dave. On the backlog number, it's at about $50 billion at the end of the year, the bounce, and that's up about 68% year-over-year. So that's one component of all the great work that AWS is doing; and of course, you're seeing some continued very strong growth -- strong usage and revenue growth there, $51 billion annualized run rate business. So it's continuing to grow at a meaningfully larger absolute dollar rate than others out there. And we're really pleased with the growth we're seeing there. It's -- as Brian touched on the opening, just a lot of good engagement and innovation coming out of the re:Invent conference as well.",114

I wanted to know if you could tease out how we should be thinking about the level of investments that are needed between the mix of fulfillment versus where you want to go on the customer service side and the logistics and delivery side as you look out to '21. And obviously, it's going to be a very different year in '21 than what we saw in '20, where we saw a surge in demand and a lot of capacity constraints that have opened up as the year goes on and there'll be sort of tougher comp dynamic as you get into the middle of '21 as you're lapping against that demand impact in '21. How do we think about the levels of investment you'll make, where those investments are going to go and what that means for sort of confidence on the demand side over the medium to long term?",170
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2021",2021-02-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2508.0,2188888.0,85626226.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,9,"Sure, Eric. Obviously, we had a large investment last year, group fulfillment capacity including transportation, 50% year-over-year. I would say that -- and spent -- I believe it's $44 billion on CapEx. Yes. The -- we're still working through our plans for 2021. I think the added complexity here is the range of outcomes. Certainly was the case in 2020, but even for 2021, there's a lot of question as to continuation of COVID conditions comping against prior year sales. Sometimes, there are things in there that are -- definitely wouldn't repeat, probably the number of gloves we sold and hand wipes and things like that or computer monitors that people set up their home offices. But there's also a lot of people who engage more strongly with Prime benefits in 2020, and we think that'll have lasting impact, both from the purchase frequency, amount they purchase, use of digital benefits, et cetera. So we are going to have to build probably for multiple scenarios. And in an FC world, it's hard to turn that capacity on quickly, so it generally means you may have to overbuild to protect the customer experience.
On transportation, we made large investments in our transportation network in 2020. That work is not done yet. We have a lot of continued expansion. So we see that over -- definitely through 2021. I can't quantify it right now. I'm only giving guidance through Q1 right now, and we are still working some -- through some of the plans as we do this time of the year.
And then infrastructure will remain a healthy part of our investment as well. We're supporting an AWS business that is growing at a rapid clip, both in usage and in revenue. We're expanding regions globally and have a lot of upside in that area, talking with customers on their transition plans to the cloud. So we definitely do not want to run out of capacity, and we work to not do that. So there could be a risk of forward spend in 2021 as -- due to the uncertainty, but we'll see as we move through the year.",358
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2021",2021-02-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2508.0,2188888.0,85626227.0,Question and Answer Operator Message,Operator,,Operator,10,Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.,9
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2021",2021-02-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2508.0,2188888.0,85626228.0,Question,Douglas Anmuth,,Analysts,11,"Brian, hoping you could talk more about the importance of AMZL, Amazon Logistics during the holiday season, if you could talk more about percentage of packages, perhaps shift from your fulfillment centers and then where this can go in coming years. And then also a quick comment on the COVID cost. You mentioned $2 billion in 1Q. Just curious how you think about it more on a full year basis, what some of the puts and takes can be there.",80
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2021",2021-02-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2508.0,2188888.0,85626229.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,12,"Yes. So yes, for the full year, we're -- again, $11.5 billion was our gross cost for 2020, $4 billion of that in Q4. We see a step down to closer to $2 billion in Q1. That compares with a $600 million spend last Q1 as the pandemic just started, and we started to react in March. And obviously, those costs escalated in Q2 and Q3.
So if we look at the core components of that, right, there's productivity that -- productivity drags from hiring so many new employees and also having physical separation. That gets better all the time. It was exasperated a bit in Q4 because of all the new hires that we brought on, over 170,000 new people. That should moderate. That's why one of the reasons that we see a step down in Q1 versus Q4. It's volume-related and also mix of employees.
After that, we're going to have to see. Again, hopefully, the vaccine gets going. Everyone gets vaccinated, and we return to normalcy. That would be very helpful on a lot of fronts for everybody. And if not, there will be a continuation of some of these costs.
I will say that while we are very transparent or try to be on the costs that we're seeing, specifically around COVID, there are some positive things happening that counteract a bit of that, not the least of which is the top line volume in 2020. We grew 37% on an FX-neutral basis versus growing 22% in 2019. And the fact that we've been running pretty full out since arguably April, but definitely into May, has created operating efficiencies of its own. The counterbalance, the physical separation and the training of new employees. So there's a lot of moving parts in here. We were able to save about $1 billion in transportation cost this year -- excuse me, in 2020 as virtually all travel was shut down and our sales teams found new ways to reach customers. We'll see how that develops over time.
Marketing, although it got back to probably more healthy levels in Q3 and Q4, definitely was lower in Q2 as we worked through some capacity issues. And it wasn't fruitful to invest in marketing when you're having trouble hitting existing customer demand.
So there are a lot of moving parts that I'll try and be as transparent on as I can be during the quarter. And this -- again, Q1 is -- we're seeing about $2 billion of absolute dollar COVID costs. And Dave can take the AMZL question.",427
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2021",2021-02-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2508.0,2188888.0,85626230.0,Answer,Dave Fildes,,Executives,13,"Yes. And just as we talk about AMZL, Amazon Logistics, right, that we think about that, in terms of the facilities, it's a lot of the middle-mile and the last-mile elements that are under our management and control. And so you're talking about sort centers at the middle-mile delivery stations and the last mile. We talked that on a square footage basis, 2020 was a big build year for us. Our footprint grew around 50%. About half of that incremental square footage fit into that sort of AMZL transportation side of the equation, which is a higher mix than what you've seen of any incremental add in a year. It's a higher mix being 50-50 than what you've seen from us in the past.
So a lot of focus on that there, both because of the desire to pre-pandemic increase the 1-day delivery capabilities for Prime members. But also, as we've moved through this year, it gets us a little bit more -- or much more certainty on being able to get items from point A to point B. So we finished the year where now more than half our packages, both U.S. and worldwide, are handled through AMZL, and a lot of work going into that.
And so we'll look to expand and continue to build on that with our AMZL offerings, but as we've said in the past, our delivery partners, independent delivery partners that are out there, the UPSs, USPSs, certainly overseas carriers as well, are an important part of that, and they'll continue to help us scale that up and build up that offering and make it better.",272

First, the other revenue line saw a significant acceleration in 4Q. Just curious if you can talk about or provide some further color on the advertiser demand that you saw in the fourth quarter. And then second, on grocery was a big driver for Amazon in 2020. Just general thoughts on grocery. And I think you mentioned in the release, 7 communities rolled out AmazonFresh grocery stores. How are they performing? And should we expect a broader rollout?",80
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2021",2021-02-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2508.0,2188888.0,85626233.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,16,"Sure, John. Let me start with the other revenue question. Yes, we saw strength in other revenue, grew 64% in Q4 versus 49% in Q3 and 41% in Q2. That is primarily advertising. That's the majority of it. I would say that there has been a recovery in advertising spend as the year progressed. The fact that we moved Prime Day into Q4 has an impact there because, again, it carried a lot of clicks and eyeballs into Q4 for that time period.
But I want to highlight a lot of great work being done by the advertising team. Their main principle is to help sellers, vendors, authors, publishers and partners use our tools, navigate them as fluidly as possible and add value both for them and for our end customers who get to see and find and discover new and different products.
There are some things that are adding to the efficiency of advertising. We're now using a deep learning model to show more relevant sponsored products and had success with that. We're improving the relevancy of ads shown on the product detail pages all the time. And we've seen rapid adoption of video creative format for sponsored brands. All these things help tick up the conversion and the productivity of the advertising, both for the seller or vendor involved and also for Amazon and makes it a more productive experience for the customer as well.",237

I think there's -- the Go grocery has a couple of locations open and off to a good start, a lot of interest in those and the technology that those offer as well as the AmazonFresh location. So we're at about 8 locations open, and I think in the neighborhood of about half a dozen locations are confirmed to open. So more to come on those.
There's other kind of tangents and footprints on that. The Go stores, there's around 25 of those that are out there that also important part of that is food. So you see us -- it's -- we've talked about this a bit in the past, is we're doing a lot with online grocery and branching out from Whole Foods and some of the other physical footprint locations and being able to offer that convenience, but we also think that being able to offer some innovative physical store grocery offerings like these go and fresh, some of which have some pretty cool self-checkout capabilities and implement some of the Just Walk Out technology qualities are really some interesting areas that are resonating with customers. I think they appreciate that not just in times of maybe not wanting to have physical contact with everyone in the store but just even beyond that, the general convenience of being able to move throughout the store and check out more efficiently than you otherwise would in a traditional retail environment. So excited to do more on that front.",262

The first one, I'd be curious to hear about any of the learnings you had from the strength of the international business in 2020 and how you think about the right types of investments to make in that business in '21 and beyond to ensure you retain as many of these users and wallets as you've gained throughout 2020.
And the second one, understanding the comments, Brian, earlier about sort of investments going forward. Maybe just talk to us a little bit about 1-day. Are these investments you're making, could they get you back to a 1-day product in later part this year or in '22 when the world normalizes? Or are these assets you're putting in place now not able to be deployed from a 1-day perspective when overall e-commerce slows down a little bit?",139
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2021",2021-02-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2508.0,2188888.0,85626237.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,20,"Sure, Brian. Let me start with your international question. I think the biggest learning is that if we can move 2021 volume into 2020, it creates good leverage for us. And it's kind of what we saw. There was essentially a doubling of the growth rate versus probably the going in time -- rate for 2020.
Now again, that was a very hard volume because of the COVID restrictions and issues with our workforce, keeping our workforce safe and everything else. But I think what you saw was some very high leverage on that model that overcame some of the more fixed costs that we're seeing in the Prime benefits. So we pre-invested, as we've discussed in the past, in things like video and devices and other elements of the Prime offering, now grocery, you're starting to see. And we've added those Prime benefits ahead of probably the curve that you would have seen in North America.
So that has always created a bit of a drag on operating income, that as well as investments in new geographies, the investment in India, the investment that we've made over the last 2 or 3 years that are in places like the Middle East, Turkey, Brazil, Australia, most recently, Sweden and the Netherlands in 2020. So there's a lot of moving parts in the international segment. But you're starting to see the benefit of the higher volumes and with it, higher advertising as well that we expected and we expect over time. And we'll see the growth rate is going to have the same challenges year-over-year that perhaps we'll see in North America we're going to have a race between lapping things that may have been onetime in nature in 2020 versus accelerating Prime membership and Prime members' purchases, purchase frequency and adoption of digital benefits.
So we'll see what that looks like in 2021. Very happy with the performance in 2020. And really, hats off to the teams in many countries around the world who are all dealing with the same issues that we were in North America.",347

And there's a number of international located customers out there like MercadoLibre and Zalando and others that we've listed in there that are great customers for us. So we're working on that and really looking to support that just globally.
And I mentioned this before, but re:Invent, it was a great way to bring a lot of those folks from around the world together virtually and free. And typically, we've recorded the revenue for re:Invent from ticket sales and sponsorships. If you account for this COVID anomaly this year of it being virtual and free, AWS' year-over-year revenue growth, if you look at it, actually accelerated adjusting for that from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. So a lot of fun innovation, good innovation coming out of that event that we're excited to talk more with customers about.",176

Yes, definitely. And we've been doing that throughout the year, and it's been getting better. In fact, we had a lot of examples of deliveries right up to the last minute on December 24 in the United States for holiday gifts. So the 1-day has been getting better, and it's -- the issues in 2020 was essentially around capacity and volume and getting things out the door and being able to then hit a shortened time period.
So it wasn't that we were delaying or slowing down the shipment itself. It was the time taken to get through the warehouse and handle backlog of demand. So as the year progressed, we did see that get better and better. We do forecast that it will get better. I'm not quantifying this for you. I realize that. But I think you can generally notice wherever you're particularly are, whatever geography you are, some cities are back probably to 1-day levels that they saw or even better pre-pandemic. Other areas that may have other dynamic issues are still working their way out of backlog and volume issues. But when they -- the dust settles and as we open up more and more capacity, you'll see greater and greater 1-day percentages for our Prime shipments.",236

First, obviously, the Jeff Bezos announcement is quite important. I think Jeff Wilke is also retiring. Can you talk a little bit if you expect any changes to Amazon, how we should think about that? And then maybe Dave Clark is taking over retail. Talk a little bit about that.
And then secondly, obviously, the backlog is really strong in AWS, up 68%. The margins did come down a little bit quarter-over-quarter to 28%. Can you talk about the deals, how pricing is in the cloud segment? Is it remaining robust? And any reason the margins came down a little bit quarter-over-quarter?",105
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2021",2021-02-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2508.0,2188888.0,85626242.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,25,"Sure, Justin. Let me start with your comments on the CEO transition and then the consumer CEO transition. I think they're both examples of what are highly effective succession planning processes at Amazon. The Board of Directors obviously takes that very seriously. It is an annual discussion and probably more often on succession plans, development of key executives, expanding the number of key executives, et cetera. And you see the byproduct of that as we expand the S team as we, 5 years ago, set up the 2-CEO structure where Jeff Wilke was CEO of Consumer and Andy Jassy was CEO of AWS. We have strong single-thread leaders on devices, Amazon or -- Video, including Amazon Studios, Advertising. So I think there's a lot of bench strength within Amazon; and generally, we do try and push the decisions down in the organization as we scale, especially internationally as we try and do things consistently globally but recognize local differences in our model.
So having said all that, succession planning is super important. The example you saw with Jeff Wilke, Jeff announced in the fall that he was stepping down to pursue some other goals and interest that he has outside of Amazon. He had been here over 20 years, had been super pivotal in our development of our consumer business, our culture, the development of layers and layers of leaders. And one of them was Dave Clark, who has, over the last 5-plus years, really been charged with developing some very fundamental things for our company: the expansion of the fulfillment center network, the expansion and creation of our transportation capacity, grocery delivery and the grocery plan, a lot of other things. But Dave has -- had been great leader in his own right. So when Dave -- or, excuse me, when Jeff Wilke decided to retire in the fall, it was a natural transition to Dave Clark. And that just occurred in January, and they're wrapping things up in the next month.
So that's a successful example of succession planning and a successful transition. Same thing for Jeff Bezos' role. And I will reiterate that Jeff is not leaving. He is getting a new job. He's going to be Executive Chair of the Board, super important role. The Board is super active and important in Amazon's success story.
And Andy has been here since 1997. He is not only a visionary leader. He's a strong operator as I said. And he's got a great track record of developing multiple things and businesses within Amazon, not the least of which is AWS, which is arguably the most profitable, important technology company in the world.
So that's just a flavor on the insight on how it works. We're very happy to see both Jeff and Andy get new perspectives. So Andy has a chance to put his imprint on Amazon. He is certainly going to carry through the culture and the vision and the invention factory that Amazon is and will take that to the next level.
Jeff will be the Executive Chairman of the Board. He will be involved in many large one-way-door issues, as we say, one-way doors, meaning the more important decisions, things like acquisitions, things like strategies and going into grocery and other things. So Jeff's always been involved with that, and that's where we'll keep his time focused on -- or he'll keep his time focused on in his new role.
So very excited all around to see the ability to have a strong transition to Andy in Q3. We'll be working on backfilling the AWS role, and we'll talk more about that in the future.
But for now, today is about Andy and Jeff Bezos.",620

The factors we've talked about in the past continue to be in play. We're improving infrastructure planning to meet the capacity needs given the growth we're seeing. More broadly, our results reflect that balance between the investing, the price reductions, driving cost efficiencies. And the margins are going to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter depending on those factors to the extent we are investing in new regions and some other elements.
A few discrete things that aren't probably new but just to call out, the driver of the reduced impact from the change in the useful life of the servers. As you recall, we amended the server useful life at the beginning of the year from 3 to 4 years, and so we saw some benefit to the AWS margins and the broader margins in total. When we look at that, the impact does diminish throughout this year. So when we increased it beginning in January, the benefit from this change in Q4 was about $538 million. That's down from $634 million in Q3. So that gives you some sense of it's coming down. That's the total amount that's allocated amongst the segments, but the majority of those figures I just gave do relate to AWS because significance of the server assets going to that segment. And again, that impact's going to continue to taper down over time, for example, into Q1 of 2021.
One other element is just FX impact. That's always going to hit us to some degree, but AWS customer billings are probably primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. The cost, though, if you think about it, many of the costs are going to be for build-out in local currency for data centers and the people that work there and power and what have you, so there's a bit of a foreign exchange difference there. And that happens to be this time around a little bit bigger. We saw an unfavorable impact of about $96 million to the AWS margin this time around for FX, so just another point to call out there.
You mentioned the backlog, too. Look, I think that's one data point amongst many as you look at AWS, but I think we're really encouraged by just general large enterprise business adoption is continuing to do well as they're choosing AWS as a tech provider and speeding up innovations. You saw a long list of the many companies that we've announced arrangements with in the past 90 days. So really excited to continue to build onto that.",437

Just going back to the topic of shipping cost inflation. This is one of the few lines that's kind of variable and kind of increasing a little bit faster than the other fixed costs. And Dave, you mentioned that over half the orders are now going through Amazon Logistics worldwide. When do you expect that rate of inflation per order to level out a little bit because of these efforts? And if you look at the cost curve in places like the U.K. where -- or in London, where you have well over half on your own last-mile delivery, are you starting to see leverage there? Any comments on that?",111

On that -- this is Dave. I think it's not -- I won't give a forward kind of guidance mix or what that levels off like. Some of the step-up in costs and disparity -- or the bigger gap, I should say, versus the unit growth rates that you're seeing there, there's a few factors. But I think this is Q4. We did add on a lot of new capacity as I said. It came on later in the year into Q4. More of it was in kind of that transportation arm, and so the costs associated with that would be going to that trans cost piece. So that's one of the factors, along with the fact that we're continuing to try where we can to focus on improving 1-day. And that varies region to region with all the kind of challenges of COVID that have gone on this year. But that's a goal of ours, is to get back to where we were in terms of 1-day unit mix and continue to build onto that. So that'll be something to keep an eye on as we move into 2021.

Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. 
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2020. 
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 29, 2021 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. 
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. 
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. 
This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence; actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity; workforce staffing and productivity; and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and spending patterns as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain. 
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Brian.",438

Before we get to Q&A, I will touch upon a few highlights from the first quarter of the year. Let me start by highlighting the momentum we are seeing in AWS. 
In the first quarter, AWS revenue growth accelerated across a broad range of customers. During COVID, we've seen many enterprises decide that they no longer want to manage their own technology infrastructure. They see that partnering with AWS and moving to the cloud gives them better cost, better capability and better speed of innovation. We expect this trend to continue as we move into the post-pandemic recovery. 
There's significant momentum around the world, including broad and deep engagement across major industries. For example, last quarter, we announced new commitments and migrations from some of the world's most renowned sports leagues, the National Hockey League, the PGA Tour, Formula 1 and the German Bundesliga. 
We continue to expand our AWS infrastructure footprint to support the strong growth we're seeing. AWS offers 80 availability zones across 25 geographic regions around the world. And we've  announced plans to launch 15 more availability zones in 5 more regions. 
Turning to the consumer business, we continue to see strong customer demand globally in the first quarter. Revenue growth in our international segment grew 50% on an FX-neutral basis year-over-year in Q1 as restrictive regional and national lockdowns were in place throughout the quarter, particularly in the U.K. and Europe. In North America, revenue growth of 39% largely reflects the continuation of demand trends that we have seen since the early months of the pandemic. Third-party sellers were largely comprised of small- and medium-sized businesses, continue to see strong sales and serve more customers. Our 3P seller services revenue increased 60% on an FX-neutral basis year-over-year in the first quarter, growing significantly faster than online stores revenue. Third-party units represented 55% of our total paid units in Q1, up from 52% in Q1 of last year. 
Prime members also continue to shop with greater frequency and across more categories than before the pandemic. These trends have also extended to Prime's digital benefits. Over the past 12 months, Prime Video streaming hours were up over 70% year-over-year. Amazon Studio had its best award season yet, and Prime members can look forward to a strong slate of upcoming original series and films featuring an impressive group of diverse talent and creators. We're also continuing to expand our roster of live sports content, and we're excited to partner with the NFL and be the exclusive home of NFL Thursday Night Football into the next decade. 
Twitch is also seeing great momentum. Hours watched on Twitch nearly doubled year-over-year in the first quarter, and we now average more than 35 million daily visitors. Another popular benefit of Prime membership is Prime Day, and we are excited to announce that we will hold the 2-day savings event during the second quarter. Prime Day is also a great opportunity for our selling partners to reach more customers, and will make supporting small businesses a big focus again this year. We'll have more to share on Prime Day, including the event dates a bit later this quarter. 
We continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of our employees. In the U.S., Amazon has held on-site vaccination events in 29 states, reaching more than 300,000 frontline employees and contractors. We are watching events closely in Europe and in particular, India, where we have put in place employee initiatives, from medical health lines, teleconsulting, hotel rooms for quarantining and financial support, as well as donating 100 ICU ventilator units to local hospitals. We'll continue to invest in the health and safety of our employees and delivery partners, particularly in our global fulfillment and logistics operations. 
And finally, to summarize our financial results. Total revenue of $108.5 billion came in above the guidance range of $100 billion to $106 billion. In addition to our strong segment results, advertising revenue within the North America and international segments also accelerated during the quarter. The leverage we are seeing on this higher revenue, combined with strong operational performance led to higher operating income as well. 
Operating income of $8.9 billion in Q1 was above our guidance range of $3 billion to $6.5 billion. We incurred a little less than the $2 billion in COVID-19-related operating costs that we had projected in the first quarter. We continue to incur these costs across our global fulfillment network as we maintain social distancing measures, which impacts our productivity and as we make direct investments in employee safety. Looking ahead, we expect to incur approximately $1.5 billion in COVID-19-related operating costs in the second quarter. 
Lastly, I'd like to congratulate and thank our employees for making Amazon #1 in the U.S. on LinkedIn's 2021 top companies ranking, an annual list identifying the most sought-after places to work. We appreciate the customer obsession and passion for innovation from teams across the company to make Amazon a great place to work. With that, let's move on to Q&A.",840

So you guys are investing pretty aggressively to build out that Amazon control last-mile fulfillment. We see the blue vans driving around everywhere in the Bay Area  so congrats on that. So I guess the question is,  is how long until you feel like if that's in the right place as far as all your major metros where you want to set that up. And at what stage does the unit cost of shipping start to improve from these initiatives? And I guess, high level, is controlling the last mile allowing you to further penetrate or gain market share in certain categories where speedy delivery is of the essence. Can you talk about that, please?",121

Yes, let me start with last mile in general. So we're investing heavily. We talked about it last year, our fulfillment, including Amazon Logistics investment, we increased our capacity by 50%. And you can see from our CapEx numbers, the CapEx, including infrastructure, of course, increased to 80% in the trailing 12 months over the prior trailing 12 months. So certainly, a large area of investment, not only fulfillment centers, but also 2 elements of transportation, what we call the middle mile where we're putting sort centers, Amazon Air, line haul, trailers, think of all the intermediate movements between our warehouses and our final delivery stations. And then that last mile was just delivery stations, DSP and seeing our delivery service partners as well. 
So you talked about costs. We actually think our cost right now is very competitive with our external options, and we measure that very closely. It certainly gets better with demand and amortization and route density, et cetera. But we see, which is very helpful, is the ability to control the whole flow of products from the warehouse to the end customer. Its churn would -- normally was a batch process where we would hand off a large batch of orders to a third party once a day, let's say, to a continuous flow process, where we continually have orders leaving our warehouses 5, 6 times a, day going through middle mile and then to final delivery, either through our AMZL drivers or DSP partners. 
So that gives us a lot of ability not only to control the flow of the product, but also flow of information. We're seeing a lot of progress in that area. And I think you'll see it, too, as a customer where you're starting to get more precise estimates of delivery. You'll get notes that say, hey, you're 8 stops away from your delivery, et cetera. Because everyone's busy. A big part of delivery is actually being there sometimes when you need to get -- be there for the delivery. Other times, Of course, you can just have it put on your doorstep and get to it later. But that's -- we see a lot of benefit from that. We also see that there's a lot of cutoff times that we can extend, again, because we pretty much have perfect information between the order placement allocation to warehouses where we're going to pick and box up the product and send it on its way. So lots of advantages. We are continuing to invest, and we'll see a large investment in this area through 2021 as well. 
We do think that it may also spill to 2022. That should set us up in really good stead with our capacity. And already, the majority of our units are going through AMZL today.",474

Just to add to that, Ryan touched upon it, but there are, an important part of this last mile effort has been the program we've had, the -- Brian called this -- mentioned the delivery services partner program, or the DSP, it's an important part of the last mile network. And that -- just as a reminder, that employs more than 100,000 drivers, and it's been growing for the past few years. And it's really -- it's a program with an incentive for those folks to become small business owners and start their own package delivery business. So it's a great way for those folks to access the delivery technology and the package volumes we have and tapping on the network.

I think it's -- the backlog growth, just to give you the figures for March 31, it's $52.9 billion. The weighted average life is about where we've been for the past several quarters, so about -- a little over 3 years in terms of the weighted average remaining life. So that's up about 55% right now. So it really continues to be really strong and really pleased with that.
I think that's backlog figures, but also just the revenue growth and the momentum we're seeing in here is a lot of hard work and innovation on the teams and growing teams and reaching out and working with those. And so you can expect to continue to see customers making these long-term commitments. We think it's a representation you think of a lot of companies that have worked with us, been engaged with us, been with us. And as they get better comfort line of sight with what they want to do.

First, Brian, you touch upon this a little bit in your prepared remarks about the acceleration in international growth. Can you maybe just speak to the drivers there. And in, particularly in markets where COVID is no longer a major issue, have you seen any particular declines or maybe just slowdown in e-commerce demand or a decline in growth? It seems like they're going in different directions in Europe, for instance, it seems like the -- a lot of these markets are still very much under lockdown, yet your international business has grown pretty significantly. I don't know if there is positive or negative correlation.",111

Thanks, Youssef. Yes, I would say we're seeing strength pretty much across the board in international. And it does vary by country. But if you just step back a minute, on an, even on an FX-neutral basis, we grew 50% in the quarter. We grew 50% last quarter, although that's aided by the fact that Prime Day was in Q4 this year. But if you look at the growth rate prior to COVID and post-COVID, in the international segment, on a -- even on an FX-neutral basis, has been tripling their prior growth rate in revenue anyway.
So very strong and probably advancement of the model in a lot of countries by a year or more. And we're really pleased that we've been able to show our value to those customers, not only with our shipments and our ability to deliver and get them what they need to survive in homes in place during the pandemic, but also the strength that we've seen in the digital offering and the adoption of video, music, our devices. So it's really -- and we're forward investing, as you know, in that, in international with a lot of those Prime benefits. So it's really -- it's good to see as the underlying consumer shipping business, part of it grows, that we're still seeing healthy engagement and growing engagement.
So I don't have a downside case yet. In fact, surprised a bit by the growth. I don't think we normally would have forecasted 50% growth in Q1. And certainly stressing our operations. But I would -- my hat's off to the operations team, they handled the volumes in Q1 very efficiently. Costs were very much under control. We started to see strong leverage of our fixed assets, especially our fulfillment center and transportation assets.",300

And just these aren't big contributors by any means to the growth numbers Brian was talking about. But I think along with those efforts in countries we've been in for some period of time. We're continuing to open up new regions. If you look back, Poland recently opened up in March, Sweden opened up in the fourth quarter of last year. And even in some regions that we've been in for a few years, places like Turkey, we launched Prime in the back half of last year. So there's a lot of good effort and thought going into -- by the teams to continue kind of taking what we're learning in each of these geographies and feeding it back into a local presence to take advantage of everything we've learned with Prime and the broader consumer-facing experience.",141

Grocery has been a great revelation during the post-pandemic period here. I think people really value the ability to get home delivery. And we've seen that as numbers go up considerably pre and post-pandemic. So -- but we've also worked very hard to increase our capacity during that time period. In the United States, we're delivering out of our Whole Foods stores, and we've engaged -- we'll be allowed to pick up a greater expansion of pickup at Whole Foods stores. Amazon Fresh became a free Prime benefit, as you know, in the late part of 2019. And customers really adopted it and continue to see strong growth. So I think on the fresh stores, it's a little too early. The stores themselves, we're confident that the Just Walk Out technology that will be a boon, a benefit to customers. And we're very excited about what's in the works, but that's still really early in day 1.",158

Two questions. The 2Q revenue guide range was strong, despite the initial pandemic comps. Could you just discuss demand levels you're seeing on the e-commerce side, and just other kind of key drivers of strong expected revenue growth in the second quarter. And then on the advertising business, if you can just talk about some of the key drivers of the acceleration. I think it, it feels like it's maybe the third quarter in a row of acceleration. So what's kind of driving that? And how should we think about the trajectory for the business as we round through the year?",102
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2177.0,2263781.0,87756736.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,20,"Sure, John. Let me start with your second question on advertising. So certainly, traffic has been a large driver of what we're seeing in the advertising space. But it discounts kind of the improvement that we're also seeing, relevancy and new products that the team is, has been rolling out, that the customers also enjoy.
So I think the advertising team's done a great job of turning clicks into productive sales, and the advertising that results is valuable to us as well. We're using new deep learning models to show more relevant sponsored products. We continue to improve the relevancy of the ads being shown on the product detail pages. And we've seen rapid adoption of the video creative format for sponsored brands, among other things.
So you're seeing a little bit more than just traffic. And again, very pleased with the performance of that team and of the receptiveness of our customers, our vendors, our authors and sellers to our advertising products. We think it's also very valuable for consumers as well, helping them find things more easily and discover new brands.
On Q2 guidance, yes, I would say, we are projecting, again, continued strength across all of our segments. We -- I will remind you that Prime Day has been scheduled for later in Q2, and we'll have more on that as the quarter unfolds. So that's a consideration as well.",233

Can you tell us at all just in terms of quantifying or just how you're thinking about the contribution within that 2Q guidance? And then also just on the rationale for timing, given historically in 3Q, we moved to 4Q last year and then now in 2Q.
And then hoping you could also just talk about the Thursday Night Football deal, the strategy there, how that drives engagement and strengthens the ecosystem and also what it needs for ad dollars for you.",92

I think there's some pretty good estimates out there that you probably can leverage. But other than to say it's contemplated in this guidance. On the timing, last year, we had intended to hold Prime Day earlier. We -- there are a number of factors, the Olympics, which are still out there this year. In fact, in some -- many areas, July is a big vacation month. So it might be better to have -- for customers, sellers and vendors to experiment with a different time period. We experimented the other way, obviously, in 2020 by moving it into October, but we believe that it might be a better timing later in Q2. So that's what we're testing this year.
On Thursday Night Football, I would say just -- I'm not sure I could size the advertising opportunity right now. But we're very excited to have the exclusive content for Thursday Night Football. Of course, we've broadcast Thursday Night Football for a number of years now, shared that responsibility with a lot of other partners. We think we can do some really new and innovative things with that -- with those games, with the NFL, and we're looking forward to kicking that off in earnest.",218

First on the AWS acceleration, was that at all related to transaction volumes coming back for maybe more cyclical sectors? And could 2Q see even more of that? And then secondly, I think in your release, you talked about 175 million Prime members watching video. It's about 7 of 8 users. So just wondering what you see is the effect on your retail business from that? Any updates you could provide on content spending. And how you think about Prime Video as a driver for overall Amazon.",89

We wouldn't point to any particular customer group. We're seeing great usage and expansion across a number of industries and a number of types of customers from startups all the way to enterprises. To put it little bit in perspective for you, in Q1 of 2019, we were at $31 billion run rate. By last year, we had increased that to $41 billion revenue run rate, which is a 32% increase. This year, we're up to a $54 billion annualized run rate, which is, while also a 32% year-over-year growth, it added $13 billion of revenue in the last 12 months as opposed to $10 billion prior -- $10 billion in the prior 12 months before that. So the percentages can be a little deceiving. I would encourage you to look at the absolute dollar growth, although both were very strong in this quarter.
So we are seeing, again, strength across the board. We have firm confidence that we offer a lot of advantages to AWS customers from functionality to a vibrant and robust partner ecosystem. And then really, we also have less downtime and better security, which I think is super important to all of our customers, especially security nowadays. So that's on AWS. On -- Dave, why don't you pick up the...",222

Just in terms of strategy, I think there's probably nothing new or surprising, but just to reiterate it, we look at Prime Video as a component of the broader Prime membership and making sure it's driving adoption and retention as it is. It's a significant acquisition channel in Prime countries. And that we look at it and see that members who watch video have higher free trial conversion rates, higher renewal rates, higher overall engagement. And there's great examples of places like Brazil, where you launch a video-only subscription, for example, that preceded the broader Prime membership with shipping components, and that was, as an example, a great way to expose people to Amazon. And as we launched the broader Prime in Brazil, it was a great mechanism to folks into that program.
So a lot of, kind of different experiences there. But as the -- as Jeff's quote would indicate, a lot more people are continuing to enjoy it. And I think the studios team has done a great job, really striving to be the best home for talent, getting a lot of diverse artists and filmmakers and, I think folks are noticing that both critically, but of course, just in terms of viewership, a lot of good momentum there.
Just in terms of spend, just to say we continue to expect to grow that on an absolute basis and invest in that beyond original content. Brian talked about live sports and a lot of the great opportunities that feed into that, too. So a lot of continued excitement there.",262

Brian, I wanted to ask you one high level one. You guys have done such a great job building out your network and sort of providing consumers with access to so many categories of goods.

What areas are you most focused on when you look across all the categories, delivery experience, the countries to invest in and innovate, to really improve the consumer offering? That's one.
And then secondly, can you just talk to us about sort of what you've learned about the Echo journey, areas where you've had success, and still existing opportunities for Echo to have a larger installed base and just more of an impact on the ecosystem.",128

Thanks, Brian, for your questions. There's always a lot of areas that we're working to improve upon. I think generally, the speed of innovation is very quick at Amazon, but we always want it to be quicker. And we always want it to be globally consistent, and we want to take the best practices from 1 country to make sure we're doing it the same way everywhere.
I think currently on our list right now is that we are in the process of getting our 1-day shipment percentages back up to where they were pre-pandemic. We're there in Europe, and we're starting to see in Europe not only strong 1-day, but also more broad, same-day selection, so they tend to go hand-in-hand.
In the U.S., we've made improvements or consistently getting better. I would say the end delivery is really a function of everything before it, and how well we can handle and process in a timely manner all the orders in North America. It's been challenged by the volumes, but it's also been challenged by the rapid expansion of space. But we're making progress nonetheless, and we hope to get that even higher in 2021.
We're very excited about the adoption of our Prime benefits pretty much across the board, especially with the digital benefits. We are looking forward to some new content, even though we're very happy with the performance, the studios business and the content and awards that they were nominated for and were able to garner this year. We have some big things on the horizon, including Lord of the Rings, and we're very excited about getting that type of content to our Prime members quicker.",281

And then just on your question on kind of Echo and if I could take it up a level, really broadly, Alexa and devices. Our goal with that has just been -- continues to be to make customers' lives easier and really more convenient. And we want to continue to bring more hardware choices in that case, but also make Alexa smarter with new features. As we talked about before, advances in AI and machine learning, and really deliver tools that help developers and the makers of those devices build for and with Alexa, because in that community, it's not just our Echo devices, but also a variety of third-party device manufacturers. We've seen a lot of momentum with smart home capabilities and working with them.
And so -- and I think with us, with so many other areas, it's about making sure we're maintaining a really high bar, and a lot of that with that type of technology is speech recognition capabilities, the intelligence behind it and getting smarter. And some of that becomes a responsibility that customers have higher and higher expectations for their capabilities, something like Alexa, and that's great.
And I think if we just look back over the last 12 months and what's been going on, the role that customer usage has played with Alexa and the behavior there, you've seen, as people have been isolated or unable to be as mobile, you see customers are using Alexa to help them stay connected with loved ones. We're seeing customers using Alexa to help stay healthy. So whether that's interacting with health-related tips or fitness apps or increased usage of the Fire TV, and they're looking to Alexa for information. And so using our devices and the services and the Alexa-enabled services for things like educational apps.
And then, of course, part of that, too, is making sure they stay entertained when they're trapped or cooped up and don't have other access. So I think you can just see in that example a lot of really good utility, and it just, I think, encourages our teams to strive even harder to serve customers, given when you see those types of examples and how they resonate with customers.

Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2020.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 29, 2021, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC, and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence; actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and spending patterns as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain.
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

Before we get to Q&A, I'd like to first thank all of our Prime members, our vendors, our 3P sellers and my Amazon colleagues, especially the worldwide ops team for a record-breaking Prime Day in June. Third-party sellers who are mostly comprised of small and medium-sized businesses were a big contributor to Prime Day's success. The Prime Day event was the biggest 2-day period ever for these SMBs in our stores, and our 3P revenue continues to grow significantly faster than our online store's revenue. Third-party units represented 56% of our total paid units in Q2, up from a 53% mix 1 year ago.
Our second quarter net sales were $113 billion or at about the midpoint of our guidance range. That's a year-over-year increase of 27%, or 24% excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and included the shift of Prime Day into Q2 this year, which added about 400 basis points to the year-over-year growth rate. Q2 of this year was a transition period for many of our customers. As the quarter progressed, people were at home less as restrictions and lockdowns eased in some of our largest geographies, including the U.S. and much of Europe. As a result, while Prime members continue to spend more with us, growth in Prime member spend moderated compared to spending seen during the peak of the pandemic.
As you look at our recent revenue growth rates, I want to give you some insight into what we are seeing as there have been some noticeable intra-quarter changes in our revenue run rate. Prime Day has also been in 3 different quarters the past 3 years so I will normalize for this impact on my growth rate comments. Also since FX rates have bounced around, all of my comments exclude foreign exchange.
Here's a quick recap of our growth rates in 2020 and 2021. First, before COVID-19, we've been growing at a revenue growth rate close to 20%. 2019 full year growth was 22%, and revenue growth for the first 2 months of 2020 was 21%. Once the pandemic hit and lockdowns began in March 2020, the initial growth rate jumped into the mid-30% range. Q1 of last year ended with a revenue growth rate of 27%. However, our operations network took time to step up to serve this growth in demand due to space constraints and our need to ramp up hiring quickly while prioritizing employee health and safety.
By mid-May of last year, we have made good progress to open up more capacity by adding hundreds of thousands of employees. This allowed our revenue growth rate to jump to the 35% to 45% range and remained at that level through Q1 of this year when we had 41% growth. In Q2 of this year, we began to comp this high sales period from last year, and the year-over-year revenue growth rate has narrowed. It has also narrowed as vaccines become more readily available in many countries and people are getting out of their homes.
Since May 15, again, excluding Prime Day, our year-over-year growth rate has dropped into the mid-teens. Our Q3 revenue guidance range of 10% to 16% growth reflects an expected continuation of this trend. Given all this volatility, it's useful to consider the 2-year compounded annual growth rate, which remains strong in the 25% to 30% range. Recall this compares to our pre-pandemic growth rate of 21%. This reflects the acceleration of Prime membership and Prime member purchase levels over the past 18 months.
While I'm not giving forward guidance beyond Q3 of this year, we do expect this pattern of difficult year-on-year revenue comps to continue for the next few quarters. As we move forward and start to comp COVID's impact on our revenue growth, we encourage you to also look at the multiyear compounded annual growth rate since the onset of the pandemic to better put this growth in perspective.
Now back to the Q2 highlights. We continue to be very pleased with the Prime member growth and engagement we're seeing. We've been fortunate to welcome more than 50 million new members in the past 18 months, and Prime member benefits usage remains high. That includes continued strong engagement in Prime's family of digital offerings, like Prime Video's original movies. For example, Prime members helped make The Tomorrow War and Tom Clancy's Without Remorse the #1 streaming movies on their respective opening weekends.
Amazon advertising is innovating at a fast clip, launching over 40 new features and self-service capabilities in the quarter, making it easier for sellers, companies and authors to grow their businesses by helping customers discover their brands and products. Other revenue increased 83% year-over-year in Q2, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, driven largely by continued acceleration in our ads business.
Moving on to AWS. Revenue growth accelerated across a broad range of customers. We see strong growth in enterprises, governments, educational and research institutions and our start-up and digital-native customers. We recently announced new commitments and migrations from customers across a diverse set of major industries, including Swisscom and Bell Canada in Telecom, BMO Financial Group and Bancolombia in financial services and Ferrari in automotive.
AWS customers recognize that the move to the cloud is very positive for their businesses in the medium and long term. Disruptive economic events like COVID have caused many people to step back and think about how they want to change strategically, and many have come to the conclusion that they do not want to own and run their own data centers. They see that they can save money and gain agility and innovation by moving to AWS.
I'll finish up with some comments on our ongoing investments in operations. As we think about the pull forward in demand we've seen these past 18 months, it has required and will continue to require a significant amount of investment in our fulfillment network. Our teams have done a remarkable job stepping up to serve customers and support our vendors and sellers, and we have worked hard to increase capacity at a rapid rate.
For the trailing 12 months ended Q2, CapEx and equipment finance leases increased 74% versus the prior trailing 12-month period. And as usual, most of our 2021 spend in building openings are planned in the second half of this year. This is all part of a multiyear investment cycle for us. Unit volumes, while obviously growing at lower rates off last year's large comp, continue to remain high, and we see strong demand for FBA and third-party sellers. So there's more work to do, including additional build-outs of our FCs as well as our middle mile and last mile capabilities to support our fast improving delivery offers for customers.
I encourage you to read the business highlights in our press release. It's a diverse collection of efforts supported by many thousands of customer-focused Amazon employees, from Amazon Pharmacy, to Business Prime, to AWS' plans to add 7 new regions, to NFL Thursday Night Football starting next year, to the Black Business Accelerator program, to Alexa's collaboration with Ford Motor Company. We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders.
With that, let's move on to Q&A.",1224

Just going back to the 2Q revenue. Beyond Prime spend moderating and the reopening, is there anything else you'd point to, in particular, that may have kept you in the middle of the range versus, obviously, where you've been over the last year versus expectations? And I guess, in particular, if you talk about Prime Day relative to your expectations?
And then secondly, the big commerce partnership a couple of weeks ago, you seem to open up more to working with merchants away from Amazon. Just hoping you could talk more about the multichannel fulfillment opportunity. And do you think you now have the logistics capabilities, and has everything recovered to the point where you can offer these services more to third parties?",130

Now, as far as Q2 run rate is concerned, if you look back the last few quarters, we've not done a great job of nailing the impact of COVID. It has -- we've generally overperformed our guidance range. I think last quarter, we had kept the same process, coming off some very high volumes for the last prior 4 quarters.
And really, the only difference I see in Q2 versus Q1 and before is the year-over-year comp, which we had factored in, but also the increase in mobility. I think the impact of people getting vaccinated and getting out in the world, not only shopping off-line, but also living life and getting out, it takes away from shopping time. It's a good phenomenon and it's great. And we just have to appropriately gauge our run rate going forward.
So Prime Day was very successful. We passed the record set in last fall's Prime Day, which was a very different time of year to have Prime Day and started to bump up against early holiday shopping. So we're really pleased. And again, I think it was a great day for -- then for third-party sellers, as I pointed out.",201

I'd just say our focus is really squarely on adding capacity to meet the current high customer demand that Brian talked about in his opening remarks. Now we're always working to develop new and innovative ways to support partners, SMBs, in particular, who sell on Amazon. And that includes testing shipping programs and newer initiatives that can help those businesses get packages to customers quickly and reliably. So continue to see us look for ways to be able to innovate where it's appropriate relative to the customer demand we're already seeing in our network.",102

And I think that was evident in gross margin as well. So I guess my question is whether there's any deliberate shift towards these services, or is that just more of an output of the somewhat weaker trends you saw after mid-May?
And then secondly, is Prime Day still a once-per-year phenomenon? Or would you consider separate events spread out during the same year to capitalize on different seasonal trends?",99
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2356.0,2355528.0,90040720.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,9,"Sure. On the second question, I don't have anything to announce today. Our trend has been once a year. Of course, it's moved between quarters the last 3 years. So that's all I have on that one.
As far as the higher-margin areas and whether that's a purposeful strategy, I'd like to say it is, but if you look at what they are, third party is kind of a continuation of strength in our FBA program, in particular. I think the sellers are doing a great job of adding additional selection. That's very valuable and reinforces our flywheel. And we like to see that, and you see that third-party percent of units went up from 53% last year to 56%. And that's a steady mark. We've seen that. As we said, the third-party sellers are doing a great job, and we like to see that.
On advertising, advertising is, again, another part of our flywheel. We have traffic coming in for the consumer business. And if we do a good job with advertising, we'll make it an additive experience for our customers and our sellers and vendors. So that's what we work on is to make sure that it's a relevant experience and adds to your shopping experience and helps you find selection that perhaps you wouldn't have found otherwise or it would have been harder to.
And then on AWS, AWS is, again, its own separate part of the business. It has been 15 years in the development, and we think our scale and experience really pays dividends. If you look at the last quarter, AWS added more revenue quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year than any quarter in our history. We're now a $59 billion annualized run rate business, and that's up from $43 billion at this time last year.
So those are output measures, as we like to say. The input measures are doing a good job on products, adding new capabilities and being able to work with our customers to solve their problems. And I think that's what you're seeing, and it's matching up well with a renewed emphasis on getting to the cloud by a lot of companies out there. And when they are looking to make that transition, it's giving up control and putting yourself in choosing a partner for the long haul, and we're proud that companies choose us for that journey.",396

The nitpicky one, Brian, fulfillment costs, I guess, on a per unit basis was pretty high in the second quarter relative to normal seasonality. Can you talk to us about what's driving that? Is that new build, new square feet or is there sort of inefficiencies that went on in the quarter in fulfillment?
And the second one, sort of a bigger picture. I think last quarter, you talked a little bit about same-day in Europe. There's been some headlines about same-day. How do we think -- or how should we think about a larger same-day offering being part of the investment process right now just to sort of maintain and grow your share of grocery and consumables?",130
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2356.0,2355528.0,90040723.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,12,"Sure. Thanks. Yes, I would say on the fulfillment side, there are a number of things. First, we're adding a lot of capacity. If you step back, the Amazon-fulfilled unit volume, so that's the units coming out of our fulfillment centers, both retail and FBA, have doubled in the past 2 years. And the AMZL, the delivery arm of our business, has more than doubled in that time period. So you can see there's been very strong multiyear demand here that we are still catching up with from last year.
So most of -- I mentioned earlier our year-over-year growth in CapEx and equipment leases is 74% in the second -- at the end of June compared to 38% the year before. So we're continuing to add, and most of that development is really ahead of us, in the second half of the year. So if you've been with us a long time, you know the cadence is that as we add demand -- or excuse me, as we add capacity, there's a lot of additional costs, from hiring, to starting up, to training, to getting that building or sort center or delivery station up and running. It usually takes a multiyear period to tame those assets. And we've literally nearly doubled our network here in the last 18 months from a size standpoint. So there's a lot of that going on, a lot of strong effort by our fulfillment and ops teams to help mitigate the cost.
The other thing is wage pressure has become evident. We've talked about this a bit. The wage increase for -- that we normally would do in October, we pulled forward into May. We're spending a lot of money on signing and incentives. And while we have very good staffing levels, it's not without a cost. It's a very competitive labor market out there. And certainly, the biggest contributor to inflationary pressures that we're seeing in the business.",325
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2356.0,2355528.0,90040724.0,Answer,Dave Fildes,,Executives,13,"Brian, on the second point just around speed, as we've talked about many times, customers respond well to the fast, high-quality delivery. And of course, back in 2019, we were talking at that time about expanding the 1-day delivery in the U.S. -- in Europe. One-day delivery, as part of Prime, in most of those sizable European countries where we operate, has been standard for many years.
We're investing in the transportation network to support the demand. A significant part of the capital investments we've been talking about for the past few years and certainly, since the pandemic's start has been to support those efforts in middle and last-mile capacity to keep pace and support with that demand. So as we've been saying here, that work is not done yet. We're continuing to expand. You'll see that investment throughout 2021.
And that growing transportation network will support faster delivery times for customers. One-day delivery is improving in the U.S., as well as same-day delivery where it makes sense and where the network is growing there. So we'll have to continue to see how we go, but we're focused on those data points. And we're also focused on improving delivery precision as a way of improving the quality of the overall offering.",211

One, within online stores, was there any particular area of softness during the quarter? I'm just thinking about maybe some product categories that may have come back or actually, the opposite, may have gone down the demand for with the reopening that you can maybe highlight.
And then as you look beyond Q3 and Q4, kind of what kind of growth assumptions for e-commerce just in general for the next couple of years are you guys working with to build your budget and invest against the opportunity? I'm just thinking, are you guys assuming that e-commerce growth remains -- or goes back to pre-COVID levels or stays kind of at an elevated level versus that?",119
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2356.0,2355528.0,90040727.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,16,"Sure. Let me start with the online store's revenue. You're probably looking at the growth rate of 13% in Q2 versus the revenue growth -- FX-neutral revenue growth rate of 24%. I would point you back to last year in Q2 that online stores grew 49%. There were restrictions on what we stocked in our warehouses. And remember, we had to constrain space for a lot of third-party sellers as well as our retail offering. But the mix shifted for the early part of Q2 last year to be more of a retail mix and an MFN mix, and then it flipped back to be more of a balanced mix that you've seen in the past.
On forward investment, here's how I'd explain it. We -- again, we are sitting here with demand volumes that have gone up on an Amazon-fulfilled network basis, they've doubled in a 2-year period. So we are not back to where we want to be on a number of dimensions. We handled Q4 last year. We've been playing catch-up pretty much since the pandemic started. But what suffered is space and space constraints and that's -- it's gotten better but it was a factor last year.
And also our 1-day delivery percentage has dropped and has not returned to levels seen pre pandemic in the United States. It's on par and getting better than pre-pandemic in Europe. But in the United States, while it's improving, it still hasn't reached the pre-pandemic level. So we have a lot of growth to do there.
As far as the stickiness of purchases, I think there's certainly a number of things that were purchased last year that didn't repeat for a lot of retailers, things like consumables early on, gloves, cleaning supplies, computer monitors, things you use to outfit your house. You probably go through your own checklist of purchases and say, ""Okay, I probably will not do this every year.""
But there has been a healthy movement to online commerce. We've added Prime members and the Prime members that we have, have ratcheted up their purchases with us, which was -- has always been a part of the plan and a good sign. It means we're offering them more things that they can buy and satisfying more their demand needs. So even in Q2, when, as I said, rates are starting to moderate, in the quarter, those Prime member purchases still grew year-over-year on the per Prime member basis. They just didn't grow at the same clip that they had in the prior 3 or 4 quarters.
So that's a good sign. And we like the engagement levels and the retention levels that we see with Prime members. So all in all, a very positive story on that front has accelerated the model quite a bit. There's just, again, some comparison issues that we'll just have to realize and perhaps look at a 2-year compounded annual growth rate for a period of time to judge where we are on that progress because there's been a lot of ins and outs, especially with Prime Day moving around. So hopefully, that answers your question.",524

So I was wondering if your third-party marketplaces platform is seeing perhaps a faster influx of more sellers or emerging brands.
And following up on the labor market commentary there. Do you think you will see any incremental headwinds, hiring the necessary people for fulfillment centers this year?",71
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2356.0,2355528.0,90040730.0,Answer,Dave Fildes,,Executives,19,"Stephen, it's Dave. I'll take that first question just around SMBs and behavior. I think, look, it's -- we've seen a 20-year progression in terms of building out the services that we thought were -- resonated with us in our business but also sought very early on to externalize those services and offerings to sellers and particularly, small and medium-sized businesses over time.
Obviously noteworthy was FBA and many other features. And so I think this -- what you see is really just a continuation of that effort put out by the teams around whether it's logistics, brand representation. More recently, in recent years with some of the advertising features, we've been able to develop surface for all our selling partners. And so I think that's a big area and a big part of commitment.
So I don't know that I'd call out anything specifically in the near term other than to say that we continue to see great momentum. On a units basis, as we give that metric every quarter, about 56% of our overall total paid units are third party. That's up about 300 basis points year-over-year. So expect for us to continue to put forth that effort in FBA around the world for sellers and some of these other SMB features, continue to gain momentum there.",219

We've got a labor estimate in our Q3 guidance. I would say it's a bit of a complicated mix of economic growth and industries opening up, government payments in some areas that may impact people's working and then whether or not children are back at school fully in the fall. So there's a lot of dynamics. We do count on having more employees in Q3 and Q4, as you know, from our ramp-up to the holidays. So I would probably count on wage pressure remaining for the immediate future.",102

It's -- if you look at the results, it's now producing consistently positive results here. And so can you talk to us a little bit more -- just talk to us a little bit more about what's driving that. Is this the result of most major builds are now complete and you're seeing the efficiencies in fulfillment centers and so we should see this trend to continue? Or is there something else that's driving international operating income just remaining positive here?",90
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2356.0,2355528.0,90040734.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,23,"Sure. Ron, thanks for your question. Yes, we have had strong international results in the last 5 quarters or so. Noticeably, there have been positive operating income, which had not been the trend prior to Q2 of last year. I would say the major factors here are the acceleration of growth. So we've, in some ways, put the 2 years out-growth on top of today's assets. That's a lot of stress but it's a lot of leverage of the assets that we have.
And as we've talked about before, our fulfillment centers and operations have been running pretty much at peak since May of last year. It's starting to mitigate a bit but it's a strong undercurrent. But having said that, we continue to invest in international expansion. You may have noticed that we added Portugal as a Prime country last quarter. We have investments in Brazil, in India, in the Middle East, in a number of countries. So we continue to add new countries.
We have a strong performance in our more established countries like Europe and Japan. And so it's a bit of a mixed bag. But right now, again, the performance is very strong. The foreign exchange rate has been favorable as well the last few quarters, so that has helped. But really pleased with the performance of our international teams.
And we'll see, again, it -- our investment plans -- our plans are to make money, obviously, in the long run, but we have forward advanced Prime benefits in a lot of these countries before they would have been able to see them if they have run the same trajectory as we did in the U.S. So there's a bit of forward investment on Prime benefits, especially things like Video that we know resonate with customers and are good for the Prime program and turn into, eventually, really strong businesses.",314

So Amazon -- sorry, AWS. So you saw a 10% sequential growth in the quarter. You saw that also in the fourth quarter. Was there anything around reopening that made second quarter AWS exceptionally strong and that we should kind of keep in mind going forward? Or do we feel like this was kind of a normal quarter for kind of AWS and this is kind of a good cadence for the business?
And then just a follow-up. Just your -- maybe your point about the ability to kind of keep up. Is there any kind of throttling of FBA that's going on just because you don't have the capacity? Or were you trying to say that you might be losing share to other sellers who can kind of promise to get an item to customers faster, given still some of the challenges with logistics and last mile and everything?",158
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2356.0,2355528.0,90040737.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,26,"Let me start with that second question. No. My comments were really about throttling of space last year, which did impact -- impacted our vendors and our retail business as well as our third-party business. It's probably more pronounced in Q2 of last year, especially April and into early May, as we are working to get fully staffed in a helpful and safe way and also build out more capacity.
In Q4, again, we were handling volumes that were somewhat unheard of year-over-year. Our Q4 growth rate was 42%. That's usually not the case. And it's magnified at peak when we're already handling the highest volumes of the year. So all I was trying to say was that our space planning and, if you will, throttling of space for our third-party sellers is not something we like to do. We don't think we're the only ones who had that issue, and that's why we're building out our network. So quickly -- in our minds, it's hard to do quickly but we're moving as quickly as possible. And again, we have a lot of new capacity being added in the second half of the year. 
On AWS growth, if you look at the run rate last year, we had 33% growth rate in Q1, and it dropped to 29%, 29% to 28% the last 3 quarters. There's always a lot of year-over-year things but -- going on, but we do note that last year, there was a lot of effort by companies to limit their spend and operate more efficiently as we're all plunged into a kind of an unknown demand curve, and some industries were hurt worse than others.
If you'll remember, we worked -- we actually worked very hard with our customers to help them lower their demand for AWS services as best we could to match any new demand patterns. We also helped people scale very quickly. Companies like Disney+, Netflix and others were very glad that AWS was there to help them scale to meet volumes very quickly.
So there's a lot of mixed bag there. We think that it was a strong performance this quarter. We do see good trends with new contracts and new clients that are either signing up with AWS and making the journey to the cloud or accelerating their journey to the cloud or setting up new longer-term contracts with us.",399

Let me start with the second one. So again, at any point in time, there's a lot of cost pressures in the operating margins of AWS. There's growth, which helps us leverage our assets. There's increasing the efficiency of our servers and the efficiency of our sales force. Those are all positives.
On the flip side, there's price decreases, there's new contracts signed with large players for multiple years. So there's pricing pressure. There's also the expansion of the sales force and building infrastructure to add new regions globally. So as we said, these margins are going to bounce around. We're happy with the Q2 margins. I would note that there was a negative impact from foreign exchange that was about 150 basis points. But even at 28.3%, it's a strong margin for this business. We know it's going to bounce around as we invest, but also work very hard to scale our businesses and efficiently run our assets.
On the leadership change, as you expect, Andy has hit the ground running. He's continuing to have a very high bar for customer experience, high standards operational excellence, inventiveness, willingness to fail and everything else that Amazon is known for internally and externally. I think we've had a good handoff. Jeff, of course, is moving into an Executive Chairman role, and he will not be leaving. He's obviously continuing to be very involved in, as we say, the one-way door decisions.
We've also had a good leadership change at AWS with Adam Selipsky coming in. Adam, himself, comes with a lot of Amazon history and knowledge and external CEO experience that has made him even stronger as he comes back. So we feel really good about the transition. And, of course, don't expect any drop and expect Andy to add his unique brand of positive attitude and optimism and forward-looking focus to help Amazon keep going and delighting customers.",319

Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2020. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 28, 2021 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
And now I'll turn the call over to Brian.",349

Let me first start by reiterating and expanding on a few comments that Andy made in our earnings release. We are now reporting our results for the seventh quarter since the pandemic began, and we are especially proud of our employees, for both their response to the unprecedented customer demand we have experienced as well as for their implementation of many safety procedures to create a safe work environment.
During this period, we have continued to earn the trust of our customers, especially our Prime members, who have increased their annual purchases and their use of Prime benefits over the last 20 months. We've also seen strong growth in our advertising products as vendors and sellers have embraced their ability to build their brands and to reach customers just as they are considering their purchases. And AWS has seen a reacceleration of revenue growth as customers have expanded their commitment to the cloud and selected AWS as their cloud partner. As a result, Amazon's Q3 revenue of $110.8 billion represented a 2-year compounded annual growth rate of 25% versus a pre-pandemic growth rate in the low 20% range. We're grateful to our customers who have put their trust in us.
However, there certainly have been challenges to overcome since February of last year. We've nearly doubled our operations capacity in the past 2 years to keep up with the customer demand. We've incurred billions of dollars in additional costs to keep our employees safe and to support testing and other COVID-related costs. And we have grown our global headcount by 628,000 employees in the past 18 months and are recruiting for more, including more than 150,000 in the U.S. to support Q4 seasonal demand.
The demand for labor has recently coincided with the shortage of available workers, particularly in the United States. This began in Q2, but it really started to impact our operations and cost structure in Q3. It has led to wage increases and sign-on incentives as companies compete for workers as well as inconsistent staffing levels in our operations.
In addition, disruption to the global supply chains and inflation in the cost of materials such as steel and services such as trucking have also raised our cost of operations. We estimate the cost of labor, labor-related productivity losses and cost inflation to have added approximately $2 billion in operating cost in Q3, particularly in August and September. Our Q4 guidance range anticipates that these costs will approach $4 billion in Q4 as we see a full quarter's impact of these effects and a higher seasonal unit volume.
Specifically in Q3, we saw nearly $1 billion of inflationary pressures, primarily tied to wage increases and incentives in our operations. Our average starting wage is now over $18 per hour with an additional $3 per hour depending on shifts in many locations and sign-on bonuses that can be up to $3,000.
In addition, we saw inflationary pressures in raw materials and services, as I mentioned, particularly in steel and third-party trucking. We also saw over $1 billion of costs tied to lost productivity and disruption in our operations. In Q3, labor became our primary capacity constraint, not storage space or fulfillment capacity. As a result, inventory placement was frequently redirected to fulfillment centers that had the labor to receive the products. This resulted in less optimal placement, which leads to longer and more expensive transportation routes. In short, our operations are normally well staffed and optimized to be in stock and to deliver to customers in 1 to 2 days. Labor shortages and supply chain disruptions upset this balance and resulted in additional costs to ensure that we continue to maintain our service levels to customers.
As you look to Q4, we've incorporated this nearly $4 billion of added costs into our operating income guidance range. In addition, we have a nearly $1 billion year-over-year increase in Q4 for spend to support our digital media content efforts, including video, music and games. We recently launched New World, a multiplayer online PC game, and we're delighted with the response and engagement. New World has become the highest-played new game this year on Steam.
Moving to video content. Prime Video has a compelling lineup of live sports, including the UEFA Champions League and Ligue 1 soccer in France as well as NFL Thursday Night Football in the United States. And we have a great lineup of original series to look forward to, including The Wheel of Time, Lord of the Rings and Citadel and new seasons from Jack Ryan, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and The Boys. We are excited to add this content to our Prime benefits and increase the value of our prime membership.
Q4's guidance also includes an estimated $1 billion year-over-year negative impact from lower fixed cost leverage in our fulfillment network. Recall that we saw very high unit volumes in Q4 of last year, and then our fulfillment centers were running at close to 100% capacity as we work to add physical capacity to match demand. As we are now back to having a more normal Q4 fulfillment capacity and have even brought forward 2022 capacity into 2021, our operating leverage dropped compared with last Q4.
Our revenue guidance for the fourth quarter reflects the current trends we are seeing, including the lapping of our Prime Day event in October of last year. We're dealing with labor risks and supply chain interruptions like many other companies, which increases our range of potential outcomes in Q4. Consumers have started to return to pre-pandemic spending patterns, increasing their mobility and spending more on travel and services in Q2 and Q3, but we are appreciative that the incremental demand that came our way during the pandemic has remained, and that we are continuing to grow on top of that.
We also had to make this a great holiday season for customers. Last quarter, we discussed the physical capacity we were adding to meet customer demand. We made strong progress in Q3 to build and open new facilities. And as a result, for the first time since the pandemic began, we are no longer capacity constrained for physical space in the network. September alone, we brought online more than 100 new buildings in the United States, including fulfillment centers, sort centers and last-mile delivery stations. For the year, we expect our 2021 footprint additions to exceed last year's build-out, which was also significant.
To put this in perspective, we are on track to double our fulfillment network over the 2-year period since the pandemic's early days. A lot of this increased capacity supports our FBA sellers. Third-party sellers and the products they offer remain an important strength of our offering for customers, representing 56% of total paid units sold in Q3. That's up from 54% in Q3 of last year. And we're working with these partners, most of whom are small and medium-sized businesses, to build an even stronger offering.
We recently hosted Amazon Accelerate, our U.S. conference for selling partners, where we introduced new tools and capabilities, including local selling, which enables sellers to start or expand their multichannel offerings by providing both in-store pickup and fast delivery to nearby customers, and global selling tools to make it easier for U.S. third-party sellers to offer their products worldwide.
I'll finish with a few highlights regarding 2 fast-growing areas with strong profitability profiles. First, we saw a continuation of strong usage and revenue growth in AWS, with revenues accelerating to 39% year-over-year in Q3, driven by a broad base of services and customers. There are a number of areas we're excited about, but let's focus for a moment on our efforts in machine learning.
Customers of all sizes and across all industries are using AWS as their preferred cloud provider for machine learning services. We've been investing in this area for several years, offer an extensive set of machine learning services, including ones that can be applied to common business problems like Amazon Connect for contact center intelligence or Amazon Kendra for intelligent enterprise search.
And we recently launched solutions specific to industries, including industrial machine learning services as well as Amazon HealthLake to help health care and life sciences customers seamlessly transform their data across disparate sources to understand and extract meaningful medical information. And Amazon SageMaker continues to help customers scale their use of machine learning to core workloads, making it one of the fastest-growing services in AWS history with tens of thousands of active external customers using it every month.
We also continue to see strong interest and rapid adoption of our custom silicon and AWS-designed Graviton2 processors, delivering customers up to 40% better price/performance than current x86 processors. Moving to Graviton2 means little to no code changes so that customers can quickly and easily migrate their workloads to access the best price/performance in Amazon EC2.
Last but certainly not least, Amazon Advertising continues to grow quickly, representing the significant majority of other revenue, which grew 49% year-over-year in Q3. We are seeing strong adoption across Amazon vendors, sellers and authors as well as brands that don't sell in our store, particularly as we've built out our streaming TV offerings. Of course, advertising only works if we make it useful for customers. And when we create great customer experiences, we deliver better outcomes for brands.
The team also recently hosted unBoxed 2021, our annual conference for advertisers and brands, where we shared some of our newest solutions to help companies connect with their customers, measure the impact of their advertising and grow their businesses.
As we shift into Q4, we are heads down focused on delivering a great experience for our customers this holiday season. We are committed to make the necessary investments in both people and capacity to bring more items in stock and to deliver them quickly to customers.
With that, let's move on to Q&A.",1656

Maybe I'll ask about fulfillment capacity. You said your capacity is up 2x since before the pandemic and have got units up around 55% on a 2-year basis. So just wondering, is the capacity needed per unit going up as you speed up delivery times and try to get to 1 day? And then second, are you in really good shape for next year? And could you be ahead of plan for next year and kind of cut down the investment there?",83
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2610.0,2417223.0,91918085.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,5,"Justin, on your first question about whether we, the comparison of doubling the fulfillment capacity to the unit growth. Keep in mind also that our fulfillment capacity also includes our transportation delivery capacity. And in the last 2 years, we've also greatly ratcheted up our ability to deliver ourselves through AMZL. And our percent of units that we deliver through AMZL is over 50% of our units globally. So that's a big, that's a driver as well.
I'd also say that while we've been chasing really demand for the last 2 years. We've been doing it, as I said, we're running at about 100% pretty much all of last year. We are just now getting caught up on space for inventory and inventories being brought in to support the holiday. And if you look year-over-year, while units growth is, as you say, closer to 8% in Q3, the cubic, inventory cube is up closer to 40%, both in North America and internationally. So there's like the second shoe that's dropping of getting the fulfillment centers back in stock, especially for sellers and especially as we head into holiday. So that's, I think that capacity, the amount of space we have for inventory is also going up probably at a higher rate than our unit shipped right now.
Your question about whether it pulls forward from next year. We're not forecasting into next year. We do see that we will, I mean, we expect growth. And as I mentioned on the last call, we think that the growth will be suppressed for the 4 quarters that end middle of Q2 next year, just as a comp versus 2020 just because of the 40% growth we saw last year. But we expect the long-term trends to be strong in this business. We're investing as such. As I mentioned, the 2-year CAGRs, I do that just so you can kind of judge pre-pandemic versus today. We see strong growth even off of a base of last year, which was strong.
So we'll see next year on CapEx. And certainly, for the foreseeable future, our capacity constraint is actually labor, which is new and not welcome. And that's what we've tried to articulate here today. And we are hoping that, that rectifies itself through Q4 and into early 2022.",385

First, any color around those international losses in the quarter that was large even by Amazon standards, that $900 million? And then secondly, talk about the, you've been spending, so you've doubled the fulfillment capacity, I think, to really kind of catch up to demand, but now I think like you're getting ahead of it. And as you roll out, you get close to 1 day promise that you worked up 2 or 3 years ago pre-pandemic and as you start rolling out super same-day delivery or what you call sub-1-day delivery, talk about the incremental demand you think that, that could unlock and to the extent at which you're investing against not only to catch up to demand, but trying to liberate future demand if you get my point?",132
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2610.0,2417223.0,91918088.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,8,"Yes. I definitely do. And I'm glad you brought that up because I didn't include in my last answer. But yes, we have unfinished business on the 1-day promise side. We were ramping that up nicely in 2019 and in the first quarter of 2020 before the pandemic. We're still not back to levels that we saw pre-pandemic. We're getting closer. We feel, again, that kind of labor constraints have not helped us close the gap there. But we don't want to be just as good as we were before the pandemic. We expect that to increase in 2022. And we're going to plan accordingly. And I think you start to see the difference in the growth rate before and after that 1 day.
I won't forecast it too much, but we did see pickup and we saw really that we got into the consideration set for more purchases. When something is available in 1 day or less, now you really don't have to go to a store even if you need it very quickly. So it just opens up more ways for us to serve our customers, especially our Prime customers.
On your comment about international, yes, you're right, it was a larger loss than in prior quarters. In fact, we had flipped to positive operating income through the pandemic. A lot of that was, again, getting 2 years of volume growth on top of a 1 year or current year cost structure. There's also a bit of a slowdown just in content and other things, although we're building that, we would have built it at a higher clip.
But the long-term trends remain the same in international. It's a group that has very different, we're in different stages in different countries. The established countries of Europe and Japan are further along, obviously, and they perform closer to the North America results. We have new countries. We've added a lot in the last few years, the investments in Brazil, the Middle East, Australia, adjacent countries of Poland and Sweden within Europe. So those are all important investments, but they start as an investment, and we build over time. And we front-load a lot of Prime benefits in those countries, especially things like video.
We find video as a really strong attractor of customers, and it's a gateway to Prime in a lot of those countries. So the model is a bit flipped versus what we saw in North America just because we added video later in the game. But we like what we see and we see the actual, the hours watched and the percent of Prime members who watch video is actually higher in a lot of the countries, the new countries that we're getting into.
So we're, as we said, we're going to make money long term in international. Right now, it's a bit of an umbrella that catches a lot of different countries in different stages. We're happy with both the established countries. They're also seeing, however, the pressures that we're seeing in the United States on labor cost and disruption from supply chains. So can't forecast this any further at the segment level, but I just want to give you a little color.",538
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2610.0,2417223.0,91918089.0,Question and Answer Operator Message,Operator,,Operator,9,Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.,12

And to what degree can that help ease some of the impact? And perhaps what did you learn there last year from having Prime Day in 4Q? And then can you just also talk a little bit about the drivers of AWS acceleration and how you think about the margin profile with more contribution from enterprise deals?",72
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2610.0,2417223.0,91918091.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,11,"Sure. Yes. Let's start with the holiday shopping. So yes, you're right. Last year, as we look back, we used Prime Day to pull a lot of holiday shopping forward. And people knew that delivery capacity across all retailers was going to be tight. So it was more distributed through the quarter.
Obviously, that works better for us than to have it all hit in a few concentrated weeks around Cyber Monday and Black Friday and the week before and 2 weeks after. So operationally, it's easier to perform when the volume is spread out. You are seeing a lot of promotional activity from us in October, again, trying to do what we did last year, just pull some demand and get people to buy and buy early. We think that's to their advantage. Although we're preparing to serve people throughout the whole quarter, we feel we've done a good job of lining up inventory commitments that are larger than normal.
We've looked at getting more container capacity. We've been successful in that. We've accessed new ports and ports of entry into the United States. So we're doing everything we can, granted it's at a cost penalty in many cases, but we feel good about being able to serve customers this Q4. Love it in October, but we will take it in November and December as well.
On AWS, the acceleration, I would, again, I would say that what we're seeing is, again, a lot of customers accelerated their journey to the cloud based on the pandemic. Some of their spending was suppressed in 2020. It was different. Some companies were booming, Disney, Zoom, Netflix. Others that were more travel-related were suppressed in their demand. And I think there's a general level of recovery across a lot of our customer base.
We're expanding our customer base into a lot of different areas. We'll have new different customers. We add many new products. I highlighted a few of our machine learning products. So we feel really good about the acceleration in growth. We know there was some suppression last year, but the growth last year was still in the 28% to 32% or excuse me, 28% to 33% range on an FX-neutral basis through most of the year.
On the margin side, the margins are going to be, they're always going to fluctuate over time. There's a lot of moving parts. There's a lot of extensions of contracts and long-term commitments, which are great for our business and great for customers. So there's negotiated long-term deals. There's also a lot of investment in new capacity and new regions to service high usage. We're certainly adding, continuing to add to our sales force and marketing teams. And then the counterbalance on that is how well we run our data centers, what efficiencies we get, what cost reductions we get.
So it's always going to be varying. We like where we are and will not forecast forward. But again, they're apt to change, but we're working hard to keep them high and while passing through benefits and efficiencies to customers in lower pricing.",520

18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2610.0,2417223.0,91918093.0,Question,Brian Nowak,,Analysts,13,"I have 2, Brian. The first one, I wanted to kind of ask a big picture question about the retail business. I know there's a lot of extra costs sort of moving through the system now. But maybe can you just talk to us big picture about any changes or factors that have changed the company's view about the long-term profitability, the long-term return on invested capital of the retail business now as opposed to at the end of 2019.
And then the second one is on the physical stores. You have quite a few different formats and experiments going on in the physical stores. Talk to us about areas where you've seen sort of the most positive results from physical stores, where you're pleased as opposed to areas where you still see room for improvement in the physical store strategy.",141
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2610.0,2417223.0,91918094.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,14,"Sure. Let me start with your comment on the, we'll call it the core retail business. We're very bullish on the retail business. In fact, it's impossible and not productive to even try and separate advertising from third party from retail. It's all, to us, part of a flywheel where we service customers. We do it in an efficient way, and we earn their trust and earn their future business, and we fight that battle every day. And we look to expand the Prime program to build that flywheel. We look to add new products and services like grocery and video and music and the list is long.
So when you look at retail, it's certainly expensive right now, especially with the costs I've laid out in Q3 and Q4 for us to service that business. However, we have other monetization vehicles, including advertising, that if we do well become a benefit to customers and to advertisers at the same time. That's what we work on. So that is an important part of our profitability structure. It's tied directly to happy customers and customers who are engaged in buying things.
So we don't separate those 2. We do for some reasons. We want to make sure that we're understanding where our cost and where our profits happen to be, but we do realize it's all part of the same customer offering. And we like the return on investment flywheel. We do. I get to see investments in warehouses, trucking programs, new offerings that we do, new country expansion. We segment those as much as we can into discrete decisions. And then we track them and make sure that not only are we delighting customers, we're delighting shareholders in the long term. So we feel good about that.
Certainly, the cost of fulfillment in the last few months and what we've forecast into the next quarter are not what we're happy about. But we see ourselves as the shock absorber absorbing a lot of the costs so that the customer is not impacted and sellers are not impacted. And again, there's just quite limited options in the short run to impact your cost structure. Most companies would delay shipment or add fees or something. We don't think that is customer-centric nor productive. And we will get through this period and then we are committed to getting our cost structure down.",399

Of course, we have a number of different brands and store types, Whole Foods being the largest that's got over 500 locations. We've got Amazon 4-Star, Amazon Books, the Fresh grocery stores, Amazon Go and Amazon Pop Ups. And each one, of course, has a name and the types of products they offer has its own differences.
But I think when you step back, we've said that we want options for customers to be able to shop online and in-store. And I think you're seeing that probably most predominantly with the grocery offerings and the Whole Foods footprint that we've got out there. And we want to give customers choice and offer them the combination of doing that online and in-store option, whatever works best. And the goal around this is really raise the bar for what customers can expect with this omnichannel experience. So we like the hybrid model and we're working on continuing to evolve on a lot of sort of interesting in-store experiences that will resonate with customers. We know that customers like to have a choice to be able to do that.
So some of the things that we continue to be excited about and do a lot to work on are things like the Just Walk Out technology that's been in our Amazon Go stores and has now moved into some of our Amazon Fresh stores, just really eliminates, again, one of those things that people may not realize is such a hassle or a deterrent to shopping, waiting in line and eliminating something that's really been positively received by customers as they use that technology.
Another one, just as you enter these stores, there's technology we have now in a little over 70 of our physical retail stores. That's Amazon One, which is a contactless way for folks to enter stores using their palm to identify. So that's in, as I said, retail stores and Whole Foods stores. And so keep looking for us to roll that out.
And I'd say, with these technologies, too, there's opportunities beyond the Amazon physical store footprints that I mentioned. You're starting to see Just Walk Out going in sports and kind of large arena type environments. And Amazon One is at some good locations. And both those technologies, I'm excited to employ them in Climate Pledge Arena here in Seattle. So look for us to keep iterating on those and finding other new innovative ways for customers to enjoy a unique shopping experience.",427

Just in terms of framing it almost against a year ago period, could you talk a little bit about the $4 billion of COVID costs from a year ago, the elements of EBIT contribution from things like AWS and third party in advertising and maybe help investors better understand the bridge between some of the elements of headwinds to profitability in Q4 versus Q4 a year ago. Appreciate all the comments upfront, then if we could just go a little bit deeper. And then of the costs you're incurring late Q3 into Q4, how should investors think about a permanent nature to that cost structure versus a transient nature of the cost structure, either as an output of the macro environment or the unit environment in Q4?",140

Thanks, Eric, for your questions. I'll just start with the second one. So how should we think about the cost permanence? Certainly, on the labor front there, we estimated about half of the cost is permanent base wage. The other half is in incentives that we currently offer to attract workers. We're going to have to see. I think we are going to have to adjust and work to lower our cost going forward, especially on things that we procure that may have gone up in price in the last few months. Mostly what I'm talking about is kind of third party, things like trucking and steel for fulfillment center construction. So we will be working on our cost structure for a while. If you're trying to do the bridge for Q4 year-over-year, a couple of things I would say. Yes, the COVID costs are lower by $1.5 billion versus last year.",153

If you're Q4, excuse me, the $4 billion is going to be pure variance year-over-year. That's what we've identified, $2 billion roughly of labor inflation and $2 billion of operational disruption mostly through higher transportation costs.
There are a couple of other items year-over-year. If you remember, last year, we were running at nearly 100% of capacity. That's not the ideal for us, but it has the benefit of being highly leveraged and can have other costs, but it's highly leveraged mathematically on a cost per unit shipped. As we get more into a normal buffer so that we can handle swings in volumes, especially as we get closer to holiday cutoffs, we generally run with more slack in the system. And we're in the good fortune of returning to maybe a more normal profile in space this Q4. The issue is again on labor. So there's that. There's the increased cost in digital content, combination of video, games, music, audible. So some rather large items year-over-year. Haven't given you a complete bridge, but that's what we're seeing.",179

First, you mentioned growing customers' use of Prime, more original programming coming and the services you offer continuing to expand. Do you see this demand, this new content, the new services having expanded to a point where a price increase for the Prime subscription begins to make sense? And then second, you mentioned the unBoxed event earlier this week. A number of new ad products announced there. Which among them do you expect to be most impactful to the overall advertising business?",86

I'm going to start with the first question on Prime. So yes, we're very excited about the current programming that's coming out in the back end of this year and also the prospect for 2022. We think it's a real step-up in options and quality and volume for our customers globally on the video side. I'm very excited about it. And you're right, it does have a lot of value.
I have nothing to discuss or announce around Prime price increases, but we always look at that. We look at the value. It's generally a country-by-country discussion. We look at the value we've built. We look at the time since our last price increase. There's a lot of strategic factors involved, obviously. But the main job is to build the value of Prime, and that's what we work on and video's a big part of that.",149

And Dan, on the second piece for advertising, I think we still see there's a lot of opportunity in the biggest kind of bucket, if you will, of the current advertising revenue run rate, and that's in the sponsored activity that we're able to offer up to customers, continuing to find ways to just measure that information and be able to surface it credibly and quickly and improve on that for advertisers out there. So a lot of work, I think, still being done on the team there and being able to add value for customers.
I'd point to, there's a lot of excitement in the video advertising area. I know we've talked about that in the past. It's growing quickly. It's not the biggest piece of that run rate that you see in there but growing well. And I think just the technology, we're able to develop some of the relationships that we've been able to foster with things like live sports, the opportunities with the Fire TV device and the video community and where we can reach folks through those areas is really exciting.
IMDb TV, our ad-supported channel, continues to do really well. People really enjoy that. We recently expanded that beyond the U.S. for the first time to the U.K. So a lot of really good and interesting ideas and a lot of opportunities to grow in different ways with video.",236

So you guys are always kind of beating the rest of e-commerce on speed of delivery across a wide set of SKUs. But there's a bunch of these new companies cropping up that are wiring up speedy, same-day delivery for a lot of products from either their own warehouse or from various other retailers. Do you view that as a threat? And you have a same-day offering in 15 cities. Does your same-day leverage kind of your existing fulfillment center footprint or do you have to kind of rethink the approach to get the speed down to that 30-minute window or wherever it's going to go? And the second question is just New World was a huge hit. So just any thoughts high level on the overall strategy within gaming.",134
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2610.0,2417223.0,91918108.0,Answer,Dave Fildes,,Executives,28,"Yes. I'll take the second question first related to games. So yes, I think, as we mentioned at the top, really excited to get New World out there to more customers' hands and saw some really good momentum and engagement coming out of the gate with customers there on some of the offerings like the Steam platform and Twitch as well.
But if you step back, I think, look, we've said for a while now that gaming is obviously one of the fastest-growing industries in the entertainment space. And we find and see a number of different ways to be able to offer some folks a variety of services. So we develop and publish games for customers through Amazon Games, which developed that New World.
We're also leveraging the flywheel, the Amazon flywheel of offering some exclusive and free content as part of Prime Gaming, so it's part of Prime benefits. You got AWS and utilizing AWS servers to stream games with our Luna, Amazon Luna offering. And then as I mentioned before, building this large, engaged, passionate gaming community online with Twitch.
So again, kind of to my point about a lot of really interesting ideas when we're talking about video in the advertising space. It's a lot of different areas that can interrelate, serve different communities within the gaming area. And so we're going to keep working on that, keep building and listening to customers on the games we've launched and keep pushing forward with an exciting slate in the future.",253

It's a rapidly evolving space. And obviously, we're customer-obsessed, but we also are competitor aware.
We like the business that we have. We have over 170,000 products that customers, Prime customers can get within 2 hours from Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods Market and other stores that participate with us in over 5,000 cities and towns.
So we're well on our way to providing ultrafast delivery for things that require ultrafast or things like groceries and others. And we see that expanding. But there'll be room for multiple winners in the space. And as we say, you have to have a cost structure and a logistics network that will pay for the delivery over time. So we see it as part of an offering that we offer to customers that ranges from 2 days to 1 day to 2 hours or 1 hour in some cases. So we like to meet customers where they are and when they need things, and we're working on speed consistently.",187

Obviously, Prime Day is always a really great advertising event as well. And then you saw a little bit of that in Q2 when we had Prime Day in Q2 this year, and we're lapping Prime Day from Q4 of last year. So there might be comparable issues, but as far as the strength of the offering and the differential between the growth of the advertising business versus the unit growth, we think we're really resonating with advertisers.
Working on new products, new ways to advertise, new ways to highlight their brands. It's resonating with sellers as well for the same reasons. And we feel it's additive to the customer experience. It helps customers find curated selection and also see brands that they may not have otherwise seen.",136
