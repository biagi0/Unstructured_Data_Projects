24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Jan-25-2010",2010-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3660.0,46831.0,3573155.0,Presenter Speech,Peter Oppenheimer,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We're thrilled to report our best quarter ever. We posted Apple's highest quarterly revenue and earnings and set new records in sales of Macs and iPhones. We're shipping the best products in our history and customers love them.Today, we are reporting our current results as well as all historical comparisons under the new accounting principles we discussed with you on our last earnings conference call, which I'll explain in detail after going through the highlights of our record-breaking December quarter. Revenue for the quarter was $15.68 billion, growing 32% over the prior December quarter's results and surpassing a previous quarterly record by almost $3.5 billion. Operating margin was Apple's highest ever at 2.73 billion representing 30.1% of revenue. Net income was $3.38 billion, up 50% over the year-ago quarter and was almost 850 million higher than our previous quarterly record. Earnings per share were $3.67. Turning to the details of our results. I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We generated record Mac sales of 3.36 million, beating our previous record set in the September quarter by over 300,000. Quarterly Mac sales grew 33% year-over-year and this compares extremely favorably to IDC's latest public estimate of 17% growth for the market overall in the December quarter. We are extremely proud of this result and believe our Mac hardware and software are providing outstanding innovation and value that our customers really love.Response to the new iMacs introduced in October was very strong, contributing to 70% year-over-year growth in desktop sales. Customers are thrilled with the iMac's tremendous new features, including enhanced performance, the widescreen LED display, wireless keyboard and new Magic mouse. Portable sales were also robust during the quarter, increasing 18% year-over-year, based on strong sales of both MacBook and MacBook Pro. We experienced very strong demand following the October launch of the new MacBook, which features a new durable unibody design, brilliant LED display, glass Multi-Touch trackpad and enhanced performance. The new iMac and MacBook launches showed very strong results in or education business during the quarter. Overall, Mac sales through our U.S. education channel increased 16% year-over-year, as we set new December quarter records from both K-12 and higher channels. We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory. Now I'll turn to our music products. We sold almost 21 million iPods compared to 22.7 million in the year-ago quarter. As expected, sales of our traditional iPods declined year-over-year, but the very strong 55% year-over-year growth in sales of iPod Touch resulted in an overall iPod ASP increase of 9% and revenue growth of 1%.Our share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by NPD and iPod was the top-selling MP3 player and continued to gain share internationally year-over-year in most countries we track based the latest data published by GfK.The iTunes Store delivered a record-breaking quarter, with strong sales of music, video and apps. iTunes has the world's largest online music catalog with a selection of 11 million songs. iTunes also features over 8,000 Hollywood films, including 2000 HD videos, 10,000 music videos and over 50,000 TV episodes. The App Store continues to be an unparalleled success with more than 3 billion downloads to date by iPhone and iPod Touch users in 77 countries. We ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory on a look-forward basis.I'd now like to turn to the iPhone. We are thrilled to have sold over 8.7 million iPhones during the quarter, which is a new company record and an increase of 100% over the prior December quarter. This compares extremely favorably to KAnalysis latest published estimate of 35% growth for the smartphone music [ph] overall in December quarter. Recognized revenue from iPhone handset sales, accessory sales and carrier payments was $5.58 billion during the quarter, compared to $2.94 billion in the year-ago quarter. The sales value of the 8.7 million iPhones sold in the quarter was over 5.4 billion resulting in an ASP of about $620 [ph] .We added 70 new carriers during the quarter including Canada Bell in TELUS, Orange in the UK, China Unicom and KTF of South Korea. We now have iPhone distribution in 86 countries and we are very pleased with the international growth we achieved as we've both countries and carriers. We experienced very strong year-over-year growth in a number of major markets, including Japan, Australia, the U.K., France and Germany.Satisfaction and demand for iPhone in the corporate environment remains strong. In fact, business customers have ranked iPhone the number one smartphone in J.D. Power's Customer Satisfaction Survey for the second year in a row. And we have continued to see a rapidly growing number of enterprise CIOs who have added iPhone to their approved device list. Specifically, we now have over 70% of the Fortune 200 deploying or piloting iPhone. This penetration has doubled since the iPhone 3GS first shipped this past summer. I'd now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores.  Revenue in the quarter was 1.97 billion compared to 1.75 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 13%. Our stores sold a record 689,000 Macs compared to 515,000 Macs in the year-ago quarter. About half the Macs sold in our stores during December quarter were to customers who have never owned a Mac before.We opened 10 new stores during the quarter, including spectacular new stores at the Louvre in Paris and on the Upper West Side in New York, bringing us to a total of 283 stores in 10 countries. We also completed 32 store remodel projects during the December quarter, bringing us to a 100 remodels in the calendar year. With an average of 278 stores opened during the December quarter, average revenue per store was 7.1 million, compared to 7 million in the year-ago quarter. Retail segment margin was 481 million, or 24.4%. Up from 409 million or 23.4% in the year ago quarter.We hosted a record 50.9 million visitors in our stores during the quarter compared to 46.7 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 9%. We also conducted 586,000 personal training sessions and sold 280,000 memberships to our One to One program. We now have 62 stores outside the U.S. and we're on track to open 40 to 50 stores in fiscal 2010 at least half of which we expect to be in international locations.We remain very pleased with the performance of our stores and customers continue to truly value the great experience our stores provide. Total gross margin was 40.9%, operating expenses were 1.69 billion and included a 168 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was 33 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 29% better then we expected due to a higher mix of foreign earnings.Turning to cash, our cash for short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled 39.8 billion at the end of the December quarter compared to 34 billion at the end of the September quarter, an increase of 5.8 billion. Cash flow from operations was about 5.8 billion.Our investment priority for the cash continues to be preservation of capital which has served us well in the current environment. We are continuing to focus on short dated high-quality investments and remain comfortable with our investment portfolio.As we discussed on our last conference call, in September 2009, the FASB amended the accounting standards that determine how we account for sales of the iPhone and Apple TV as well as certain other types of transactions related to revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables. We elected to adopt these new accounting principles on a retrospective basis in the December quarter. Because we began selling both iPhone and Apple TV in fiscal 2007, we retrospectively adopted the new accounting principles as if the new accounting principles have been applied in all prior periods. Consequently, the financial results of each quarter from fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2009 have been revised. We believe retrospective adoption provides analysts and investors the most comparable and useful financial information and better reflects the underlying economic performance of our business.Under the old accounting principles, we were required to account for sales of both iPhone and Apple TV using subscription accounting, because we indicated we might provide future unspecified software upgrades and features for those products free of charge. Under subscription accounting, revenue and associated product costs of sales were deferred at the time of sale and recognized on a straight-line basis over 24 months, which resulted in significant amounts of deferred revenue and deferred costs on the balance sheet.The new accounting principles require us to account [ph] for the sale of each iPhone and Apple TV as two deliverables. The first deliverable is the hardware and software provided at the time of sale and the second deliverable is the right to receive future unspecified software upgrades and features when and if they becomes available.The new rules require us to estimate a standalone selling price for the software upgrade right and to recognize that amount ratably over our estimated 24-month life for iPhone and Apple TV. For all periods to date from 2007, we have estimated the selling price of the upgrade right to be $25 for iPhone and $10 for Apple TV. The difference between the total iPhone or Apple TV sales price and the $25 or $10 estimated selling price of the upgrade right is recognized as revenue immediately. As a result, substantially all of the revenue and all of the product cost, including warranty expense from the sales of iPhone and Apple TV are recognized at the time of sale. Therefore, you will see much less deferred revenue and no deferred cost on the revised balance sheets related to past iPhone and Apple TV sales. The accounting for OpEx is unaffected by the new accounting principles.The new accounting principles also altered the way we previously accounted for some other aspects of the business, including some education and other shipments and some international carrier payments, none of which were significant. For example, under the old accounting principles, we were required to recognize revenue from certain education sales over multiple years because we could not meet the strict criteria required for immediate revenue recognition. Under the new accounting principles, we are permitted to make estimates of the value of the elements that need to be deferred and recognized over time. Therefore, in our revised financial statements a significant portion of the revenue from such transactions has been recognized as of the time of sale.The results of the December quarter, as well as the revised results of each of the past three fiscal years, reflect the new accounting principles. In addition to filing the 10-Q for the December quarter with the SEC today, we also filed an amended 10-K for 2009 to reflect the retrospective application of the new principles to prior years. To assist analysts and investors in their understanding of the impact of the new principles, we also filed an 8-K today to provide quarterly financial schedules, reconciling the application of old and new accounting principles to historical income statements, balance sheets, cash flow from operations, deferred revenue and summary data information. These schedules will also be available later today on our website at apple.com/investor. We're very pleased by the FASB ratification of the new accounting principles as we believe they will better enable us to reflect the underlying economics and performance of our business. And therefore, we will no longer be providing non-GAAP financial measures.Looking ahead to the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We will provide a range of guidance for the March quarter under the new accounting principles. We expect revenue to be between about $11 billion and $11.4 billion compared to $9.1 billion in the March quarter last year under the new accounting principles. We expect gross margin to be about 39%, reflecting approximately 40 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to about 1.64 billion, including about 190 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about 30 million, reflective of  the short-term interest rate environment and we expect the tax rate to be about 29%. We are targeting EPS in the range of about $2.06 to $2.18 compared to $1.79 in the year-ago quarter under the new accounting principles.In closing, we're extremely pleased with the results of our record-breaking December quarter, including our 32% revenue growth and 50% net income growth. We remain focused on delivering the industry's most innovative products and great value to our customers and we are incredibly excited about our new product pipeline. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.",2146

We're thrilled to see the Mac at the 33% growth rate. It is about two times the market. And so I wouldn't want to predict what will occur in the future. As you know, we don't do that other than to give guidance. But I would point out that some of the markets that we're in, the Mac growth was absolutely spectacular. As an example, Italy, France, Switzerland and Spain all grew at 40% or higher. Australia was up over 70%, China was up almost 100%. And so we've got -- there's some markets out there that we're doing extremely well and we'll just have to see where it takes us.

We've been working with them since, really since well before we announced the first iPhone to get it out.

And in the vast majority of locations, we think that iPhone customers are having a great experience from the research that we've done.

I know that you've switched over the accounting, but it looked like under the prior accounting method, your gross margin would've been somewhere north of 37%, which is well above the 34% that you guided to on the last call. And I was hoping that you could, as you usually do, give us a sense of the puts and takes on gross margin during the December quarter?And for the March quarter as well.",82

And the guidance that we provided, as you said, Rich, was under the historic principles. So the two are not comparable. But let me try and help, and actually I like to first start with revenue. Our actual revenue of 15.68 billion exceeded the guidance that we gave under the old accounting principles by over 4 billion. And roughly half of that was attributed to the performance of the business, we set records for Mac and iPhone shipments, had a great iTunes quarter -- and by the way, iPod Touch up very strongly, 55%. And the accounting change accounted for the other half of the 4 billion. We focused our attention on converting to the new accounting, which was really complex and I'm so proud of how hard the finance team and the systems teams worked to accomplish this so quickly after the FASB amended the standard. So we didn't spend as much time really diving into the gross margin. But I can tell you that the December quarter gross margin of 40.9 was a bit better than we expected heading into the quarter due to three factors. The first is, we did experience a better commodity environment then we had anticipated. Second, we had better warranty performance and lower freight and duty cost than we had anticipated. Second, we had better warranty performance and lower freight and duty costs than we planned. And we did benefit from the higher revenue and leveraged some of our fixed cost. As we go forward to the March quarter, I would expect gross margin to be about 39%, down a little bit sequentially as a result of three factors, all about equal in size. The first is we do expect the higher component environment and some other cost in the March quarter, relative to what we saw in December. Second, we'll have a very typical seasonal decline in revenue and so we won't have as much leverage on our fixed cost and we won't the benefit of a couple of small one-time items that we had in the December quarter, not repeating. And then finally, the U.S. dollar has strengthened here in the new calendar year from where we were in the December quarter. And that's having an impact as well.",395

For this quarter compared to last quarter, we're continuing to see that the market is very constrained in VRAM. And we do expect that, that will drive prices higher sequentially. For the vast majority of the other commodities, it appears to us that the excess inventories that causes prices to fall last year have been depleted and are more in a supply-demand balance.

For Mac, we would expect to see a sequential decline, which is very typical in the March quarter from the December holiday quarter. For iPod, we certainly would expect to see the same. And given that our expectations in traditional iPod sales will decrease over time, the sequential decline may be a little bigger than we've seen in prior years. And we don't have a lot of experience with iPhone, but certainly gaining some.

We started selling in China, as you know, at the very end of October, beginning in November. Earlier this month, we had cumulatively activated over 200,000 units, crossing the 200,000 unit mark. We ramped the point of sales across that period of time to end at about 1,500 by the end of Q1. And we are very, very focused on the quality of the point of sales and the customer experience. And so we would prefer to move slow because we're building the brand for the long-term and we're very much focused on the long-term in that market because we think there's significant potential there.

We are completely comfortable with it. We could have sold a lot more and elected not to because we're managing inventories very tightly. I'm not putting a target of four to six weeks up there on iPhone, we do have that target on iPod as you know, and we have a target on the Mac of four to five. We ended under the Mac number and ended within the iPod number despite, although we did pull the inventory on the iPod down from beginning to end of the quarter by about 150,000 units. On the phone [iPhone], we obviously had expansion through the quarter in terms of the number of carriers that we're dealing with, within some existing countries and also launched some larger countries like China and Korea and really needed more inventory than we started with. But I feel totally comfortable with it.",172

I think it's important to keep this in some perspective that we have over 100,000 apps on the store. And that over 90% of the apps that we've had, have been approved within 14 days of the submission. We created the approval process to really make sure that it protected consumer privacy, safeguard children from inappropriate content and to avoid apps that degrade the core experience of the phone. Some types of content, such as pornography are rejected out right. Some things like graphic combat scenes and action games might be approved, but with appropriate age ratings. Most of the rejections however are actually bugs in the code itself and this is protecting the customer and the developer to a great extent because they don't want customers who are unhappy with the apps. So I think what you have here is something that -- the noise on it occasionally may be much higher than reality with over 90% approved within 14 days, I think this is pretty good.",171

We have just really got going in China. I really like what I see so far. It's -- although the average income is not nearly as high as perhaps the United States and some other Western European markets, there is a significant size middle class in -- up there. And so, I think it's somewhat a -- I think to do a real deep analysis, you really have to look, not just at the averages, but at the distribution of income within these countries. We have been selling in Brazil for a while and we are learning about Brazil as well. The Brazilian economy is different than the Chinese economy because the duties are very significant, and the taxes are very significant there, which tends to compound the price. But we are very focused on these markets and in fact, if you look at greater China last quarter, which is China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, our revenues tripled year-over-year in that geography, which is I think phenomenal by any measure. And so we have a tremendous focus on it. As was alluded to you earlier in the call, 58% of our revenue last quarter was from outside United States. And it's clear as you can look at our numbers, our growth rates are much higher outside the U.S. And so we realized that we must do well in these markets to continue to grow.",237

As you know, we did feel strongly that that did exist with the iPod. On a corporate basis, the iPhone really saw a significant acceleration of acceptance and exploration after we announced the iPhone 3GS and associated operating system in the mid-part of the year. And as I think Peter mentioned in some of his opening comments, 70% now of the Fortune 100 are actively piloting or deploying it. If you look internationally, about 50% of the FT 100 is doing the same. And so there are some -- those are some pretty staggering numbers when you think about the time period that we've been in the business, it's only two and a half years and several of the requests from enterprises really implemented in the June, July timeframe.

Primarily what we've seen in the countries that we have done this in is that the sales are largely incremental as we add carriers. As you know, we've added carriers in the U.K. I think when our market share comes up there, you'll see a significant change. We've added carriers in France and I'm pleased to say that the latest GfK numbers for market share in France is over 60% for the October, November timeframe. We've added carriers in the Scandinavian countries and saw market share increases, I think we will see the same in Canada, when we get the market share numbers for Canada. And so that's what we've seen so far. However, we've also selected in most cases, we've selected countries that we thought that would happen in.

Or could we see more of a services type flavor longer term?  Any help there would be greatly appreciated. And then Peter on the tax rate, just given the increasing contribution to growth from international, can we think about tax rate having the downward pressures to go into the back half of this year?",94

I'll start with your second question first. We did have a lower tax rate for the first quarter and your tax rate is really the one part of the guidance where under GAAP, it's annual. So at this point, we expect our tax rate to be about 29% for fiscal '10. And when I last spoke with you in October, we had expected it to be 30. So yes, it's down a point and it's down a point because of a higher mix of foreign earnings. And so if foreign earnings were to grow beyond what we have thought about for the year, then our tax rate may very well be lower. In terms of our Quattro and Lala acquisition. We acquired Quattro because we wanted to offer a seamless way for our developers to make more money on their apps, especially those that are providing free apps.

I talked about how we're accounting for an iPhone sale in really two elements. The first being the initial hardware and the software that somebody would buy and walk out of the store with. And the second element being the right to receive future upgrades when and if they become available and we have estimated the selling price of that upgrade for iPhone to be about $25. So in terms of what we've done here in the revision of our financial statements, we went back and applied a $25 deferral to all iPhones that we have sold in the past and a $10 deferral to Apple TV. And when you look at the -- all the things that we put out today in terms of income statements and balance sheets and cash flow, you'll see that there is substantially less deferred revenue on those balance sheets and no deferred costs. We are recognizing the deferred revenue from the $25 deferral each quarter in our balance sheet. And so to help you be sure that you have your models correct on a go-forward basis, we essentially recognized about $110 million in the December quarter for the $25 that we deferred for all the iPhones that we sold over the past two years. So Keith, we deferred $25 on the 8.7 million iPhones that we sold in the quarter. So that came out as revenue. But then we put in about 110 million from the amortization that occurred from the past two years sale. Does that make sense?",264

The iPhone was up over 400% year-on-year during the quarter. And so that's what's driving that huge revenue growth that you see in Japan. The Mac growth is above market, but we believe we can do better in the Mac area in Japan. In Asia Pacific, Asia Pacific is doing an incredible job with the Mac, growing 54%. It's our highest performing region in terms of growth. And in the iPhone, the iPhone was up over 500% in Asia Pacific and as you probably remembered, we talked about China on this call, but we also added Korea during the quarter and we added several other countries throughout the year after Q1 of last year. And so iPhone really drove an incredible amount of the total revenue growth that you see on revenue of 140%.",150

As I've said before, the team did just an amazing job to implement this new accounting within four months of the FASB ratifying it. The comments that I made were that our revenue were $15.68 billion under the new accounting, exceeded the guidance we gave under the old accounting by over 4 billion. About half of that was driven by the amazing performance of the business, and the other half was driven by the accounting change.",98

And so we feel great about how we came out of the quarter. That we had very few orders that were supported with stimulus funds. And I would hope that, that would change in the future, although I don't know if that will happen or not. Our whole Ed business is based on that, we really understand teaching and learning and student achievement at a very deep level. And we think we're the only technology company that really gets it. And so we sell a lot more than just sell boxes as many other people do. And so I think with staying very focused in that market, I think we can continue to do well.

Thank you for joining us. We're thrilled to report outstanding March quarter results that exceeded our expectations. The strong momentum we experienced in the holiday quarter continued in the March quarter. As a result, we are reporting our best non-holiday quarter revenue and earnings ever, the highest quarterly iPhone sales ever and a new record for Mac sales in the March quarter. We're delivering the best products in Apple's history and our customers are responding enthusiastically. 
Revenue was $13.5 billion, a 49% increase over the prior March quarter's results. This very strong performance was due primarily to the more than doubling in iPhone sales and the strong momentum of our Mac products. This resulted in a much smaller sequential revenue decline from the December to March quarters than we normally experience.  Operating margin was $4 billion, representing 29.5% of revenue. Net income was $3.1 billion, up 90% over the year-ago quarter. And earnings per share were $3.33.
Turning to the details of our results, I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We generated record March quarter sales of 2.94 million Macs. This represents 33% year-over-year growth compared to IDC's latest published estimate of 24% growth for the market overall in the March quarter.
We were very pleased with Mac sales growth in each of our geographic segments, and we experienced strong double-digit growth for both desktop and portable categories. We made our portable lineup even stronger last week by introducing an updated MacBook Pro line with faster processors, more powerful next-generation NVIDIA graphics and even longer battery life. We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory.
Moving on to our music products. We sold 10.9 million iPods, about equal to the 11 million we sold in the year-ago quarter. Sales of iPod touch continued to be very strong, with units growing 63% year-over-year. The strong mix of iPod touch resulted in overall iPod revenue growth of 12%, the strongest iPod revenue growth rate in the last two years. Our share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by NPD. iPod was also the top-selling MP3 player and continued to gain share internationally year-over-year in nearly every country we track, including high market share countries, such as Australia, the U.K., Canada and Japan, based on the latest data published by GfK.
The iTunes Store delivered its best quarter ever with sales of $1.1 billion due to the continued strong demand for music, video and apps. iTunes has the world's largest online music catalog with a selection of over 12 million songs, and in February, we crossed the 10 billion mark for songs purchased and downloaded. The App Store continues to be a phenomenal success with more than 185,000 apps and well over 4 billion downloads to date by iPhone and iPod touch users in 90 countries.
We're very excited to have launched the iBook Store, as well as over 3,500 new apps designed for iPad. We ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory. 
I'd now like to turn to the iPhone. We are thrilled to have sold 8.75 million iPhones during the quarter, an all-time high, exceeding the previous record set in the most recent holiday quarter. This represents 131% year-over-year growth over the previous March quarter's result and is more than 3x IDC's published estimate of 41% growth for the Smartphone market overall in the March quarter. Recognized revenue from iPhone handset sales, accessory sales and carrier payments was $5.45 billion during the quarter compared to $2.43 billion in the year-ago quarter. The sales value of iPhones alone was about $5.3 billion and dividing this by the 8.75 million units, yields in ASP of about $600.
We've continued to expand iPhone's reach by adding both carriers and countries, and we now have iPhone distribution with 151 carriers in 88 countries. We experienced very strong year-over-year growth in each of our geographic segments and particularly in Asia, Australia, Japan and Europe. We were very pleased with the significant sales growth from both existing and new carrier partners. We were also very pleased that customers, once again, ranked iPhone first in J.D. Power and Associates' 2010 U.S. Wireless Smartphone Customer Satisfaction Study.
We are also very excited about the release of the iPhone OS 4 this summer. Developer response to the beta release and new SDK has been very positive, and we believe customers and developers will really enjoy the over 100 new features, including multitasking for third-party apps, folders, enhanced enterprise support, the iAd mobile advertising program and much more.
Turning to the iPad. We're extremely pleased with sales results during the past couple of weeks and the critical reviews and customer feedback have been outstanding. Customers are loving the iPad and its revolutionary Multi-Touch user interface that lets them browse the Web, read and send e-mail, enjoy and share photos, watch HD videos, listen to music, play games, read eBooks and much more. We're on track to begin shipping the 3G version of the iPad in the U.S. on April 30 and to begin shipping both versions of the iPad in nine additional countries at the end of May. 
I'd now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores. Revenue in the quarter was $1.68 billion compared to $1.38 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 22%. Our stores sold 606,000 Macs compared to 438,000 Macs in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 38%. About half the Macs sold in our stores during the March quarter were to customers who’ve never owned a Mac before.
We opened two new stores in the U.K. during the quarter, as well as a new store in Germany to end with 286 stores. With an average of 284 stores opened during the March quarter, average revenue per store was $5.9 million compared to $5.5 million in the year-ago quarter. Retail segment margin was $373 million or 22.2% compared to $317 million or 23% in the year-ago quarter. We hosted 47 million visitors in our stores during the quarter compared to 39.1 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 20%.
We also conducted over 700,000 Personal Training Sessions, and we ended the quarter with 607,000 members in our One to One program. We remain on track to open 40 to 50 new stores in total during fiscal 2010 with over half being in international locations including London, Paris and Shanghai.
Total company gross margin was 41.7%, which was 270 basis points above our guidance. This difference was primarily driven by several categories of positive factors compared to our forecast. In order of relative impact, these were: First, a stronger product mix including more iPhones and accessories; second, lower costs; and third, fixed cost leverage from the higher-than-expected revenue in the March quarter, as well as a few other small items.
Operating expenses were $1.65 billion and included $194 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $50 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 24%. We had previously forecasted a 29% tax rate for the full year but have revised our forecast to about 27% based on a higher mix of foreign earnings. The 24% tax rate for the March quarter was required to true up the year-to-date provision to 27%.
Turning to cash. Our cash plus short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $41.7 billion at the end of the March quarter compared to $39.8 billion at the end of the December quarter, an increase of $1.9 billion. Cash flow from operations was over $2.3 billion. Our investment priority for the cash continues to be preservation of capital, which has served us well in the current environment. We are continuing to focus on short-dated, high-quality investments and remain comfortable with our investment portfolio.
Looking ahead to the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between about $13 billion and $13.4 billion compared to $9.7 billion in the June quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 36%, down from 41.7% in the March quarter and reflecting approximately $36 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect about 25% of the sequential gross margin decline to be driven by the first quarter of iPad sales. As we said in January when we announced the iPad, we have been very aggressive with pricing and are delivering tremendous value to customers. We think the market for the iPad will be large, and we want to capitalize on our first mover advantage.
We expect the remaining three quarters of the margin decline to be due to four factors of roughly equal impact including a stronger U.S. dollar, our Mac portable transition, the beginning of the education buying season and a future product transition.
We expect OpEx to be about $1.83 billion, including $185 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $45 million, reflective of the short-term interest rate environment, and we expect the tax rate to be about 27%. We are targeting EPS in the range of $2.28 to $2.39 compared to $2.01 in the year-ago quarter. 
In closing, we are thrilled with our record March quarter results and the momentum of our business. We're very pleased with the market share gains for our iPhone, Mac and iPod products and with the tremendous customer response to iPad. We're looking forward to the release of both iPad versions in nine international countries at the end of May, and we're very enthusiastic about iPhone OS 4 arriving this summer. We are very confident in our new product pipeline and are excited about the months ahead. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.",1651

If you look at last quarter, we made the announcement, as you know, of the iPad in January. And in our view, for the last quarter, there was no obvious impact on either the Mac or the iPod. But you can look at the numbers that we're reporting and judge that for yourself. Going forward, now that we're selling into April, we really don't have enough experience to come to a judgment yet, so we'll see how it goes. We're obviously thrilled with the sales of the iPad.

Do you think any of that could have been attributed to potential people holding off on buying a Mac for an iPad? And what would you attribute maybe that step down in the month of March to?",80

And so our compare point was to a month that we announced two new products versus a month that we didn't announce any new Macs. And so I wouldn't look at -- I don't think you can really judge the Mac business on a month-by-month basis. I think looking at a longer period of time is correct. And certainly, our internal expectation was that the comparable would come down through the quarter at it began to comp against those products.",105

You talked about many margin hits sequentially. Can you talk about revenue? For example, you have the iPad, which you'd never had before, which should help sequentially. You usually have Macs up in the June quarter sequentially. And obviously, iPods are usually maybe down a little. But can you talk about the puts and takes sequentially? Is there something going on with the iPhone where maybe there's a transition that hits that sequentially that that's why you're guiding down revenue sequentially?",92

We're thrilled with the performance of our business and to be providing guidance year-over-year for growth of 34% to 38% for the June quarter. In coming up with that, we factored several points into the guidance including sequentially lower ASPs from the beginning of the education buying season, a stronger U.S. dollar and product transitions. We've also factored in sequentially lower iTunes, which is typical as holiday gift cards are used in the March quarter and also sequentially lower accessory and software sales. For Mac, we would expect to see a sequential increase in Mac unit sales as a result of the beginning of the education buying season and the recent refresh that we just did in the Mac Pro line. For iPod, our in-stocks in this March quarter were better than last year, which helped us achieve the 10.9 million units. So this year, we would expect to see a bigger sequential decline in the June quarter than the 70% we saw last year. And for iPhone, we don't have much experience with seasonality with our current country or in carrier distribution. So we're confident, and very confident, in our product but we'll see what occurs and we'll report to you in July. And for iPad, we're thrilled with customer response to the iPad. And we'll  begin shipping both the Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi + 3G versions in the U.S. by the end of April and nine additional countries by the end of May.

If you look in terms of the geographies, we had some staggering growth rates, as you mentioned. If you look at Asia-Pacific as an example, the iPhone units in Asia-Pacific grew 474% year-over-year. Japan grew 183%. Europe grew 133%. And so these are some fabulous numbers. We're seeing just incredible demand for iPhone. Some of this was led by adding eight carriers in some key countries, for example, Vodafone in the U.K. and Ireland, as well as some other carriers in key countries in Asia. But we also had very strong performance from existing carrier partners, really, around the world. And so it was widespread and just generally terrific results.",133

If you look at Greater China, which we define as Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, the iPhone units were up year-over-year over 9x. And we added another 800 points of distribution in China. The revenue also, and we've never released this number before but I'll do this in this particular case is through the first half of the fiscal year that we just completed, so the six-month period, our revenue from Greater China was almost $1.3 billion. And this is up over 200% year-over-year, and so we're well-pleased with how the company is positioned to take advantage of the growth in Greater China.",108

There are three main countries where Apple has a contractual exclusive relationship and that's the United States, Germany and Spain. There are a few smaller countries where we have a exclusive or co-exclusive, but those three are the ones that are of major markets. Over the past year, we've moved a number of markets from exclusive to non-exclusive. And in each case that we've done that, we've seen our unit growth accelerate and our market share improved. But that doesn't mean that we view that, that formula works in every single case. And so I would just sort of reiterate what I did last time is that that's our learning so far. That's the results that we've seen so far. But we think very carefully about each of these at the country level to conclude what's in our best interest.",150

Bear with me, I'm going to just plug through some numbers. But you said gross margin's going to decline 600 basis points sequentially and a quarter of that would be due to the iPad. So it's 150 basis point negative impact from the iPad. If you've seen the iPad as 10 points lower gross margin than the company average, which is way, way lower than most third-party tear-down services, which suggest it basically means that for that contribution to be true, per your guidance, iPad would need to be 15% of your revenue or $2 billion. So either iPad's going to be more than $2 billion in terms of revenue, per your guidance for next quarter and have a gross margin that is less than 10 points less than the company average, or the gross margins of the iPad are more than 10 points lower than the company average. I mean the math, I think, is pretty self-evident. So can you comment on whether we should be thinking about this device as having dramatically lower margins than the company average? Or should we be thinking about this as something that has perhaps a bit more volume than many investors are thinking about?",211

Let me comment on the iPad margin first. As you know, we don't give out specific margins for products but really refer to the company's gross margin. But that said, I would point out that when we priced iPad, we priced it very aggressively in order to deliver tremendous value to our customers. And we think the market size for the iPad is very large, and we want to capitalize on our first mover advantage. So as we've done in other products, although I'm not forecasting it, you can see that we have a good track record of writing down the cost curves with value engineering and volume manufacturing, or at least that's certainly been our experience with other products.

We've been very aggressive to take advantage of our first-mover opportunity here. And then we've got some other transitions.

It has very high growth rates from a market point of view. And Apple with the iPhone unit growth of 131% outgrew the market by 3x and so we feel great about that. And those numbers were even better outside the U.S. than inside the U.S. We've learned a number of things, and we are trying every day to take everything that we've learned and do something better from a product point of view, do something better from distribution and our carrier relationships and so on and so forth.

But the absolute number of units are still small and we still classify the product as the hobby for the company. And I would just repeat what I probably have said before is that if you look at the other markets that Apple is in, the Macintosh competes in a market of 300 million or so units a year. The iPhone competes in a market, if you look at all phones, of maybe 1.2 billion a year. The iPod competes in a market that has 100 million plus or minus units in it per year. And so these are enormous-sized markets. And clearly, the market that Apple TV is in is not, in our view, nearly that large as yet.

And what's your sense? Or do think iPad is cannibalizing maybe competitive netbooks?,30
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-20-2010",2010-04-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,21156096.0,57323.0,4321316.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,60,"Mike, it's Tim. I can only tell you that in the quarter that we finished, the Q2 that we finished in March, that although we announced the iPad in January, there was nothing obvious in the iPod numbers or the Mac numbers to suggest cannibalization. Now there's an obvious difference between announcing, and people know it's coming and it's starting to sell. And so that part of the equation, we don't know yet. We will find out. We are thrilled with how the iPad is selling and the enormous response that we've received. We also announced new MacBook Pros that you probably saw last week and the whole line changed. And so we're also happy about how the Mac business is positioned and the level of product innovation in those notebooks is enormous. We’ve taken battery life up to 10 hours; it's absolutely amazing. In terms of the iPad competing for customers who were considering a netbook, I'm the wrong person to ask that because to me it's a no-brainer. iPad, netbook, it's sort of 100 to zero. I can't think of a single thing the netbook does well. And iPad does so many things very, very well that I'm already personally addicted to mine and couldn’t live without it. So I'm probably not the right person to ask that just yet.",222

And given all the public debate over its positioning, which you obviously have some strong views on, can you elaborate on why you see it as a huge independent category given it's a new market? You just sort of listed off a bunch of markets that are pre-existing. But you've stated in this case, you also feel without that pre-existing market, it is big. And why do you think Apple's approach will outpace that of, say, competitor tablets or vertical devices like e-books?",98
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-20-2010",2010-04-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,21156096.0,57323.0,4321318.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,62,"Well, I think Steve did this extremely well as usual in positioning the product in the January announcement when he talked about that if a product category were to exist between the notebook and the Smartphone, that it would need to do some things better than either of those. And I'm just saying from my personal use, there's a variety of things that I would put on that list. And I love notebooks personally, but I would put e-mail on it, I would put browsing on it, listening to music, watching videos, watching TV shows of any type, reading books. And the list goes on. Of course, you have the entire App Store in the ecosystem built around that. And so people that like to play games as well, they now have that large canvas to play games on. And other Apps, from serious Apps to less serious Apps, the larger canvas provides a artist a lot more room to do things that are very cool. And so I think that it is a new category. And that certainly the -- it's early, but we really, really like what we see right now. We had what we thought were high hopes. And it has exceeded those. And so I mean that's all I can offer for now, but I'd love to talk again in July and tell you how the quarter went in –- for the June quarter.",238

The one you left out was price because Apple, along with the carriers, has done a good job lowering the price of the hardware over the last couple of years. But with the low end at $99, it seems that the incremental demand from here would come from more affordable monthly service plans? And so I guess my question is whether Apple has any influence via the carriers to get more aggressive on the total cost of ownership for the iPhone? And then just have a quick follow-up on the iPad.",108

And by the way, I feel like each of the carrier partners we work with want to do the same. And so I think everybody is focused on that. When we dropped the subsidized price of the Phone to $99 last year, we were actually surprised that the mix to the 3GS was very, very high. And as you know, that one starts at $199. And so I think it's important. I think that the price is important of the device. But I think there are other things that people really want, like an extremely innovative product, and all the Apps, and the ecosystem, and the great OS and the incredible hardware that we've got. And so I just think it's one of the factors.",143

One of the upside drivers of revenue and margins for the iPhone has been the aftermarket sale of things like accessories.

And the over 5,000 accessories that work for the iPhone and the iPod, largely work for the iPad.

Peter, in your same-store sales comment, I think that the Retail same-store sales were up about 7% and total retail was up about 22% in terms of revenues.

Our retail stores had a great March quarter. The average increase of revenue per store was actually up 8%. And this was the best that we had seen in six quarters. The Mac did incredibly well in the stores, up 38% overall, same-store Mac sales were up over 20%. The Phone did well. And I think the stores are going to really be a great place for customers to come and look at and buy iPads. So we're very confident in our retail stores, the experience that it's giving customers. And finally, just after 10 years of retailing, we are just ecstatic about the fact that roughly half of the Mac sales that occur each quarter are to people that have never owned a Mac before.",127

So if you annualize it, that's incredibly high by retail standards, particularly for the size of store that we have.

And the school districts are under a lot of pressure in pretty much every state across the country. I've seen no evidence that we are losing market share in education. And so I think it's really just a budget issue. And we've now entered in the June quarter the education buying season. June tends to be more dominated by K-12.

Thank you for joining us. We are extremely pleased to report outstanding results for the June quarter. During the quarter, we began shipping iPad to millions of delighted customers in 10 countries. We launched the very popular iPhone 4. We shipped iOS 4 with many great new features, and we set a new all-time record for quarterly Mac sales. 
We're shipping the best products in Apple's history, and the response from our customers has been terrific. And as a result, we are thrilled to announce today our highest quarterly revenue ever, surpassing the previous record set in the most recent holiday quarter.
Revenue was $15.7 billion, an increase of $6 billion or 61% over the prior June quarter's results. The tremendous revenue growth was driven primarily by the very successful launch of iPad in addition to strong sales of iPhone and Mac. Operating margin was $4.23 billion, representing 27% of revenue. Net income was $3.25 billion, up 78% over the year-ago quarter, and earnings per share were $3.51. 
Turning to the details of our results. I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We generated record quarterly sales of 3.47 million Macs, exceeding the previous record established in the most recent December quarter by over 100,000. This represents 33% year-over-year growth compared to IDC's latest published estimate of 22% growth for the market overall in the June quarter.
We are pleased to have outgrown the global market in both the desktop and portable categories. We experienced strong double-digit Mac growth in each of our geographies, led by both the continued momentum of iMac in the very popular MacBook Pro family, which was updated in April with faster processors, more powerful graphics and even longer battery life.
We are also pleased to report record Mac sales in our U.S. Education Institution business despite state budget constraints. We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory. 
Moving on to our music products. We sold 9.4 million iPods compared to 10.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Sales of iPod touch continued to be very strong, with sales growing 48% year-over-year. The continued mix shift toward iPod touch resulted in an overall iPod ASP increase to 12%, generating total iPod revenue growth of 4%. iPod share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by NPD.
IPod also continued to be the top-selling MP3 player and to gain share internationally year-over-year in nearly every country we track based on the latest data published by GfK. The iTunes Store had another great quarter, with revenue exceeding $1 billion and growing 25% year-over-year. The App Store continues to be an unparalleled success, with more than 225,000 apps available, including more than 11,000 apps specifically for iPad. 
IPhone, iPod touch and iPad users have downloaded over 5 billion apps from the App Store. We ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory. 
I'd now like to turn to iPhone. We were very pleased with iPhone sales of $8.4 million, including over $1.7 million iPhone 4s in the initial five countries where it was launched. This represents 61% year-over-year growth and is considerably higher than IDC's latest published estimate of 38% growth for the global smartphone market overall in the June quarter. Customers are loving the great new features of iPhone 4 including face time for video calling, the high resolution Retina display, HD video recording and the beautiful new glass and stainless steel design. 
Recognized revenue from the iPhone handset sales, accessory sales and carrier payments was $5.33 billion during the quarter compared to $3.06 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 74%. The sales value of iPhones alone was about $5 billion, which yields an ASP of about $595. At the end of the June quarter, we had iPhone distribution with 154 carriers in 88 countries. We continue to experience very strong year-over-year growth particularly in Asia, Europe and Japan. Additionally, we continue to be very pleased with strong sales growth from both long-standing and new carrier partners.
During the quarter, we surpassed two months sales of 100 million iOS devices. Response to the iOS 4 since its June 21 launch has been very favorable, with customers and reviewers praising its many new features including multitasking, folders, enhanced mail and deeper enterprise support. 
Turning to iPad, we are off to an amazing start. And we're extremely pleased with customer response with sales today. Through the end of the June quarter we shipped 3.27 million iPads to customers in 10 countries. Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during quarter was $2.17 billion. The sales value of iPads alone was almost $2.1 billion, which yields an ASP of about $640. 
Feedback from customers continues to be outstanding as more and more of them experienced iPad and take advantage of its Multi-Touch user interface, large-screen and high-quality graphics to browse the Web, read and send e-mail, read e-books and much more. We look forward to bringing iPad to customers in nine additional countries on July 23. 
I'd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores, which had an outstanding quarter, generating record revenue and customer traffic. Retail revenue was $2.58 billion compared to $1.49 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 73%. Our stores sold 677,000 Macs compared to 492,000 Macs in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 38%. About half the Macs sold in our stores during the June quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before. 
We opened seven new stores during the quarter including four in the U.S., two in Australia and one in Canada, ending with 293 stores. With an average of 287 stores opened during the June quarter, average revenue per store was $9 million compared to $5.9 million in the year-ago quarter. 
Retail segment margin was $593 million compared to $387 million in the year-ago quarter. We hosted a record 60.5 million visitors in our stores during the quarter compared to 38.6 million visitors in the year ago quarter, an increase of 57%. We expect to open 24 stores this quarter, including our fabulous new stores in Paris and Shanghai, which opened earlier this month; our Covent Garden store in London, and our first two stores in Spain to be opened in Barcelona and Madrid. 
Total company gross margin was 39.1%, which was 310 basis points above our guidance. This difference was driven by two categories of factors. The first category accounted for a little over half the difference. When we provided our guidance for the June quarter, we identified five things that we expected to drive a sequential decline in gross margin from the March to June quarters. These were the first quarter of iPad sales, a stronger U.S. dollar, our portable Mac transition, the beginning of the education buying season and the iPhone 4 transition. Collectively, these things did have an impact sequentially but to a lesser extent than we had anticipated in our guidance.
The second category of factors, which accounted for the remainder of the difference, consisted of unanticipated favorable adjustments, as well as leverage on the higher-than-expected revenue. Operating expenses were $1.9 billion and included $181 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&E for the quarter was $58 million. Our tax rate for the quarter was 24.2%, about three points below our guidance as a result of two factors. First, we had a better mix of foreign earnings, and this accounted for about 2/3 of the difference. Second, we finalized favorably some prior-year U.S. tax audits accounting for the remainder of the difference. As a result of the better mix of foreign earnings, we have lowered our expected fourth quarter tax rate from 27% to about 26.5%.
Turning to cash. Our cash plus short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $45.8 billion at the end of the June quarter compared to $41.7 billion at the end of the March quarter, an increase of $4.1 billion. Cash flow from operations was $4.8 billion. Our investment priority for cash continues to be preservation of capital, and we are continuing to focus on relatively short-dated, high-quality investments and remain comfortable with our investment portfolio. Looking ahead to the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.
As we announced on Friday, we will be offering free cases to all customers who have purchased an iPhone 4 through September 30. As a result, we will be deferring revenue corresponding to the value of the cases that has yet to be ordered by or delivered to eligible customers under this offer as of the end of the September quarter. We estimate this deferral to be about $175 million, and we expect the September quarter deferral to be recognized as revenue in the December quarter. We will recognize the cost of the cases upon delivery to our customers.
We expect revenue to be about $18 billion compared to $12.2 billion in the September quarter last year. We expect gross margins to be about 35%, reflecting approximately $40 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect most of the sequential decline to be due to a higher mix of iPhone 4 and iPad sales, which have higher cost structures and provide great value to customers, as well as the revenue deferral impact of the iPhone 4 case offer.
To a lesser extent, we expect the sequential decline to be driven by back-to-school promotion and the absence of the favorable adjustments that benefited gross margin in the June quarter. We expect OpEx to be about $2 billion, including about $195 million related stock-based compensation expense. We expect OI&E to be about $50 million, reflective of the short-term interest rate environment, and we expected tax rate to be about 26.5%. We are targeting EPS of about $3.44. 
In closing, we're thrilled with our record June quarter revenue and strong financial performance. We're very pleased with sales of iPad and iPhone 4. We're working hard on catching up with customer demand for these great products, and we look forward to rolling them out to even more customers and more countries this quarter. We are very pleased with the market share gains for our iPhones, Macs and iPods, and remain very confident in our new product pipeline. 
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.",1752

If you look at the iPhone, we are now up to more than 80% of the Fortune 100 that are deploying or piloting the iPhone, and we also see very good momentum in the Fortune 500. In fact, over 60% of the Fortune 500 are deploying or piloting iPhone. This is also transcending into education institution, and we see around 400 higher education institutions, which have approved the iPhone for faculty, staff and students. And so iPhone is really taking off, and iOS 4 was another help in doing that. In terms of the Macintosh, you can see the Mac had an incredible quarter. We're still selling principally to consumer and education, but we are seeing businesses with increasing interest in the Mac. It's more difficult to measure because many of those sales are filled through the channel. We're obviously thrilled with growing 33% year-on-year.",148

On the iPod, it's the same, none significant last quarter, and none currently. The iPad and the iPhone are significantly different. Both of these products, the iPad and specifically the iPhone 4, we had backlog at the end of last quarter that we were not able to fill. And currently, we are still selling both of those products as fast as we can make them. So we still are quoting longer lead times than we liked, and we're working around the clock to try to get supply and demand in balance. In the scheme of things, it's a good problem to have.",122

On the iPad, as I'd mentioned last quarter, we went into the iPad thinking that planning a 1 million per month capacity was a very bold move. And in fact, if you look at the -- a lot of the industry analysts were predicting that we only sell somewhere around that number for the whole calendar year. And as you know, we did 1 million the first month and then the second million the second month and the third million the third month. And so basically what we're doing is we're increasing capacity as quickly as we can, and there's a number of things that we have to increase in order to do that. But I'm fairly confident that we will be able to increase the capacity. It's not a situation where there's something put down that we can't eventually increase. The iPhone, we just started ramping it in June with very limited days last quarter. As you know, we launched on the 24th and the quarter ended on the 26th, and we're still ramping and increasing volume. But again, there's not a specific thing that is overwhelming. It's just a matter of getting up the ramp.",207

Let me start with your second question. I don't want to go into a lot of specificity there, but we did have some adjustments that occurred in our supply chain and some other product costs that benefited us in June. They were the larger contributor of the second set of factors that I outlined for you. As regards our gross margin for the September quarter, we've just introduced the iPad and the iPhone 4. We are delivering great value to customers, and these products have higher cost structures. In the case of the iPhone 4, it has a higher cost structure than the predecessor product that we were shipping. But while the margin there is attractive on a sequential basis, we have been pretty aggressive here with pricing, and it's going to play through a bit on the margin line.",141

Eugene Munster,,Analysts,18,The iPhone number was strong despite a lot of moving parts in the channel in terms of inventory this quarter versus a year ago when you launched the 3GS. Can you talk a little bit about what those dynamics were and how they impacted the 8.4 million unit number you printed?,51
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-20-2010",2010-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,120.0,68102.0,5016153.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,19,"Gene, it's Tim. We greatly reduced shipments of the previous generation iPhone beginning around June 7, which was our Worldwide Developers Conference and coincided with the announcement of the iPhone 4. But as you probably know, we did not launch the iPhone 4 and the new 8GB 3GS until June 24, which was only three days before the end of the quarter. The result of that was that we had significantly lower sales after June 7 for that period of time, as we waited on the official launch. In fact, if you looked at our year-over-year growth rate prior to June 7, it was around 90%. And as you know, we exited the quarter, you can see this from the datasheets, we exited the quarter with total iPhone sales of 61%. And so basically, we did a channel adjustment. We pulled the previous generation of iPhones down significantly in channel inventory. We increased from zero the iPhone 4 inventory and the inventory of the 8GB 3GS. And the net reduction in the channel was about 250,000 units from the beginning of the quarter. And I would remind you that as you probably guessed, the run rate associated with the sales of the new product are larger than the run rate associated with the sales of the old product. And so in terms of any kind of weeks of inventory, it would be much less than where we were running before.",240

And so we ended with about 2.45 million, if you look at the ins and outs in that just to give you the numbers, the previous generation draw down by the end of the quarter was slightly less than 1.3 million, and the combination of iPhone 4 and iPhone 3GS was up about 1 million, and the vast, vast majority of that 1 million was in transit at the end of the quarter, not available for sale.",80

However, what we would really wanted to do is, if we have the opportunity to do it, quite frankly, is to take inventory up quarter-over-quarter or at the beginning of the quarter, the end of the quarter because the sales run rate was larger at the end of the quarter with the new product.",78

Eugene Munster,,Analysts,24,"And then just quickly, I have a philosophical question that I can understand why you guys run out of products and the iPad comes out and it's the first time you're doing it, but these shortages that we have right out of the gates, can you just give us any insight? There's obviously a lot of talk, do you guys purposely do this just to create buzz? I suspected that that's not the case, but can you give us any insight into a company that understands how to build products as well as you do, that we still have these problems going into these product launches?",106

If you look at the previous generation product, we called the number of units that we're going to sell many weeks beforehand, and when we've run out, we've run out. And quite frankly, we tend to manage that aggressively on purpose because we would rather the market move very quickly to the new product. And that's what happened here, and I'm frankly speaking, I'm glad that it happened and it's exactly the way that we want to manage it. In terms of the new product, we do not purposely create a shortage for buzz. I'm not sure where that comes from, but that's certainly not our objective. We would like to fill every customers' order as quickly as we can. The demand for iPhone 4 is absolutely stunning, and we're working very hard to catch up with demand and I can't predict when that will occur, but I can tell you that everyone's working very hard to do it.",168

We have been pleasantly surprised at how fast this product has gotten out of the chute. If you look at how long it took us to sell the first million iPods, the 20-plus months versus the one month of iPad, it's just phenomenal difference. It is not following a typical early adopter curve, and then taking a long time to cross into the mainstream. And so I don't know how high is high.

Peter, on your guidance last quarter, you basically said about a quarter of the expected sequential decline in gross margins was expected to come from the iPad, so about 150 basis points.

And we did about 310 basis points better than we had guided, so then a little more than half of that was those five factors not being quite as deep as we thought. And the biggest piece of that difference really came from selling more iPhones and selling accessories. So the other factors were generally about what we thought they would be.",79

You were down about 260 basis points, but you had mentioned you had a favorable benefit, as well as some operating leverage. What was the collective impact of those two positive forces of operating leverage and favorable -- so you thought you'd be down 570 from those factors, and you were down 400 to 450, and then you had favorable impact of 150 from the other two factors, or how do we think about that in basis points?",94

So we were ahead of what we thought by about 310 basis points. A little more than half of that came from the five factors not being quite as deep as we thought, and it was mostly selling more iPhones and more accessories that drove that.

The first is we will need to defer revenue for the iPhone 4s that we sell or we've not delivered the Bumpers and where we have not heard from the customers wanting to place an order. And I expect the accrual that we'll need to make, which is a revenue accrual with no cost to be about $175 million in the September quarter, and I would expect to have that be recorded as revenue in the December quarter.

And it looks good in every country that we have launched in so far, and we're excited about launching it in additional countries this coming weekend. Anecdotally, it does seem to me that it is beyond an early adopter stage already, as I indicated earlier, just based on watching the people that are using it. And it's the fastest that, that has happened in any product I know of or have ever been involved with. So I think it's extremely unique and extremely special. In terms of what the competition does, I don't know what they will do and what they will try, no secret that everybody's trying to work on something to come out with it, but we're extremely happy with our competitive position. And the business model that we have, if you look at the U.S. as an example, since everybody can look at that model where you have a very affordable rate structure that starts at $15 with no commitment at all, and a very aggressive device price that seems to be what the end user really desires. And so, yes, somebody could come in and jack the rate plans way up and subsidize, but I'm not so sure that people are really going to want another contract. But we'll see if somebody tries that, maybe we'll both learn. Right now, we're thrilled with our position.",252

I think that the phone market will increasingly become a smartphone market. And Steve said that long ago, and we've seen that, that forecast has come true as the smartphone market continues to grow at multiples of the basic handset market that is shrinking. I think we have a lot of opportunity domestically and in the other parts of the Americas. And I think Peter's comment was more that our growth as a company, whether you look at Mac, iPhone or iPod, is we're growing faster internationally than we are domestically. And you can see that in the revenues as well. However, i think you have to put that in perspective. The company's revenues in Americas are growing over 40%. And so this is a huge number. We're not talking about a low number. It's just that the international numbers are absolutely killer.",153

I mean, if you look at the Mac as an example, in Asia-Pacific, the Macs grew 73% year-over-year. This is phenomenal that we could grow by this much. And in China, we grew 144%. In Korea, we grew 184%. In Hong Kong, we almost doubled. And even in a country like Spain where the economy has clearly been very difficult, the Mac grew 59%. And so there's some very, very extraordinary numbers in that. In the iPhone space, we are doing well in basically all of the key markets. And so in terms of expanding that, learning what we've learned with the exclusive deals and continuing to look market by market, as I've indicated in the past, we've elected to open Spain up. And at the end of this month, we will go from an exclusive carrier market to having three carriers. And so that's one example. There are also more countries remaining. And frankly, there's still increased distribution and increased market penetration like enterprise and consumer, and a general move in the marketplace from the basic voice and text phone to the smartphone, all of which are in the iPhone saver. And so, honestly, I just see an enormous amount of opportunity out there. And our biggest challenge is to decide which of these to deploy resources against, not to have good ideas about which ones are about making the list of ideas.",264

It's the synergy between, both technically and from a demand point of view. If you look at the iPod historically, all of the people here felt that the iPod created a halo for the Mac. And in fact, as the iPod volumes took off, you will see a dramatic change in the Mac sales back in time that we experienced. And so could that happen on iPhone and iPad? We'll see. I don't want to predict it. But I do think that with our Mac share -- the Mac has outgrown the market 17 straight quarters. However, the Mac share is still low. And so there's still an enormous opportunity for the Mac to grow. And certainly, the more customers we can introduce to Apple through iPad, and through iPhones and through iPods, you would think that there might be some synergy with the Mac there, and there may be synergy between the iPad and the iPhone as well, and so on and so forth. And so that's the way that we look at it internally, instead of the negative. Although I know everybody is more focused on the negative piece of it. This is where it's great to have a lower share, because if it turns out that the iPad cannibalizes PCs, then I think it's fantastic for us, because there's a lot of PCs to cannibalize. It's still a big market.",258

And as, I think, answered in Toni's questions, look, with the iPhone 4, we have been very aggressive here. This is the best iPhone that we have ever shipped. We're delivering great value to customers. And it has a higher cost structure than its predecessor product. And I don't want to comment on its specific gross margin.",101

Just trying to ballpark the size of the supply-demand gap for the iPhone and the iPad.

That question is very difficult to answer, because the way that you will truly find out what it is, at least from my own experience and perspective is you have enough supply to serve the demand and then you know what the demand is. And today, we don't have enough on either iPhone 4 or iPad. And so I truly don't know. Obviously, we have taken bets internally, in terms of the capacities that we're going for, and we've rolled those into the guidance.

Thank you for joining us. We're extremely pleased to report the conclusion of a great fiscal year for Apple with outstanding results for the September quarter. Our innovative product lineup is the best ever and customer response have been tremendous. As a result, we set new all-time records for Mac, iPhone and iPad sales in the September quarter, and we are thrilled to report the highest quarterly revenue and earnings in Apple's history.
Revenue for the quarter was $20.34 billion, an increase of more than $8.1 billion over the prior September quarter's result, representing growth of 67%. The very strong growth was fueled primarily by record iPhone sales, the tremendous popularity of iPad and our best Mac quarter ever. Operating margin was $5.45 billion, representing 26.8% of revenue. Net income was $4.31 billion, which exceeded our previous quarterly earnings record by $930 million and represented 70% growth over the year ago quarter's earnings. These results translated to earnings per share of $4.64.
Turning to the details of the quarter. I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We set a new quarterly record with sales of almost 3.9 million Macs, exceeding the previous record established in the June quarter by over 400,000. This represents 27% year-over-year growth, more than double IDC's latest published estimate of 11% growth for the market overall in the September quarter. We experienced strong double-digit growth in both Mac desktop and portable categories, led by very strong sales of iMac, which was updated in July, and the continued popularity of the MacBook Pro and MacBook. Mac growth was strong in each of our geographic segments, led by Asia Pacific at 56% year-over-year and Japan at 49%. We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory.
Moving to our music products. We sold nearly 9.1 million iPods compared to 10.2 million in the year ago quarter. In September, we announced a great new lineup of iPods for the holiday season, including our redesigned iPod shuffle featuring clickable buttons, the reinvented iPod nano with Multi-Touch and the new iPod touch with Retina display and FaceTime video calling. iPod's share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70%, based on the latest monthly data published by NPD. iPod also continues to be the top-selling MP3 player and to gain share internationally year-over-year in most of the countries we track, based on the latest data published by GfK. We remain within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory on a look-back basis.
The iTunes Store also had another strong quarter with revenue over $1 billion. In September, we launched iTunes 10, including a number of new features, such as $0.99 TV rentals, AirPlay wireless music playback and Ping, which offers social music discovery to millions of iTunes users in 23 countries. We also introduced the new Apple TV, which provides a simple way to watch movies and TV shows on your HDTV for the breakthrough price of just $99.
I'd now like to turn to iPhone. We were extremely pleased to have sold 14.1 million iPhones compared to just under 7.4 million in the previous September quarter. This represents 91% year-over-year growth and is well ahead of IDC's latest published estimate of 64% growth for the global smartphone market overall in the September quarter. Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessories sales was $8.82 billion during the quarter compared with $4.61 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 92%. The sales value of iPhones alone was about $8.6 billion, which yields an ASP [average selling price] of about $610.
At the end of the September quarter, we had iPhone distributions through 166 carriers in 89 countries. We continue to experience very strong year-over-year growth, particularly in Asia, Europe and Japan where iPhone sales more than doubled year-over-year. We were very happy to be shipping iPhone 4 in China as of the last day of the September quarter, and we've been very pleased with customer response to date. Last month, J.D. Power and Associates announced that for a fourth consecutive time, Apple ranked highest in its survey of customer satisfaction among manufacturers of smartphone, citing particularly strong performance in ease of operation, operating system, features and physical design.
Adoption of iPhone within the enterprise continues to accelerate. In fact, since we've shipped iPhone 4, we've seen extraordinary growth from 60% to more than 80% of Fortune 500 companies deploying or piloting iPhone. Enterprise CIOs continue to add iPhone to their approved device list worldwide. Most recently, Fortune 500 companies like Procter & Gamble, General Electric, Pfizer, Allstate and Cardinal Health, and Global 500 accounts such as Aviva Group, Total, Novartis, Roche and sanofi-aventis, have made iPhone available to their employees. We ended the quarter with about 3.3 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 825,000, to support the launch of iPhone 4. We continue to have a sizable backlog and believe we could have sold even more iPhones if we had been able to supply them.
Turning to iPad. We're thrilled with this momentum. In just the second quarter of availability, we sold almost 4.2 million iPads with distribution in 26 countries by the end of the September quarter. We're seeing great enthusiasm for iPad from consumers, educators and businesses. Enterprise CIOs are adding iPad to their approved device list at an impressive rate. Since the launch of iPad, over 65% of the Fortune 100 are already deploying or piloting iPad. Some recent examples of companies approving iPad include Procter & Gamble, Lowe's, Hyatt, NBC Universal and Novartis. Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter was $2.8 billion. The sales value of iPads alone was about $2.7 billion, which yields an ASP of about $645.
We were able to increase the supply of iPads over the course of the quarter, building channel inventory by about 500,000 units to end the quarter with between three and four weeks of channel inventory, below our target range of four to six weeks. We're expanding U.S. iPad distribution to include Walmart, Target, Verizon and AT&T stores. We are also expanding distribution internationally. 
Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we surpassed cumulative iOS device sales of 125 million last month. During the September quarter, we released iOS 4.1, which builds on the innovations of iOS 4, bringing FaceTime video calling, multitasking, folders and Game Center to iPod touch in addition to iPhone customers. And in November, we plan to release iOS 4.2, which will bring many of the great new features of iOS 4 to iPad. iOS 4.2 will also include AirPrint, Apple's new printing architecture, that automatically finds printers on local networks and enables printing from iOS devices over Wi-Fi without the need to install drivers or download software. 
The App Store continues to be an unparalleled success. There are now over 200,000 registered iOS developers that continue to bring outstanding and creative new apps [applications] to the iOS platform, including over 65,000 game and entertainment titles and over 30,000 apps designed specifically for iPad. And we launched iAd in July, which provides marketers with the ability to place interactive ads in popular apps for iPhone, iPod touch and iPad. We were very happy with the results so far. Customers are loving the media rich ad and marketers are very pleased with viewer engagement. 
I'd now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores, which had a record-breaking quarter. Retail revenue was $3.57 billion compared to $2.04 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 75%. Our stores sold a record 874,000 Macs compared to 670,000 Macs in the year ago quarter, an increase of 30%. About half the Macs sold in our stores during the September quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before. 
We opened 24 stores during the September quarter, 16 of which were outside the United States, including spectacular stores in Beijing, Shanghai, London and Paris. Our new Beijing and Shanghai stores opened on the last day of the quarter, and first day sales from both stores exceeded all previous store openings. Our four China stores are our highest traffic stores in the world and are among our highest performing. We also entered our 11th country, with the opening of stores in Barcelona and Madrid. That brings us to a total of 317 stores worldwide as of the end of the quarter, with 84 of them outside the United States. With an average of 301 stores open during the September quarter, average revenue per store was $11.8 million compared to $7.8 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 52%. 
Retail segment margin was $917 million compared to $564 million in the year ago quarter. We hosted a record 74.5 million visitors in our stores during the quarter compared to 45.9 million visitors in the year ago quarter, an increase of 62%. As we look ahead to fiscal 2011, we see great opportunity to continue our retail growth with our focus on international expansion. In total, we expect to open 40 to 50 stores in our fiscal 2011, with over 50% of them outside the United States. We will also begin replacing several stores in the United States to get them rightsize for Apple's current product line and to meet our service goals.
Total company gross margin was 36.9%, which was 190 basis points above our guidance. About 2/3 of this favorability was driven by lower commodity and other costs and the remainder was mostly attributable to a better-than-planned mix of iPhone sales. Operating expenses were $2.07 billion and included $185 million of stock-based compensation expense. OI&E [other income & expenses] was $14 million, and the tax rate for the quarter was 21%, about five points below our guidance, largely a result of two factors. First, we had a higher mix of foreign earnings than we planned. Second, we had some discrete onetime tax benefits in the quarter as well. Our tax rate for fiscal 2010 was about 24.5%.
Turning to cash. Our cash plus short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $51 billion at the end of the September quarter compared to $45.8 billion at the end of the June quarter, an increase of $5.2 billion. Cash flow from operations was $5.7 billion. 
The September quarter was the culmination of a monumental year for Apple. In fiscal 2010, we launched several new Macs, establishing record sales of over 13.6 million and achieving 31% year-over-year sales growth, significantly outpacing the growth of the overall PC market. We introduced the tremendously popular iPhone 4 with breakthrough features, including FaceTime and Retina display, fueling full year sales of 40 million iPhones, an increase of 93% over fiscal 2009. We launched the groundbreaking iPad, selling nearly 7.5 million to delighted customers in two quarters alone. We also brought great new features to iOS and iTunes and continue to innovate with completely new designs for iPod. And as a result, we generated record revenue of over $65 billion, an increase of over $22 billion year-over-year or 52%. Earnings of $14 billion grew even faster at 70% year-over-year. To put this growth into perspective, in fiscal 2010, Apple generated almost 5x the revenue and more than 10x the earnings it did just five years earlier in fiscal 2005.
As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be about $23 billion compared to $15.7 billion in the December quarter last year. We expect gross margins to be about 36%, reflecting approximately $52 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $2.325 billion, including about $250 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $65 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. We are targeting EPS of about $4.80.
In closing, we're thrilled with our record September quarter and fiscal year 2010 results. We're very enthusiastic about our innovative product lineup and our significant opportunities for growth as we head into fiscal 2011, and we are extremely confident in our new product pipeline. 
Before taking your questions, I would like to turn the call over to our CEO, Steve Jobs.",2064
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2010",2010-10-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,7260.0,80046.0,5746386.0,Presenter Speech,Steven Jobs,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Peter. Hi, everybody. As most of you know, I don't usually participate in Apple's earnings calls since you are all in such capable hands with Peter and Tim, but I just couldn't help dropping by for our first $20 billion quarter. I'd like to chat about a few things, and then stay for the rest of the Q&A, if that's all right.
First, let me discuss iPhone. We sold 14.1 million iPhones in the quarter, which represents a 91% unit growth over the year ago quarter and was well ahead of IDC's latest published estimate of 64% growth for the global smartphone market in the September quarter. And it handily beat RIM's 12.1 million BlackBerrys sold in their most recent quarter ending in August. We've now passed RIM, and I don't see them catching up with us in the foreseeable future. They must move beyond their area of strength and comfort into the unfamiliar territory of trying to become a software platform company. I think it's going to be a challenge for them to create a competitive platform and to convince developers to create apps for yet a third software platform after iOS and Android. With 300,000 apps on Apple's App Store, RIM has a high mountain ahead of them to climb. 
But what about Google? Last week, Eric Schmidt reiterated that they are activating 200,000 Android devices per day and have around 90,000 apps in their app store. For comparison, Apple has activated around 275,000 iOS devices per day on average for the past 30 days, with a peak of almost 300,000 iOS devices per day on a few of those days, and Apple has 300,000 apps on its App Store. Unfortunately, there is no solid data on how many Android phones are shipped each quarter. We hope that manufacturers will soon start reporting the number of Android handsets they ship each quarter. But today, that just isn't the case. Gartner reported that around 10 million Android phones were shipped in the June quarter, and we await to see if iPhone or Android was the winner in this most recent quarter. 
Google loves to characterize Android as open, and iOS and iPhone as closed. We find this a bit disingenuous and clouding the real difference between our two approaches. The first thing most of us think about when we hear the word open is Windows, which is available on a variety of devices. Unlike Windows, however, where most PCs have the same user interface and run the same apps, Android is very fragmented. Many Android OEMs, including the two largest, HTC and Motorola, install proprietary user interfaces to differentiate themselves from the commodity Android experience. The user is left to figure it all out. Compare this with iPhone, where every handset works the same. 
Twitter client, TwitterDeck (sic) [TweetDeck], recently launched their app for Android. They reported that they had to contend with more than a hundred different versions of Android software on 244 different handsets. The multiple hardware and software iterations present developers with a daunting challenge. Many Android apps work only on selected Android handsets running selected Android versions, and this is for handsets that have been shipped less than 12 months ago. Compare this with iPhone, where there are two versions of the software, the current and the most recent predecessor to test against. 
In addition to Google's own App Marketplace (sic) [Apps Marketplace], Amazon, Verizon and Vodafone have all announced that they are creating their own app stores for Android. So there will be at least 4 app stores on Android, which customers must search among to find the app they want and developers will need to work with to distribute their apps and get paid. This is going to be a mess for both users and developers. Contrast this with Apple's integrated App Store, which offers users the easiest to use largest App Store in the world, preloaded on every iPhone. Apple's App Store has over 3x as many apps as Google's Marketplace and offers developers one-stop shopping to get their apps to market easily and to get paid swiftly.
You know, even if Google were right and the real issue is closed versus open, it is worthwhile to remember that open systems don't always win. Take Microsoft PlaysForSure music strategy, which used the PC model, which Android uses as well, of separating the software components from the hardware components. Even Microsoft finally abandoned this open strategy in favor of copying Apple's integrated approach with their Zune player, unfortunately, leaving their OEMs empty-handed in the process. 
Google flirted with this integrated approach with their Nexus One phone. In reality, we think the open versus closed argument is just a smokescreen to try and hide the real issue, which is, what's best for the customer, fragmented versus integrated. We think Android is very, very fragmented and becoming more fragmented by the day. And as you know, Apple strives for the integrated models so the user isn't forced to be the systems integrator. We see tremendous value in having Apple rather than our users be the systems integrator. We think this is a huge strength of our approach compared to Google. When selling to users who want their devices to just work, we believe integrated will trump fragmented every time, and we also think our developers can be more innovative if they can target a singular platform rather than 100 variants. They can put their time into innovative new features rather than testing on hundreds of different handsets. So we are very committed to the integrated approach, no matter how many times Google tries to characterize it as closed. And we are confident that it will triumph over Google's fragmented approach, no matter how many times Google try to characterize it as open.
Second, I'd like to comment on the avalanche of tablets poised to enter the market in the coming months. First, it appears to be just a handful of credible entrants, not exactly an avalanche. Second, almost all of them use 7-inch screens as compared to iPad's near-10-inch screen. Let's start there. One naturally thinks that a 7-inch screen would offer 70% of the benefit of a 10-inch screen. Unfortunately, this is far from the truth. The screen measurements are diagonal so that a 7-inch screen is only 45% as large as iPad's 10-inch screen. You heard me right. Just 45% as large. If you take an iPad and hold it upright in portrait view and draw an imaginary horizontal line halfway down the screen, the screens on the 7-inch tablets are a bit smaller than the bottom half of the iPad display. This size isn't sufficient to create great tablet apps in our opinion.  
While one could increase the resolution of the display to make up for some of the difference, it is meaningless unless your tablet also includes sandpaper, so that the user can sand down their fingers to around 1/4 of their present size. Apple has done extensive user testing on touch interfaces over many years, and we really understand this stuff. There are clear limits of how close you can physically place elements on a touchscreen before users cannot reliably tap, flick or pinch them. This is one of the key reasons we think the 10-inch screen size is the minimum size required to create great tablet apps.
Third, every tablet user is also a smartphone user. No tablet can compete with the mobility of a smartphone, its ease of fitting into your pocket or purse, its unobtrusiveness when used in a crowd. Given that all tablet users will already have a smartphone in their pockets, giving up precious display area to fit a tablet in our pocket is clearly the wrong trade off. The 7-inch tablet are tweeners, too big to compete with a smartphone and too small to compete with an iPad. 
Fourth, almost all of these new tablets use Android software. But even Google is telling the tablet manufacturers not to use their current release, Froyo, for tablets and to wait for a special tablet release next year. What does it mean when your software supplier does not to use their software in your tablet? And what does it mean when you ignore them and use it anyway?
Fifth, iPad now has over 35,000 apps on the App Store. This new crop of tablets will have near zero.  And sixth and last, our potential competitors are having a tough time coming close to iPad's pricing even with their far smaller, far less expensive screen. The iPad incorporates everything we've learned about building high-value products from iPhones, iPods and Macs. We create our own A4 chip, our own software, our own battery chemistry, our own enclosure, our own everything, and this results in an incredible product at a great price. The proof of this will be in the pricing of our competitors' products, which will likely offer less for more. 
These are among the reasons we think the current crop of 7-inch tablets are going to be DOA, dead on arrival. Their manufacturers will learn the painful lesson that their tablets are too small and increase the size next year, thereby abandoning both customers and developers who jumped on the 7-inch bandwagon with an orphan product. Sounds like lots of fun ahead.

And there's a lot of -- I think, a lot of development and progress that will occur over the next few years, but we're already seeing tremendous interest in iPad from education and, much to my surprise, from business. We haven't pushed it real hard in business, and its being grabbed out of our hands. And I talk to people every day in business, in all kinds of businesses, that are using iPads, all the way from Boards of Directors that are shipping iPads around instead of BoardBooks, down to nurses and doctors in hospitals and other large and small businesses. So the more time that passes, the more I am convinced that we've got a tiger by the tail here. And this is a new model of computing, which we've already got tens of millions of people trained on with the iPhone, and that lends itself to lots of different aspects of life, both personal, educational and business. So I see it as very general purpose and I see it as really big. And the timing, one could argue about the timing endlessly, but I don't think one could argue that it's going to happen anymore.",224

And we think we have a very good product here that's going to be hard to match, and we're not done.

So over the next several years, those non-smartphones, many of those non-smartphones are going to convert to smartphones, and the pie is going to continue to grow and I think there'll be room for some number of companies to be successful.

Well, Ben, in providing our guidance, we thought about each of those factors that you cited and we do see a small sequential decline. This is being primarily driven by a higher-than-expected mix of new iPods that we have just recently announced and more iPad sales, and which as Steve said, we've been very aggressive with that with our pricing and are delivering great value to customers. So it's the higher mix of those on a sequential basis that I see impacting the gross margin slightly.",87

We have gone through a streaming model on Apple TV. It's complete streaming. So all the content is rented from the iTunes Store or is streamed from your computer or soon to be streamed from your iPhone or iPad with AirPlay. So how is our new model of Apple TV doing? Well, I can report that in just a very short amount of time, we've already sold a $0.25 million of them, over 250,000. And we're thrilled with that. I think that it's a great product and I think its $99 price point is very enticing and I think when we get the AirPlay stuff in place before the end of this year, it's going to give another big reason for people to buy it.

And we, on our last conference call, highlighted that we would have a higher mix of iPhone 4 sales and we were very aggressive with feature function there. So it had a different gross margin than its predecessor product. We also sold more iPads. Again, we were very aggressive there with our pricing, and we had the bumper program and some onetime items that occurred in June that we said wouldn't occur in September. So these were sort of the factors we saw bringing down gross margin. To some extent, each of them did occur in the September quarter, but we ended up doing about 50% better than we thought, as a result of the commodity market and selling more iPhones.",130

As you know, Nokia is the biggest, and we admire them for being able to ship the number of handsets that they do, but we don't aspire to be like them. They're good at being like them. We want to be like us and we want to make the best ones. So in our part of the market, Android is our biggest competitor. They outshipped us in the June quarter as we were transitioning to iPhone 4. They outshipped us for the first time according to Gartner's number, which we think are pretty accurate. And so we're waiting to find out what happened in this quarter. And if they -- we'll find out -- I don't know how we'll find out, but Gartner will put out some new numbers and maybe others will. And so one of these days, we'll eventually learn. And I imagine we'll be competing with them for quite some time, but we have very different approaches. And we believe in our approach very strongly. It's providing users a products that just work, and we think there's lots of users that want that in the world. And their approaches is very different from that. And there may be lots of users that want their approach as well, but we're going to pursue ours and we think that's the winning approach in the end.",243

I wanted to just better understand your aspirations for iPhone and iPod. Tim, I think I've heard you say, look, we think about the Mac business as being one where we make the best products, but we're competing against kind of a strong incumbent power in Microsoft and we don't aspire to have high market share. In your iPod business, that was kind of the opposite. You had very high volume. You drove price points down to entry points in the marketplace and you have more than 50% market share globally. I think when we've talked about it in the past, you've actually said that you view the iPhone business as being more akin to the iPod business in terms to your aspiration. Steve, it sounded like that wasn't really consistent with what you said. You said very clearly, we don't want to be Nokia, we just want to make a good phone. So perhaps you can help me better understand how we should think about your aspiration for both the iPhone and the iPod? Steve, you also made a comment about 7-inch screens aren't going to cut it and implying that you're not going to go down to those lower price points. Is your aspiration for iPhone and iPod to be volume players and market leaders, or is it simply to make good products and if you have smaller share like you do in Mac, that's fine? Can you help me with that, please?",254

And I'll let Tim say what he's going to say too. First of all, Nokia makes $50 handsets and we don't know how to make a great smartphone for $50. We are not smart enough to figure that one out yet, but believe me, I'll let you know when we do. And so our goal is to make a really breakthrough, great products, make the best products in every industry that we compete in, and to drive the cost down while constantly making the products better at the same time. That's what we did with iPod. We updated our products many times every year with better functionality, oftentimes at the same price and sometimes at a lower price. And it was the relentless improvement, in some cases a lower price, that was able to beat our competition and yield the market share that it did. And as you know, we have a very low market share in the phone market, in the single digits, in terms of all the handsets, and we have a very high market share now on tablets because we're the first mover. But we don't think about it that way. The reason we wouldn't make a 7-inch tablet isn't because we don't want to hit a price point. It's because we don't think you can make a great tablet with a 7-inch screen. We think it's too small to express the software that people want to put on these things, and we think as a software-driven company, we think about the software strategies first. And we know that software developers aren't going to have -- they're not going to deal real well, with all these different-sized products, where they have to redo their software every time a screen size changes. And they're not going to deal well with products where they can't put enough elements on the screen to build the kind of apps they want to build. So when we make decisions on 7-inch tablets, it's not about cost, it's about the value of the product when you factor in the software. You see what I'm getting at? So we're all about making the best products at aggressive prices. And that's what we will do and that's what we've done with the iPod and that's what we will do with the iPad as well.",390

If I could push you on that, Steve, so if the market starts to move towards somewhat lower functionality smartphones, in that migration of non-smartphones to smartphones that you talked about, if the market starts to move to dramatically lower price points, and you feel you can't make an appropriate product that is good at those price points, you will see tier under those circumstances, do I hear you correctly?",76

You're looking at it as a hardware person in a fragmented world. You're looking at it as a hardware manufacturer that doesn't really know much about software, who doesn't think about an integrated product but assumes the software will somehow take care of itself, and you're sitting around saying, ""well, how can we make this cheaper?"" Well, we can put a smaller screen on it and a slower processor and less memory. And you assume that the software will somehow just come alive on this product that you're dreaming of. But it won't. Because these app developers have taken advantage of the products that came before with faster processors with larger screens, with more capabilities that they can take advantage of to make better apps for customers. And they're not -- it's a hard one because it throws you right back into the beginning of that chicken and egg problem again, to change all the assumptions on those developers. Most of them will not follow you. Most of them will say, ""I'm sorry, but I'm not going to go back and write a watered-down version of my app just because you've got this phone that you can sell for $50 less and you're begging me to write software for it.""",217

You now have more than $50 billion in cash. You're generating more than $20 billion a year in cash, it rests very comfortably on your balance sheet earning less than 1% interest. What is your aspiration for that cash? And why are you not more open to returning some of that cash to shareholders in the form of buybacks or dividend?",68

We strongly believe that one or more very strategic opportunities may come along, that we're in unique position to take advantage of because our strong cash position. And I think we've demonstrated a really strong track record of being very disciplined with the use of our cash. We don't let it burn a hole in our pocket and we don't allow it to motivate us to do stupid acquisitions. And so I think that we'd like to continue to keep our powder dry because we do feel that there are one or more strategic opportunities in the future. That's the biggest reason. And there's other reasons as well we could go into, but that's the biggest one.",124

And what I'm looking for is sort of how you're thinking about Apple as it's been positioned over the last several years, sort of more of a consumer-focused, SMB-focused company, but clearly there is a huge opportunity here with the iPod and the iPhone and probably at some point the Macs into the corporate world. So how do you think about your positioning from a marketing standpoint, a sales standpoint? Any changes you need to make or how are you sort of addressing that?",97

On the iPad, there have been some comments on this earlier, but just to give you some stats here. About 2/3 of the Fortune 100 are deploying or piloting iPad and I don't know about you, but I've never seen an adoption rate like this in my life at enterprise. Enterprise is historically much slower moving on adoption. We're also seeing the iPad begin to pick up interest in K-12, which is another market that historically adopts very, very slowly. And so the early data points look great and as a matter of fact, we are -- or have built and are building additional capacity internally in the sales organizations to call on businesses. And obviously, we have a huge amount of sales people already there calling on education institutions. We're also enabling and training our carrier partners to do the same and you probably saw an announcement last week with AT&T, and that's a direct result of customers wanting to buy the iPad on a postpaid-type plan. And so we're putting a lot of energy on those. iPhone has followed a trajectory that gets in the same kinds of numbers as I pointed on iPad. We're a little bit higher by now. It's 85% of the Fortune 100 are deploying or piloting iPhone. And so this isn't a hobby or something we're doing lightly. We put enormous energy in the company, in engineering, in software that built a number of enterprise features in the OS. You've seen that, it get better and better as we have stepped through the different OS releases and we're building the sales capability for those groups as well. It's clear that both the phone and the iPad have an enormous opportunity. The Mac is also increasingly getting pulled into an enterprise where the employees are able to select. And of course, this is a trend that we like to see and that we think will continue in larger ways. But when people are given the choice, they would prefer a Mac, and so Macs are being pulled in as well. We don't have as much distribution effort on that. But as we see and if it gets larger, we will move accordingly. The great thing is that we're maintaining our focus on the consumer and the consumer is the forefront on the thinking of all of our products, and it's these consumers in the enterprise, so to speak, that are pulling these products in. And so we're not developing two different lines like many companies do and have enterprise versions and consumer versions. This is another part of our simplistic approach to things that I think will pay us great dividend and is already starting to do so.",457

I'm getting substantial questions, as I'm sure everybody on this call is, just about gross margins.  So I guess one of the questions I have is, as you're seeing the increase in volume, is there any kind of a change in terms of sort of the scale leverage you have from a manufacturing standpoint or -- I know you guided to lower gross margins but the Street of course was higher. So just anything you can give us in terms of color on the gross margins with the iPhones and iPhone 4, in terms of how that's panning out, how we should think about start-up costs that were associated with both that as well as the iPad? Just any color would be great.",131

Well, Shannon, we don't provide product-specific gross margins, but we are always working aggressively to lower our cost whether it's the iPhone or any of our other products. And I think we had a very good track record in this regard. And we were happy with our gross margins in the September quarter. They were ahead of what we thought. And we see them being just down slightly in the December quarter as we ship more iPads, where we've been quite aggressive and continue to ship more iPads as well.",91

If you count at the country level, we have about 166 relationships that we ended the quarter with in about 89 countries. And so that's a significant expansion across the last year, as we in many countries went from a single carrier relationship to more than one carrier.

The A4 chip inside it is an Apple creation, everything again as I mentioned, from the battery chemistry to the enclosures, and we've learned a lot. We've learned a lot from the miniaturization we've done on iPods and iPhones, and we're a very high-volume consumer electronics manufacturer. So I think we've learned a lot, we've developed a lot of our own components where others have to buy them on the market with middlemen getting their cut of things. And I think we're systems architects and know how to build systems in a very efficient way. So I think this is a product we've been training for, for the last decade.",125
