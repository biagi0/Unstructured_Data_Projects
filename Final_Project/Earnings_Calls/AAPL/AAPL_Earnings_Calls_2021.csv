Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. It's with great gratitude for the tireless and innovative work of every Apple team member worldwide that I share the results of a very strong quarter for Apple. We achieved an all-time revenue record of $111.4 billion. We saw strong double-digit growth across every product category, and we achieved all-time revenue records in each of our geographic segments.
It is not far from many of our minds that this result caps off the most challenging year any of us can remember. And it is an understatement to say that the challenges it posed to Apple as a business paled in comparison to the challenge it posed to Apple as a community of individuals, to employees, to their families and to the communities we live in and love to call home.
While these results show the central role that our products played in helping our users respond to these challenges, we are doubly aware that the work ahead of all of us to navigate the end of this pandemic, to restore normal life and prosperity in our neighborhoods and local economies and to build back with a sense of justice is profound and urgent. We will speak to these needs and Apple's efforts throughout today's call, but I want to first offer the context of a detailed look at our results this quarter, including why we outperformed our expectations.
Let's get started with hardware. We hit a new high watermark for our installed base of active devices, with growth accelerating as we passed 1.65 billion devices worldwide during the December quarter. iPhone grew by 17% year-over-year driven by strong demand for the iPhone 12 family, and our active installed base of iPhones is now over 1 billion. The customer response to the new iPhone 12 models' unprecedented innovation from world-class cameras to the great and growing potential of 5G has been enthusiastic, even in light of the ongoing COVID-19 impact at retail locations.
iPad and Mac grew by 41% and 21%, respectively, reflecting the continuing role these devices have played in our users' lives during the COVID-19 pandemic. During this quarter, availability began for both our new iPad Air as well as the first generation of Macs to feature our groundbreaking M1 chip. The demand for all of these products has been very strong.
We have also continued our efforts to bring the latest iPad's enriching content and professional support to educators, students and parents. Educational districts and governments worldwide are continuing major deployments, including the largest iPad deployments ever to schools in Germany and Japan.
Wearables, Home and Accessories grew by 30% year-over-year, driven by significant holiday demand for the latest Apple Watch, our entire AirPods lineup, including the new AirPods Max as well as the new HomePod mini. This broad strength across the category led to new revenue records for each of its 3 subgroups, and we're very excited about the road ahead for these products. 
Look no further than the great potential of Fitness+, which pairs with Apple Watch to deliver real-time on-screen fitness data alongside world-class workouts by the world's best trainers. There are new sessions added each week, and customers are loving the flexibility, challenge and fun of these classes as well as how the pairing with Apple Watch pushes you to achieve your fitness goals.
This deep integration of hardware, software and services have always defined our approach here, and it has delivered an all-time quarterly Services record of $15.8 billion. This was the first quarter of the Apple One bundle, which brings together many of our great services into an easy subscription; and with new content being added to these services every day, we feel very optimistic about where we are headed.
The App Store ecosystem has been so important as individuals, families and businesses worldwide evolve and adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we want to make sure that this unrivaled engine of innovation and opportunity continues. This quarter, we also took a significant new step to help smaller developers continue to experiment, innovate and scale the latest great app ideas. The App Store Small Business Program reduces the commission on the sale of digital goods and services to 15% for small businesses earning less than $1 million a year. The program launched on January 1, and we are already hearing from developers about how this change represents a transformation in their potential to create and grow on the App Store.
Tomorrow is International Privacy Day, and we continue to set new standards to protect users' right to privacy, not just for our own products but to be the ripple in the pond that moves the whole industry forward. Most recently, we're in the process of deploying new requirements across the App Store ecosystem that give users more knowledge about and new tools to control the ways that apps gather and share their personal data.
The winter holiday season is always a busy time for us and our products. But this year was unique. We had a record number of device activations during the last week of the quarter. And as COVID-19 kept us apart, we saw the highest volume of FaceTime calls ever this Christmas. As always, we could not have made so many holidays special without our talented and dedicated retail teams who helped us achieve a new all-time revenue record for retail, driven by very strong performance in our online store.
Particularly, after the events of the last few weeks, we're focused on how we can help a moment of great national need. Because none of us should have any illusions about the challenges we face as we begin a new chapter in the American story, hope for healing, for unity and for progress begins with and depends on addressing the things that continue to wound us.
In our communities, we see how every burden from COVID-19 to the resulting economic challenges, to the closure of in-person learning for students falls heaviest on those who have always faced structural barriers to opportunity and equality. This month, Apple announced major new commitments through a $100 million Racial Equity and Justice Initiative. The Propel Center launched with a $25 million commitment and with the support of historically black colleges and universities across the country, will help support the next-generation of leaders in fields ranging from machine learning to app development to entrepreneurship and design.
And our new Apple Developer Academy in Downtown Detroit will be the first of its kind in the United States. Detroit has a vibrant culture of black entrepreneurship, including over 50,000 black-owned businesses. We want to accelerate the potential of the app economy here, knowing there is no shortage of good ideas in such a creative, resilient and dedicated community. Finally, we're committing $35 million across 2 investments in Harlem Capital and the Clear Vision Impact Fund that support, accelerate and grow minority-owned businesses in areas of great potential and need.
In December, we concluded an unmatched year of giving. Since the inception of the Apple Giving program in 2011, Apple employees have donated nearly $600 million and volunteered more than 1.6 million hours to over 34,000 organizations of every stride. Through our partnership with (PRODUCT)RED, we've adapted our 14-year $250 million effort to support HIV and AIDS work globally to ensure that care continues even in the time of COVID. That includes delivering millions of units of personal protective equipment to health care providers in Zambia.
And here in the United States, even with COVID's effects, we are ahead of schedule on our multiyear commitment to invest $350 billion throughout the American economy. As proud as this makes us, we know there is much more to be done. Looking forward, we continue to contend with the COVID-19 pandemic, but we must also now work to imagine what we will inherit on the other side. When a disease recedes, we cannot simply assume that healing follows. Even now, we see the deep scars that this period has left in our communities. Trust has been compromised. Opportunities have been lost. Entire portions of our lives that we took for granted, schools for children, meetings with our colleagues, small businesses that have endured for generations have simply disappeared. It will take a society-wide effort across the public and private sectors as individuals and communities, every one of us, to ensure that what's ahead of us is not simply the end of a disease but the beginning of something durable and hopeful for those who gave, suffered and endured during this time.
At Apple, we have every intention to be partners in this effort, and we look forward to working in communities around the world to make it possible. And as this chapter of uncertainty continues, so will our tireless work to help our customers stay safe, connected and well.
With that, I'll hand things over to Luca.",1489
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3609.0,2183036.0,85458058.0,Presenter Speech,Luca Maestri,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We started our fiscal 2021 with exceptional business and financial performance during the December quarter as we set all-time records for revenue, operating income, net income, earnings per share and operating cash flow. We are thrilled with the way our teams continued to innovate and execute throughout this period of elevated uncertainty.
Our revenue reached an all-time record of $111.4 billion, an increase of nearly $20 billion or 21% from a year ago. We grew strong double digits in each of our product categories, with all-time records for iPhone; Wearables, Home and Accessories; and Services as well as a December quarter record for Mac. We also achieved double-digit growth and new all-time records in each of our 5 geographic segments and in the vast majority of countries that we track.
Products revenue was an all-time record of $95.7 billion, up 21% over a year ago. As a consequence of this level of sales performance and the unmatched loyalty of our customers, our installed base of active devices passed 1.65 billion during the December quarter and reached an all-time record in each of our major product categories.
Our Services set an all-time record of $15.8 billion, growing 24% year-over-year. We established new all-time records in most service categories and December quarter records in each geographic segment. I'll cover our Services business in more detail later.
Company gross margin was 39.8%, up 160 basis points sequentially, thanks to leverage from higher sales and a strong mix. Products gross margin was 35.1%, growing 530 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and mix. Services gross margin was 68.4%, up 150 basis points sequentially, mainly due to a different mix.
Net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow were all-time records. Net income was $28.8 billion, up $6.5 billion or 29% over last year. Diluted earnings per share were $1.68, up 35% over last year and operating cash flow was $38.8 billion, an improvement of $8.2 billion.  
Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was a record $65.6 billion, growing 17% year-over-year as demand for the iPhone 12 family was very strong despite COVID-19 and social distancing measures, which have impacted store operations in a significant manner. Our active installed base of iPhones reached a new all-time high and has now surpassed 1 billion devices, thanks to the exceptional loyalty of our customer base and strength of our ecosystem. In fact, in the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for the iPhone 12 family.  
Turning to Services. As I said, we reached an all-time revenue record of $15.8 billion and set all-time records in App Store, cloud services, Music, advertising, AppleCare and payment services. Our new service offerings, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ as well as the Apple One bundle are also contributing to overall Services growth and continue to add users, content and features.
The key drivers for our Services growth all continue to move in the right direction: First, our installed base growth has accelerated and is an all-time high across each major product category; second, the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the December quarter with paid accounts increasing double digits in each of our geographic segments; third, paid subscriptions continue to grow nicely, and we exceeded our target of 600 million paid subscriptions before the end of calendar 2020. During the December quarter, we added more than 35 million sequentially, and we now have more than 620 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 140 million from just a year ago.
Finally, we continue to improve the breadth and quality of our current Services offerings and are adding new services that we think our customers will love. For example, Apple Music recently released its biggest product update ever with features like Listen Now, all new search, personal radio stations and autoplay. 90% of Apple Music users on iOS 14 have already used these new features.
In payment services, we continue to expand our coverage with nearly 90% of stores in the United States now accepting Apple Pay so that customers can easily have a touchless payments experience.  
Wearables, Home and Accessories grew 30% year-over-year to $13 billion, setting new all-time revenue records in every geographic segment. As a result of this strong performance, our Wearables business is now the size of a Fortune 120 company. Importantly, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach with nearly 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. We're very excited about the future of this category and believe that our integration of hardware, software and services uniquely positions us to provide great customer experience in this category.
Next, I'd like to talk about Mac. We set a December quarter record for revenue at $8.7 billion, up 21% over last year. We grew strong double digits in each geographic segment and set all-time revenue records in Europe and rest of Asia Pacific as well as December quarter records in the Americas, Greater China and in Japan. This performance was driven by strong demand for the new MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and Mac mini, all powered by our brand-new M1 chip.
iPad performance was also very impressive with revenue of $8.4 billion, up 41%. We grew strong -- very strong double digits in every geographic segment, including an all-time record in Japan. During the quarter, the new -- the all-new iPad Air became available and customer response has been terrific. Both Mac and iPad are incredibly relevant products for our customers in the current working and learning environments. And we are delighted that the most recent surveys of consumers from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 93% for Mac and 94% for iPad. With this level of customer satisfaction and with around half of the customers purchasing Mac and iPad during the quarter being new to that product, the active installed base for both products continues to grow nicely and reached new all-time highs.
In the enterprise market, we are seeing many businesses shifting their technology investment in response to COVID. One example is how businesses are handling their hundreds of millions of office desk phones while more employees are working remotely. Last quarter, Mitsubishi UFG Bank, one of the largest banks in the world, announced that it will be replacing 75% of its fixed phones with iPhones. By doing so, it expects to realize significant cost savings while providing a secure mobile platform to employees.
We're also pleased with the rapid adoption of the Mac Employee Choice Program among the world's leading businesses, who are seeing improved productivity, increased employee satisfaction and talent retention. With the introduction of M1-powered Macs, we're excited to extend these experiences to an even broader range of customers and employees, especially in times of increased remote working.
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with almost $196 billion in cash plus marketable securities and retired $1 billion of maturing debt, leaving us with total debt of $112 billion. As a result, net cash was $84 billion at the end of the quarter. We returned over $30 billion to shareholders during the December quarter, including $3.6 billion in dividends and equivalents and $24 billion through open market repurchases of 200 million Apple shares as we continue on our path to reaching a net cash neutral position over time.
As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to provide some color on what we are seeing, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we will not be guiding to a specific revenue range. However, we are providing some directional insights assuming that COVID-related impacts of our business do not worsen from our current assumptions for the quarter.
For total company revenue, we believe growth will accelerate on a year-over-year basis and in aggregate, follow typical seasonality on a sequential basis. At the product category level, keep in mind 2 items: First, during the March quarter last year, we saw elevated activity in our digital services as lockdowns occurred around the world, so our Services business faces a tougher year-over-year comparison; second, we believe the year-over-year growth in the Wearables, Home and Accessories category will decelerate compared to Q1. As you know, we were chasing demand on AirPods last year as we expanded channel inventory from Q1 to Q2. This year, we plan to decrease AirPods channel inventory as is typical after the holiday quarter.
We expect gross margin to be similar to the December quarter. We expect OpEx to be between $10.7 billion and $10.9 billion. We expect OI&E to be up around $50 million and our tax rate to be around 17%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.205 per share of common stock payable on February 11, 2021, to shareholders of record as of February 8, 2021.
With that, let's open the call to questions.",1539

First question for Luca. The gross margin was particularly strong versus your outlook. Can you talk about whether you recognize the full impact of the weaker dollar in the December quarter given your typical currency hedges? And then how are you thinking about the headwinds and tailwinds on gross margins as you go into the March quarter? And then I have a follow-up for Tim.,71
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3609.0,2183036.0,85458062.0,Answer,Luca Maestri,,Executives,7,"Yes, Katy. So yes, the gross margin was strong, was better than we had anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. The reason for that was obviously we had very strong leverage from higher sales. And the mix was strong, both the mix within products and the mix of services, and that was only partially offset by cost. As you know, we launch many new products during the fall, and that always comes with new cost structures. So in total, it was very good.
On -- from the FX standpoint, really, at the gross margin level, FX didn't play a role, neither sequentially nor on a year-over-year basis for the December quarter partially because of the hedges that you talked about but also because some currencies are still weaker against the dollar. They're still weaker than a year ago, look, specifically to emerging markets in Latin America, in Russia, in Turkey and so on.  
Clearly, if the dollar remains weak or continues to weaken, that can become a tailwind for us as we get into the March quarter. At current rates, we expect some level of benefit around 60 to 70 basis points for the March quarter.",197

And Tim, one of the challenges with valuing Apple is just a limited visibility that investors have into the road map and any new categories that you might enter over time. Without, of course, commenting on any given opportunity, can you talk about the framework that you use internally to evaluate new markets that might be attractive and what you believe will determine your success as you look to enter new markets?",75
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3609.0,2183036.0,85458064.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,9,"Thanks, Katy, for the question, and thanks for not asking me any specifics. The framework that we use is very much around we ask ourselves if this is a product that we would want to use ourselves or a service that we would want to use ourselves, and that's a pretty high bar. And we ask ourselves if it's a big enough market to be in unless it's an adjacency product, of which we're looking at it very much from a customer experience point of view.
And so there's no set way that we're looking at it, no formula kind of thing. But we're taking into account all of those things. And the kind of things that we love to work on are those where there's a requirement for hardware, software and services to come together because we believe that the magic really occurs at that intersection. And so hopefully, that gives you a little bit of insight into how we look at it.
And I think we have some good -- really good opportunities out there. And I think if you look at our current portfolio of products, we're -- we still have relatively a low share in a number of cases in very big markets. And so we feel like we have really good upside there, and we feel like we have really good upside in the Services area, too, that we've been working on for quite some time with 4, 5 new services just coming online in the last year, year plus. And so -- yes. Thank you.",261

Can you maybe share some color on what drove that? Was it more on the unit side or the ASP side? You referred to very strong mix a couple of times on the call.

Yes, certainly, iPhone was one of the major factors why we exceeded our own internal expectations at the beginning of the quarter. We have a fantastic product lineup and we know that, and it's been fantastic to see the customer response for the -- for new models, particularly the Pro models, the Pro and the Pro Max. So we've done very, very well both on units and on pricing because of the strong mix.  
And we've had some level of supply constraints as we went through the quarter, particularly on the Pro and the Pro Max. As you said correctly, we launched these products in the middle of the quarter, 2 models after 4 weeks, the other 2 models after 7 weeks. And so obviously, we had a very steep ramp, which fortunately went very, very well. The products are doing very well all around the world. I think you've seen that our performance has been particularly strong in China, where we've seen phenomenal customer response that probably there was also some level of pent-up demand for 5G iPhones given that the market is moving very quickly to 5G.
And so as we look ahead into the March quarter, we're very optimistic. We believe we're going to be able to be in supply-demand balance for all the models at some point during the quarter. And it's -- the product is doing very well all around the world.",238

If you look at this past quarter, which has -- we started selling 2 of the iPhones 4 weeks into the quarter and the other 2 7 weeks into the quarter. And so I would caution that this is in the early going.

China was more than an iPhone story. iPhone did do very well there. And sort of like the world, if you look at both switchers and upgraders, we were up year-over-year, and China also had a record number of upgraders during the quarter, the most we've ever seen in a quarter. I think probably some portion of this was that people probably delayed purchasing in the previous quarter as rumors started appearing about an iPhone.
Keep in mind that 5G in China is -- the network is well established, and the overwhelming majority of phones being sold are 5G phones. And so I think there was some level of anticipation for us delivering an iPhone with 5G. And so iPhone did extremely well.
However, the other products did as well. I mean we could not have turned in a performance like we did with only iPhone. iPad did extremely well, far beyond the company average. Mac was above the company average. Wearables, Home and Accessories was above the company average. And so if you really look at it, we did really well across the board there.
In terms of COVID, I think they're -- at least for last quarter, they were beat -- sort of beyond COVID, very much in the recovery stage. This quarter, there are different reports about some cases in some places and lockdowns occurring but we have not seen that in our business as yet. And of course, those cases are much smaller than the ones in other countries.",254

I guess the other thing I was curious about, with regard to the Services business, if we could dig a little bit more, I think this is one of the first times when, Luca, you talked about Apple TV+, Arcade, Apple Pay, some of the smaller services actually kind of moving the needle. And then I was also curious, you had a number of stores closed at least later in the quarter, and that typically has impacted some of your AppleCare revenue and yet you outperformed. So maybe if you could talk about a bit more about the drivers of the Services revenue.",104

I mean, really, it's been strong across the board. There are 2 businesses during COVID that have been impacted negatively, and we talked about it in the past. One is AppleCare. Obviously, when the stores are closed, it's tougher, of course, for customers to have interaction with us. And advertising, which is -- it's in line with the overall level of economic activity.
What happened during the December quarter is that in-store traffic improved. And so AppleCare, we grew. We didn't grow as much as company average, but we grew in AppleCare, set an all-time record there in spite of the fact that, yes, we are running -- particularly in December, we started closing a few stores, particularly here in the United States but also in Western Europe. But in total, we were able to support more customers than in past quarters.
And we also saw a sequential acceleration in advertising and so that also helped the overall growth rate. Clearly, the strength was in digital services, in the App Store, in cloud services, in Music. Those were the services that really delivered very, very strong performance. It's something that we've seen happen during the COVID environment.",198

Luca, I was wondering if we could just probe a little bit more into iPhone. Maybe you can just -- you talked about a drawdown in channel inventory last quarter. Our iPhone channel inventory is sort of at normal levels now exiting Q1. And should we be thinking about above-seasonal iPhone growth -- given that you're still not in supply-demand balance and you had fewer selling days in fiscal Q1, should we be thinking about sort of above-seasonal iPhone growth looking into Q2?",93
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3609.0,2183036.0,85458077.0,Answer,Luca Maestri,,Executives,22,"So on the December performance, as you know, Toni, this was a very different cycle because we launched at a different time than usual. And so we had an initial part of the quarter where, obviously, we didn't have the new phones. And then as we launched the new phones, we also did the channel fill that typically happens, to a certain extent, in the September quarter.
At the end of the quarter, the demand has been very strong. And so we've been constrained, as I said, on -- especially in the Pro models. At the end of December, we exited with a level of iPhone channel inventory, which was slightly below a year ago. So we -- and we still had some level of supply constraints, which we believe we're going to be able to solve during the March quarter.
In terms of the sequential change, we talked about -- during the prepared remarks, we talked about total company average, and we said that we expect that sequential progression to be similar to the typical seasonality that you've seen in past years. Certainly, last year is not typical because of COVID. But if you go back, fiscal '17, '18, '19, that's our typical seasonal progression.
And we mentioned a couple of product categories, Services and Wearables, where we're going to be having a slightly more difficult compare. And so I think you can draw your conclusions around the iPhone.",240

And then, Tim, I was wondering if you could just comment more broadly around growth for Apple and sources of growth. The company this year is going to be well over $300 billion in revenue. Historically, you've eschewed acquisitions. And I'm wondering if you could comment whether you still feel confident that Apple has Apple organic growth opportunities and that you don't believe acquisitions are an important source of growth. And then I think perhaps most importantly, as you look out, let's say, over the next 5 years, what do you think is a realistic revenue growth rate for Apple going forward?",103
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3609.0,2183036.0,85458079.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,24,"Yes. Toni, as you know, we give some color on the current quarter but not beyond that in terms of growth rates, so I'll punt that part of your question. But if you back up and look at the sort of the ingredients that we have at this point, we have the strongest hardware portfolio that we've ever had. And we have a great product pipeline for the future, both in products and in services.
We have an installed base that has hit new highs that we just talked about earlier in our opening comments. And we're still attracting a fair number of switchers and, of course, upgraders. We just set an all-time Services record, and we have that installed base to compound that, and particularly with the added services that we've had over the last year or so, that as they grow and mature, will contribute even more to the Services revenue stream.
And on the Wearables side, we've brought this thing from 0 to a Fortune 120 company, which was no small feat. But I still think that we're in the early stages of those products. If you look at our share in some of the other products, whether you look at iPhone or Mac or iPad, you find that the share numbers leave a fair amount of headroom for market share expansion. And this is particularly the case in some of the emerging markets, where we're proud of how we've done, but there's a lot more headroom in those markets.
Like if you take India as an example, we doubled our business last quarter compared to the year ago quarter, but our absolute level of business there is still quite low relative to the size of the opportunity. And you can kind of take that and go around the world and find other markets that are like that as well.
And of course, the other thing from a market point of view is we're -- we've been on a multiyear effort in the enterprise and have gained quite a bit of traction there. You've heard some of the things in Luca's comments today, and we comment some on it each quarter. We're very optimistic about what we can do in that space.
And then, of course, we've got new things that we're not going to talk about that we think will contribute to the company as well just like other new things have contributed nicely to the company in the past. So we see lots of opportunity. Thank you for the question.",425

I guess starting with you, Luca, I just wanted to go back to the gross margin discussion, and we really haven't seen gross margins at this level, high 39%, I think, since 2016. Could you maybe step back and talk about what has enabled the shift higher? What are the key drivers to get you there? And is commodity tailwinds or in-sourcing of some components really a big part of this? So just love to understand the durability of the gross margin at these levels. And what are the big drivers that got us here?",101
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3609.0,2183036.0,85458082.0,Answer,Luca Maestri,,Executives,27,"Well, Amit, of course, when you grow the way we've grown this quarter, 21%, it's -- obviously, we have a certain level of fixed cost in our product structures, right? And so a high level of sales helps margin expansion without a doubt, and so that has been probably the biggest factor, to be honest.
And then as I was saying earlier, we've had, across the board, in services, in every product category, we've had a very strong mix of products, right? We were talking about the iPhone, the Pro and the Pro Max, and that's been pretty much the case in every product category. So the mix has also been very good.
The commodity environment is fairly benign. And the one thing that has not affected us this time around is the FX that it's true, it has not been a tailwind yet for the reasons that I was explaining to Katy, but at the same time, it has not been a negative. And the reality is that FX for us has been a negative over the last 5 or 6 years almost every quarter. And so that has changed, and that obviously makes a difference.",197

And then, Tim, when I look at the growth rates on Mac and iPads, they've been in the 20% to 40% range for the last 3 quarters, and I suspect some of this is just folks contending with the pandemic. But love to understand, when you look at these growth rates, how much of this do you think is replacement cycle-driven folks upgrading what they have at home versus new customers and new folks that are coming into the Apple ecosystem? And do you see -- I guess what sort of growth rates do you think is more durable or predictable as we go forward over here?",109
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3609.0,2183036.0,85458084.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,29,"If you look at the switcher or the switchers, if you look at the new to Mac and new to iPad, these numbers are still about -- at a worldwide level, about half of the purchases are coming from people that are new. And so the installed base is still expanding with new customers in it. And so that's true on both iPad and Mac.
If you look at Mac, the M1, I think, gives us a new growth trajectory that we haven't had in the past. Certainly, if Q1 is a good proxy, there's lots of excitement about M1-based Macs. As you know, we're partly through the transition. We've got more -- a lot more to do there. We're early days of a 2-year transition, but we're excited about what we see so far.
The iPad, as we went out with the iPad Air, and we now have the best iPad lineup we've ever had, and it's clear that some people are using these as laptop replacements, others are using them as complementary to their desktop. But the level of growth there has been phenomenal. You look at it at 41%. And yes, part of it is work from home and part of it is just learning.
But I think I wouldn't underestimate how much of it is the product itself on -- in both the case of iPad and Mac. And of course, our share in the Mac is quite low in the -- for the total personal computer market. And so there's lots of headroom there.",259

But there are other regions that 5G is -- that has very good coverage. Like Korea is an example. And so the world, I would describe it right now, is more of a patchwork quilt. There are places that there's really excellent coverage. There are places where, within a country, that is very good but not from a nationwide point of view. And then there are places that really hasn't gotten started yet. Latin America is more closer to the last one. There's lots of opportunity ahead of us there. And I think Europe is where there are 5G implementations there. I think most of that growth is probably in front of us there as well.",150

I mean it -- and I think I was mentioning it during the prepared remarks. We -- clearly, in China, the March quarter is typically the strongest quarter for our Services business and for the App Store because of Chinese New Year, as you mentioned. And last year, what we saw was an increased level of activity because, after Chinese New Year, the whole country went into lockdown for several weeks. And so that propensity for playing games continued for several weeks, more than a typical cycle. So we expect to have a great quarter in China, but at the same time, we need to keep in mind that the compare is going to be particularly challenging because of what happened a year ago.",125

Can you speak to how that -- the level of benefit that you saw there? And going forward, are you confident that you can continue to improve the mix in iPhone going forward?",94

So I think that answers your question for the December quarter. What we've seen so far, it's very early because we launched the new products only a few weeks ago. What we've seen so far is a very high level of interest for the Pro models, the Pro and the Pro Max. We worked very hard to ramp up our supply.

As a follow-up question, if you could talk a bit to the benefit that you may have seen from some of the carrier actions? We've seen very aggressive trade-ins during the quarter.

I think subsidies always help that anything that reduces the price to the customer is good for the customer and obviously good for the carrier that's doing it and good for us as well. And so it's a win across the board. I believe that, at least based on what I see right now, is that there would be probably continuing to have quite a bit of competition in the market, if you're talking about the U.S. market for customers as the carriers work to get more customers to move to 5G.
In -- outside of the U.S., the subsidies are not used in all geographies, and so it really varies greatly by country. Some of them are -- separate completely, the handset and the service; and in those areas, we don't have subsidies.",140

A lot of the pushback we get on our view on Apple is that everyone around them or that they know in developed countries has an iPhone or Apple product and the market is kind of being saturated some. But when I look at other countries like India, I believe statistically, you are materially below that in market share. So are you doing active efforts there? It seems like there's been some news reports of moving supply chain there or you recently opened up an Apple Store. How should we think about that? Because it just seems like you're really not full market share equally around the world.",124

There are several markets, as I alluded to before, India is one of those, where our share is quite low. It's -- it did improve from the year ago quarter. Our business roughly doubled over that period of time, and so we feel very good about the trajectory. We are doing a number of things in the area. We put the online store there, for example, and last quarter was the first full quarter of the online store. And that has gotten a great reaction to it and has helped us achieve the results that we got to last quarter. 
We're also going in there with retail stores in the future. And so we look for that to be another great initiative and we continue to develop the channel as well. And so there's lots of things, not only in India but in several of the other markets that you might name where our share is lower than we would like.
And I -- again, I would also say, even in the developed markets, when you look at our share, definitely, everybody doesn't have an iPhone, not even close. And so we really don't have a significant share in any market. We're -- so there's headroom left even in those developed markets where you might hear that.",218

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call today. Apple is proud to report another strong quarter, one where we set new March quarter records for both revenue and earnings, besting our year ago revenue performance by 54%. Reflecting both the enduring ways our products have helped our users meet this moment in their own lives as well as the optimism consumers seem to feel about better days ahead, we set new March quarter records in every geographic segment, and success was broadly distributed across our product categories. Mac and Services delivered all-time record results, and we set new March quarter records for iPhone and Wearables, Home and Accessories.
To provide some color on our results, let's turn to our product categories. We saw a very strong performance for iPhone, which grew 66% year-over-year driven by the strong popularity of the iPhone 12 family. With unmatched 5G capability, the best camera system ever in an iPhone and advanced durability from Ceramic Shield, this family of devices is popular with both upgraders and new customers alike. And just last week, we unveiled an all-new purple finish for iPhone 12 and 12 Mini. 
As has been the case throughout the pandemic, iPad and Mac continue to be critically important tools for our customers. Over the past year, tens of millions of iPads and Macs have been deployed to help students learn, creators create and to enhance remote work in all of its forms. This has helped iPad grow very strong double digits to its highest March quarter revenue in nearly a decade.
On Mac, fueled by the M1, we set an all-time revenue record continuing the momentum for the product category. In fact, the last 3 quarters for Mac have been its 3 best quarters ever. Last week, both iPad and Mac took a big step forward. We debuted a radically redesigned brand-new iMac designed around M1's unmatched capabilities, and we've brought M1 to iPad for the first time in the new iPad Pro with 5G capability and a Liquid Retina XDR display.
It was a quarter of sustained strength for Wearables, Home and Accessories, which grew by 25% year-over-year. Apple Watch is a global success story, and the category set March quarter records in each geographic segment, thanks to strong performance from both Apple Watch Series 6 and Apple Watch SE. It's an exciting and busy period ahead for Wearables, Home and Accessories with the launch of the next-generation Apple TV 4K and our newest accessory, AirTag. AirTag builds on the powerful and incredibly useful Find My experience, helping users privately and securely keep track of the items that matter most to them. Third-party accessories and products can also make use of the Find My network, guaranteeing a great experience no matter what products you choose to use.
Turning to Services. We achieved growth of 27% year-over-year and set new records for services in each of our geographic segments. We continue to enhance and improve our current service offerings from Apple Music to Apple News while continuing to launch new services that enhance our customers' lives.
Just last week, we introduced Apple Card Family which reinvents how you can share credit cards and build credit together. We also announced Apple Podcast subscriptions, a global marketplace for listeners to discover premium content from their favorite creators and storytellers.
While we're on the topic of services, in many ways, this quarter showed the unique value to customers created by Apple's belief in the deep integration of hardware, software and services. Across our products and throughout our software ecosystem, we continue to deploy industry-leading new tools to protect users' fundamental right to privacy. In addition to the App Store privacy nutrition labels that we discussed on last quarter's call, we're proud to have launched the full implementation of App Tracking Transparency. This powerful yet simple idea gives users a choice over how their data is used and shared across the apps that they love and use every day.
No matter what device you enjoy it from, it is a milestone period for Apple TV+, racking up many new award nominations and wins, including its first Oscar nominations. Ted Lasso, in particular, has been recognized with a multitude of awards and nominations including most recently, an AFI Program of the Year Recognition, Writers Guild of America Awards and a clean sweep at the Critics Choice Awards. Apple TV+ also continues to be a place where we can tell stories that matter and lift up important voices and experiences like our new upcoming content partnership with Malala; or our latest original documentary special, The Year the Earth Changed, narrated by the legendary David Attenborough and released to commemorate Earth Day.
This is, of course, just one example of how Apple lives its values and operationalizes the idea that to whom much is given, much is expected.
To begin with our environmental efforts, just last week, we marked a milestone Earth Day on multiple fronts. In addition to the progress we've made in our own efforts to achieve our pledge of a net zero carbon footprint by 2030 across our entire supply chain and use of our products, we're proud to play a role in the growing ripple change taking place across the private sector.  As of this month, 110 of our suppliers have joined us in our renewable energy commitment, and we will bring online nearly 8 gigawatts of new clean energy, the equivalent of taking 3.4 million gas-powered vehicles off the road each year. Through Apple's $4.7 billion in green bonds and related efforts, we've supported transformative environmental projects around the world from clean energy initiatives in China to 2 of the world's largest onshore wind turbines in Denmark to 180-acre solar project outside Reno, Nevada and many more.
We're also keenly focused on how this wave of green innovation can lead to equitably shared prosperity. Through our new $200 million Restore Fund, we're helping local and rural communities around the world build sustainable industries around work in forests, creating opportunities and removing up to 1 million metric tons of carbon from the atmosphere every year. And here in the United States, we started a green impact accelerator, investing and supporting minority-owned businesses at the forefront of environmental fields.
As we look forward to WWDC, we're taking new steps to foster -- to support and foster the unmatched community of developers we work with here in the United States and around the world. I'm particularly excited about our inaugural Entrepreneur Camp for black founders and developers. Building on the success of our Entrepreneur Camp program, which we began in 2019, this program gives this profoundly innovative community of developers the chance to develop next-level technical skills through hands-on technology labs, and with our partners at Harlem Capital, it also shares insights and mentorship on building and scaling an app business.
We were proud to announce that we have expanded and accelerated our commitment to the U.S. economy. Over the next 5 years, we will invest $430 billion, creating 20,000 jobs in the process. The investments will support American innovation and drive economic benefits in every state, including a new North Carolina campus and job creating investments in innovative fields like silicon engineering and 5G technology.
Looking forward, whether you're running a business or just hoping to see family again after more than a year, it's tempting at this moment to let hope about the end of the COVID-19 pandemic outstrip clear-eyed realism about the challenges we still face. In many places around the world, new waves of infections driven by even more infectious variants of the virus are driving new lockdowns. Instead of simply assuming that the end is in sight, we at Apple are doing our part to make it a reality, beginning with an enduring and uncompromising commitment to the health and safety of our teams, and extending well beyond our walls into the communities where we work. We also want to do everything we can to connect users to life-saving vaccinations that are in ever greater supply. Through Apple Maps, for example, we now showcase vaccine site locations here in the United States, building on our maps of testing locations in many countries around the world.
It's worth remembering for much more than financial reasons or year-ago compares, just how we felt at this time last year when everything we knew had to change: Planes sat grounded, entire business districts were empty and silent; people left groceries or care packages sitting in the garage or in the hall overnight in recognition of all that we didn't know and therefore, had to imagine. Thanks to researchers and scientists, doctors and nurses, everyone who can put a shot in an arm and even just check a name off a list, we have reached new days of hopeful resolve.
Our work is not done, but as I said a year ago, while we can't say for sure how many chapters are in this book, we can have confidence that the ending will be a good one. With that, I'll hand things over to Luca.",1522

Good afternoon, everyone. We are extremely pleased to report record results for our March quarter despite continued uncertainty in the macro environment. We've been operating in new ways for over a year, and we could not be more proud of the way our team continues to execute and innovate at unprecedented levels.
Our revenue reached a March quarter record of $89.6 billion an increase of over $31 billion or 54% from a year ago. We grew very strong double digits in each of our product categories, with all-time records for Mac and for Services and March quarter records for iPhone and for Wearables, Home and Accessories. We also set new March quarter records in every geographic segment with growth of at least 35% in each one of them.
Products revenue was a March quarter record of $72.7 billion, up 62% over a year ago. As a result of this level of sales performance and the unmatched loyalty of our customers, our installed base of active devices reached a new all-time record in each of our major product categories. Our services set an all-time record of $16.9 billion, growing 27% over a year ago. We established new records in each geographic segment and in most service categories. I will provide more details about the performance of our services business later.
Company gross margin was 42.5%, up 270 basis points from last quarter driven by cost savings, a strong mix and favorable foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 36.1%, growing 100 basis points sequentially also thanks to cost savings and FX, partially offset by seasonal loss of leverage. Services gross margin was 70.1%, up 170 basis points sequentially and mainly due to a different mix. Net income of $23.6 billion, diluted earnings per share of $1.40 and operating cash flow of $24 billion were all March quarter records by a wide margin.
Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenues had a March quarter record of $47.9 billion, growing 66% year-over-year as the iPhone 12 family continued to be in high demand. Performance was consistently strong across the world as we grew strong double digits in each geographic segment and set March quarter records in most markets we track. Thanks to the exceptional loyalty of our customer base and strength of our ecosystem, our active installed base of iPhones reached a new all-time high. In the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates customer satisfaction of over 99% for the iPhone 12 family.
Turning to Services. We reached an all-time revenue record of $16.9 billion with all-time records for the App Store, cloud services, music, video, advertising and payment services. Our new service offerings, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ as well as the Apple One bundle, continue to scale across users, content and features and are contributing to overall services growth. The key drivers for our services business all continue to move in the right direction.
First, our installed base growth has accelerated and reach an all-time high across each major product category. Second, the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the March quarter, with paid accounts increasing double digits in each of our geographic segments. Third, paid subscriptions continued to show strong growth. During the March quarter, we added more than 40 million paid subs sequentially, and we have now reached more than 660 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform. This is up 145 million from just a year ago and twice the number of paid subscriptions we had only 2.5 years ago.
Finally, we're adding new services that we think our customers will love, while also continuing to improve the breadth and quality of our current service offerings. For example, Apple Arcade launched its biggest expansion yet adding incredibly fun games to the catalog, including new exclusive Arcade originals, along with 2 entirely new categories, App Store Greats and Timeless Classics. Apple Pay continues to expand geographically, launching in Mexico and in South Africa, bringing our payment service to 6 continents.
Wearables, Home and Accessories grew 25% year-over-year to $7.8 billion, setting new March quarter revenue records in every geographic segment. Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with nearly 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. We're very excited about the future of this category and believe that our integration of hardware, software and services uniquely positions us to provide great customer experiences in this category.
Next, I'd like to talk about Mac. We set an all-time revenue record of $9.1 billion, up 70% over last year, and grew very strongly in each geographic segment with all-time revenue records in Europe and rest of Asia Pacific and March quarter records in the Americas, Greater China and Japan. This amazing performance was driven by the very enthusiastic customer response to our new Macs powered by the M1 chip.
iPad performance was also outstanding with revenue of $7.8 billion, up 79%. We grew very strongly in every geographic segment with an all-time record in Japan and a March quarter record in rest of Asia Pacific.
Both Mac and iPad are incredibly relevant products for our customers in the current working and learning environments, and we are delighted that the most recent surveys of U.S. consumers from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 91% for Mac and 94% for iPad. With this level of customer satisfaction, and with around half of the customers purchasing Mac and iPad during the quarter being new to that product, the active installed base for both products continues to grow nicely and reached new all-time highs.
In the enterprise market, customers across many industries are accelerating their adoption of iPhone 12 and 5G as a key platform for the future of their business. Delta Airlines, for example, is putting iPhone 12 and 5G connectivity into the hands of flight attendants so they can provide the best passenger service possible as air travel rebounds. Openreach in the U.K. has started equipping tens of thousands of field engineers with iPhone 12 to speed up their deployment of broadband services to homes around the country. And UCHealth, a large health care provider in Colorado, was able to reduce per patient vaccination time from 3 minutes to only 30 seconds largely by moving from PC stations to iPhones. This has allowed their staff to rapidly scan and register new patients and vastly increase their daily vaccination capacity.
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with over $204 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We issued $14 billion of new term debt and retired $3.5 billion of term debt, leaving us with total debt of almost $122 billion. As a result, net cash was $83 billion at the end of the quarter.
This strong position allows us to continue to invest confidently in our future, while also returning value to our shareholders. We are innovating and investing at an unprecedented pace, including accelerating our investment in the United States with our new commitment to contribute more than $430 billion and 20,000 jobs to the country over the next 5 years.
As we continue to execute at an extremely high level, we were also able to return nearly $23 billion to shareholders during the March quarter. This included $3.4 billion in dividends and equivalents and $19 billion through open market repurchases of 147 million Apple shares. We continue to believe there is great value in our stock and maintain our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time.
Given the confidence we have in our business today and into the future, our Board has authorized an additional $90 billion for share repurchases. We're also raising our dividend by 7% to $0.22 per share, and we continue to plan for annual increases in the dividend going forward.
As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance, but we are sharing some directional insights assuming that the COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are seeing today for the current quarter.
We expect our June quarter revenue to grow strong double digits year-over-year. However, we believe that the sequential revenue decline from the March quarter to the June quarter will be greater than in prior years for 2 reasons. First, keep in mind that due to the later launch timing and strong demand, iPhone only achieved supply-demand balance during the March quarter. This will cause a steeper sequential decline than usual. Second, we believe supply constraints will have a revenue impact of $3 billion to $4 billion in the June quarter.
We expect gross margin to be between 41.5% and 42.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $11.1 billion and $11.3 billion. We expect OI&E to be around $50 million and our tax rate to be around 14.5%. Finally, reflecting the approved 7% dividend increase I just mentioned, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share of common stock payable on May 13, 2021, to shareholders of record as of May 10, 2021.
With that, let's open the call to questions.",1582

I'm just curious, there are so many different things happening in this cycle, 5G, pandemic. How are you thinking about the opportunity for refreshing the installed base and attracting new customers. And are you seeing lives shorten given some of the programs that are being put out there by the carriers and by yourself? Just kind of maybe big picture, if you can talk about what you're seeing in terms of iPhone out there in the market.",88

We saw double-digit increases on a year-over-year basis on both the new to iPhone and upgraders. So -- and in fact, in the March quarter, there was actually a record number of upgraders for a March quarter. And so we like what we see. It's obviously the early days of 5G. Different countries are in different points. But penetration is still -- on a global level, is still low at this point. And so a lot of the 5G upgrades will be in front of us, not behind us.
You see in China, things have moved quickly to 5G. They're moving quickly in the United States. But a lot of the other regions are slower to adopt and slower to gain coverage in 5G.",126

And then, Luca, can you talk about gross margin? I mean 42% is higher than it's been that I can kind of remember actually at this point. So maybe if you talk about the drivers of gross margin.

Yes, we did 42.5% during March, and we've guided to similar, slightly lower levels for June. So for March, we were up 270 basis points sequentially, really driven by 3 major factors. Cost savings, which has been good for us during the cycle. A really strong mix, a strong mix on iPhone, but in general, across all product categories, and that obviously was helpful. And foreign exchange sequentially, again, from December to March, was favorable 90 basis points. So that helped as well. So those are the 3 major factors there. As we transition into June, as you know, that we will expect some level of deleverage but that will be offset by cost savings. Foreign exchange doesn't have much of an impact as we go from March to June.",132

First one, just on Services. I think 90 days ago, the expectation was that line item would decelerate a little bit into the March quarter. It turned out it actually accelerated for us. I'd like to just understand what do you think drove that acceleration specifically? And is mid-20% sort of the growth norm as we go forward for Services?",65
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3631.0,2261739.0,87690078.0,Answer,Luca Maestri,,Executives,12,"So Amit, the -- our Services business did better than what we were expecting when we had the last call in January. It was stronger across the board. One of the things that we've noticed is that throughout COVID was that obviously digital services have done very well. And then we've had a couple of categories like Apple Care because many of the points of sale and stores were closed and advertising because of the reduced economic activity that were negatively affected during COVID. 
During the March quarter, we've seen a return to growth on Apple Care and obviously, we've reopened a lot of the stores during the course of the quarter. And advertising, obviously, consumer sentiment has improved and advertising is coming back. And so the combination of these factors really delivered this very, very strong performance during the March quarter.
As we look ahead, as you know, we don't provide specific guidance for our product categories. But in general, I talked during our prepared remarks, I mean, there are a number of things that we always look at around the Services business, how many new paid accounts do we have, what number of new subscriptions do we get that -- above all, is our installed base continuing to grow? Are we adding new services? Are we improving the quality of the existing services? And so when we look at all these fundamental vectors of our Services business, obviously, we feel very good. We feel very good about it.",250

And then, Tim, if I could follow up with you. It seems like engagement with iPhones and Apple devices generally has gone up materially over the last 12 months. And I don't think replacement cycles, at least in the data we see, has shrunk or changed that much at the end of the day. I'm wondering, does that combination of increased usage, replacement cycles haven't changed, end up in iPhones potentially growing on a multiyear basis? Because, usually, I would imagine if I'm using something more I have to replace it more often. So I'd love your perspective on it.",104

We're clearly seeing strong performance in both the new to iPhone or the switcher component and upgraders, as I'd mentioned before. And in fact, the upgrader was the best March quarter that we've ever had in -- and so that speaks to what you're seeing, I think, a lot.
It's difficult with just this far into the cycle to make a statement about the cycle in general because keep in mind that we just launched midway through the Q1 period. And so we've only been operating for 4.5 months or so. But clearly, we like what we see right now a lot. If you look at how the iPhone did around the world, we had the top 5 models of smartphone in the U.S., the top selling, the top 2 in urban China, 4 out of the top 5 in Japan, the top 4 in the U.K. and the top 6 in Australia. And so it was a sort of across the board in some really key countries, we did really, really well. I do think that the 5G cycle is important. And we're in the early days of it, frankly.",192

So I know you don't guide beyond -- or provide an outlook beyond the next quarter.

And then I have a follow-up for Luca.",104

Keep in mind that the compare that we're running to would be the quarter, the Q2 of last year is the quarter that China would have entered a shutdown first and then the rest of the world entered the shutdown in middle part of March. And so part of the growth is compare -- is the comparison point. But that said, the results were fabulous across the board. The shortages that Luca spoke about in the color that he provided on the future, affect primarily the iPad and the Mac. And so we'll have some challenges in there, and challenges in meeting the demand that we've got.
The demand feels very strong right now. Both on the Mac side, you have the combination of M1 and work from home and remote learning. And then iPad, you've got remote learning and work from home as well. And the product that we just announced is really killer, the iPad Pro with the M1 in it. And so there's a lot of great things of the strength of the product cycle in addition to the trends that we're seeing in the marketplace.
And where this pandemic will end, it seems like many companies will be operating in a hybrid kind of mode. And so it would seem that work from home and the productivity of working from home will remain very critical.
If you look at Wearables then, the watch had a fabulous quarter. And I still think we're in the early innings on the watch. The number of new -- people that are new to the watch is almost 3 out of 4. And so this is a long way from being a mature market. And so -- and then the Services by itself has really accelerated. And so all in all, we feel very, very good.",327

Should we read into that as a leading indicator for how we should think about the revenue growth deceleration in the business as the world normalizes? Or were there some supply disruptions during the quarter that caused you to drain inventory and create that tightness that you're talking about for June?",78

One is the fact that iPhone -- we launched iPhone later than usual during this cycle. And so we reached supply-demand balance only during the March quarter, which makes obviously the sequential decline steeper than usual. And then this $3 billion or $4 billion of supply constraints that Tim just said, primarily on iPad and Mac. So as you look at your model and you obviously can look at our numbers that we've done in the past, I think you can try to gauge that.
From a channel inventory standpoint, we did what we normally do during a March quarter. So we reduced inventory as it's typical on iPhone. We exited within our target range. So I would say that on the inventory side, it was pretty straightforward. Obviously, given that the supply constraints are on the iPad and on the Mac, we wish we had more inventory of iPad and Mac. But this is all a function of high demand for all our products.",199

TV+ is going very well. As you know, the objective and the philosophy that we've had on TV+ is to create high-quality original content and to be one of the most desired platforms for storytellers. And I see that happening day by day as we sign more shows and more storytellers including Malala as I had mentioned in my opening comments.
To date, we've received -- the Apple Originals have received 352 award nominations and had 98 wins. And this is from Oscar nominations to Emmy Awards to Critic Choice awards and all the rest. And we've got some shows that are -- have gotten significant buzz like Ted Lasso and The Morning Show and Defending Jacob and many others. And so we feel really good about where we are. We're not releasing subscriber numbers. But we feel good about where we are.

As my follow-up, Luca, on the June quarter guide, when you talk about the sequential decline being a little bit about perhaps the 13% or low-teens percent that we've seen historically, are the supply constraints of the $3 billion, $4 billion impact included in that? Or is that in addition to sort of the more than average sequential decline that you're referring to?

So when you look at our normal seasonality, and you've mentioned a percentage there that is really an average of several years, what we're saying is that we believe that the sequential decline this year is going to be higher than that. And it's a combination of the 2 factors, right? One is the timing of the launch and then the very high demand for iPhone during the March quarter. And the $3 billion to $4 billion supply constraints that we mentioned. Yes, and the constraints come from the semiconductor shortages that are affecting many, many industries, and it's a combination of the shortages as well as the very, very high level of demand that we are seeing for both iPad and Mac. For Mac, for example, if you just -- just to keep it into context, the last 3 quarters of Mac have been the best 3 quarters ever in the history of the product, right? So we are experiencing an incredible level of demand, which certainly is favored by working from home and learning from home environment, but also by the incredible amount of new products and innovation that we put into the products that we launched during the last couple of quarters.",208

The iPhone 12 of the -- the iPhone 12 family are or more broadly affect all iPhones, the iPhone 12 is the most popular.

We set a March quarter revenue record and grew strong double digits across each of the product categories. And so the revenue growth was broad. We've been especially pleased by the customer response in China to the iPhone 12 family. And as I had mentioned earlier, you have to remember that China entered the shutdown phase earlier in Q2 of last year than other countries. And so they were relatively more affected in that quarter, and that has to be taken into account as you look at the results.
As I mentioned earlier, we had the top 2 selling smartphones in urban China, so we're very proud of that. And iPad, Mac both had enormously positive quarters with great strength across the board. And we're seeing a strong reception to the new iPad Pro as well that we just announced. A lot of great comments. And about 2/3 of the people buying Mac and iPad were buying them for the first time.

That was very helpful, Tim. And then maybe as a follow-up, I kind of have like a big picture philosophical question, and to the extent you can answer this. One of the concerns many investors have is about the overhang of regulatory risk. I understand it's very hard to handicap that. But I'm kind of curious, do you think giving more public disclosure on your Services business like App Store would help alleviate some of those concerns? Or do you think that's revealing a lot of competitive details. But kind of curious to know what you think on services disclosure.",102

If we feel that more disclosure would help, we would obviously move in that direction. The App Store and other parts of Apple are not cast in concrete. And so we can move and are flexible with the times. For example, in the App Store, as you know, just a couple of quarters ago, we lowered the commission rate for small developers to 15%. So that was an example of moving with the times, and we've gotten a great, great reception to that. And so we continue to learn, and I think it's very important that we're very clear about why we do what we do. The idea behind curating the App Store in order to get the privacy and security that our customers want, I think is very important, and we have to convey that in a very straightforward manner.",173

But you mentioned through COVID that accessories do much better in a physical store environment, and that's been hard due to the shutdowns, obviously.

And we're in better shape for parts of Q2 than we were previously, but we're still operating with a limited operational model in many stores. And there's still some stores today that are closed. Like stores in Michigan and stores in France and so forth. And so I think it will take some amount of time, but my view would be as the stores get back up to speed, fully up to speed, we should be able to increase some of the accessory sales. Although I think we're doing fairly well at the moment. So it's not something that we're not doing well. Online has been much more beneficial and much more productive than we would have guessed going into this.",140

You're right. I mean we had great performance in Europe. We grew 56% during the quarter. And it was probably one of the geos where we actually saw results that were better than even our own expectations. We grew very strong double digits across the board, every product category. Particularly, I would say, iPad and Mac. They really was very, very strong. Again, obviously, Europe has been affected by lockdowns -- more than most parts of the world, the lockdowns have lasted longer than here in the United States, for example. Tim was mentioning there are places in Europe still today where our stores are closed. And fortunately, we have a very strong online business that has really helped us. But working from home, learning from home, limited entertainment options, that has all played in our favor.
Keep in mind that our Europe segment is a very broad version of Europe because it includes Western Europe, which has done very, very well. And then Eastern Europe and it goes into the Middle East. Even India is part of Europe. And those emerging markets have done incredibly well, significantly better than company average. So very, very pleased with some of the results in India, for example, Russia, Middle East in general. So it's been very broad, both across product categories and across countries in Europe.",229

We -- at the time we announced $350 billion of investment over the following 5 years. And during these 3 years, since then, we've overachieved on those commitments, and we felt it was the right time to update these type of investments. And they span from, obviously, the investment that we made directly at Apple. For example, we talked about the creation of 20,000 new jobs at Apple over the next 5 years in the United States. And of course, our business has grown. And so our commitment, for example, to U.S. suppliers grows over time, and that shows in the higher numbers. In the meantime, we've got into new businesses, for example, Apple TV+, a lot of the content that we developed for our TV service is produced here in the United States. And so that's additional investment here in the United States.
From an OpEx standpoint, I think as you've seen this year, we're getting a lot of leverage. This is one of those years we said many times, sometimes our OpEx grows faster than revenue, and there are some other cycles where the opposite happens. We are growing revenue this year much faster than our OpEx increase. But we want to continue to make all the necessary investments into the business. We will never underinvest in our business. And so you will continue to see the fact that we -- we will continue to grow our operating expenses, particularly on the R&D side, which continues to be the core of the company.",275

Good afternoon, everyone. Today, Apple is reporting a very strong quarter with double-digit revenue growth across our product and services categories and in every geographic segment.  
We set a new June quarter revenue record of $81.4 billion, up 36% from last year, and the vast majority of markets we track grew double digits, with especially strong growth in emerging markets, including India, Latin America and Vietnam. Total retail sales also set a June quarter record, and almost all of our retail stores have now opened their doors.  
This quarter saw a growing sense of optimism from consumers in the United States and around the world, driving renewed hope for a better future and for all that innovation can make possible. But as the last 18 months have demonstrated many times before, progress made is not progress guaranteed. An uneven recovery to the pandemic and a Delta variant surging in many countries around the world have shown us once again that the road to recovery will be a winding one.  
In the midst of that enduring adversity, we are especially humbled that our technology has continued to play a key role in keeping our customers connected. Just last month, it was great to be back with our teams and customers for the opening of our newest retail store in Los Angeles, Apple Tower Theatre. It was a hopeful reminder of the energy and sense of community shared spaces bring and how appreciative we all are now of the simple privilege of talking to one another face-to-face.  
As we look forward to more in-person interactions in the future, we're doubling down on innovation and doing all we can to help chart a course to a healthier and more equitable world. I'll have more to say about our work in those areas a bit later on. But first, let's turn to our product and services categories.  
For iPhone, this quarter saw very strong double-digit growth in each geographic segment, and we continue to be heartened by our customers' response to the iPhone 12 lineup. We're only in the early innings of 5G, but already its incredible performance and speed have made a significant impact on how people can get the most out of our technology.  
Customers love iPhone 12 for its superfast 5G speeds, A14 bionic chip and Adobe vision camera never seen before in a phone. Users continue to rely on iPad and Mac to work, learn, create and connect. iPad had its highest June quarter in nearly a decade, while Mac set an all-time June quarter record. We've seen a great response to the new iMac and iPad Pro, both powered by the M1 chip's exceptional speed and power efficient performance. The iMac's remarkable thin design and vibrant colors have made it a favorite for users everywhere. And the iPad continues to be an incredibly versatile tool in our users' toolbox, inspiring creativity and connection and keeping us entertained and productive in equal measure.  
It was another very strong quarter for Wearables, Home and Accessories, which set a new June quarter record while helping people find more ways to stay entertained, healthy and connected at home and on the go. Apple Watch remains a go-to choice for users to stay on top of their health and reach their fitness goals. And our newest accessory AirTag began shipping to an enthusiastic response from customers, making the Find My network more useful than ever, while protecting user privacy.  
Turning to Services, which set a new all-time revenue record as we continue to roll out innovative new features and programming. We're proud to be the recipients of 35 Emmy nominations this year, which speaks to the quality of our programming and an enthusiastic reception from customers and critics alike. Apple TV+ users are loving series like Mythic Quest and anticipating groundbreaking films like CODA, which premieres next month. And of course, Ted Lasso kicked off season 2 just last week and continues to win over viewers with its heartwarming message about the power of community, compassion and hope.  
We also introduced Apple Podcasts subscriptions, a global marketplace for users to discover exclusive content and support their favorite creators. And we launched spatial audio for Apple Music, a cinematic listening experience that promises to change how music fans listen and musicians create even more immersive, layered and beautiful songs.  
Last month, we shared many exciting new features at WWDC, but more powerful than any of them was the incredible showing of developers from all walks of life and around the world. The new tools we announced will help developers harness cutting-edge technologies like augmented reality, reach new users and customize their experience on the App Store, are learned to update or invent an app with Swift, Apple's powerful and intuitive programming language.  Today's investments in education and coding translate to tomorrow's small businesses and groundbreaking new apps, the next app -- the next act of an app economy already creating jobs and opportunity around the world.  
In June, a new study by the Analysis Group found that it was another record year for App Store developers whose combined billings and sales increased by 24% to $643 billion in 2020. The app economy continues to be an incredible engine of prosperity and opportunity fueled by the ceaseless striving of developers to make apps that enrich people's lives.  
Much like the developer community, we are diehard optimist about technology's potential to help people live happier, healthier and more fulfilled lives, goals that shine through with powerful new updates coming to iOS, iPadOS, macOS and watchOS this fall. That begins with innovative new features that help users stay connected with one another, like SharePlay and spatial audio for FaceTime or disconnect when they need a break, like Focus, which limits distracting notifications when you're winding down for bed or concentrating at work. And new productivity features make iPad an even more useful tool for multitasking, helping users navigate across apps, split their screen or use Quick Note to capture a thought the moment inspiration strives.  
In the health space, our new health sharing feature will make it easier than ever to securely share your health data with loved ones. That includes new capabilities like walking steadiness, which uses sensors to assess user stability doing everyday task and recommends exercises to improve stability and avoid a fall.  
In the belief that privacy is a fundamental human right, we shared new features in iOS 15 that continue to drive our progress forward from mail privacy protection, which stops invisible pixels and an e-mail from tracking your mail activity, to app privacy report, which helps users check on the apps they've granted permission to use their personal data.  
We also introduced some incredible next-generation technologies coming to the accessibility space, from assistive touch, which helps people with limb differences navigate Apple Watch to new voiceover capabilities to help blind and low-vision users. Accessibility remains a bedrock principle for us in the simple belief that the best technology for the world should be the best technology for everyone.  But the responsibility to be a force for good in the lives of others extends beyond the technology we make, so to the teachers and students shaping our future.  
This quarter, as part of our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, we awarded innovation grants to engineering schools at 4 historically black colleges and universities to expand their coursework, scholarships and internship opportunities in hardware engineering and silicon chip design. We see education as a great equalizing force, and we're more dedicated than ever to supporting the educators, advocates and students lighting the path and leading the way. That includes the 350 Swift Student Challenge winners we recognized at this year's WWDC. 
If you ever need a dose of hope or inspiration, I can't say enough about our student scholarship winners whose apt bring so much good into the world, from teaching other young people to code to helping volunteers deliver groceries to people at high risk of COVID-19. Young people's innovations remind us that our collective future is bound up in the next generation's passion for solving global challenges and of the responsibility we have to join them in building a better world.  
Turning to our own backyard, we're continuing to press forward in our efforts to help bring more affordable housing to the Bay Area and across California. This month, we shared that we've contributed more than $1 billion to help first-time homeowners and construct thousands of new affordable housing units across the state. And we're continuing to stay focused on supporting the global response to the pandemic and delivering the best products and services for people.  
Our greatest source of inspiration isn't technology itself but how people use it in their own lives in ways great and small: to write a novel or to read one; to care for an ailing patient or see a doctor virtually; to track their heart rate on a jog or to train for the Olympics. Every day, I'm grateful for the dedication of our teams to the simple mission of creating technology that improves people's lives. And I want to thank everyone at Apple for the purpose and passion they bring to that mission.  
With that, I'll hand it over to Luca for a deeper dive on our performance this quarter.",1557
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3697.0,2352171.0,89905389.0,Presenter Speech,Luca Maestri,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report record June quarter financial results, which reflect the importance of our products and services in our customers' lives and our strong underlying operating performance. Our revenue reached a June quarter record of $81.4 billion, an increase of nearly $22 billion or 36% from a year ago. We grew double digits in each of our product categories with an all-time record for Services and June quarter records for iPhone, Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories. We also set new June quarter records in every geographic segment with very strong double-digit growth in each one of them.  
Products revenue was a June quarter record of $63.9 billion, up 37% over a year ago. This level of sales performance, combined with the unmatched loyalty of our customers, drove our installed base of active devices to a new all-time record. Our Services set an all-time revenue record of $17.5 billion, up 33% over a year ago with June quarter records in each geographic segment.  
Company gross margin was 43.3%, up 80 basis points from last quarter, driven by cost savings and a higher mix of services, partially offset by seasonal loss of leverage. Products gross margin was 36%, down 10 basis points sequentially, as seasonal loss of leverage was almost entirely offset by cost savings. Services gross margin was 69.8%, down 30 basis points sequentially, mainly due to a different mix.  
Net income of $21.7 billion, diluted earnings per share of $1.30 and operating cash flow of $21.1 billion were all June quarter records by a wide margin. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories.  
iPhone revenue set a June quarter record of $39.6 billion, growing 50% year-over-year and exceeding our own expectations as the iPhone 12 family continue to be in very high demand. Performance was consistently strong across the world, and we grew very strong double digits in each geographic segment, setting June quarter records in most markets we track. Our active installed base of iPhones reached a new all-time high thanks to the exceptional loyalty of our customer base and the strength of our ecosystem. In the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 97% for the iPhone 12 family.  
Turning to Services. As I mentioned, we reached an all-time revenue record of $17.5 billion with all-time records for cloud services, music, video, advertising and payment services and June quarter records for the App Store and AppleCare. Our newer service offerings, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ as well as the Apple One bundle, continue to scale across users, content and features and are contributing to overall services growth.  
The key drivers for our Services business all continue to move in the right direction. First, our installed base of devices reached an all-time high across each geographic segment. Second, the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the June quarter in each geographic segment, and paid accounts increased double digits. Third, paid subscriptions continue to show strong growth. We now have more than 700 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, which is up more than 150 million from last year and nearly 4x the number of paid subscriptions we had only 4 years ago. 
And finally, we're adding new services that we think our customers will love while also continuing to improve the breadth and quality of our current services offerings. For example, during WWDC in June, we previewed our new iCloud+ and Apple Wallet features, which we believe will create a more secure and differentiated customer experience.  
Wearables, Home and Accessories grew 36% year-over-year to $8.8 billion, setting new June quarter revenue records in every geographic segment. We continue to improve and expand our product offerings in this category. This quarter, we began shipping our new Apple TV 4K with a redesigned Siri Remote and our brand-new AirTags, and the customer response to both products has been very strong.  
In addition to its outstanding sales performance globally, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with nearly 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product.  For Mac, despite supply constraints, we set a June quarter record of $8.2 billion, up 16% over last year, with June quarter revenue records in most markets we track around the world. It is remarkable that the last 4 quarters for Mac have been its best 4 quarters ever. This exceptional level of sales success has been driven by the very enthusiastic customer response to our new Macs powered by the M1 chip, which we most recently brought to our newly redesigned iMac.  
iPad performance was also strong with revenue of $7.4 billion, up 12% in spite of significant supply constraints. During the quarter, we also starting shipping our new iPad Pro powered by the M1 chip, and customer response has been outstanding. Both iPad and Mac have taken computing to the next level, and when you combine their performance over the last 12 months, they are now the size of a Fortune 50 business thanks to the best product lineups we've ever had, very high levels of customer satisfaction and a loyal growing installed base. In fact, around half of the customers purchasing Mac and iPad   during the quarter were new to that product, and in most recent surveys of U.S. consumers from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 92% for Mac and 95% for iPad.  
In Enterprise, our customers are excited about the superior performance, battery life and security that the new M1 Macs bring. MassMutual, for example, is offering M1 MacBook Pro to all of its employees and equipping all conference rooms with M1 Mac Minis in preparation for return to work. And with its incredible performance and affordable entry price, the MacBook Air with M1 is gaining rapid adoption among many leading enterprise organizations.  
Italgas, Italy's largest natural gas company, which will soon be using its extensive network to distribute renewable gases, is replacing every employee's Windows laptop with the new MacBook Air powered by Apple's M1 chip to bring the latest technology to its workforce. And Grab, Southeast Asia's leading super app that provides transportation, food delivery and digital payment services, is adding M1 MacBook Air to its company-wide M1 Mac deployment.  
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $194 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We retired $3 billion of term debt and increased commercial paper by $3 billion, leaving us with total debt of $122 billion. As a result, net cash was $72 billion at the end of the quarter.  
As our business continued to perform at a very high level, we are also able to return $29 billion to shareholders during the June quarter. This included $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $17.5 billion through open market repurchases of 136 million Apple shares. We also began a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in May, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 32 million shares.  
As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance, but we are sharing some directional insights assuming that the COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. 
We expect very strong double-digit year-over-year revenue growth during the September quarter. We expect revenue growth to be lower than our June quarter year-over-year growth of 36% for 3 reasons. First, we expect the foreign exchange impact on our year-over-year growth rate to be 3 points less favorable than it was during the June quarter. Second, we expect our services growth rate to return to a more typical level. The growth rate during the June quarter benefited from a favorable compare as certain services were significantly impacted by the COVID lockdowns a year ago. And third, we expect supply constraints during the September quarter to be greater than what we experienced during the June quarter. The constraints will primarily impact iPhone and iPad. 
We expect gross margin to be between 41.5% and 42.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $11.3 billion and $11.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around 0, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share of common stock payable on August 12, 2021, to shareholders of record as of August 9, 2021. 
With that, let's open the call to questions.",1478

Just to dig into the commentary on guidance a little bit. Just starting with the fact that last year, obviously, there was a later launch of iPhone than we've typically seen in other years. Could you talk us through that and perhaps some of the other products, what may be different as compared to last year?",57
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3697.0,2352171.0,89905393.0,Answer,Luca Maestri,,Executives,7,"Well, as I explained, there are -- first of all, we are expecting to grow very strong double digits. That's, I think, Chris, the starting point here. We expect this very strong level of growth that we've experienced during the course of the year to continue into the September quarter. 
We said that the growth rate is going to be below 36%, and I've listed 3 factors. The first factor is that the dollar continues to be favorable on a year-over-year basis in the sense that it's weakened against most currencies on a year-over-year basis, but that benefit is going to be about 3 points less in the September quarter than what we've experienced during the June quarter because the dollar strengthened against most currencies in recent weeks. 
Second, I mentioned that the services growth rate that we've experienced in the June quarter, 33%, that's significantly higher than what we've had in recent history. And that was due to the fact that there were a couple of services categories, namely our advertising business and AppleCare that were significantly impacted a year ago because of the COVID lockdowns and therefore, they had a relatively easy compare in the June quarter. And so we don't expect that to continue into the September quarter. And so we expect still significant growth in Services, but not to the level that we've seen in June. 
And then I mentioned that the supply constraints that we've seen in the June quarter will be higher during the September quarter. Back in -- when we talked here 3 months ago, we said that we were expecting supply constraints for the June quarter between $3 billion and $4 billion to affect primarily iPad and Mac. We were able to mitigate some of those constraints during the June quarter. 
And so we came in at a number that was slightly below the low end of that range that we had quoted at the beginning of the quarter, but we expect that number to be higher for the September quarter. 
And so when you put all that together, again, very strong double-digit growth for September, with these caveats that I just mentioned.",361

And then in conjunction with that, what additional costs are you absorbing because of these supply constraints? Is that having an effect on gross margins or just product cost in general as you perhaps pay a little more to get more supply?",78

In terms of the cost, we're paying more for freight than I would like to pay, but component costs continue in the aggregate to decline.

We had a particularly strong response to the 12 Pro and the 12 Pro Max. Those results were particularly strong. 
And if -- but if you look at the balance of our products, we also set June quarter records for Wearables, Home and Accessories for Mac and for Services. So it was sort of an across-the-board strength. And we're seeing plenty of new customers come to the market. For example, Mac and iPad, about 2/3 of the customers who bought in the last quarter were new to that product. For the Apple Watch, that number was 85%. And so we could not be happier with the results.",143

I guess, first off, Luca, I was hoping you could maybe talk a little bit more about the gross margins and maybe the expectations you laid out for September. I think sequentially, it implies it's down 100 basis points or so. So maybe just touch on what are the puts and takes there would be helpful because I think historically, September tends to be a flattish, maybe even up a little bit gross margin number for you folks.",83

I think it's important to go back to the Q3 results, right? It's 43.3%. And one of the things that I mentioned is that in addition to getting really good cost savings on a sequential basis, we also had a very high mix of services as part of the total, and particularly, with advertising doing really, really well because of the rebound that we saw from the COVID lockdowns a year ago. 
And so as we move forward sequentially, we do expect a different mix, and so that drives the guidance that we provided, which, again, as you know, it's significantly higher than just a year ago. For example, a year ago, we were at 38.2%, so almost 400 basis points of expansion on a year-over-year basis, right? And so I think it's important to take that into account, just a different mix.",144

I don't think anyone expected gross margins to be north of 40% just quickly for you, folks. So that is impressive. 
If I could follow up on Services, and I know you called out the 33% growth this quarter as a bit of an aberration. The compares were easier. But as you look at your services growth rate over the last 4 quarters, let's just say, what do you think is enabling this growth? Is it you're able to have a higher ARPU more monetization of your installed base? Or is your installed base growing? I'm curious, which one is bigger? And then over time, how do you think those 2 components stack up for you?",120

Obviously, the fact that our installed base continues to grow and it sets new all-time highs all the time obviously gives us a larger opportunity all the time. And second, we have more and more people that are engaged in our ecosystem, both transacting for free, which is a very large number, and people that are willing to pay for some of the services, and that percentage of people that are paying for our services continues to grow nicely. I mentioned it grew double digits again this quarter. So that obviously helps on the revenue side. 
And of course, we continue to increase both the quality and the quantity of the services. As you know, during the last few years, we've launched a lot of new services from Apple TV+ to Fitness+, Apple Arcade, News+ and so -- and of course, the Apple Card. And so these are businesses that we are scaling right now. And so all that additional revenue helps, and I think it flows through our growth rates. As you said, during the last 4 quarters, we are well into the mid-20s, right? So I think it's obviously very nice for us to see.",205

So first question, there's a debate in the market around how much Apple benefited from the pandemic, given increased spend in areas like Mac and App Store. But of course, you've mentioned over the past several quarters that there are other areas that were limited by the pandemic and store closures and less foot traffic. When you net out all the puts and takes, was your business helped? Or was it hindered by the pandemic?",77
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3697.0,2352171.0,89905417.0,Answer,Luca Maestri,,Executives,31,"Well, of course, Katy, we don't have the crystal ball that tells us exactly what these different variables, how they impacted our business. We do know that on -- I would say, on the positive side of the ledger, obviously, especially during the periods of extreme lockdowns, digital services did very well because entertainment options were limited. And so obviously, our digital services did really, really well. 
Obviously, with more people working from home, more people studying from home, we know that iPad and Mac demand was very, very strong. 
On the other side, we had certain services like advertising because of the reduced economic activity, AppleCare because our stores were closed, that were affected negatively, and certain products like the iPhone or the Watch. So there are maybe more complex types of sales because of the complexity of the transaction. They were also affected because so many points of sale were closed all around the world, not only our stores but also our partner stores, right? So we had that dynamic during -- throughout COVID. 
And now some of these businesses are rebounding. I mentioned advertising and AppleCare. iPad and Mac, it's difficult for us to gauge because we've been constrained for quite a long period of time. And the reality is that maybe the new normal after we exit COVID may be different from the past. 
For example, maybe there's going to be hybrid models around work, for example. And so it's difficult to tell you on a net basis what that is, clearly -- and this is very fluid because it tends to change over time. I can certainly tell you that we're all looking forward to a COVID-free world. I think that would be very good for us and for the entire -- I mean for our customers as well.",304

If you look historically after a really strong product cycle, which you've experienced this year with iPhone 12, iPhone revenues come under pressure because the upgrade rate slows, the mix often shifts to the lower end of the portfolio. Is it fair to assume a similar trend will play out over the next year? Or if not, what do you think is different this time?",73

We're not predicting the next cycle, but I would point out a few things. One is we have a very large and growing installed base. As you know, the iPhones passed 1 billion active devices earlier this year. Two, we have loyal and satisfied customers. The customer set that we're seeing on the new iPhones are -- is just amazing. It's jaw-dropping. 
And the geographic response is pervasive across the world. And in the U.S., we had the top 3 selling models. In the U.K., we have 4 out of the top 5. In Australia, we have the top 2. In Japan, we have the top 3. In Urban China, we have the top 2. And so the response from customers all around have been great. Obviously, the product itself is amazing. The 12 lineup was a huge leap that introduced 5G and had A14 Bionic and a number of other fantastic features that customers love. 
The next thing I think to consider is that we're in the very early innings of 5G. If you look at 5G penetration around the world, there's only a couple of countries that are in the double-digits yet. And so that's an amazing thing 9 months or so into this. And the last thing is we're going to continue to deliver great products. We're going to continue to do what we do best is integrate hardware, software and services together into an amazing experience. And so those are the things that I would consider if I were coming up with forecast.",260

Fantastic execution. It's resulted in consistency for your results. Tim, this is actually perfect timing for this question. You talked about your installed base of 1-billion-odd units. I was curious if you could help us understand how old that installed base is. And the reason that I'm asking this question is we're clearly seeing people upgrade to 5G phones. And if that's the case and that continues, that could be a larger force than most other forces for your revenues to continue to grow as people migrate to the 5G family of phones. So I was curious if you could shed light on how the upgrades are happening and then also how old that base is.",121

What I would tell you is it's -- first of all, it's difficult to answer your question precisely. But what I would tell you is on both switchers and upgraders, we did extremely well in Q3. Both were up strong double digits. And the geographic representation of iPhone year-over-year comps were -- looks extremely well. And so we're really pleased with it. 
I would remind you that the 1 billion number that I quoted also was iPhone, where we quoted a number earlier in the year in the January call, I believe, of 1.65 billion devices is the total active devices just for clarification. And so the net is very strong switchers, very strong upgraders, best upgrade quarter for June -- for the June quarter that we've seen. And we feel really great about the momentum. But at the same time, we recognize that the 5G penetration is quite low around the world and very, very low. We're at the front end of this.",165

For my follow-up, Apple is probably one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world. How do you -- how does Apple determine what's strategic and something that Apple wants to make itself versus nonstrategic? And also, I was curious, there's a lot of -- well, it's public news now that Arm is getting acquired by NVIDIA, and I was curious how Apple views that. Is that something that's beneficial to Apple or not meaningful or negative?",79

And in terms of us and how we decide to make silicon, we ask ourselves if we can do something better, if we can deliver a better product, if we can buy something in the market and it's great and it's as good as what we could do, we're going to buy it. We'll only enter where we believe we have an ability to do something better and therefore, make a better product for the user. 
And so the M1 is a great example of that. We have the ability within our silicon team to deliver a product that we feel is appreciably better than we could buy. And so we've taken our great hardware and software expertise and combine those and have brought the M1 out. And the response to the M1 has been unbelievable. It's powering Mac sales that are constrained. It's powering now iPad, which also has constraints on it. And so that's how we look at whether we should enter a market or not.",194

Of course, there's always a bit of variability around results, right? But certainly, we haven't done 33% in years. And so that was a bit of an anomaly.

We do have some shortages. In addition to that, where the demand has been so great and so beyond our own expectation that it's difficult to get the entire set of parts within the lead times that we try to get those. And so it's a little bit of that as well.

The legacy nodes are where the supply constraints have been on silicon.",128

So based on the data and the comments about upgraders and switchers being strong as well as emerging markets were relatively strong in the quarter, what does that specific set of data point strength mean for the iPhone portfolio? And I guess my question around that is, when you think about switchers and price points, I think last year you launched the SE too to really address maybe some of the lower price point markets like the emerging markets. So does that mean, thinking about the portfolio going forward, there is less of a need for a lower price product going forward? And that the current portfolio and the new cycle going forward would be more high end in nature as we currently have today? And then I have a follow-up.",138

I could go on and name a few more. It's a very long list. And so we're -- those results are for the entire line of products that we have. 
And keep in mind, we still do have SE in the line. We launched it a year ago, but it's still in the line today, and it's sort of our entry price point. And so I'm pleased with how all of them are doing. And I think we need sort of that range of price points to accommodate the types of people that we want to accommodate. And so we've put something for the entry buyer who really wants to get into an iPhone and then something for the pro buyer who wants the very best iPhone that they can buy.

And so I'm very pleased with what we're seeing on Apple One right now, and think it's a great ramp for the future of services. And more importantly, it's a great customer benefit because many of our customers like to try out more than one of these services, and it allows them to do that with one easy bundle and subscription service. 
In terms of IDFA or the advertising in general, I take it your question is about ATT.

Can you maybe talk about whether these are tactical in nature or more structural like vertical integration that will continue to drive benefits to product gross margins? 
And on Services side, you noted several times about the strength in ad growth, which is obviously very high-margin contributor, but the sequential trajectory on Services margins was flat. So what were some of the offsets there? And then I have a follow-up for Tim.",101

On the product side, I talked about cost savings. Tim mentioned that maybe on the freight side, we're seeing some level of cost pressure that is a bit out of the norm at this point in the cycle. For everything else for all the major commodities and components, we continue to see a very typical cycle where we are getting good cost savings on a sequential basis. And so far, it's been very good, as you can tell from the absolute level of gross margins because on the product side, we are up more than 600 basis points on a year-over-year basis. So it feels something that we've been able to accomplish and we're able to maintain, at least in the near term. Nothing that was abnormal during the quarter or a one-off in nature. It was pretty structural. 
On the Services side, again, up a lot on a year-over-year basis. So the baseline has gone up a lot. The sequential decline, as you said, it was very, very small. And as I mentioned several times in the past, we have a very large services portfolio with very different margin profiles in our services. And so even a slight change in mix can drive some sequential differences, and this was the case this quarter, just a different mix. I mentioned, for example, that AppleCare has rebounded. 
And so those -- the relative success of our Services in the marketplace can drive some slight changes in gross margins. Again, step back for a second, 69.8% gross margin. We're very, very, very happy with where we are with the Services margin trajectory.",271

And Tim, there is increasing regulatory focus in China, in particular, on some of the Chinese companies. It's not a direct impact of Apple, but how should investors handicap the indirect impact given some of these companies are pretty large contributors to Apple's App Store revenues? 
And also, is there -- are you seeing any impact at all from these? And is the limiting of the usage of some of these apps influencing how people are either interacting with your devices? Or is there any other ancillary impact that you're seeing?",92

So it was a strong quarter, and embedded in that was a quarterly record for Services, which includes the App Store. And so we're seeing strength in China. The economy has really bounced back there fairly quickly from COVID. 
In terms of the regulatory focus, what we are focusing on from our angle is to serve users there and to make sure that they're very satisfied with the products and the services that we're showing. And we all -- we work with a lot of different companies to ensure that. And so that's our focus.",106

A year ago, I spoke to you about the atmosphere of uncertainty in which we were living and the way it had come to define our daily experience, both as people and as a company. Today, much has changed, profoundly so. And while we are still living through unprecedented times, we are encouraged by progress around the world. I'm grateful to our teams who have stayed resolutely focused on our customers and the pursuit of innovation on their behalf. We've aimed to help our customers navigate the world as it is while empowering them to create the world as it can be. Whether it's public health workers managing vaccination campaigns on iPhone or students returning to classrooms full of iPads or family staying connected over FaceTime, it is an honor to know that what we make matters and to see that reflected in the world and in our performance.  
This fiscal year, we reported $366 billion of revenue, which represents 33% annual growth. We also achieved more than 20% growth across all of our product categories and in every geographic segment. And today, Apple is reporting another very strong quarter. Demand was very robust, and we set a new September quarter record of $83.4 billion, up 29% from last year and in line with what we discussed on our last call despite larger-than-expected supply constraints.  
We estimate these constraints had around a $6 billion revenue dollar impact, driven primarily by industry-wide silicon shortages and COVID-related manufacturing disruptions. Even so, we set an all-time record for Mac and quarterly records for iPhone, iPad, Wearables, Home and Accessories, representing 30% year-over-year growth in products.  Our Services business performed better than we expected, where we hit an all-time record of $18.3 billion and grew 26% year-over-year.  
And we set quarterly records in every geographic segment with strong double-digit growth across the board. During fiscal 2021, we earned nearly 1/3 of our revenue from emerging markets and doubled our business in India and Vietnam. We are optimistic about the future, especially as we see strong demand for our new products. At the end of the September quarter, we introduced our iPhone 13 lineup as well as the Apple Watch Series 7, iPad and iPad mini, all of which represent significant advances. The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini, alongside the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max, are setting a new standard with their superfast performance, advanced camera systems, longer battery life and brilliant Super Retina displays.  
Customers are loving the ninth generation iPad, which features a beautifully sharp display and twice the storage of the previous generation as well as the new iPad mini, with its ultra portable design and impressive speed and performance. And we've been thrilled with the reviews that Apple Watch Series 7 has earned for its larger display, faster charging and refined design. And just last week, we introduced the completely reimagined MacBook Pro, powered by the extraordinary M1 PRO and M1 Max chips. These are our most powerful notebooks ever with game-changing performance and battery life and the world's best notebook display. We think customers are going to love MacBook Pro, whether they're editing video in Final Cut Pro or making music in Logic Pro and so much more. They'll be able to do things never before possible on a notebook.  
We also announced our all-new AirPods that feature spatial audio and industry-leading sound, longer battery life and an all-new design. For the home, we added 3 new colors to our HomePod mini lineup, which offers seamless integration across Apple's products and services. We also announced a new subscription tier to Apple Music called Apple Music Voice, which offers subscribers access to the Services catalog of 90 million songs, all through the power of Siri.  
Across the board, teams at Apple continue to drive unmatched innovation through the seamlessly integrated hardware, software experience we've long prided ourselves on. iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 have created more ways than ever to stay productive, whether choosing Focus to avoid distractions or Quick Note to capture a thought. macOS Monterey offers new ways to connect with friends and family, get more done and work fluidly across Apple devices. And watchOS 8 has made Apple Watch even more powerful and more ways than ever to stay active and to track your health on the go.  
We've never had a more diverse range of Services for our customers to choose from, and we've been very encouraged by our performance, which reflects growing customer enthusiasm and satisfaction. In just its first 2 years, Apple TV+ has already proved itself to fans around the world. And I want to congratulate the incredible actors, writers, storytellers, producers and everyone else whose behind-the-scenes work has made that success possible.  
This quarter, Apple TV+ won 11 Emmy's, including the Award for Outstanding Comedy Series for Ted Lasso. That show has continued to bring light and laughter to fans all over the world with its boundless optimism and beloved cast of characters. We couldn't be more proud of our entire lineup of content from the gripping second seasons of The Morning Show and Truth Be Told to our newest programs, Swagger, which is out tomorrow. The response has been incredible.  
This quarter also saw major updates to Fitness+, including the addition of new activities like meditation and Pilates and the announcement of group workouts, a feature that brings fitness and friends together. We also shared that Fitness+ will soon be available in 15 new countries, bringing workouts for every age and skill level to millions more people around the world.  
And those are just 2 of the Services our customers are loving. This quarter, Apple Card won a J.D. Power award for customer satisfaction in its very first year of eligibility. The App Store continues to help people find the apps they depend on to stay productive, creative and entertained. And on Apple News, we launched a news partner program that expands Apple's support for journalism while creating an even better business opportunity for publishers.  
And we continue to support our customers around the world. We're glad to report we've opened several new Apple Stores. This quarter, we opened a beautiful store in Changsha, which is our first store in the Hunan province of China. We also just opened our third store in Istanbul. And we recently added a store in the Bronx, which means we are now in all 5 boroughs in New York City. All of our stores are now open worldwide and have been for 7 weeks. As we enter our busiest time of year, I particularly want to share my gratitude for our retail teams. Customers have never relied on our products more, and our retail teams have truly answered the call. We meet our customers where they are with many ways to shop through our online and retail stores and can help them choose the best product for them and get it up and running.  
We are also excited about our education initiatives. This month, we introduced the Everyone Can Code Early Learners program, offering free resources, which helps students and elementary school learn coding. We see education not only as a fundamental good in its own right but is a great equalizing force. A world where all people can access a quality education isn't just a smarter world. It's a more equitable one.  
That desire to create a more just and equitable world is the guiding principle behind our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative. This quarter, Apple shared plans to expand our $100 million investment by an additional $30 million. Those funds will be used in a number of ways, including the creation of a new global Hispanic-serving institution equity and innovation hub. The hub will dramatically expand the technology and resources for students in the STEM fields. Those programs join our ever-expanding work with historically black colleges and universities, including the now 45 community coding centers and regional hubs, serving underrepresented communities across the United States.  
This month, we were also happy to welcome the inaugural class of developers and entrepreneurs to the Apple Developer Academy in Detroit. The Academy is Apple's first in the United States and is designed to help prepare students for jobs in the thriving iOS app economy, which supports more than 2.1 million jobs across all 50 states. In August, we shared our impact accelerators first cohort of black, Latinx and indigenous-owned businesses whose pioneering work in green technology and clean energy serves many of the communities most impacted by climate change.  
More broadly, we are already carbon neutral as a company. And this quarter, we made new strides towards reaching our goal of carbon neutrality across our entire supply chain and the life cycle of our devices by 2030. We've made significant product advances in this area. iPad and iPad Mini now come with 100% recycled aluminum enclosure. The antenna on iPhone 13 is made up of upcycled plastic water bottles, which marks an industry-first. And as our customers are seeing when they purchase iPhone 13, we've redesigned the packaging to eliminate the outer plastic wrap, which will allow us to avoid using 600 metric tons of plastic. This brings us closer to removing all plastic in our packaging by 2025.  
We've also made good progress toward our goal to 1 day make our products without taking anything from the earth. With Apple Watch Series 7, for example, 99% of the rare earth elements we use are recycled.  Ahead of COP26, I'm also pleased to report that we have more than doubled the number of our suppliers who have committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. We're very encouraged to see the growth in this area, and we will continue to drive those changes in the supply chain in the months and years to come.  
We've never viewed our environmental work as a side project. Teams across Apple are pushing this work forward in the same spirit of innovation we bring to our products and services. We are determined to be a ripple in the pond that drives a far greater change. From the pandemic to climate change to inequity and injustice, global challenges won't abide solitary solutions, and we feel a deep sense of responsibility to help.  
We are incredibly proud of the product lineup we have going into the holiday season, and we are encouraged by the customer response we've seen. And while we cannot know exactly which path the pandemic will take the world down in the months to come, we feel quite confident that this new year will be driven by the values that guide us and by the innovation that defines us.  
With that, I'll hand it over to Luca for a deeper dive on our performance this quarter. Luca?",1812

Good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report very strong financial results for the September quarter, capping a record-setting fiscal year 2021. We set a September quarter revenue record of $83.4 billion, an increase of nearly $19 billion or 29% from a year ago despite larger-than-expected supply constraints.  
We also reached new Q4 records in every geographic segment with strong double-digit growth in each one of them. And it was a record September quarter for both products and services. On the products side, revenue was $65.1 billion, up 30% over a year ago as we experienced better-than-expected demand for our products despite supply constraints that we estimated at around $6 billion.  
We grew in each of our product categories with an all-time record for Mac and September quarter records for iPhone, for iPad and for Wearables, Home and Accessories. This level of sales performance, combined with the unmatched loyalty of our customers and the strength of our ecosystem, drove our installed base of active devices to a new all-time record.  
Our Services set an all-time revenue record of $18.3 billion, up 26% over a year ago, with September quarter records in every geographic segment and in every Services category.  
Company gross margin was 42.2%, down 110 basis points from last quarter due to higher costs and a different mix of products, partially offset by leverage. Products gross margin was 34.3%, down 170 basis points sequentially as higher cost structures were partially offset by leverage and mix. Services gross margin was 70.5%, up 70 basis points sequentially, mainly due to a different mix.  
Net income of $20.6 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.24, both grew over 60% year-over-year and were September quarter records.  
Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue grew 47% year-over-year and set a September quarter record of $38.9 billion despite supply constraints as customer demand was very strong. The iPhone 12 family continued to perform very well, and we are seeing enthusiastic customer response to the launch of our iPhone 13 family.  
We also grew double digits in each geographic segment, setting September quarter records in both developed and emerging markets. The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone, and our active installed base of iPhones reached a new all-time high.  
For Mac, we set an all-time revenue record of $9.2 billion despite supply constraints, driven by strong demand for our M1-powered MacBook Air. In fact, our last 5 quarters for Mac have been the best 5 quarters ever for the category. iPad performance was also strong with a September quarter revenue record of $8.3 billion, up 21%, in spite of significant supply constraints as customer demand for the iPad Pro, also powered by M1, was very strong.  
For both Mac and iPad, we continue to see a combination of high levels of customer satisfaction and first-time buyers. Around half of the customers purchasing Mac and iPad during the quarter were new to that product. And in the most recent survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 97% for both Mac and iPad.  
Our continued investment in iPad and Mac is taking computing to the next level. We have redesigned and reengineered both products to provide customers an unmatched experience, which resulted in record fiscal years for both categories. We are carrying this momentum also in the enterprise market. For example, SAP has already deployed Macs to tens of thousands of their employees to date. Following the launch of our new M1 MacBook Pro last week, SAP is planning to add it to the growing list of M1 Mac offerings available to their global workforce.  
Another example is France's national railway company, SNCF, which equips all train drivers with iPads to manage their entire daily workflow and train operations, helping to lower energy and maintenance costs. In fact, the iPads have been so well received that 90% of the drivers choose to purchase them for personal use at the end of the corporate device refresh cycle.  
Next, Wearables, Home and Accessories set a new September quarter record of $8.8 billion. We continue to improve and expand our product offerings in this category, which we believe improve the overall customer experience and showcase the integration between our products and services. Apple Watch, AirPods and HomePod mini are powerful devices in their own right, but paired with our other products, software and services, they create unique experiences, like switching audio seamlessly between devices on your AirPods.  
Turning to Services. As I mentioned, we reached an all-time revenue record of $18.3 billion with all-time records for cloud services, music, video, advertising, AppleCare and payment services and a September quarter record for the App Store. Our continued investment and strong execution in Services has helped us deliver a record $68 billion in revenue during fiscal 2021, nearly tripling this category in 6 years. These impressive results reflect the positive momentum we are seeing on many fronts.  
First, our installed base continues to grow and reached an all-time high across each geographic segment. Next, we continue to see increased customer engagement with our services. The number of paid accounts on our digital content stores grew double digits and reached a new all-time high during the September quarter in each geographic segment. Also, paid subscriptions continued to show very strong growth. We now have more than 745 million paid subscriptions across the Services on our platform, which is up more than 160 million from last year and nearly 5x the number of paid subscriptions we had less than 5 years ago. And finally, as Tim mentioned earlier, we're adding new services that we think our customers will love. And we continue to improve the breadth and quality of our current services offerings. 
Fiscal '21 was not only a big year for Services but for our entire company. During the past 12 months, we grew our business by 33% or $91 billion, reaching nearly $366 billion of revenue with record level performance across the board. Every product category and every geographic segment set a new annual revenue record and was up at least 20% over -- of fiscal 2020. 
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $191 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We issued $6.5 billion of new term debt, retired $1.3 billion of term debt and decreased commercial paper by $2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $125 billion. As a result, net cash was $66 billion at the end of the quarter as we continue to make progress towards our goal of net cash neutral over time. 
As our business continues to generate very strong cash flow, we were also able to return $24 billion to shareholders during the September quarter. This included $3.6 billion in dividends and equivalents and $20 billion through open market repurchases of 137 million Apple shares. We also retired an additional 5 million shares in the final settlement of our 17th ASR. 
As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance but we are sharing some directional insights based on the assumption that the COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. 
As we mentioned earlier, during the September quarter, supply constraints impacted our revenue by around $6 billion. We estimate the impact from supply constraints will be larger during the December quarter. Despite this challenge, we are seeing high demand for our products and expect to achieve very solid year-over-year revenue growth and to set a new revenue record during the December quarter. 
We expect revenue for each product category to grow on a year-over-year basis, except for iPad, which we expect to decline year-over-year due to supply constraints. For Services, we expect our growth rate to decelerate from the September quarter but to remain strong. We expect gross margin to be between 41.5% and 42.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $12.4 billion and $12.6 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share of common stock payable on November 11, 2021, to shareholders of record as of November 8, 2021. 
With that, let's open the call to questions.",1448

If you look at Q4 for a moment, we had about $6 billion in supply constraints, and it affected the iPhone, the iPad and the Mac. We had -- there were 2 causes of them for Q4. One was the chip shortages that you've heard a lot about from many different companies through the industry. And the second was COVID-related manufacturing disruptions in Southeast Asia. The second of those, the COVID disruptions, have improved materially across October to where we currently are. 
And so for this quarter, we think that the primary cause of supply-chain-related shortages will be the chip shortage. It will affect -- it is affecting, I should say, pretty much most of our products currently and -- but from a demand point of view, demand is very robust. And so part of this is the demand also is very strong. But we believe that by the time we finish the quarter that the constraints will be larger than the $6 billion that we experienced in Q4.",170

So you'll sort of push forward in the next quarter as well. Can you -- just a different question because I'm curious, you're starting to sell more and more things on a ratable basis. And how are you thinking about that? I mean you have the new Macs and that we keep seeing, you can buy for a monthly the charge in that. How do you think that's driving sales? And how should we think about percent maybe of the portfolio that's now available? And I don't know if you want to tell us how much revenue is now under a recurring nature, but it definitely seems as you're shifting more and more to maybe sort of a bundled sale or offering from a consumer standpoint where you just pay one price every month and you get all of your Apple devices and Apple services.",147

The first product, Shannon, that really sold on a monthly basis was iPhone. And that began to happen in the U.S., as an example, shortly after the subsidy kind of world changed markedly. And so I would say that predominantly, the mode of buying an iPhone in the United States is on a monthly kind of plan today. For the balance of the products, still the most popular would be buying them outright. But we are seeing more and more demand for monthly payments. 
And so we want to give the customer what they want. And so you will see us do more and more things like that, that will meet the customer where -- and provide the price that they want in a way that they want to pay for it. I don't know the percentage of products that are sold that way today, but it is increasing.",150

Thanks a lot, and good afternoon, everyone. I have 2 as well. I guess when I think about the supply chain headwinds and you're talking about $6 billion in September and getting bigger in December, Tim, I would love to understand how do you guys comfort that this is really a demand that's getting deferred versus potentially getting destroyed at least somewhere else. And if you think about the supply chain bottlenecks, you were the COO. You managed a lot of the stuff. Do you feel comfortable that sort of peaks in December and alleviates from there? Or what does the trajectory look like for improvement?",107

What I feel comfortable on is I feel like we've made great progress on the COVID-related disruptions, and that happened across the month of October, and we're in a materially better position today. It is difficult to predict COVID. And so I'm not going to predict where it goes. But I can just tell you that as of today, we're in a materially better position than we were in September and in the first several weeks of October. 
In terms of the chip shortage, the chip shortage is happening on legacy nodes. Primarily, we buy leading edge nodes, and we're not having issues on leading edge nodes. But on legacy nodes, we compete with many different companies for supply and it's difficult to forecast when those things will balance because you'd have to know how kind of how the economy is going to be in '22 and the accuracy of everyone else's demand projections. 
And so I don't feel comfortable in making a prediction. I think it would be subject to too much inaccuracy. But I do feel very comfortable with our operational team. I think we've got a world-class one, and I'm sure they're doing everything they can do to collapse cycle times and improve yields and do all the things that you can do, in addition to fundamental capacity investment to remedy the situation.",227

And then Luca, if I may ask you a question on gross margins for December, you essentially guided gross margins to be flat to maybe down a little bit versus September. Maybe just touch about it. So I think historically, I would have expected gross margins to be up in December, given how much revenue leverage you end up with. So maybe what are the puts and takes on gross margins that are resulting in a more flattish guide versus historical seasonality?",84

But it's also the period of the year where we launch a lot of new products. And as you know, we launch essentially in every product category. We launch new products. Demand is very strong. But as you know, when we launch these new products, we tend to have higher cost structures at the beginning of the cycle. And so that's what balances this out. 
Obviously, from a year-over-year standpoint, it's actually a significant expansion, right? Because when you look at what we did a year ago in the December quarter, 39.8%, this clearly indicates a significant expansion.",117

Look, maybe I can take both of those. The channel inventory, as you would expect in a constrained environment, the iPhone channel inventory ended below the targeted range and is currently below it. And so that's that. 
In terms of the blurring of demand, we look at -- Katy, we look at a number of different data points. We look at demand across our online store, demand in retail. The -- we look through to back orders on the carrier channels, the ones that do take back orders there. We look at channel orders as well. And so we have a number of different data points that we use to conclude how strong demand is. And we feel very, very good about where demand is right now.

We recently surveyed 4,000 consumers in the U.S. and China, and the feedback is most of them don't want to pay for apps or services direct with the developer. They value the security, privacy, ease of transactions with the App Store. So how do you think about balancing the regulators push for more choice with a customer base that's happy with the existing experience? And just as a follow-on to that, how are you and Luca thinking about the potential impact of Services revenue growth rate as some of the changes to the App Store go into effect?",103

And so these are the 2 major tenets that have produced over the years a very trusted environment where consumers and developers come together and consumers can trust the developers on the developers and the apps or what they say they are and the developers get a huge audience to sell their software to. And so that's sort of #1 on our list. Everything else is a distant second. 
And so what we're doing is working to explain the decisions that we've made that are key to keeping the privacy and security there, which is to not have sideloading and not have alternate ways on the iPhone, where it opens up the iPhone to unreviewed apps and also get by the privacy restrictions that we put on the App Store. And so we're very, very focused in discussing the privacy and security elements of the App Store with the regulators and legislators.",173

And I just have 2 quick questions, one big picture, theoretical. So you covered the supply chain in pretty extensive detail on the call. But maybe just a bigger picture on how you're thinking about it philosophically given what you just sort of went through over the last 12 to 8 months. So what I mean by that, is there sort of a recalibration needed or an adjustment around your supply chain philosophy either from a partner perspective or maybe a regional perspective? And how do you think about the current infrastructure and its ability to sort of rebound and sort of handle sort of these disruptions that seem to crop up from time to time?

I don't see a fundamental error that we've made, if that's what you're picking out, in terms of creating the environment that we're in. It was created for a number of reasons. The pandemic came along. Some people in the industry and some people outside the industry thought that the pandemic would reduce demand. They pulled their orders down. Things reset. And what really happened was demand went up and went up even more than the -- than a straight trend would predict. 
And so the industry is working through that now. I'm making it little overly simplistic. There's some other things like yields and things like that, that are happening as well. But those things are mainly manageable in the course of time. And so what we're doing is working with our partners on making sure that they have supply that we need and making sure that our demand statements are accurate as we see them and so forth. 
And at the same time, we are reducing our lead times and cycle times so that when you get a chip off a fab that as quickly as possible, it's in a product and shipping and also helping the fab partners increase their yields. And so those things are things that we're doing. We also support the CHIPS Act and the investment there to put more investment in the ground. And so we're spending some time advocating for the CHIPS Act as well.",244

And I didn't mean to implicate that you guys had messed up, just maybe came off that way. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. When you think about purchasing devices ratably, you touched on that earlier. But maybe can you just touch on the partnerships that you have with carriers and the support that they have given you over the last couple of years? It's been a key component of your success, the tight relationships that you have globally. Do you think sort of this business model, as it's currently sort of put together globally, is sort of a permanent structure, meaning carriers are going to be integral part of driving demand for iPhones? Or is there a sense that maybe it's a little bit more transitory depending on the part of the cycle that we're in.",142

It's not a 1 year and done. And I think that we're motivated there. The carrier is motivated there. We have mutual interest and the customer benefits hugely from getting a new 5G phone that has 5G and a number of other features in it, too. 
And so I think everybody is aligned on purpose. The model that you paint is -- I wouldn't call it a global model because there are different variations around the world depending upon the country. But in general, I think that the marriage, if you will, or partnership between Apple and the carrier channel has never been stronger and that it's on very solid footing.",131

Customers appreciate having the option of whether they want to be tracked or not. And so the -- there's an outpouring of customer satisfaction there on the customer side. And the reason that we did this is that, as you know, if you followed us for a while, we believe strongly that privacy is a basic human right. And we believe that for decades, not just in the last year or so. 
And we've historically rolled out more and more features over time for -- to place the decision of whether to share data and what data to share in the hands of the user where we believe that it belongs. We don't think that's Apple's role to decide, and we don't think that's another company's role to decide but rather the individual who owns the data itself. And so that's our motivation there.

Probably the first one is for Tim. On the Services revenue, much better than expected. Can you give us some details about what drove that? Was it Apple Stores more open, so more AppleCare or more Apple One or Arcade or TV or Fitness? 
And then probably for Luca on supply chain, when you mentioned supply chain headwind is going to get worse and you mentioned $6 billion this quarter, there's 2 ways to think about your terminology of worse. Is it the delta from $2 billion that you identified 3 months ago that went to $6 billion, so therefore, the delta of $4 billion gets worse? Or are you just saying -- and therefore, it's above $10 billion for December quarter. Are you just saying it just gets higher than the $6 billion that you just identified earlier in the call?",153

On the supply constraints, what we're saying is that the amount of -- the nominal amount of supply constraints for Q1, we estimate to be larger than $6 billion. And so it's important to know that we're getting a lot more supply in Q1 than we had in Q4, obviously, because our sequential growth is significant. And we have very solid growth year-over-year. And so the amount of supply is growing dramatically. It's just that the demand is so robust that we envision having supply constraints for the quarter.",119

And it was really across the board. It's difficult to single out a specific area because we set all-time records on cloud. We set all-time records across the board, AppleCare, music, video, advertising, payment services, the App Store was a September quarter record. So it was strong across the board. 
When we look at the Services business, we always think about some fundamental factors that allow us to have good visibility over the sustainability of the business, right? The fact that the installed base continues to grow, that's obviously a positive. The fact that the number of people that are actually paying on the platform continues to grow double digits. And so that obviously increases our opportunity. The number of subscriptions that we have on the platform, we mentioned during the call, 745 million paid subs right now. It's an increase of 160 million versus just 12 months ago, right? 
And obviously, the fact that we continue to launch new services, new offerings within the services that we already have, new features, that obviously gives us a lot of momentum going forward. We're very fortunate we have a very -- now it's a very large business, $68 billion in the last 12 months and very diversified.

Guys, first of all, great job managing through the supply constraints. It's obviously affecting everybody. So congratulations. And then Tim, one for you, a strategic question. When Apple thinks about strategic areas that as a company they want to own, for example, software is a high priority, but you're also one of the largest semiconductor companies if the company would stand alone. So curious about the kind of input, that thinking that goes into owning some piece of technology. For example, when we survey people, they say batteries and screens are very important.

And so it really depends on whether we see a way to do something that's differentiated or not. And I wouldn't want to rule anything out.

But the reality, what happens, we always make our products better and -- which means adding new technology and new features to the product. So typically, when you move from one generation of products to the next one, the cost structures tend to be higher, particularly at the beginning of the cycle. And so when you make that transition, there is always some level of margin compression from the transition to a new product. 
The other aspect that you need to think about is the fact that the December quarter is the holiday season, and so the percentage of products business that we have in the holiday quarter is higher than what we have in the September quarter, for example. And therefore, as you know, because the Services margins are higher than the products margin, there's also a mix between the products and services business that plays into the gross margins for the company, right? And that's what you see as you move sequentially from September to December.",189

I had a question about -- broadly about pricing of new products. This year, Apple launched the iPhone 13 at a slightly lower price than where the 12 was launched last year in China. Can you maybe help us think through what are some of the things that you look at in deciding that? And is that an action that you could take more broadly in other regions? And I have a follow-up.",74

And as a follow-up, you've introduced a lot of new services over the past few years, and these have become a much more important part of the Apple story. Can you maybe share either some metrics on some of the new services like TV+ in terms of paid subs? And how are you measuring the success of these investments?",60

And so you can bet that we're looking at subs and ARPUs and conversions and churn and all of the normal things you would look at with a subscription business. But we're not going to get into sharing those on an individual service basis. What we're trying to do is give you visibility to the aggregate number of subscriptions that we've had, which Luca covered earlier with the 745 million across both Apple-branded and third party. And so we're giving you an aggregated view of it instead of the -- at the individual service level. But you can bet that we're managing it at the individual service level.",122
