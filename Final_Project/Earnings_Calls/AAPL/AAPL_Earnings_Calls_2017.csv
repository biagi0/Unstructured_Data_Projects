I'm very happy to share with you the outstanding results of Apple's December quarter. We generated the highest quarterly revenue in Apple's history, along with all-time unit and revenue records for iPhone and Apple Watch, all-time revenue records for Services and Mac and all-time revenue records for 4 out of our 5 geographic segments. The strong performance of our business also produced all-time record earnings per share.
Revenue in the quarter was $78.4 billion, which was above the top of our guidance range. iPhone had a tremendous quarter thanks to exceptional demand that beat our own internal expectations. While iPhone 7 is our most popular model, we saw especially strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which was a higher portion of the new product mix than we've ever seen with Plus models in the past. 
Demand for iPhone 7 Plus exceeded supply throughout the quarter, and we came into supply-demand balance in January. iPhone 7 Plus has earned rave reviews for its advanced new features, especially the dual camera system, which produces stunning portraits and high-quality zoom. This is a uniquely Apple feature that is surprising and delighting our users. Both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are empowering our customers to be more productive, more engaged and more expressive than ever by integrating hardware, software and services to create experiences that only Apple can deliver.
It was our best quarter ever for Services with almost $7.2 billion in revenue. App Store customers broke all-time records during the holiday quarter, including $3 billion in purchases in December alone, making it the App Store's single best month ever. Our innovative and vibrant developer community has created over 2.2 million apps for doing almost anything that you can imagine. Apple's developer community has now earned over $60 billion, including over $20 billion in 2016 alone.
Revenue from our music business grew for the third quarter in a row, and our AppleCare and iPlus storage services had all-time record results. Apple Pay continued its strong momentum with the number of users more than tripling over the past year and hundreds of millions of transactions and billions of dollars in purchases in the December quarter alone.
Transaction volume was up over 500% year-over-year as we expanded to 4 new countries, including Japan, Russia, New Zealand and Spain, bringing us into a total of 13 markets. Apple Pay on the web is delivering our partners great results. Nearly 2 million small businesses are accepting invoice payments with Apple Pay through Intuit QuickBooks Online, Fresh Books and other billing partners, and beginning this quarter, Comcast customers can pay their monthly bill in a single touch with Apple Pay.
Services are becoming a larger part of our business, and we expect the revenues to be the size of a Fortune 100 company this year. Our services offerings are now driving over 150 million paid customer subscriptions. This includes our own services and third-party content that we offer on our stores. We feel great about this momentum, and our goal is to double the size of our Services business in the next 4 years.
The Mac not only returned to growth but generated its highest quarterly revenue ever. Our latest data shows that most Mac customers are buying their first Mac with the vast majority of them coming from a Windows PC. The new MacBook touch with Touch Bar is an outstanding example of the innovation made possible by integrating world-class hardware and software. We were supply constrained for the new MacBook Pro throughout the December quarter and are just now coming into supply-demand balance.
It was also our best quarter ever for Apple Watch, both units and revenues, with holiday demand so strong that we couldn't make enough. Apple Watch is the best-selling smartwatch in the world and also the most loved with the highest customer satisfaction in its category by a wide margin. Apple Watch is the ultimate device for a healthy life, and it's the gold standard for smartwatches. We couldn't be more excited about Apple Watch.
We're also thrilled with the response to AirPods. Customers love the magical experience AirPods are delivering, and if you haven't tried them yet, you'll be delighted when you do. They're far ahead of anything else in the market today, and we're working hard to catch up with the incredible demand.
With AirPods off to a fantastic start, a strong full first year for Apple Watch and Beats headphones offering a great wireless experience using the Apple-designed W1 chip, we now have a rich lineup of wearable products. Their design, elegance and ease of use make us very excited about the huge growth potential for wearables going forward.
Our ecosystem is broadening to more and more of the areas where people spend their time, at the gym, on the go, in the home and on the job. For example, every major automaker is committed to supporting CarPlay with over 200 different models announced, including 5 of the top 10 selling models in the United States. There are well over 1 million people using CarPlay now and this continues to grow rapidly.
And we are leading the industry by being the first to integrate home automation into a major platform with iOS 10. With Siri and the new Home app in iOS 10, everywhere you go, you can easily and securely control all of your home accessories with your iPhone, iPad or your Apple Watch. The number of HomeKit-compatible accessories continues to grow rapidly with many exciting solutions announced just this month, including video cameras, motion detectors and sensors for doors, windows and even water leaks. Perhaps even more importantly, we are unmatched when it comes to securing your home with HomeKit-enabled door locks, garage doors and alarm systems.
I'm personally using HomeKit accessories in the Home app to integrate iOS into my home routine. Now when I say good morning to Siri, my house lights come on and my coffee starts brewing. When I go to the living room to relax in the evening, I use Siri to adjust the lighting and turn on the fireplace. And when I leave the house, a simple tap of my iPhone turns the lights off, adjusts the thermostat down and locks the doors. When I return to my house in the evening, as I near my home, the house prepares itself for my arrival automatically by using a simple geofence. This level of home automation was unimaginable just a few years ago, and it's here today with iOS and HomeKit.
We're making great progress in the enterprise market alongside our major partners. The combination of iOS and Cisco technology is giving companies everywhere the opportunity to vastly improve the user experience for their mobile employees. With enhanced networking performance, up to 8x faster roaming, better reliability for apps and native voice experience, we're excited about how much more productive the workforce will be with these great capabilities. In fact, the total number of joint customer opportunities has grown over 70% since last quarter.
Enterprises are using IBM's new Mobile at Scale design and development model to deploy multiple iOS apps with speed and efficiency. For example, Finnair is transforming aircraft maintenance and CEMEX is revamping activities from attracting new clients to invoicing to after-sales support.
And later this spring, SAP will be rolling out its SDK for iOS, providing its community of more than 2.5 million developers the tools to build powerful, native iOS apps that leverage the SAP HANA cloud platform. We're delighted with how these partnerships are making it even easier for enterprise customers to transform how work gets done with iOS.
As we reflect on a record-breaking December quarter, I'd like to thank our developers, our business partners and our employees for their incredible contributions and commitment. And I'd like to thank all of our customers around the world for their excitement and loyalty, which ultimately drive these results.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Luca to talk about the quarter in more detail.",1351
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2017",2017-01-31,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3362.0,1120849.0,46506435.0,Presenter Speech,Luca Maestri,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the December quarter was $78.4 billion, the highest quarterly revenue in the history of Apple and above our guidance range. As Tim mentioned, the strength of our results was very broad based. As we said, new revenue records for iPhone, for Services, for Mac and for Apple Watch.
We also established new all-time revenue records in most developed and emerging markets with strong growth rates in many countries, including the U.S., Japan, Canada, France, Australia, Brazil, India, Turkey and Russia. We accomplished all this despite a very challenging foreign exchange environment due to the continued strength of the U.S. dollar. As we had expected, our year-over-year performance in Greater China improved significantly relative to the September quarter. Total Greater China segment revenue was down 12%, but revenue from Mainland China was even with the all-time record results from a year ago and grew in constant currency terms. In all other geographic segments, we generated all-time quarterly record results.
We had the benefit of a 14th week during the quarter this year, but this was offset by 4 factors: First, this year, we grew channel inventory significantly less than a year ago; Second, iPhone 7 launched earlier in the September quarter compared to the iPhone 6s launch the previous year, creating a more difficult comparison for the December quarter this year; Third, the stronger U.S. dollar affected total revenue growth this year by 100 basis points; and fourth, our year-ago revenue included the benefit of a one-off $548 million patent infringement payment. Also, strong customer interest left us in supply-demand imbalance for several of our products throughout the quarter this year.
Gross margin was 38.5%, at the high end of our guidance range. Operating margin was 29.8% of revenue, and net income was $17.9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $3.36, a new all-time record, and cash flow from operations was $27.1 billion.
We had a terrific quarter for iPhone as we sold 78.3 million units, a new all-time record and an increase of 5% over last year. Customer demand was even higher than our reported results as iPhone unit sell-through was up 8%.
We saw double-digit iPhone growth in the U.S., in Canada, Western Europe, Japan and Australia and even stronger growth in many emerging markets, including Brazil, Turkey, Russia, Central and Eastern Europe and Vietnam. iPhone ASP increased to $695 in the December quarter from $619 in the September quarter, driven by the very strong product mix and the amazing success of iPhone 7 Plus.
Despite stronger demand than last year, we added only 1.2 million units of iPhone channel inventory across the quarter, significantly less than the increase of 3.3 million units a year ago. And we exited the quarter near the low end of our 5- to 7-week target channel inventory range.
Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are exceptional, not only with consumers but also with business users. In the U.S., for instance, the latest data from 451 Research on consumers indicates a 97% customer satisfaction rating among all iPhone owners and a 99% satisfaction rating for owners of iPhone 7 Plus. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the iPhone customer satisfaction rating was 94%, and of those planning to purchase smartphones in the March quarter, 78% plan to purchase an iPhone.
Turning to Services. We generated an all-time record $7.2 billion in revenue, an increase of 18% year-over-year. Our run rate growth was actually higher when taking into account 2 discrete items: On one hand, the 14th week added to services revenue this December quarter; on the other hand, that benefit was more than offset by the comparison to the one-off $548 million patent infringement payment included in services revenue a year ago.
The App Store continued its impressive run, breaking all previous revenue records. Year-over-year, App Store revenue growth was 43% through the first 13 weeks of the quarter. It's great to see that both average revenue per paying account and the number of paying accounts grew strongly during the quarter. And according to App Annie's latest report, App Store revenue continues to outpace the industry overall with more than double the revenue of Google Play in calendar 2016.
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.4 million Macs and generated our highest-ever quarterly Mac revenue. We were very happy to report double-digit unit growth in several countries, including Japan, Mainland China, India, The Netherlands and Sweden as well as in the U.S. education market. We ended the quarter at the low end of our 4- to 5-week target range for Mac channel inventory.
Turning to iPad. We sold 13.1 million units, which was ahead of our expectations, and we posted double-digit growth in both Mainland China and in India as we've expanded distribution channels in those countries, and we continue to attract a very high percentage of first-time tablet buyers. We also reduced channel inventory by about 700,000 units as opposed to an increase of 900,000 units last year, and we exited the quarter near the low end of our 5- to 7-week target range.
iPad is incredibly successful in the segments of the tablet market where we compete, both in terms of market share and customer metrics. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad had 85% share of the U.S. market for tablets priced above $200. And in November, 451 Research measured a 94% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, a 97% rate for iPad Air and 96% for iPad Pro. Among U.S. consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next 6 months, purchase intention for iPad is more than 4x higher than any other brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a 96% satisfaction rate and a purchase intent of 66% for the March quarter.
In fact, businesses of all sizes are choosing iPad and iPhone to help them reimagine their everyday activities. We're seeing strong momentum in sectors such as retail, where iOS solutions are being deployed for everything from product development to logistics to mobile point of sale. Companies like Toys""R""Us, Coach and Kate Spade are using iOS and our mobility partner solutions to dramatically transform their customer and employee experiences.
Our retail stores experienced strong double-digit growth in visitors and revenue in the December quarter, and we continue to expand our global presence with plans to open our first store in Singapore and our second store in Dubai soon. We're continually updating our stores and adding new exciting outreach programs to educate kids on our products, entertain the community with fresh live music, teach future Swift developers to code and empower entrepreneurs to start, grow and evolve their businesses.
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $246.1 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $8.5 billion. $230.2 billion of this cash or 94% of the total was outside the United States. We also had $77.1 billion in term debt and $10.5 billion in commercial paper outstanding at quarter-end.
We returned almost $15 billion to investors during a very busy December quarter for our capital return activities. We paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $5 billion on repurchases of 44.3 million Apple shares through open market transactions. And we launched a new $6 billion ASR, resulting in an initial delivery and retirement of 44.8 million shares. We also completed our eighth accelerated share repurchase program, retiring an additional 4.4 million shares. This led to a net diluted share count reduction of 65.3 million shares during the quarter.
We have now completed $201 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program, including $144 billion in share repurchases. And we plan to provide investors with our annual update on the capital return program in the spring.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26% as expected. And as we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion. This guidance range includes a $1.2 billion year-over-year headwind from foreign exchange. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 39%. This guidance range includes an 80 basis points sequential headwind from foreign exchange. We expect OpEx to be between $6.5 billion and $6.6 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.
Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on February 16, 2017, to shareholders of record as of February 13, 2017.
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.",1467

Well, if you look back at our history, 100 basis points range for gross margin is not unusual. Clearly, during a period when foreign exchange is very volatile, we think it's more prudent to broaden the range a bit. I've mentioned that we expect, assuming that rates don't move too much, we expect foreign exchange to be a major negative as we move from the December to the March quarter. You know that the dollar has appreciated significantly towards the end of the December quarter, and so we got 80 basis points of sequential headwind from foreign exchange. We also have the sequential loss of leverage, which is typical of our seasonality, but we expect to offset these 2 impacts with cost efficiencies and also with our mix of products and services. So obviously, if the dollar is a little less strong than it is today, we could do a bit better on gross margins. Obviously, we continue to work very hard on our cost efficiencies, so we'll see where we land.",175

Katy, I am optimistic, given what I'm hearing, that there would likely be some sort of tax reform this year, and it does seem like there's people in both parties that would favor repatriation as a part of that. So I think that's very good for the country and good for Apple. What we would do with it, let's wait and see exactly what it is. But as I said before, we are always looking at acquisitions. We acquired 15 to 20 companies per year for the last 4 years, and we look for companies of all sizes. And there's not a size that we would not do based on just the size of it. It's more about the strategic value of it. In terms of original content, we put our toe on the water -- we have put our toe on the water with doing some original content for Apple Music, and that will be rolling out through the year. We are learning from that, and we'll go from there. The way that we participate in the sort of the changes that are going on in the media industry that I fully expect to accelerate from sort of the cable bundle beginning to break down is, one, we started the new Apple TV a year ago, and we're pleased with how that platform has come along. We have more things planned for it. But it's come a long way in a year, and it gives us a clearer platform to build off of. Two, embedded in the 150 million paid subscriptions that I mentioned in my opening comments, there are a number of third-party services that are a part that where we participate economically in some of that by offering our platform and selling and distributing. And then thirdly, we are obviously -- with our toe on the water, we're learning a lot about the original content business and thinking about ways that we could play at that.",330

Is there a way to think about those in 2 separate terms?",64

We look at it -- those are the 2 key elements for us. And what is particularly interesting to us is to see that the number of people that are transacting on our stores is increasing strong double digits, and we're also seeing that the ARPU per paying customer is increasing double digits, right? So it's a combination of the 2 obviously. The quality and the quantity of content that we make available in our services improves all the time. And we also see that as people get into the platform and start transacting on the platform and we keep track of their behavior over time, we actually see that they tend to spend more and more over time. And that's why we are excited about the future of the Services business, and that's why we -- as Tim said, we have a goal that -- it's already become a very large business. It's going to be a Fortune 100 company this year, but we have a goal to double it over the next 4 years.",183

And if I could just switch gears on a follow-up. There's been a fair amount of discussions around your market share in China and what's happening over there. Your numbers actually look fairly impressive in Greater China, China specifically. So could you just talk about what are the demand trends you're seeing there on the ground? And how do you see that transpire through the year?",67
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2017",2017-01-31,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3362.0,1120849.0,46506446.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,14,"Yes, I'll take this one. If you look at how we did in the quarter, as I think Luca shared, our Greater China revenue is down 12%. And about 4 points of that was currency related, so it's an 8 point decline in constant currency. And then within Greater China, if you look at the PRC, our revenue was flat year-over-year, and that was against the all-time record quarter. And if you look at that on a constant currency basis, it was actually up 6. So it's a significantly better performance on sort of every way you look at it versus what we had experienced the prior 3 quarters. Underneath that, what we've seen is that iPhone 7 was the best-selling smartphone in China during the quarter according to Kantar. Singles' Day, which is a huge day in China, as you know, we were the most popular U.S. brand on Alibaba. We set a new record for services in China as the company did. And Mac revenue was up double digit year-over-year. iPad units were also up double digit in Mainland China, which was obviously different than the trend that we saw in the balance of the world. We also saw 50% of our iPhone sales in China were to switchers and first-time buyers, which is a very high number that we're pleased with, and obviously, our total installed base continues to grow there in the strong double digits. That said, the challenges that are there are: one, the currency is -- has devalued 6% year-over-year; and two, Hong Kong remains a very, very difficult market. And so I would -- I look at it and I'm encouraged with the significant improvement. But we're not without challenges there. And I wouldn't want to imply that, although I do like many, many things that I've seen and how broad based the Pluses were across our product line.",316

And then as you grow your Services business, is there anything we should keep in mind from a margin perspective? Would these be lower-margin services or similar?

Obviously, within the Services business, we have a number of categories. The App Store is the one that is driving significant growth right now. I said in my opening comments that it grew 43% 13 weeks over 13 weeks. It grew even more for the quarter, right? And what we like about the App Store is that it's truly a global platform, so we are seeing significant growth not only in the developed markets where you expect to see a lot of transaction volume, but we see great growth in places like China, for example. And we know that there are parts of the world where we can do better. We can grow, for example, our developer community in a number of emerging markets. And so -- and as we look -- as I was explaining earlier, as we look at the number of people that transact growing double digits, we see the amount spent per paid account growing so well, we think that the App Store is going to be a significant driver of growth. On the music front, we are the market leader in digital music, and obviously, now by having the combination of the download business with the streaming service, which we didn't have until recently, we've been able to bring our music business back to growth. We've grown over the last 3 quarters, and we feel very good about that. Tim has talked about original content. We've had very good success with exclusives, so we know that it's another business that we can grow. Our iCloud storage business is growing very quickly, and so that -- there is a business that also, at a geographic level, we can continue to grow significantly. Our AppleCare business is growing very well. A lot of it comes from the fact that our installed base of devices around the world continues to grow very well, strong double digits. And as we've explained in the past, the vast majority of the services that we provide is not driven by what we sell during the last 90 days. It's much more driven by the installed base, and that gives us a tailwind. We're also opening up several new markets because we're accepting new forms of payments, and therefore, it's easier for -- particularly for international customers to take advantage of our services. You were asking about the margin profile. We said it many times. In aggregate, our Services business tends to have margins that are above company averages. They are accretive, so they help us quite a bit from a margin standpoint. Within the Services business, we have very different margin profiles also because, as you know, we account for some of these services in different ways. In some cases, we transact on a buy-sell basis. In other cases, we perform as agents, for example, to our developers, right? And that drives different margin percentages.",488

I think, in the past, there was some concern in some of the emerging markets that you were basically not able to -- you weren't getting the volumes because you had to raise ASPs given the currency, but you talked about a lot of the emerging markets actually doing pretty well this quarter. So I'm just curious, you've raised the price on the iPhone 7 Plus and that -- what are you seeing? And what are your customers saying in terms of willingness to pay up?",108

Since June of 2014, so we're talking about 2.5 years ago, the dollar has strengthened 25% against the basket of currencies where we do business. And so obviously, it is a difficult situation for us. I mentioned that foreign exchange is a significant headwind for us, both at the revenue level and at the gross margin level. In emerging markets, it's incredible. The level of interest for our products is -- continues to be phenomenal. The brand continues to be very aspirational. There's more and more people that can afford our products around the world. The middle class is growing in places like China, India, Brazil. But certainly, strong dollar doesn't help us, and therefore, when we make pricing decisions, we need to be very careful. We always want to find the optimal balance between units, revenue and margin, and it becomes more difficult as the dollar appreciates.",154

We were actually at the high end of the range for gross margins. We had guided 38% to 38.5%, and we came in at 38.5% exactly. And really, the slight improvement over the midpoint of the guidance range was due to the fact that our revenue was ahead of our expectations, and so we got a bit more leverage out of the increased revenue levels. We feel very good about the gross margins for the quarter. Again, keep in mind, the strong dollar, that doesn't help us on that front.",91

We did have an exceptional quarter with iPhone, and that was with the backdrop of not predicting the demand very well on the iPhone 7 Plus and therefore, being in constraint on it through the quarter. If you look at the absolute number of upgraders, it was the highest that we've seen in any quarter. And if you look at the switcher number, it's the highest that we've seen in any quarter. If you look at the upgrade rate, it's similar to last year. However, I think the big asterisk, I share all this with you for transparency's sake, but I would tell you that the way we look at this is, in a quarter where you have a supply constraint, it's difficult to draw too many conclusions from it. But for -- I wanted to share that with you anyway so you have the backdrop.",150

As your comps get easier this year, I was curious if you think you're going to be returning to growth in that region. And then just to give us the context, I know you talked about the 6% constant currency increasing revenue in Mainland China, but curious, if you strip out the double-digit increase in iPad and MacBook and potentially the mix shift to the 7 Plus, I'm curious what underlying iPhone units did in Mainland China.",86

I don't have the answer in front of me. The -- if you look at 7 Plus, it was the most popular Plus model that we've ever had. It set a unit record. So that, I can share. In terms of how are we going to do, we don't provide guidance at the segment level. But sitting here today for Q2, I wouldn't expect the year-over-year performance to be dramatically different than the year-over-year performance in Q1.

So I think iPhone units, on a sell-through basis, were up about 8%. You had an extra week, which gave you about 8%. I understand there were differences of the timing of the launch. So making all those adjustments, it looks like iPhone units were probably up low single digits. But Luca, you alluded to the fact that your installed base was growing double digits, so that would kind of suggest to me that the upgrade rate -- the upgrade percentage is actually declining. And more specifically, I'd just like your broader perspective on how investors should think about upgrade rates. It looked like they peaked in the iPhone 6 cycle, and it looks like they've been extending -- going lower. Replacement cycles have been extending over the last couple of years. I think some of the U.S. carriers alluded to that as well. So I'm wondering if you could kind of step back and just talk a little bit more broadly about how investors should think about or what the trajectory's been over the last 2 years and how investors should think going forward. Do you believe there are opportunities for that upgrade rate to improve or replacement cycles to accelerate going forward? And what are some of the considerations we should think about?",225
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2017",2017-01-31,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3362.0,1120849.0,46506464.0,Answer,Luca Maestri,,Executives,32,"Well, I think it's a good question and a number of points that I want to make. Starting with the growth in installed base of iPhones, yes, it's growing strong double digits, and that's very good for us for a number of reasons, including the fact that it's a big driver for our Services business. When we look at it geographically, I think we see different developments. For example, we felt very, very good about the unit growth that we had in many markets around the world. You've been quoting an overall total company growth rate, but when we look at it at a country-specific level, there were a lot of countries -- actually, I would say the majority of the countries where iPhone units grew strong double digits, starting here in the United States, where, for example, the fact that annual upgrade programs are becoming more and more popular, is proving to be a positive for us. Same happened in a number of countries around the world, starting with Canada and Australia but also many places in Western Europe as well. Japan grew double digits in terms of units. So I think geographically, we are seeing very, very good performance. The point that I think I need to make when you think about upgrade rates, clearly, this issue of the strong dollar doesn't help us. Could we sell significantly more and significantly faster from an upgrade cycle standpoint in places outside the United States where we've had -- we've been forced to increase prices by up to 20%, 30%, 40% in certain countries? And you think about the impact that this is having on local demand, obviously, that doesn't help us. But overall, I would say, as Tim said, when we look at the upgrade rate for -- and we look at it from the standpoint of the new phones, right, the new generation phones, the upgrade rate, the percentage of people that have upgraded to the new phone has been very similar to what we've seen last year. The 6 cycle was certainly a phenomenal cycle. There was pent-up demand for the larger screen phones, and certainly, as we look ahead, we have a role to play. The more we're able to innovate with new generations of products, clearly, that plays a role in the upgrade rate.",389

Back in April 2012, you said on one of these earnings calls that, ""I've always hated litigation and I continue to hate it. And I highly prefer to settle versus battle."" Yet you recently decided to initiate a lawsuit against Qualcomm. I'm wondering if you can comment on the ostensible change or departure from this viewpoint. And what would be a successful end result of this litigation? And whether you can confirm whether there's any potential gross margin risk in the future as a result of this litigation.",95

I don't like litigation and view it as a last resort. And so you should take from our filing that we viewed it as we didn't see another way forward. They were insisting on charging royalties for technologies that they had nothing to do with, and so we were in a situation where the more we innovated with unique features like Touch ID or advanced displays or cameras, just to name a few, the more money Qualcomm would collect for no reason and the more expensive it would be, therefore, for us to innovate. So it's somewhat like buying a sofa and you charge somebody a different price if it goes -- depending upon the price of the house that it goes into. Just from our point of view, it -- this doesn't make sense, and we don't believe it will pass muster in the courts. In addition to that, they -- as a part of their increasingly radical steps they were taking to try to hold up that model, they withheld $1 billion in payments that they owe to us. And so we felt like we had no choice was the net of it. In terms of where it goes, we'll see. I don't like litigation, and so if there's another way, then that would be great. But at this point, I don't see it. I fully expect at this point in time that it will take some time. But in the end, I think common sense will prevail, and the courts will see it for what it is. And so that's the way I see it. Thanks for your question.",283

It looked like it was about to turn possibly even positive. And you said it was above your plan, but I think it was pretty well below The Street's expectations.

In the year-ago quarter, we increased by 900,000 [ph]. In this quarter, we decreased by 700,000 [ph] . The -- on top of that, from an ASP point of view, in the year-ago quarter, we launched the iPad Pro 13 inch. That would be the iPad with obviously the highest price on it. We would have done the channel fill plus the launch of the product, and so that would have bolstered the ASPs in that particular quarter. In addition to all of that, we did under call the number of iPads that would be in demand for the quarter, and that compounded a shortage issue that we had with one of our suppliers. And so all in all, there was quite a few things going on there. If I sort of zoom out of the 90-day clock and look at it, we've got some exciting things coming on iPad. I still feel very optimistic about where we can take the product. When we look at the number of people buying iPads for the first time, which is a good thing to look at from a point of view of whether things are reaching a penetration point or not, the numbers indicate that it's not close to that kind of thing. The customer sat numbers are through the roof. Literally, the customer sat for the iPad Pro is 99%. It's stunning. And so I see a lot of good things and hope for better results. But we are still currently in this shortage issue now. And I'm not projecting to get out of that totally during the quarter, and so it will damper this quarter somewhat. But again, beyond the 90-day kind of clock, I'm very bullish on iPad.",304

Are there functional things coming over time that you think could surprise people?",74

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Today, we are reporting strong March quarter results with accelerating revenue growth and earnings per share up 10% over last year. We feel great about this performance.
Revenue was $52.9 billion, near the high end of our guidance range. Global revenue was up 5% year-on-year with growth accelerating from our December quarter performance. That's despite a $1 billion year-over-year revenue headwind from foreign exchange in the March quarter and a larger iPhone channel inventory reduction this year versus last year.
iPhone sales were in line with our expectations, and we're thrilled to see the continued strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus with its beautiful large display and dual camera system. Our active installed base of iPhones grew by double digits year-over-year, and based on the latest data from IDC, we gained market share in nearly every country we track.
Late in the quarter, we released the stunning (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition versions of iPhone 7 and 7 Plus in recognition of 10 years of our partnership with (RED). This relationship has given our customers an unprecedented way to contribute to the Global Fund and bring the world a step closer to an AIDS-free generation. We've seen wonderful customer response to these eye-popping new iPhones.
For the second quarter in a row, our Services revenue topped $7 billion, and it's well on the way to being the size of a Fortune 100 company. We're very happy to see the deep level of customer engagement with the Apple ecosystem across all of our services.
App Store momentum is terrific with revenue growing 40% year-over-year to an all-time quarterly record. The number of developers offering apps for sale on our store was up 26% over last year, and we're thrilled to see their success. We also saw double-digit revenue growth from Apple Music subscriptions and iCloud storage and overall, very strong growth in the total number of paid subscriptions for our own services and the third-party content we offer on our stores. Paid subscriptions now exceed 165 million.
Apple Pay is experiencing phenomenal traction. With the launch of Taiwan and Ireland in the March quarter, Apple Pay is now live in 15 markets with more than 20 million contactless-ready locations, including more than 4.5 million locations accepting Apple Pay in the U.S. alone. We're seeing strong growing usage as points of acceptance expand with transaction volume up 450% over the last 12 months.
In the U.K., for example, points of acceptance have grown by 44% in the last year, while monthly Apple Pay transactions have grown by nearly 300%. In Japan, where Apple Pay launched last October, more than 0.5 million transit users are completing 20 million Apple Pay transactions per month. And we're always excited to see our partners bring their customers new ways to use Apple Pay. You can now even send a Starbucks gift card via iMessage with just a touch.
We're seeing great momentum from our powerful advances in Messages. In fact, at one point during the Super Bowl in February, customers were sending 380,000 messages per second, more than double the previous year. A few weeks ago, we introduced Clips, a new app that's another great example of how we're continually making our products even more engaging, and it's off to a great start. With Clips, it's fun and easy to combine video, photos and music on an iPhone or an iPad into great-looking expressive videos with great visual effects and titles just using your voice, then share your Clips with friends through the Messages app or on social media.
We had great Mac results during the quarter. Revenue grew 14% to a new March quarter record and gained market share, thanks to strong demand for our new MacBook Pros. Our Mac business has generated over $25 billion of revenue over the past 4 quarters. We're investing aggressively in its future, and we are very excited about the innovation we can bring to the platform.
We also updated our most popular-sized iPad with a brighter Retina display and best-in-class performance at its most affordable price ever, and customer response to date has been very strong. iPad results were ahead of our expectation, and we believe we gained share during the March quarter in a number of major markets, including the U.S., Japan and Australia. iPad remains the world's most popular tablet, and it's the primary computing device for millions of customers across the globe.
Building on the momentum from the holiday quarter, Apple Watch sales nearly doubled year-over-year. Apple Watch is the best-selling and most loved smartwatch in the world, and we hear wonderful stories from our customers about its impact on their fitness and health.
We're also seeing great response to AirPods with a 98% customer satisfaction rating based on a recent Creative Strategies survey. Demand for AirPods significantly exceed supply, and growth in Beats products has also been very strong. In fact, when we combine Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats headphones, our revenue from wearable products in the last 4 quarters was the size of a Fortune 500 company.
In Greater China, we were very pleased to see strong double-digit revenue growth from both Mac and Services during the March quarter. We also had great results from our retail stores in Mainland China, with total store revenue up 27% over last year and comp store revenue up 7%. These results contributed to our improving performance in Greater China.
Through the first 2 quarters of fiscal 2017, our year-over-year comparisons improved significantly over the last 2 quarters of fiscal 2016. First half revenue was down 13% year-over-year, about 1/3 of which was attributable to FX. That's in contrast to a 32% revenue decline in the second half of last year. Our March quarter results were in line with our expectations and similar to the year-over-year performance we experienced in the December quarter. We continue to be very enthusiastic about our opportunity in China.
We set a new March quarter record for India, where revenue grew by strong double digits. We continue to strengthen our local presence across the entire ecosystem, and we're very optimistic about our future in this remarkable country, with its very large, young and tech-savvy population, fast-growing economy and improving 4G network infrastructure.
Apple Retail is entering an exciting chapter with new experiences for customers and breathtaking new store designs. With the opening of our newest store in Dubai this past weekend, we now have 495 retail locations worldwide. The new Apple Dubai Mall is a truly international store with employees who collectively speak 45 languages and are already welcoming customers from around the world.
As Luca will discuss in a moment, today, we're also providing an update to our capital return program. Given our strong confidence in our future, we're increasing the program size by $50 billion, bringing the total to $300 billion, and we're extending the time frame through March of 2019. We're adding to our share repurchase authorization and increasing our dividend for the fifth time in less than 5 years.
We're very excited about our upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference taking place in San Jose next month. The conference is significantly oversubscribed, and we'll be welcoming thousands of attendees. We look forward to helping them learn about breakthrough technologies across all 4 of our software platforms: iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS, that enable developers to create incredible experiences for every aspect of customers' lives and improve the way they manage their homes, cars, health and more.
I'm very proud to mention that we recently released our 10th annual Environmental Responsibility Report reflecting our amazing progress. In 2016, 96% of the electricity used at Apple's global facilities came from renewable sources of energy, reducing our carbon emissions by nearly 585,000 metric tons. We're now 100% renewable in 24 countries, including all of Apple's data centers. There's much more work to be done, but we're committed to leaving the world better than we found it.
Closer to home, we're excited about moving into our new corporate headquarters, Apple Park, our new center for innovation. The main building on Apple Park is designed to house 13,000 employees under one roof in an environment that fosters even greater collaboration among our incredibly talented teams.
We have many more ongoing investments in the United States economy since Apple is a company that could only have been created in America. Through our innovative products and the success of our business, we're incredibly proud to support more than 2 million jobs in all 50 states, and we expect to create even more. Last fiscal year, we spent more than $50 billion in the United States with American suppliers, developers and partners, and we continue to invest confidently in our future.
Now for more details on the March quarter results, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca.",1479
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, May 02, 2017",2017-05-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3487.0,1189548.0,48902451.0,Presenter Speech,Luca Maestri,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the March quarter was $52.9 billion, and we achieved double-digit growth in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Germany, The Netherlands, Turkey, Russia and Mexico. Our growth rates were even higher, over 20%, in many other markets, including Brazil, Scandinavia, the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe, India, Korea and Thailand.
Gross margin was 38.9%, at the high end of our guidance range. That's a sequential increase from 38.5% in the December quarter, which is particularly impressive given the seasonal loss of leverage, sequential foreign exchange headwinds of 100 basis points and cost pressures on certain commodities. Operating margin was 26.7% of revenue, and net income was $11 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $2.10, an increase of 10% over last year, and cash flow from operations was strong at $12.5 billion.
For details by product, I'll start with iPhone. We sold 50.8 million iPhones, and we reduced iPhone channel inventory by 1.2 million units in the quarter compared to a reduction of about 450,000 a year ago. So our iPhone performance was slightly better than last year on a sell-through basis.
We had very solid iPhone growth in 4 of our 5 operating segments and experienced especially strong results in Western Europe, the Middle East and our Rest of Asia Pacific segment, all areas of the world where iPhone sales were up double digits. iPhone ASP was $655, up from $642 a year ago, thanks to a strong mix of iPhone 7 Plus and in spite of unfavorable foreign exchange rates. We exited the March quarter within our 5- to 7-week target channel inventory range.
Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are very strong not only with consumers, but also with business users. In the U.S., the latest data from 451 Research on consumers indicates a 96% customer satisfaction rating among iPhone 7 owners and 98% for iPhone 7 Plus. Among corporate smartphone buyers, iPhone customer satisfaction was 95%, and of those planning to purchase smartphones in the June quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.
Turning to Services. We generated $7 billion in revenue, an increase of 18% year-over-year and our best results ever for a 13-week quarter. We're very happy with this strong level of growth, especially given the tough compare to last year as the busy week between Christmas and New Year's fell within the March fiscal quarter a year ago but was included in the December fiscal quarter this year. As we said last quarter, our goal is to double the size of our Services business by 2020.
The App Store established a new all-time revenue record and grew 40% year-over-year. We continue to see growth in average revenue per paying account as well as the number of paying accounts across our content stores during the quarter. In fact, the quarterly increase in the number of paying accounts was the largest that we've ever experienced. And according to App Annie's latest report, the App Store continues to be the preferred destination for customer purchases, generating twice the revenue of Google Play during the March quarter.
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. Revenue was up 14% year-over-year and set a new March quarter record. We sold 4.2 million Macs, up 4% over last year compared to 0 growth in the PC market according to IDC's latest forecast. Demand for MacBook Pro was very strong, helping to drive overall portables growth of 10%, twice the growth of the portables market. We ended the quarter at the low end of our 4- to 5-week target range for Mac channel inventory.
Turning to iPad, we sold 8.9 million units, which was ahead of our expectations despite supply constraints throughout the quarter. We are very pleased to see iPad growth in the U.S. during the March quarter and revenue growth worldwide for our 9.7-inch and larger iPads over the last 4 quarters. iPad channel inventory was essentially flat from the beginning to the end of the quarter, and we exited just below our 5- to 7-week target range.
iPad remains very successful in the segment of the tablet market where we compete. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad had 81% share of the U.S. market for tablets priced above $200. And in February, 451 Research measured consumer satisfaction rates for iPad that ranged from 95% for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro to 100% for the 12.9-inch version. Among U.S. consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next 6 months, purchase intention for iPad was 69%. Corporate buyers reported a 96% satisfaction rate and a purchase intent of 68% for the June quarter.
All our products continue to be extremely popular and drive mobile transformation in the enterprise market. We set a new enterprise revenue record for the March quarter, and we expect this momentum to continue for the remainder of the year.
Recently, Volkswagen selected iPhone as their corporate standard smartphone. So 620,000 employees around the world had the opportunity to enjoy the best-in-class mobile experience that iPhone offers. And Capital One has reimagined the customer banking experience by empowering their associates with Mac and Apple Watch and over 40 native iOS applications now running on nearly 30,000 iPhones and iPads.
We're also seeing strong momentum with our enterprise partners who are helping us deliver long-lasting innovation and differentiation for iOS versus competing platforms. The Deloitte partnership is off to a great start with more than 115 customer opportunities in the pipeline across 15 different industries. SAP released the SAP cloud platform, SDK for iOS, at the end of March, and over 3 million SAP developers now have an even better means to develop powerful iOS-native apps for the enterprise.
The partnership with Cisco enables optimized performance of iOS devices over their networks and is generating a large and growing pipeline of sales opportunities across multiple verticals, including health care and financial services. And our partnership with IBM continues to drive greater productivity and innovation with IBM MobileFirst for iOS apps now in more than 3,300 client engagements. And with its Mobile at Scale offering, IBM recently closed an agreement to deploy 11,000 iOS devices at Santander Bank to drive digital transformation.
Our retail and online stores produced great results with strong revenue growth in all our geographic segments and 18% growth overall. Visitors to our retail and online stores were up 16% over last year, and we added 4 new stores during the March quarter. And with the opening of our store in Dubai last week, we're now at 495 stores in 18 countries.
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $256.8 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $10.8 billion. $239.6 billion of this cash or 93% of the total was outside the United States. We issued $11 billion in debt during the quarter, bringing us to $88.5 billion in term debt and $10 billion in commercial paper outstanding.
We returned over $10 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid $3 billion in dividends and equivalents, and we spent $4 billion on repurchases of 31.1 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We also launched a new $3 billion ASR, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 17.5 million shares. And we retired 6.3 million shares upon the completion of our ninth accelerated share repurchase program in February. All these activities contributed to a net diluted share count reduction of 66.3 million shares in the quarter. We have now completed $211.2 billion of our $250 billion capital return program, including $151 billion in share repurchases.
As Tim mentioned, today, we're announcing an update to our program, which we're extending by 4 quarters through March of 2019 and increasing its size to a total of $300 billion. Once again, given our strong confidence in Apple's future and the value we see in our stock, we're allocating the majority of the program expansion to share repurchases.
Our board has increased the share repurchase authorization by $35 billion, raising it from the current $175 billion level to $210 billion. We will also continue to net share settle vesting employees' restricted stock units.
In addition, we're raising our dividend for the fifth time in less than 5 years. As we know, this is very important to many of our investors who value income. The quarterly dividend will grow from $0.57 to $0.63 per share, an increase of 10.5%. This is effective with our next dividend, which the board has declared today, payable on May 18, 2017, to shareholders of record as of May 15, 2017.
With over $12 billion in annual dividend payments, we're proud to be one of the largest dividend payers in the world, and we continue to plan for annual dividend increases going forward. In total, with this updated program, during the next 8 quarters, we expect to return $89 billion to our investors, which represents about 12% of our market cap at the current stock price.
We expect to continue to fund our capital return program with current U.S. cash, future U.S. cash generation and borrowing from both domestic and international debt markets. We will continue to review capital allocation regularly, taking into account the needs of our business, investment opportunities and our financial outlook. We will also continue to solicit input on our program from a broad base of shareholders. This approach will allow us to be flexible and thoughtful about the size, the mix and the pace of our program.
As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $43.5 billion and $45.5 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.6 billion and $6.7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $450 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%.
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.",1673

How are you able to expand gross margin sequentially and guide rather seasonally for the June quarter in light of what's going on in the memory market? And maybe if you can comment, in particular, whether the holdback of payments to Qualcomm is benefiting you at all on gross margins year-on-year, and also whether your contracts around commodity prices is likely to hit gross margins by more in the back half of this calendar year.",84

Let me take one by one. Let me start with our performance for the March quarter, which we were very happy with. As you said, we were up 40 basis points sequentially, and this is in spite of the fact, as you know, that we lose leverage as we go from the December quarter to the March quarter. The foreign exchange headwind on a sequential basis was 100 basis points. Obviously, that was also a negative. And as you said, we started to experience some level of cost pressure on the memory side, particularly on NAND and DRAM. To offset that and actually do better than that, we had very good cost performance on other commodities. And the fact that our Services mix increases as we go through the year, that is, of course, also helping given the profile of our gross margin for Services. So that answers the question around Q2. As we move into the June quarter, as you know, we tend to have some level of gross margin compression as we go from the March quarter to the June quarter. Again, the majority of that comes from the sequential loss of leverage. We also have a different mix of products as we move into the June quarter. And the cost pressures on memory will remain. We expect to offset partially these impacts with other cost efficiencies and again, with a mix shift towards Services. Yet, the impact on NAND and DRAM will continue to be there, and we expect it to be there. We don't guide past the June quarter, but we expect it to be there for the time being. On Qualcomm, I just want to make it very, very clear that we are accruing. We do not expect to be paying more than what we are accruing right now. So we didn't get any benefit in our P&L, in our margins during the March quarter, and we're not getting any benefit during the June quarter either.",338

As you noted in your remarks, the iPhone 7 Plus demand is selling incredibly well, and this is a product that was pretty severely supply constrained in the December quarter. And I just wonder whether there are any lessons learned as you go forward into future product launches around how you manage the timing of announcing a product when there's supply constraints and how you might work with the supply chain differently around ramping some of these components that have particular difficulties around the yields early on.",94

Katy, one of the things that we did not get right was the mix between the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. There was -- wound up the demand was much stronger to the 7 Plus than we had predicted. And so it took us a little while to adjust all the way back through the supply chain and to bring iPhone 7 Plus into balance, which occurred in this early -- this past quarter. What have we learned from it? Every time we go through a launch, we learn something. And you can bet that we're brushing up our models, and we'll apply everything we learned to the next time.",113

Thanks for the question, Shannon. We saw in Q2 the -- a performance that, combined with Q1 and that formed the first half of the year, was much better than what we experienced in the second half of last year. And if you look at what was driving that, iPhone 7 Plus, we sold the highest number of Plus models in the first half than ever before compared to 6s Plus or compared to the 6 Plus. We -- also the Mac business did extremely well. The Mac revenue growth was up 20% in China, and we had extremely strong Services growth during the quarter in China. As I've mentioned in the -- in my comments, our retail and online stores did well overall, and in China. They grew by 21%, which is an acceleration from what we had seen in the previous quarter. And traffic, which, for us, is incredibly important in the retail stores because we do a lot more than sell, traffic was up 27% year-on-year. And now 7 of our top 10 highest traffic stores in the world are in Greater China. And so that's the set of things that sort of went in our direction, so to speak. On the flip side, currency devalued by 5%, and so that's not an insignificant headwind. And our performance continued to be weak in Hong Kong, which has been hit a bit harder as the tourism market continues to slump. Also where the iPhone 7 Plus did well, we didn't perform as well on some of the previous generation iPhones. And so that's sort of the set of things on the plus and minus side. We did perform about where I thought we would. I thought it would be similar to the previous quarter and it was. What I now believe is that we'll improve a bit more during this current quarter, not back to growth but improve -- but make more progress. And we continue to believe that there's an enormous opportunity there. And in the scheme of things, our business is pretty large there.",349

So I'm curious as to -- given some of the commentary that's come out of the administration, which I think most companies were expecting some sort of return, how do you generally think about what you need to run the business from a cash perspective, how you think about the balance sheet from a, I don't know, strength perspective, just as we look forward to what hopefully will come through?",111

We've been pretty consistent during the last 5 years. Essentially for the last 5 years, the way we've run the company is essentially to return our free cash flow to our investors. That's what we've done with the program until now, and the expansion of the program that we've announced today goes in the same direction, right? We know how much we need to invest in the business. We will never under-invest in the business. We're in a very fortunate position that we generate cash beyond the needs that we have. And given the current capital structure that we have, we decided that until now we return about 100% of the free cash flow to investors. It's difficult for us to speculate about what might or might not happen. The program that we're announcing today reflects the current tax legislation in this country. And there's a lot that still needs to happen there, and we'll see. Obviously, we will reassess our situation if things change.",176

We don't disclose into this number of subscriptions. Of course, we're just giving you the total count of subscriptions that are out there. Of course, there are several customers that subscribe to more than one of our services. There is some level of overlap, but the total number of subscribers is very, very large, obviously less than 165 million. But it's very good for us to see the breadth of subscriptions that we offer and that customers are interested in. It's a large number. And if you remember, we quoted the same number a quarter ago, and we talked about 150 million. So when you think about a sequential increase of 15 million subscriptions from the December quarter to the March quarter, it really gives you a sense for the momentum that we have on our content stores, right? It's quite impressive to add 15 million subscriptions in 90 days. On -- as we look at the dynamics that are happening on our content stores and particularly on the App Store, which is the largest, we see fairly consistently 2 things. We see that the number of paying accounts is growing a lot. And I mentioned the increase in number of paying accounts that we've had during these last 90 days is the largest that we've ever had. So this very large number of people coming into the ecosystem, experiencing the ecosystem, which is obviously improving all the time in quality and quantity, and then start paying and transacting on the -- on our stores. And that number is growing very, very strongly, strong double digits. What we're also seeing, as we look at the people that start paying on our stores, we see a pretty common trend over time, and we keep track of that across cohorts of customers, that as people come into the ecosystem and start paying on the ecosystem, we see a spending profile that is very similar around the world. People start at a certain level, and then they tend to spend more over time. And so obviously, the combination of people spending more over time and adding more people that are now actually spending on the stores contributes to this 40% growth that Tim mentioned for the App Store on a year-over-year basis.",384

Tim, I wanted to just ask -- the Services revenue keeps growing, and of course, the profit contribution from that is growing.

The Watch, some people consider disappointing. It had what seems to be a very good quarter, and ironically, the competition almost seems to be fading in that part of the market right now. The AirPods, of course, are doing well. Do you see wearables, a, expanding over time into a broader product line; and b, increasingly being independent of the iPhone longer term?",72

We have seen the Watch as a really key product category for us since before we launched it. And we took our time to get it right, and we've made it even better with the Series 2 offering. And we're really proud of the growth of the business. The Watch units more than doubled in 6 of our top 10 markets, which is phenomenal growth, particularly in a non-holiday quarter. And so we couldn't be more satisfied with it. When -- as some people are doing, when you begin to combine that -- combine the Watch revenues with the revenues for AirPods, this was the first -- as you know, this is the first full quarter of shipments for AirPods, but it's still very much in the ramping mode. And we're not coming close to satisfying the demand. And then add the Beats products that our -- a group of our customers really enjoy as well and look on the trailing 12 months. So this is not a forecast. That business was well into the Fortune 500. And so as I look at that, that's pretty fast to come that far. The Watch hasn't been out very long, and AirPods have been out there for 3, 4 months. And so we feel really great about it. Where does it go? I wouldn't want to comment on that, but we do have a really great pipeline here. And I think in terms of competition falling out and so forth, it's -- the watch area is really hard. It, in essence, from an engineering point of view, is similar to a phone in terms of the intricacies and so forth. And so it's not -- I'm not very surprised that some people are falling out of it. But we're very committed to it and believe that -- it's already a big business and believe over time it will be even larger.",323

First, Tim, I'm wondering if you can comment on your recent decision and the rationale for withholding royalty payments to Qualcomm. And really specifically, I wonder what you believe is the risk that Qualcomm could have a detrimental response such as withholding modem chip sales or potentially even getting an injunction on iPhones in select geographies around the world. And I'd like to understand your perspective on whether either of those are real risks to any degree and why would Apple potentially take on those risks just in advance of what will arguably be your most significant and largest product launch in history.",108

FRAND stands for fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms. That's both the price and the business terms. Qualcomm has not made such an offer to Apple, and so I don't believe that a -- I don't believe anyone's going to decide to enjoin the iPhone based on that. I think that there's plenty of case law around that subject. But we shall see. In terms of why we're withholding royalties, you can't pay something when there's a dispute about the amount. You don't know how much to pay. And so they think we owe some amount. We think we owe a different amount. And there hasn't been a meeting of the minds there, and so at this point, we need the courts to decide that unless we are able to, over time, settle between us on some amount. But right now we're depending upon the courts to do that, and so that is the thinking. The reason that we're pursuing this is that Qualcomm's trying to charge Apple a percentage of the total iPhone value, and they do some really great work around standards-essential patents, but it's one small part of what an iPhone is. It's not -- it has nothing to do with the display or the Touch ID or a gazillion other innovations that Apple has done. And so we don't think that's right. And so we're taking a principled stand on it, and we strongly believe we're in the right. And I'm sure they believe that they are, and that's what courts are for. And we'll let it go with that.",291

If I try and adjust for the drawdown in inventory and the extra week last quarter, I think sequentially, iPhones declined about 27% if I make those adjustments. And that's actually quite a bit lower than the normal seasonality we would see from Q1 to Q2, which is typically closer to 20%. I understand your comments around China, but your comparison was 40 points easier this quarter relative to last quarter, and the growth rate improved only marginally, I think, when you adjust for the extra week. So -- and then you made a final comment around a pause on iPhones. So I'm wondering if you could maybe elaborate on was the below sequential, at least by my calculation, growth rate in Q2 attributable to a pause. And can you characterize what you think upgrade rates are doing, perhaps broadly by geography, to help us better understand what might be happening or whether there are competitive dynamics that also are at play here that, again, might be contributing to that pause and that sequential decline that I referenced?",196

Let me give you some color as I see it. In this quarter, we reduced channel inventory by 1.2 million units. And so if you look on a year-over-year basis, which is primarily what we look at from a unit point of view because it would have the seasonality embedded in that, we grew sell-through on a year-over-year basis. Last quarter, sure other folks remember, was a 14-week quarter, and so you sort of have to adjust the rates last quarter to get at what the underlying sell-through growth was. And so I think that when you do that, you're going to find that, actually, the year-over-year performance is similar between the quarters. In terms of upgraders, we saw the largest absolute number of upgraders ever in any 6-month period in the first half of this year, first half of this fiscal year to be precise. And we saw the largest absolute number of switchers outside of Greater China in the same period that we've ever seen. And so in 4 of the 5 operating segments, as I think Luca mentioned in his comments, we had very good growth, and it was really propelled by the demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which is growing incredibly fast around the world. And so that's kind of the color I would add there, and hopefully, some of that are -- is useful for you.",236

Do you think that, say, this next 12, 18 months is going to be a turning point? Or is it more you need to work with the government to have Apple-owned stores or production there?

And we agree that we are underpenetrated there. Our growth rates are good, really good in -- by most people's expectations. Maybe not mine as much. And so we're putting a lot of energy in it, just like we have in other geos that eventually wound up producing more and more. And so I'm very excited about it. The 4G network investment really began rolling in, in a significant way toward the last quarter of last year, as you know, and -- but they are moving fast.

Today, we're proud to announce very strong results for our fiscal third quarter, with unit and revenue growth in all of our product categories. We'll review our financial performance in detail, and I'd also like to talk about some of the major announcements we made in June at our Worldwide Developers Conference. It was our biggest and best WWDC ever, and the advances we introduced across hardware, software and services will help us delight our customers and extend our competitive lead this fall and well into the future.
For the quarter, total revenue was at the high end of our guidance range at $45.4 billion. That's an increase of 7% over last year, so our growth rate has accelerated in 3 successive quarters this fiscal year. Gross margin was also at the high end of our guidance, and we generated a 17% increase in earnings per share. 
iPhone results were impressive with especially strong demand at the high end of our lineup. iPhone 7 was our most popular iPhone and sales of iPhone 7 Plus were up dramatically compared to 6s Plus in the June quarter last year. The combined iPhone 7 and 7 Plus family was up strong double digits year-over-year. One decade after the initial iPhone launch, we have now surpassed 1.2 billion cumulative iPhones sold.
Services revenue hit an all-time quarterly record of $7.3 billion, representing 22% growth over last year. We continue to see great performance all around the world with double-digit growth in each of our geographic segments. Over the last 12 months, our Services business has become the size of a Fortune 100 company, a milestone we've reached even sooner than we had expected. 
We had very positive results for iPad, with broad-based growth in units, revenue and market share. iPad sales were up 15% year-over-year and grew across all of our geographic segments. We achieved our highest global market share in over 4 years based on IDC's latest estimate of tablet market results for the June quarter. 
And in markets like China and Japan, over half of iPads sold were to people buying their very first iPad. Our iPad product lineup is stronger than ever. The new iPad we launched in March offers great value and performance, and the all-new 10.5-inch iPad Pro launched in June features the world's most advanced display with ProMotion technology and is more powerful than most PC desktops.
iPad is the perfect tool for teaching in new and compelling ways, and our iPad results were especially strong in the U.S. education market where sales were up 32% year-over-year to over 1 million units. We believe that coding is an essential skill that all students should learn. We're thrilled that over 1.2 million students of all ages are now using iPad and Swift Playgrounds to learn the fundamentals of coding, and over 1,000 K-12 schools across the United States plan to use Apple's Everyone Can Code in their curricula this fall. 
And for high school and community college students who want to pursue careers in the fast-growing app economy, we announced App Development with Swift, an innovative full year curriculum designed by Apple engineers and educators and provided free to schools to teach students to code and design fully functional apps, gaining critical job skills in software development and information technology.
I'd like to turn now to Mac, which gained global unit market share and reached new June quarter unit sales records in Mainland China and Japan. Mac revenue grew 7% year-over-year, driven by the strength of the MacBook Pro and iMac despite IDC's latest estimate of a 4% unit contraction in the global PC market. And with the refresh of almost our entire Mac lineup in June, we're off to a great start for the back-to-school season.
Sales of Apple Watch were up over 50% in the June quarter, and it's the #1 selling smartwatch in the world by a very wide margin. Apple Watch is having a positive impact on people's health and daily lives and motivating them to sit less and move more. With features like built-in GPS and waterproofing, Apple Watch Series 2 is the perfect companion for hiking, running and swimming.
We're also seeing incredible enthusiasm for AirPods, with 98% customer satisfaction based on Creative Strategies' survey. We have increased production capacity for AirPods and are working very hard to get them to customers as quickly as we can, but we are still not able to meet the strong level of demand. 
We made some big announcements during the June quarter that I'd like to quickly review. We launched a new investment in the future through our advanced manufacturing fund. We've earmarked at least $1 billion for this program aimed at helping our manufacturing partners develop innovative production capabilities and create high skill jobs in the United States. We believe this can lay the foundation for a new era of technology-driven manufacturing in the U.S. 
The first $200 million from the fund has been committed to Corning to support R&D, capital equipment needs and state-of-the-art glass processing. And as we announced at WWDC, we have a very exciting fall ahead with stunning advances in iOS 11, macOS High Sierra and watchOS 4. 
iOS 11 will make iPhone better than ever with Apple Pay peer-to-peer payments, an even more intelligent and natural Siri, new expressive Messages with full-screen effects, richer and more powerful Maps, enhanced live photos, Memories and portrait mode effects and much, much more. iOS 11 will also take the iPad experience to a whole new level, with features such as a customizable dock, Multi-Touch drag-and-drop, powerful new multitasking, more efficient QuickType and great new markup and scanning capabilities.
One of the most exciting and most promising announcements from WWDC was the introduction of ARKit, a new set of tools for developers to create augmented reality apps. It's still early in the beta period, but it's clear that ARKit has captured the imagination of our developer community. We think ARKit will help the most creative minds in the industry tap into the latest computer vision technologies to build engaging content. 
We believe AR has broad mainstream applicability across education, entertainment, interactive gaming, enterprise and categories we probably haven't even thought of. With hundreds of millions of people actively using iPhone and iPad today, iOS will become the world's biggest augmented reality platform as soon as iOS 11 ships.
With iOS 11, we're also bringing the power of machine learning to all Apple developers with Core ML, enabling capabilities like space detection, object tracking and natural language interpretation. Core ML lets developers incorporate machine learning technologies into their apps with all the processing done right on device so it respects our customers' data and privacy.
For Mac, we've provided a peek at the immersive gaming 3D and virtual reality experiences made possible with the upcoming release of macOS High Sierra and the amazingly powerful new iMac Pro. We're proud to make the best personal computers in the industry and are very excited to deliver even more innovation in the months to come.
Apple Watch will become more intelligent than ever this fall with watchOS 4, featuring a proactive Siri watch face, personalized activity coaching and an entirely new music experience. watchOS 4 also introduces GymKit, a groundbreaking technology platform to connect workouts with cardio equipment. 
We also previewed HomePod, a breakthrough wireless speaker for the home that delivers amazing audio quality and uses spatial awareness to sense its location in the room and adjust the audio automatically. Visitors to our listening room at WWDC were blown away by the HomePod's incredible sound, which is unlike any other wireless home speaker on the market. 
With deep knowledge of music, HomePod is designed to work with your Apple Music subscription to help you enjoy the music you already love as well as to discover great new music based on your personal preferences. As an intelligent home assistant, HomePod is a great way to send messages, set a timer, get updates on new sports and weather or control smart HomeKit devices by simply asking Siri to turn on the lights, close the shades or activate a theme. We can't wait to deliver all of these powerful innovations in the months to come, and we might even have some others to share with you later in the year.
Now for more details on the June quarter results, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca.",1420
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2017",2017-08-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3503.0,1265293.0,51236454.0,Presenter Speech,Luca Maestri,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the June quarter was $45.4 billion, up 7% over last year, an acceleration to the growth rate we recorded during the first half of our fiscal year. We achieved these results despite a 200 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange on a year-over-year basis as currency movements, especially in Europe and China, affected our reported results.
Our performance was very strong across the board, with growth in all our product categories and almost every market around the world. We achieved double-digit revenue growth in many developed markets, including the U.S., Canada, Germany, Spain, Australia and Korea, and emerging markets outside of Greater China grew 19% over a year ago. 
Gross margin was 38.5%, at the high end of our guidance range. Operating margin was 23.7% of revenue and net income was $8.7 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, up 17% over last year, and cash flow from operations was $8.4 billion.
During the quarter, we sold 41 million iPhones and reduced iPhone channel inventory by 3.3 million units, leaving us with our lowest level of channel inventory in 2.5 years and well within our 5- to 7-week target inventory range. iPhone sales were up year-over-year in most markets we track, with many markets in Asia, Latin America and the Middle East growing unit sales by more than 25%. We are very pleased with these iPhone results, especially considering the tough comparison to the June quarter last year when we launched iPhone SE.
iPhone ASP was $606, up from $595 a year ago, thanks to strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which represented a higher percentage of the iPhone mix compared to the Plus model a year ago. The impact of the stronger mix on ASP was partially offset by negative foreign exchange year-over-year and the reduction in channel inventory, which took place entirely at the high end of the portfolio.
Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are very strong with both consumers and business users. In the U.S., the latest data from 451 Research on consumers indicates a 95% customer satisfaction rating for iPhone 7 and 99% for iPhone 7 Plus. Among consumers planning to buy a smartphone, purchase intention for iPhone was nearly 3x the rate of our closest competitor. Among corporate smartphone buyers, iOS customer satisfaction was 94%. And of those planning to purchase smartphones in the September quarter, 78% plan to purchase an iPhone.
Turning to Services. We set an all-time quarterly record of $7.3 billion, up 22% year-over-year. The App Store was a major driver of this performance. And according to App Annie's latest report, it continues to be, by a wide margin, the preferred destination for customer purchases, generating nearly twice the revenue of Google Play. 
Revenue from our Apple Music streaming service and from iCloud storage also grew very strongly. And across all our Services offerings, the number of paid subscriptions reached over 185 million, an increase of almost 20 million in the last 90 days alone.
The reach, usage and functionality of Apple Pay continue to grow. We launched Apple Pay in Italy in May, and the UAE, Denmark, Finland and Sweden are scheduled to go live before the end of this calendar year. Apple Pay is, by far, the #1 NFC payment service on mobile devices, with nearly 90% of all transactions globally. Momentum is strongest in international markets where the infrastructure for mobile payments has developed faster than in the U.S. In fact, 3 out of 4 Apple Pay transactions happen outside the U.S. And with the launch of iOS 11 this fall, our users in the U.S. will be able to make and receive person-to-person payments quickly, easily and securely.
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. Thanks to great performance from the new MacBook Pro, we generated 7% revenue growth over last year and gained share in the global PC market based on the latest data from IDC. Customer satisfaction for Mac is very strong at 97% in the most recent survey from 451 Research, and our active installed base of Macs has grown double digits over a year ago. We ended the quarter within our 4- to 5-week target range for Mac channel inventory, and we have a great lineup of Macs for our customers heading into the busy back-to-school season.
Turning to iPad. We sold 11.4 million units, up 15% over last year. We were happy to see iPad growth in each of our geographic segments, with strong double-digit increases in key markets such as the U.S., Japan, Germany, France and Greater China. We exited the quarter within our 5- to 7-week target range for iPad channel inventory. 
NPD indicates that iPad had 55% share of the U.S. tablet market in the month of June, including 8 of the 10 best-selling tablets. That's up from 46% share a year ago. And among tablets priced over $200, iPad's share was 89%. In addition, the most recent survey from 451 Research measured business and consumer satisfaction rates ranging from 95% to 99% across iPad models. And among those planning to buy tablets, purchase intent for iPad was over 70%.
Our enterprise business continues to expand and our customers are transforming the way work gets done with iOS and iPad. Walmart will be deploying more than 19,000 iPads for employee training across 50 states, with projections of over 225,000 associates trained on iPad by the end of the year. 
The initial response from businesses to iOS 11 and the new iPad Pro has been amazing. And companies, including Bank of America, Medtronic and Panera tell us that they will be rolling out the 10.5-inch iPad Pro throughout key areas of their organizations. 
We're also seeing real traction with our enterprise partners. Just last month, we unveiled the next set of technology enhancements in our partnership with Cisco. This new wave adds a whole new category of security features designed to help enterprises and employees defend against growing cyber threats. We believe this investment in our joint security solutions for iOS will make cyber insurance even more attainable for businesses.
SAP is making great strides since launching the SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS in March, with a pipeline of hundreds of global opportunities. SAP has also released SuccessFactors Mobile, its first native iOS app for human resources, which will support 47 million iPhone and iPad users worldwide across multiple industries.
And our partnership with Deloitte has recently expanded to several more European countries. We're helping clients transform their businesses with iOS, with jointly developed programs such as the Connected Store, a pop-up version of a retail environment demonstrating iOS tools for sales and demand generation as well as tailored apps for safe associates, store management and customers.
We also had a tremendous quarter for iPad in education, up 32% year-over-year. Following the launch of our new iPad in March, an update to our popular Classroom app and continued enhancements to iOS that make managing iPads in the classroom even easier. The Saint Paul Public School district in Minnesota is renewing its 1:1 program by deploying over 40,000 iPads across every student and teacher in the district. iPad was chosen because of its power and durability, ease of use, multimedia and accessibility features and the extensive Catalog of iOS apps designed specifically for education.
The Shawnee Mission School District outside Kansas City recently purchased 19,000 iPads, extending its 1:1 program started in 2014, thanks to iPad's intuitive interface, superior reliability and expansive ecosystem of iOS tools for education. 
It was a very busy quarter for our retail and online stores, which collectively welcomed over 300 million visitors. In addition to our spectacular new store at the Dubai Mall, we opened our first stores in Singapore and in Taiwan during the quarter, expanding our total store footprint to 497 stores. 
In May, we kicked off Today at Apple, with new in-store programming from music to photography to art and coding and our stores collectively hosted 87,000 sessions during the quarter. As Tim mentioned last quarter, we have entered a new chapter in retail with unique and rewarding experience for our customers and some stunning new stores coming in the near future.
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $261.5 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $4.7 billion. $246 billion of this cash, 94% of the total, was outside the United States. We retired $3.5 billion of debt and issued the equivalent of $10.8 billion in new euro- and U.S. dollar-denominated debt during the quarter, including our second green bond, bringing us to $96.4 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding. 
We also returned $11.7 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid $3.4 billion in dividends and equivalents and spent $4.5 billion on repurchases of 30.4 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We launched a new $3 billion ASR program, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 15.6 million shares. And we retired 3.4 million shares upon the completion of our 10th ASR during the quarter. We have now completed $222.9 billion of our $300 billion capital return program, including $158.5 billion in share repurchases.
As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $49 billion and $52 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.7 billion and $6.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $500 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%.
Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.63 per share of common stock payable on August 17, 2017, to shareholders of record as of August 14, 2017.
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.",1662

Gross margin guidance is strong, but it did tick down from your June quarter guidance. And you also narrowed the range to 50 basis points. I wonder if you could just address, what is the driver of the sequential downtick, and what gives you confidence that you have more visibility than you did 3 months ago?",61

That's the primary driver. This happens fairly regularly for us. We also have a more difficult memory pricing environment this year than a year ago. And we think that we're going to be able to partially offset this with a positive leverage. As you've seen, we've guided up sequentially in revenue. So those are the major puts and takes. In terms of the range that we use for gross margins, we have a fairly good understanding on where we are with our hedging program, and that allows us to mitigate some of the volatility there. So we felt we could guide to a slightly narrowed range, which we've done occasionally in the past.",131

As you outlined on this call and at the developer conference in June, there is an unprecedented number of products that either ramped to volume or launched in the back half of this year. So appreciating you only formally guide a quarter out, I wonder if there's any qualitative commentary you can provide to help us think about the back half of this calendar year and how all those new products that come into the model could impact either revenue seasonality versus past years or could impact just the costs associated with ramping that many products all at once.",108

I think obviously, there's -- continues to be strong demand for smartphones but perhaps mix shift, I think you brought back the iPhone 6 this quarter to be a bit more price aggressive. And then can you just talk a bit about how you see that market developing with the growth of WeChat and some of the other developments that are happening there?",75

We were very encouraged by the results this quarter. We improved, as we thought we would, from the previous quarters a little more than I thought we would. If you look underneath the numbers, Mainland China was actually flat year-over-year during Q3. And in constant-currency terms, we were actually up 6% in Mainland China. And so we're very encouraged by that. iPad grew dramatically more than the market. The Mac grew much more than the market. iPhone was relatively flat year-on-year as the same sort of -- similar as the market was. And so we see all of those as very encouraging signs. On top of that, Services grew extremely strongly during the quarter. The -- Hong Kong continued to drag down the total Greater China segment. And -- but on a sequential basis, we're probably sort of at the trough of that, which is nice. With the peg to the dollar there, from a currency point of view and tourism being what it is, I don't really know when that market will come back. But what I -- what we see in the mainland is definitely much more encouraging. It's interesting to note that upgraders through -- both for the quarter and actually for the full fiscal year to date was our highest ever. And so that we felt very good about. In terms of WeChat, the way that I look at this is because our share -- because iOS share is not nearly a majority of the market in China, the fact that a lot of people use that, it makes the switching opportunity even greater. And I think that's more the case than the risk that a lot of folks have pointed out. And so I see Tencent as one of our biggest and best developers. They've done a great job of implementing a lot of iOS features in their apps. And we're looking forward to working with them even more to build even greater experiences for our mutual users in China.",338

And then can you talk a bit about the composition of the installed base of iPhones at this point as obviously, we're getting close to a refresh? Just you brought in the iPhone SE. You've obviously had strength at the high end. I'm just trying to think about like what percent do you think have upgraded in the prior generation? Any color you can give us on that?",69

However, if you look at it from an upgrade rate point of view instead of the absolute number, the rate is similar to what we saw with the previous iPhones, except for iPhone 6, which as we've called out in the past, had an abnormally high upgrade rate. We do think that based on the amount of rumors and the volume of them, that there's some pause in our current numbers. And so where that affects us in the short term, even though we had great results, it probably bodes well later on.",121

And then a government question. First of all, the President suggested that you may build 3 big beautiful plants. I wonder if you'd comment on if that's a possibility, either directly or indirectly.

24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2017",2017-08-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3503.0,1265293.0,51236470.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,19,"Sure. Starting with the U.S. -- and let me just take this question from what are we doing to increase jobs, which I think is probably where it's rooted. There's -- we've created 2 million jobs in the U.S. and we're incredibly proud of that. We do view that we have a responsibility in the U.S. to increase economic activity, including increasing jobs because Apple could have only been created here. And so as we look at that 2 million, there are 3 main categories of that, and we have actions going on in each of them to further build on that momentum. The first category is app development, about 3/4 of the 2 million are app developers. And we're doing an enormous amount of things to deliver curriculum to both K-12 with Swift Playgrounds and the K-6 area; other curriculum, as you proceed beyond Grade 6, under the Everyone Can Code area. And just a couple of months ago, we announced a new curriculum that's focused on community schools and community colleges, junior colleges, technical colleges for kids that did not have coding in their elementary and high school years. And so we're excited about that because we think it could increase the diversity of the developer community and the quantity. And I think this area, in general and all the things we do for the developer community, will be the largest contribution that Apple can make because this is the fastest-growing job segment in the country, and I think will be for quite some time. If you look at the second area, it's -- we have purchased or we purchased last year about $50 billion worth of goods and services from U.S.-based suppliers. Some significant portion of those are manufacturing-related, and so we've asked ourselves, what can we do to increase this? And you may have seen that at the beginning of the quarter, sometime in April, I believe, we announced a fund, an advanced manufacturing fund that we're initially placing $1 billion in. And we've already deployed $200 million of that. And the first recipient is Corning in Kentucky and they'll be using that money to expand the plant to make very innovative glass. And we purchase that glass and essentially export it to the world with iPhones and iPads. We think there's more of these that we can do. I think there's probably several plants that can benefit from having some investment to grow or expand or even maybe set up shop in the U.S. for the first time. So we're very excited about that. And then the third area is we have about 2/3 or so of our total employee base is in the U.S. despite only 1/3 of our revenues being here. And we'll have some things that we'll say about that later in the year. And so that's what we're doing from a job growth point of view and we're very, very proud of that. If you -- now turning to China. Let me sort of comment on what I assumed is at the root of your question about this VPN kind of issue. Let me just address that head on. The central government in China, back in 2015, started tightening the regulations associated with VPN apps. And we have a number of those on our store. The -- essentially, as a requirement to -- for someone to operate a VPN, they have to have a license from the government there. Earlier this year, they began a renewed effort to enforce that policy, and we were required by the government to remove some of the VPN apps from the App Store that don't meet these new regulations. We understand that those same requirements are on other app stores, and as we checked through that, that is the case. Today, there's actually still hundreds of VPN apps on the App Store, including hundreds by developers that are outside China. And so there continues to be VPN apps available. We would obviously rather not remove the apps, but we -- like we do in other countries, we follow the law wherever we do business. And we strongly believe that participating in markets and bringing benefits to customers is in the best interest of the folks there and in other countries as well. And so we believe in engaging with governments even when we disagree. And in this particular case, now back to commenting on this one, we're hopeful that over time, the restrictions that we're seeing are loosened because innovation really requires freedom to collaborate and communicate. And I know that, that is a major focus there. And so that's sort of what we're seeing from that point of view. Some folks have tried to link it to the U.S. situation last year and they're very different. In the case of the U.S., the law in the U.S. supported us. It was very clear. In the case of China, the law is also very clear there. And like we would if the U.S. changed the law here, we'd have to abide by them in both cases. That doesn't mean that we don't state our point of view in the appropriate way; we always do that. And so hopefully, that's a little bit probably more than you wanted to know but I wanted to tell you.",890

At various points in the past, you've told us the rate at which that was growing. At the end of the first half, what is that up year-on-year? What rate is it growing? Could you give us some sense of that? And on upgrade rates over the longer term, there's lots of moving parts and I get that there's, I guess, geographic mix shift on your base. There's any new phones that you may or may not bring out and how carriers promote your products. But do you think this rate of upgrade is sustainable? Do you think it gets faster over time? How should we think about the major drivers as you foresee see for it?",127

And so I think there's many, many factors in that it's not a simple thing that you can apply a set formula to -- or one variable or a couple of variable formula, in my opinion. And -- but I think in general, because our installed base is -- was up strong double digit once again, there's a lot of factors that are very positive for us. And between the upgraders and the switchers that we see and still -- the first-time buyer category is still out here, too, in several countries, including some that you may not think there is, there is still sizable base in some. Between those 3 areas, I think we have a lot of opportunity.",168

Luca, typically, in the fiscal Q4, Apple builds considerable iPhone channel inventory like 2 million or 3 million units. You're starting from a very low point at the end of fiscal Q3 as you mentioned on the call with the drawdown.

We've never done that. We are providing a fairly wide range from a revenue standpoint, so obviously, that also has an impact on potential channel inventory levels. One thing that I would tell you is that we feel very good about the performance of the business right now. We think that our Services business will continue to grow well. We've got a lot of momentum on iPad and Mac because we refreshed the lineups of those products. Watch and AirPods are doing incredibly well. We're getting a lot of positive customer feedback.

Tim, I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about 2 things that you mentioned in public before. One is television, which you have described as an area of intense interest. But I don't even think there was an update on Apple TV on this call, so perhaps you can talk to us about how you're thinking about content. I know you're doing some original content creation and how that area is evolving and your thinking. And then recently, you talked about how Apple is focusing on autonomous systems for automobiles. And there's been press reports that Apple's been testing autonomous vehicles for potentially up to a year. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about Apple's interest in autonomous vehicles and whether self-driving is really likely to be Apple's principal focus in the near to medium term.",146

It's focused on Apple Music. Currently, we have some more that's launching in a week or so that will be made available on Apple Music. The objective of this is really twofold. The one is for our own learning, given that we're new in the video space in terms of creation; and two is to give the Apple Music subscribers some exclusive content and hopefully grow our subscriber base. And we've recently hired 2 great folks with lots of experience in creating content like Breaking Bad and The Crown and some really top-notch content. And so we'll see how this area goes, but it's still an area of great interest. In terms of autonomous systems, what we've said is that we are very focused on autonomous systems from a core technology point of view. We do have a large project going and are making a big investment in this. From our point of view, autonomy is sort of the mother of all AI projects. And the autonomous systems can be used in a variety of ways, and a vehicle is only one, but there are many different areas of it. And I don't want to go any further with that.

One that is very, very important for us is the fact that the App Store, which is the largest of our Services categories, is seeing an increasingly larger amount of paying accounts. On a year-over-year basis, the number of accounts that are actually transacting and paying on the App Store is growing very, very well. It is happening for a variety of reasons. One of them, for example, is the fact that we are making it easier for customers to pay on the App Store. Outside the United States, in many markets, not every form of payment is accepted. We're making it easier all the time. We launched on Alipay, for example, in China during the December quarter. That has obviously helped a lot with the growth in the number of paid accounts. And we continue to bring more and more forms of payment in the App Store around the world. That's a big reason for that. The other reason why the number of paying accounts is growing is the fact that the quality and the quantity of content continues to improve, and so there's many more ways of experiencing games and entertainment and other apps on the store. We have other businesses like the Apple Music streaming service, which is growing very fast because we just started it a couple of years ago, so we are getting a lot of new subscribers there. Our iCloud storage business continues to grow very, very fast. So it's multiple services. The number of people transacting on our stores continues to grow. In terms of ARPU, and maybe I can make a comment on ARPU specifically related to the App Store. What we're seeing and we've seen over a long period of time as we keep track of these cohorts of customers, we see that as customers get on the App Store and start spending on it, we see this profile, spending profile is very similar across generations of customers. People tend to spend more over time. Obviously, you have different spending profiles in different geographies around the world, but in general, you see that trend across the board.",398

On the iPhone side, there's been a large amount of discussion, I guess, in blogs and among your component suppliers that the timing this time may be somewhat different and delayed versus past. Your guide almost seems you're more excited about this iPhone launch versus historically if the sequential growth is better.

I know iPhone grew about 2% year-over-year this quarter, and it looks like you had about a mid-teens market share in units in 2016. So as we look forward, maybe 3 to 4 years, do you think Apple can expand its unit market share? And if so, what will the drivers be? And my second question is just about India, general thoughts around India in the quarter.",83

We don't predict those things. But yes, if you ask me what I think, that's what I think. And so what are the drivers? The installed base is growing. It's still growing very strongly. That will generate more upgrades over time. I feel good about our ability to convince people to switch. And where the developed markets, the first-time buyer rates are down other than places like Japan perhaps. The emerging markets, we haven't even got started yet really. And from a revenue point of view, we had very strong growth there on emerging markets ex China, we're up like 18% year-on-year. It was a record for us. So we see a lot of opportunity in these markets. We are investing in India. As you mentioned in your second point, we've already launched an app accelerator center, that's on top of working with the channel and looking at expanding our go-to-market in general. And we've began to produce the iPhone SE there during the quarter, and we're really happy with how that's going, and so we're bringing all of our energies to bear there. I see a lot of similarities where China was several years ago. And so I'm very, very bullish and very, very optimistic about India.",229

As we closed the books in 2017, I have to say I couldn't be more excited about Apple's future. This was our biggest year ever in most parts of the world with all-time record revenue in the United States, Western Europe, Japan, Korea, the Middle East, Africa, Central and Eastern Europe and Asia. 
We had particularly strong finish this year, generating our highest September quarter revenue ever as year-over-year growth accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter. Revenue was $52.6 billion, above the high end of our guidance range and up 12% over last year. 
We generated revenue growth across all of our product categories and showed all-time record results for our Services business. As we expected, we returned to growth in Greater China with unit growth and market share gains for iPhone, iPad and Mac. In fact, it was an all-time record quarter for Mac sales in mainland China as well as an all-time high for Services revenue. 
And revenue from emerging markets outside of Greater China was up 40% with great momentum in India, where revenue doubled year-over-year. We also had great results in enterprise and education with double-digit growth in worldwide customer purchases of iPad and Mac in both markets. Gross margin for the September quarter was at the high end of our guidance range, and thanks to exceptional work by our teams, we generated record fourth quarter earnings per share of $2.07, up 24% from a year ago. 
iPhone sales exceeded our expectations. In the last 1.5 week of September, we began shipping iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus to customers in more than 50 countries. They instantly became our 2 most popular iPhone models and have been every week since then.
As we speak, the launch of iPhone X is now underway as stores open across Australia and Asia. iPhone X is packed with innovative new technologies that chart our path for the next decade. Technologies like the TrueDepth camera system, Super Retina display and A11 Bionic chip with neural engine, which has been in development for years with a focus on deep machine learning. 
iPhone X enables totally new experiences, like unlocking your iPhone with Face ID, taking photos with studio-quality lighting effects or playing immersive augmented reality games. We can't wait for people to experience our vision of the future. Orders have already been very strong and we're working to get iPhone X into customers' hands as quickly as possible. 
Turning to Services.  Revenue reached an all-time quarterly record of $8.5 billion in the September quarter. A few quarters ago, we established a goal of doubling our fiscal 2016 Services revenue of $24 billion by the year 2020, and we are well on our way to meeting that goal. 
In fiscal 2017, we reached $30 billion, making our Services business already the size of a Fortune 100 company. We're also delighted to report our second consecutive quarter of double-digit unit growth for iPad. Customers have responded very positively to the new iPad lineup. And with the launch of iOS 11, the iPad experience has become more powerful than ever with great new features for getting things done, like the new dock, files app, drag-and-drop, multitasking and more power than most PC notebooks. 
The launch of iOS 11 also made iOS the world's largest platform for augmented reality. There are already over 1,000 apps with powerful AR features in our App Store today, with developers creating amazing new experiences in virtually every category of apps aimed at consumers, students and [ business ]users alike. Put simply, we believe AR is going to change the way we use technology forever. 
We're already seeing things that will transform the way you work, play, connect and learn. For example, there are AR apps that let you interact with virtual models of everything you can imagine, from the human body to the solar system. And of course, you experience them like they're really there. Instantly, education becomes much more powerful when every subject comes to life in 3D. And imagine shopping, when you can place an object in your living room before you make a purchase, or attending live sporting events when you can see the stats on the field. AR is going to change everything. 
iOS 11 is also allowing developers to integrate machine learning models into their apps with Core ML. Pinterest is already using Core ML to deliver fast and powerful visual search. PadMapper uses Core ML to provide intelligent features that make it easy to find or rent your apartment. And VisualDx is even pioneering new health diagnostics with Core ML, automating [ scanned ] image analysis to assist dermatologists with their diagnosis. These are just a few examples. There's so much more to come.
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac, which had its best year ever, with the highest annual Mac revenue in Apple's history. It was also the best September quarter ever with Mac revenue growth of 25% driven by the notebook refreshes we launched in June and a strong back-to-school season. 
The Mac experience has become even better since the September launch of macOS High Sierra with new technologies to make Mac more reliable, capable and responsive and lay the foundation for future innovation. 
Moving on now to Apple Watch.  With unit growth of over 50% for the third consecutive quarter, it continues to be the best selling and most loved smartwatch in the world. We began shipping Apple Watch Series 3 just 6 weeks ago and customers love the new freedom of cellular. The ability to go for a run with just your Apple Watch or go for a quick errand without your phone while staying connected is a game changer. 
Now more than ever, Apple Watch is the ultimate device for healthy life and is already making a big difference in our customers' lives. We're very excited about the upcoming launch of the Apple Heart Study, which will use data from Apple Watch to identify irregular heart rhythms and notify users when unusual patterns are detected. 
Earlier this week, we introduced watchOS 4.1, bringing 40 million songs to your wrist through Apple Music. The combination of music streaming on Apple Watch and AirPods is truly a magical experience for people on-the-go. We're thrilled with the momentum of these products. In fact, our entire wearables business was up 75% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and, in fiscal 2017, already generated the annual revenue of a Fortune 400 company. 
Late in the September quarter, we also launched Apple TV 4K, delivering a stunning cinematic experience at home. So now users around the world can watch movies and shows in 4K HDR quality and stream live sports and news on the Apple TV app. There's already a great selection of 4K HDR titles available through iTunes and other popular video services with many more movies and shows on the way.
We're also very excited about the opening of Apple Michigan Avenue 2 weeks ago on Chicago's riverfront. This is the first store that brings together our complete vision for the future of Apple retail, providing a welcoming place for everyone to experience our products, services and inspiring educational programs right in the heart of their city. 
In addition to our very popular Today at Apple programming, which is available in all Apple stores around the world offering daily sessions in photography, music creation, art and design, coding and entrepreneurship, Apple Michigan Avenue is partnering with local nonprofits and creative organizations to make an ongoing positive impact in that community.
Also this quarter, we expanded our free app development with Swift curriculum to more than 30 community colleges across the country. We're very excited about this initiative and we're thrilled by the momentum we're seeing. The schools we've launched with this summer are just the beginning. Community colleges have a powerful reach into communities where education is the great equalizer, and the colleges adopting our curriculum this academic year are providing opportunity to millions of students to build apps that will prepare them for careers in software development and information technology and much more. We're incredibly enthusiastic about what our teams have accomplished this year and all the amazing products in our lineup.
As we approach the holiday season, we expect it to be our biggest quarter ever. I'd like to thank all of our teams, our partners and our customers for their passion, commitment and loyalty. You've helped us make 2017 a sensational year. 
Now for more details on the September quarter results, I'd like to turn over the call to Luca.",1440

Revenue for the September quarter was a record $52.6 billion, up 12% over last year, and it has been a -- great to see our growth rate accelerate in every quarter of fiscal 2017. 
Our terrific performance this quarter was very broad-based with revenue growth in all our product categories for the second quarter in a row and new September quarter revenue records in the Americas, in Europe and in the rest of Asia Pacific segments. We grew double digits in the U.S., Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Korea and several other developed markets. 
We were especially happy to return to growth in Greater China, where revenue was up 12% from a year ago; and with our momentum in India, where revenue doubled year-over-year. We grew more than 30% in Mexico, the Middle East, Turkey and Central and Eastern Europe. These results helped fuel overall growth over the 20% from emerging markets.
Gross margin was 37.9% at the high end of our guidance range. Operating margin was 25% of revenue and net income was $10.7 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $2.07, up 24% over last year to a new September quarter record, and cash flow from operations was strong at $15.7 billion. 
During the quarter, we sold 46.7 million iPhones, up 3% over last year. We were very pleased to see double-digit iPhone growth in many emerging markets, including mainland China, the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe, India and Mexico. We gained share, not only in those markets, but also in Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Singapore, based on the latest estimates from IDC. 
iPhone channel inventory increased by 1.3 million units sequentially to support the launch of iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, significantly less than the increase in the September quarter a year ago. Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are very strong with both consumers and business users. 
In the U.S., the latest data from 451 Research on consumers indicates a customer satisfaction rating of 97% or higher across all iPhone models. Among consumers planning to buy a smartphone in the next 90 days, purchase intention for iPhone was 69%, more than 5x the rate of the closest competitor with a loyalty rate for current iPhone owners of 95% compared to 53% for the next highest brand.
For corporate smartphone buyers, iOS customer satisfaction was 95%. And of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 80% plan to purchase iPhone. That is the highest score for iPhone in the history of the survey. 
Turning to Services.  We set an all-time quarterly record of $8.5 billion, up 34% year-over-year. Our results included a favorable onetime revenue adjustment of $640 million. On a run-rate basis, excluding this adjustment, services growth of 24% was terrific and the highest that we have experienced this year. 
The App Store set a new all-time record. And according to App Annie's latest report, it continues to be the preferred destination for customer purchases by a wide and growing margin, generating nearly twice the revenue of Google Play. We're getting great response to the App Store's new design in iOS 11 from both customers and developers. We're seeing increases in the frequency of customer visits, the amount of time they spend in the store and the number of apps they download.
The success of Apple Music also continues to build, and we're seeing our highest conversion rates from customers trying the service. Revenue grew strongly once again in the September quarter and that number of paid subscribers was up over 75% year-over-year. We also saw great performance from our iCloud business, with very strong double-digit growth in both monthly average users and revenue. 
Across all of our services offerings, the number of paid subscriptions reached over 210 million at the end of September quarter, an increase of 25 million in the last 90 days. 
Apple Pay expanded to Denmark, Finland, Sweden and the UAE last month and continues to grow rapidly. Over the past year, active users have more than doubled and annual transactions are up 330%. In the U.S., 70% of leading groceries chains are now accepting Apple Pay with the recent launch of Safeway. And over 5 million U.S. merchant locations will be Apple Pay enabled by the end of this year. 
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac, which for fiscal '17 set a new all-time revenue record of $25.8 billion. We sold 5.4 million Macs during the September quarter, up 10% over last year, and gained significant market share as the global market contracted by 1% based on IDC's latest estimate. This performance was fueled primarily by great demand for MacBook Pro, and Mac revenue grew 25% to a new September quarter record. We had outstanding results all around the world with each of our geographic segments growing Mac revenue by 20% or more. We are also very happy with the success of Mac in the education market, where customer purchases grew double digits year-over-year.
It was also another great quarter for iPad. We sold 10.3 million units, up 11% over last year with strong demand for both iPad and iPad Pro, and revenue grew 14%. It was great to see iPad unit and revenue growth in all of our geographic segments and particularly strong results in emerging markets, including Greater China, where iPad unit sales were up 25% year-over-year; and India, which grew 39%.
NPD indicates that iPad has 54% share of the U.S. tablet market in the September quarter, including 7 of the 10 best-selling tablets. That's up from 47% share a year ago. Also, the most recent surveys from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction rates of 97% across iPad models. And among people planning to buy tablets, purchase intent for iPad was over 70% for both consumers and businesses. 
We're seeing great momentum with our enterprise initiatives. During the September quarter, we announced a new partnership with Accenture, who is creating a dedicated iOS practice in select locations around the world. Experts from Apple are co-locating with this team, and together they'll be launching new tools and services that help enterprise clients transform how they engage with customers using iPhone and iPad. Examples include services to build new customer experiences and to facilitate iOS integration with enterprise systems, to help businesses take greater advantage of data from Internet of Things platforms and to enable the smooth transfer of existing legacy applications and data to modern iOS apps. 
And last month, we announced a partnership with GE to reinvent the way industrial companies work by bringing GE's industrial IoT platform to iOS. The Predix SDK for iOS will enable developers to build native apps to drive industrial operations with more efficiency and speed than ever before. GE is also standardizing on iPhone and iPad for its global workforce of more than 330,000 employees; and working with Apple, GE is developing iOS apps for both its internal and external audiences to bring predictive data and analytics to workers across a broad range of industries. 
Beyond our iOS devices, we're also seeing great traction for Mac in the enterprise market with all-time record customer purchases in fiscal year 2017. The September quarter was very strong for our retail and online stores, which welcome 418 million visitors. Traffic was particularly heavy during the week of our new product announcements, up 19% over last year. Retail ran a very successful back-to-school promotion in the Americas, Europe, China and Singapore, with sales for Mac and iPad Pro up strong double digits compared to last year's program. 
And around the world, our stores conducted over 200,000 Today at Apple sessions during the quarter. Let me now turn to our cash position. 
We ended the quarter with $268.9 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $7.4 billion. $252.3 billion of this cash, 94% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion in new Canadian and U.S. dollar-denominated debt during the quarter, bringing us to $104 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding. We also returned $11 billion to investors during the quarter, and we paid $3.3 billion in dividends and equivalents and spent $4.5 billion on repurchases of 29.1 million Apple shares through open-market transactions. We also launched a new $3 billion ASR program, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 15.1 million shares, and we retire 4.5 million shares upon the completion of our 11th ASR during the quarter. We have now completed almost $234 billion of our $300 billion capital return program, including $166 billion in share repurchases.
As we move ahead into December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. 
As a reminder, the December quarter in fiscal '17 spans 14 weeks, whereas the December quarter this year will include the usual 13 weeks. We expect revenue to be between $84 billion and $87 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $7,650,000,000 and $7,750,000,000. We expect OI&E to be about $600 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. 
Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.63 per share of common stock payable on November 16, 2017 to shareholders of record as of November 13, 2017. 
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.",1581

The -- we increased market share for iPhone, Mac and iPad during the quarter. We hit all-time revenue records for services and for Mac in the -- for the PRC during the quarter. We had very strong iPad revenue growth. We had double-digit unit growth in iPhone, and both the upgraders and Android switchers were both up on a year-over-year basis during the quarter. And so, the results were broad based. They were pretty much across the board, as I indicated. The other thing that happened is that the decline that we've been experiencing in Hong Kong moderated. And so it's still down year-over-year, but less so than it was. And part of that is the compare is an easier compare. And then, finally, in terms of another headwind that is a little less than it was, currency has been affecting us more significantly last quarter in China. It affected us 1 percentage point.

But I would share with you that the iPhone X orders are very strong for both direct customers and for our channel partners, which as you know, are lots of carrier throughout the world.

The reason I'm so excited about AR is I view that it amplifies human performance instead of isolates humans. And so, as you know, it's the mix of the virtual and the physical world. And so it should be a help for humanity, not an isolation kind of thing for humanity. As I go through different countries, as I've been traveling lately and looking at things, some things in the market, other things that are coming, the very cool thing is they're all over the place. I see things that the consumer's going to love because it's going to change shopping. I see things that consumers will love on the gaming side and the entertainment side. I see business-related AR apps as well that are going to be great for productivity and between small and large business. And I see apps that makes me want to go back to K-12 again and repeat my schooling because I think it changes the game in the classroom a lot. And so the real beauty here is that it's mainstream. And of course, Apple is the only company that could have brought this, because it requires both hardware and software integration and it requires sort of making a lot of -- or giving the operating system update to many people at once. And we -- and the software team worked really hard to make that go back several versions of iPhone so that we sort of have hundreds of millions of enabled devices overnight. And so there's 1,000-plus in the App Store right now. I think this is very much like in 2008, when we fired the gun in the overall App Store. And so, that's what it feels like to me, and I think it will just get bigger from here.",304

The first, Tim, can you talk a bit about how you're thinking in terms of the lineup? You go from $340 -- and this is for iPhone. You go from $349 to above $1,000, and it appears that you probably sold a fair amount of the lower end, perhaps that was just some of the switchers in China and maybe drove some of the growth in China in terms of market share. But how are you sort of thinking about what went into the guidance for the December quarter? Are you seeing really strong demand at the low end? And obviously, expected benefit from the X at the high-end. I'm just trying to understand, because you have such a broader lineup than you've had in prior years.",130

And we've tried hard to have an iPhone that is as affordable as possible for people that really want an iPhone that may have a more limited budget, and we've got some iPhones that are really great for that market. And then, we've got 3 new iPhones, and people will look at these and decide which one they want. And so we -- this is the first time we've ever been in the position that we've had 3 new iPhones at once like this at the top end of the line. And it's the first time we've had a staggered launch. And so, we're going to see what happens. But we've put our absolutely best thinking that we have here in the guidance that Luca presented. And you can tell from that, that we're bullish.",162

And then, in terms of services, $8.5 billion, up 34%. Can you talk about some of the portions of that, that outperformed? How sustainable?

As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, there was a $640 million adjustment. There was a one-off change. And it's important to call it out because, of course, it's a one-off. And so, the underlying growth rate for services in the quarter was fantastic, was 24%, the highest growth rate that we've had for services during fiscal '17. So the business is going incredibly well. I would highlight maybe 3 of these businesses within services. The App Store set a new all-time record. It's growing incredibly well. The number of paying accounts continues to grow very strongly, and that's very, very important to us for the App Store business. Apple Music was up -- subscriptions were up 75% year-over-year. We're getting the highest conversion rates that we've had since the launch of the service. And so we turned the corner in music. You remember that a few years ago, we were actually declining in music; now with the streaming service in addition to the download business, the business is growing again. And that really helps the growth rate for the entire Services business. iCloud is a service that continues to grow very strong double digits, and that's also helping. So we already become the size of a Fortune 100 company. We set a goal for ourselves to double what we did in fiscal '16 and the trajectory is actually quite positive.",235

Could you comment whether the 8 Plus outsold the 8 in the quarter? There seems to be some data that suggests that. And the 451 Research survey that you're alluding to also finds that over the next 90 days, those buying an iPhone, 43% are planning on buying the X. Could you comment upon your expectations in terms of the mix going forward? And if you won't do that, perhaps you could comment a bit about you're thinking in terms of pushing price elasticity. I think a couple of years ago, no one would have imagined selling a phone at this price. And obviously, you're pretty confident that you can do it.",125

It's not something that we've done in the past. If you look at the 8 and 8 Plus, when we launched them, they instantly became our top 2 selling products. If you look at 8 Plus in particular, to provide a little color there, 8 Plus for that -- for the period of time that we can measure to date, has gotten off to the fastest start of any Plus model. That, for us, was a bit of a surprise, and it's a positive surprise, obviously. And so we'll see what happens next. As I've mentioned before, we've never had 3 products, and it's only today that the first customers can certainly look at all 3 of those. And I'm sure there's been some people that wanted to do that before deciding even which one. And so we'll see what happens there. But in terms of price elasticity, I think it's important to remember that a large number of people pay for the phone by month. And so if you were to go out on the -- just the U.S., since that tends to be more the focus of this call. If you look at the U.S. carriers, I think you would find -- you could buy an iPhone X for $33 a month. And so if you think about that, that's a few coffees a week. It's less than a coffee a day at one of these nice coffee places.  The other thing to keep in mind is that many people are now trading in their current iPhone on the next iPhone. And the residual value for iPhone tends to be the highest in the industry and many people pick up $300, $350 or so for their iPhone. And so that even reduces the monthly payment less. And then, obviously some carriers also have promotional things going on. And so I do think it's important to try to place it in that context. In terms of the way we price, we price to the sort of the value that we're providing. We're not trying to charge the highest price we could get or anything like that. We're just trying to price it for what we're delivering. And iPhone X has a lot of great new technologies in there that are leading the industry, and it is a fabulous product and we can't wait for people to start getting it in their hands.",411

The Street historically has been a little skeptical about continued innovation, and you suggested there is more to grow. Historically, you weren't first to large screens. You weren't first to OLED. Now, though, you're leading in AR. You're leading with Face ID, which [the all-in a year ago, as some of your guys had suggested, was kind of very reminiscent of the aggressive Apple.

You talked a bit about providing a lot of value and that Apple sets its prices according to value. And I think, given the uniqueness of the product you have with the iPhone X in particular, that makes a lot of sense. I guess, the question is, given the uniqueness of the value that you have in the marketplace, why shouldn't we -- should we or why shouldn't we expect gross margins to improve this cycle versus previous ones? And perhaps, you can talk a little bit about how you think about pricing in the context of gross margin. And I have a follow-up, please.",115

When -- you said, we price our products for the value that we deliver.  We also said that every time we launch new products, the cost structures of the new products tend to be higher than the products that they replace. It's inevitable. We are adding new technologies, new features. And therefore, the cost structures go up. We have a very good track record of taking those cost structures and, over the life cycle of the product, we are able to bring them down. There are a lot of elements in the gross margin line that we have good control over and we -- there are also elements that we don't control. Take for example, foreign exchange, which has been a significant headwind for the company for the last 3 years now. Also, the mix of products that we sell into the market tends to change over time. And that also has an impact on the overall gross margin for the company. There are situations where the commodities markets are in good shape. There are situations where commodity markets can be a bit out of balance. We have a case right now around memory pricing, which is a headwind for the time being. So there's many puts and takes. The fact that our Services business is growing should be a positive because our services margins tend to be accretive to company margin. So there's many puts and takes that we tend to think about maximizing gross margin dollars. And -- because we think that's the most important thing for investors at the end of the day.  When we look at our track record over years, I think we found a good balance between unit growth and gross margins and revenue, and we will continue to do that as we go forward.",306

And then, I wanted to revisit this notion of supply and demand. And I realize it's very early and you can't make predictions. I think, a common investor question is the iPhone X was made available for sale; it quickly had pushed out availability levels to unprecedented levels versus history. And so I think the really significant question is, is that initial pushout really a function of uniquely strong demand versus history? Or is that pushout in availability really a function of much weaker supply versus history? So it would be really helpful.  You have in the past commented on first 24-hour orders for which there were 4 million-plus for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. You have, very often on this call, talked about targeting when you think you could reach supply-demand balance. So it'd be really helpful if you could provide some context in terms of what you know either about initial orders or about the supplies versus history that can help investors try and better understand the little data points that they're seeing in terms of availability of the device.",184

We're -- just sold the first units minutes ago. And so we'll see how things go. Until you get all of them out there, where customers have the ability to demo and so forth, I think it's -- I think any kind of mix discussion is very much estimating. And so we put our best estimates in but granted, we've never done this before. So there's no comparison here, with either the 3 iPhones nor the staggered launch.

But you had mentioned great success in India, I believe, Tim.  In your prepared comments, you mentioned, I think, India had doubled year-over-year. Based upon market analysis, it looks like Apple is still just a relatively small sliver of the pie there. So Tim, what would it take to be even more successful in India? Is it a manufacturing footprint there with your partners? Is it more physical stores? Is it lower price points? Is it the bandwidth that has now caught up to many other countries? Or how should we think about that? And then, the follow-up question is on the AR/VR, when will it really show up in your income statement? Are you hoping more for hardware sales or services to the apps or where the excitement will then be monetized within Apple?",153

Growing a market like India is a result of all of those things and doing them all well. And so, it's analogous to the many years that we put into China. It's building stores. It's building channels. It's building markets. It's building the developer ecosystem. It's having the right product lineup for the market. And I feel like we're making good progress there and are gaining understanding of the market, but we still have a long way to go. I don't -- which I sort of see as an opportunity instead of a problem. And I do feel great about the growth rate. And so, that's India. I think it's all of those things. As you know, we -- as I've said, I think we talked about before, we started manufacturing the iPhone SE there 6, 9 months ago. So -- and the majority of iPhone SEs that we sold in the domestic market last quarter were manufactured there. And so we also have that going and are hoping that, that winds up saving some amount of money over time and avoiding some of the compounding of taxes, et cetera. The bandwidth issue has also been an issue, but as you point out, it is being addressed. And between the large carriers there with Bharti and now Jio investing the way they are, the service in India is materially better than it was just 12 months ago. So there's been a sea change there in a short period of time. So I feel good about all that, but we have a long way to go. In terms of the monetization question on AR/VR, we tend to focus first and foremost on customer experience. And so we're all about making sure the experience is great. And we think that if we get the experience right, that revenues and profits will be a result of getting that right. And so we're much -- we're very much focused on the experience right now.",343

So we're guiding 38% to 38.5%. That's up 35 bps sequentially. Obviously, we're getting the leverage from the larger volumes. As I mentioned, I think, to Toni, we have higher cost structures every time we launch new products. So that is going to be the offset. And I mentioned, particularly the impact from the memory pricing environment, which is a headwind at this point. Just to size it for you, the impact of memory on our gross margin is 40 bps sequentially and 110 bps on a year-over-year basis. So they are meaningful impacts.

And I guess, if I could just follow up on the services line. You just talked about it a fair amount earlier, but even if I exclude the onetime gain, it looks like the back half of '17 accelerated by 500 basis points in fiscal '17 versus the first half of '17. Qualitatively or quantitatively, is there a way to think about how much of this is from expanding the installed base, which is 1 of the 3 things you mentioned, I think, versus more dollar per iOS device that you're seeing?",97

As I mentioned, particularly on the App Store, which is very important to us, the number of paying accounts has grown a lot. It's grown a lot because, as you said, the installed base has grown, but also because we have made a number of changes that have made it easier for our customers around the world to participate on the App Store and be able to transact on the Apps Store. We are accepting, for example, more forms of payment today than we were 12 months ago or even 6 months ago. So that's been very important. We also see that there is a typical spending curve for our customers when they start transacting on the store. They start at a certain level and they tend, over time, to get more familiar with the store and they start to spend more. We're also now very recently made some changes, as you probably have seen, to the design of the App Store. And I was mentioning during the prepared remarks that these changes have been received very favorably. And so, people now are spending more time on the store, they download more apps and then, over time, translates into monetization. But we also have other businesses that are growing very, very fast and actually accelerating. I mentioned Music; I mentioned iCloud. And so it all adds up. And as you correctly point out, our growth rate is accelerating.",243
