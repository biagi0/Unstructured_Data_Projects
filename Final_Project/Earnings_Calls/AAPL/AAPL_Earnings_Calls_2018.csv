We're proud to announce the results of a very successful quarter today, setting new March quarter records for both revenue and earnings.
We generated $61.1 billion of revenue. That's up 16% from last year, making it our sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth. Our performance was broad based with iPhone revenue up 14%, Services up 31% and Wearables up almost 50%. We grew in each of our geographic segments, and in Greater China and Japan, revenue was up more than 20%.
iPhone's second quarter performance capped a tremendous fiscal first half with $100 billion in iPhone revenue, an increase of $12 billion over last year, setting a new first half record and achieving our highest first half growth rate in 3 years. iPhone gained share during the quarter based on IDC's latest estimates for the global smartphone market. And customers chose iPhone X more than any other iPhone each week in the March quarter just as they did following its launch in the December quarter. Since we split the line with the launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in 2014, this is the first cycle in which the top of the line iPhone model has also been the most popular.
Q2 was our best quarter ever for Services, and momentum there continues to be incredibly strong. Revenue topped $9 billion for the first time, up more than $2 billion over last year's March quarter. We had all-time record revenue from the App Store, from Apple Music, from iCloud, from Apple Pay and more, all of which are a powerful illustration of the importance of our huge active installed base of devices and the loyalty and engagement of our customers.
Across all our services, paid subscriptions surpassed 270 million, up over 100 million from a year ago and up 30 million in the last 90 days alone, contributing to the overall increase in Services revenue. Apple Pay continues its strong growth with active users more than doubling and transactions tripling year-over-year. We believe the availability of Apple Pay at major transit systems have been a key driver of adoption among commuters. And in March, we launched Express Transit with Apple Pay in Beijing and Shanghai, the second and third largest transit systems in the world. Apple Pay is already the most successful mobile transit payment system in Tokyo, which has the busiest transit system of all. With the launch of Brazil in April, Apple Pay is now available in 21 markets, and we expect Norway, Poland and Ukraine to launch in the next several months.
This was another outstanding quarter for our Wearables business, which includes Apple Watch, Beats and AirPods with combined revenue of almost 50% year-over-year. Looking at its revenue over the last 4 quarters, our Wearables business is now the size of a Fortune 300 company.
Apple Watch had another great quarter with revenue growing by strong double digits year-over-year to a new March quarter record. Millions of customers are using Apple Watch to help them stay active, healthy and connected, and they have made it the top-selling watch in the world. We launched carrier support for Series 3 with cellular in mainland China, Hong Kong and Thailand during the quarter with more markets on the way.
And now with watchOS 4.2, there are more features than ever before. For example, in addition to tracking your workouts and heart rate, skiers and snowboarders can record runs, see vertical descent and calculate speed as well as contribute data directly to the Apple Watch Activity app.
AirPods are incredibly popular, and we're seeing them in more and more places: in the gym, in coffee shops, wherever people are enjoying music on their Apple devices. This product is a runaway hit, and we're working hard to meet the incredible demand. 
We started shipping HomePod in February, and it's widely recognized as having the best audio quality for its size and class. HomePod is a breakthrough speaker that delivers amazing sound, and we believe it will change the way people listen to music at home. It's currently available in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, and we're looking forward to adding new features to HomePod and introducing it to more markets around the world soon.
In March, we announced new products for the education community, including updating our most popular iPad with support for Apple Pencil. It empowers students to be even more creative and productive from learning to code to sketching ideas and jotting down handwritten notes to making up screenshots -- marking up screenshots. And the new iPad's gorgeous Retina display, advanced chip and enhanced cameras and sensors are designed to support the next generation of apps for immersive augmented reality experiences in the classroom.
In addition to our successful Everyone Can Code initiative, we've launched Everyone Can Create. It's a new free curriculum that makes it fun and easy for teachers to integrate drawing, music, filmmaking or photography into their existing lesson plans for any subject. We believe education is the great equalizer, and whether it's through our coding programs, our unrivaled augmented reality platform or the creativity both can unleash, we're proud to help students everywhere reach new frontiers of learning with Apple technology.
In March, we also released iOS 11.3, a major update, offering new immersive augmented reality experiences, access to personal health records in the Health app and more. Apps can now deliver AR experiences that use vertical walls and doors in addition to tables and chairs and can make more accurately mapped irregular shaped surfaces. The update to ARKit that made this possible came just 6 months after we launched the world's largest AR platform.
Also in iOS 11.3, patients in nearly 40 health systems representing hundreds of hospitals and clinics can now consolidate their medical records from multiple sources and view them all in one place right from their iPhone. This data is encrypted and protected with the user's iPhone passcode, and it can help them better understand their health history, have informed conversations with doctors and family members and make future health care decisions.
Consistent with our long-term focus, privacy is a key element of these initiatives for education and personal health. We're relentless about making the best products and experiences in the world while fiercely protecting our users' privacy because we believe privacy is a fundamental human right.
Our environmental initiatives recently passed an important milestone. All of our global facilities across 43 countries are now powered with 100% clean energy. We work with communities around the world to build clean power sources. Apple now has 25 renewable energy projects operational and 15 more under construction. We're also driving our supply chain to use clean energy. As of last month, 23 of our suppliers are committed to operating on 100% renewable energy.
We're now halfway through our fiscal 2018 with nearly $150 billion in revenues and double-digit growth in all of our geographic segments. We generated almost $34 billion in earnings in 6 months, and we're very bullish on Apple's future. We have the best pipeline of products and services we've ever had. We have a huge installed base of active devices that is growing across all products, and we have the highest customer loyalty and satisfaction in the industry.
Our Services business is growing dramatically. Our balance sheet and our cash flow generation are strong, and that allows us to invest significantly in our product road map and still return a very meaningful amount of capital to our shareholders.
Recent corporate tax reform enables us to deploy our global cash more efficiently. In the United States, we expect our direct investment in the economy to exceed $350 billion over the next 5 years, including $30 billion in capital expenditures, and we expect to create over 20,000 U.S. jobs at Apple over that time frame. We're narrowing the site selection for a new U.S. campus, and we look forward to sharing more information on that later this year.
Consistent with our annual cadence, today, we're providing an update on our capital return program. Tax reform makes it possible for us to execute our program more efficiently, both through share repurchases and payment of dividend to the tens of millions of investors who own Apple stock either directly or indirectly from large pension funds to individuals with retirement accounts.
So today, given our strong confidence in Apple's future, we're announcing a significant update to our capital return program. Our Board of Directors has approved a new $100 billion share repurchase authorization as well as a 16% increase in our quarterly dividend effective with our next dividend payable later this month.
Luca will provide more details about our program as well as a more in-depth discussion of the quarter's results. So I'll now turn the call over to him. Luca?",1479
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, May 01, 2018",2018-05-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3463.0,1446519.0,57563518.0,Presenter Speech,Luca Maestri,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased to report record financial results for our March quarter with revenue growth of 16%, EPS up 30%.
Starting with revenue. We generated $61.1 billion, our highest ever for a March quarter. Revenue grew in all of our geographic segments, setting new Q2 records in most countries we track. Performance was very strong in emerging markets where revenue was up 20%, and we were especially pleased to see 21% year-over-year growth in Greater China, our strongest growth rate from that segment in 10 quarters.
We also set Q2 revenue records in the Americas, in Europe and in Japan. Gross margin was 38.3%, essentially flat sequentially as we offset the seasonal loss of leverage with cost improvements and a shift in mix towards services. Operating margin was 26% of revenue. Net income was $13.8 billion, up $2.8 billion over last year and a March quarter record. Diluted earnings per share were $2.73, up 30% to a new record for Q2, and cash flow from operations was very strong at $15.1 billion.
iPhone revenue grew 14% year-over-year with iPhone ASP increasing to $728 from $655 a year ago, driven primarily by the performance of iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. During the quarter, we sold 52.2 million iPhones, up 3% over last year, and we grew iPhone units by double digits in several markets, including Japan, Canada, Switzerland, Turkey, Central and Eastern Europe, Mexico and Vietnam.
Our performance from a customer demand standpoint was even stronger than our reported results as we reduced iPhone channel inventory by 1.8 million units, 600,000 units more than the March quarter reduction last year. We exited the March quarter within our target range of 5 to 7 weeks of iPhone channel inventory.
Our customers are extremely happy with their iPhones. The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates that across all iPhone models, the customer satisfaction rating was 95%, and combining iPhone 8, 8 Plus and iPhone X, customer satisfaction was even higher at 99%. And among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the June quarter, 78% plan to purchase iPhones.
Turning to Services. We had a sensational quarter with all-time record revenue of $9.2 billion, and that's up more than $2 billion from last year, an increase of 31% and double the Services revenue we generated in the March quarter just 4 years ago. Our Services business is growing at a very fast pace all around the world with revenue up more than 25% year-over-year in each of our 5 geographic segments. The App Store set a new all-time revenue record in the March quarter, and Apple Music reached a new record for both revenue and paid subscribers, which have now passed 40 million.
iCloud storage revenue was up by over 50% year-over-year to a new all-time record, and AppleCare revenue grew at its highest rate in 5 quarters, setting a new March quarter record. Our other product category also set a new record for the March quarter with revenue of almost $4 billion. We began shipping HomePod in February, and unit sales of both Apple Watch and AirPods reached a new high for the March quarter. When we combine all our wearables and home products, they accounted for over 90% of the total growth in the other products category.
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac, which set a new March quarter revenue record, including new records in both the Americas and Greater China. We sold 4.1 million Macs, generating year-over-year growth in many emerging markets, including Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, Central and Eastern Europe and India. We were happy to see double-digit growth in our active installed base of Macs to a new all-time high with almost 60% of March quarter purchases coming from customers who are new to Mac.
iPad grew both units and revenue for the fourth consecutive quarter. We sold 9.1 million iPads, and about half of purchases were by customers new to iPad. Growth was particularly strong in Japan, in Latin America, Middle East and Africa and Central and Eastern Europe, all markets where iPad sales were up double digits compared to a year ago. We gained share of the global tablet market based on the latest estimates from IDC, and our active installed base of iPads reached an all-time high. NPD indicates that iPad has 53% of the U.S. tablet market in the March quarter, up from 40% share a year ago. And the most recent customer survey from 451 Research measured iPad customer satisfaction ratings of 95%. And among business customers who plan to purchase tablets in the June quarter, 73% plan to purchase iPads.
We continue to make great strides in the enterprise market. In February, we announced a new cyber risk management solution for businesses with Cisco, Aon and Allianz. This combined approach is an industry first that integrates the most secure technology from Apple and Cisco, cyber resilience evaluation services from Aon and options for enhanced cyber insurance coverage from Allianz. Organizations will now be able to better manage and protect themselves from cyber risks associated with ransomware and other malware-related threats. We are thrilled that insurance industry leaders recognize that Apple products provide superior security.
In March, we announced 2 new services with IBM to bring more dynamic and intelligent insights into apps. IBM Watson services for Core ML and IBM Cloud Developer Console for Apple will enable developers to more easily build native iOS apps that bring together machine learning with artificial intelligence and cloud services.
In health care, iPhones are being used across leading health systems, including Cedars-Sinai, the Mayo Clinic and HCA Healthcare with iOS apps to support clinical workflows, communications and care delivery. In fact, HCA Healthcare recently announced they plan to deploy 100,000 iPhones across their hospital sites within the next 3 years.
We had great performance from our retail and online stores, which produced their highest March quarter revenue ever. Year-over-year growth was led by iPhone as well as strong performance from AirPods and introduction of HomePod. Our stores hosted more than 250,000 of our very popular Today at Apple sessions with a particular emphasis on coding and app design.
During the quarter, we opened beautiful new stores in South Korea and in Austria, our first in both countries. And 3 weeks ago, we opened our newest store in Tokyo, bringing us to 502 stores across the world today.
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $267.2 billion in cash plus marketable securities, and we had $110 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding for a net cash position of $145 billion. We returned nearly $27 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid $3.2 billion in dividends and equivalents and spent $23.5 billion on repurchases of 137 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We also retired 5.7 million shares upon the completion of our 13 ASR during the quarter.
We have now completed over $275 billion of our current $300 billion capital return program, including $200 billion in share repurchases against our cumulative $210 billion buyback program. We will complete the $210 billion program during the June quarter, 3 full quarters sooner than initially planned.
The biggest priorities for our cash have not changed over the years. We want to maintain the cash we need to fund our day-to-day operations, to invest in our future and to provide flexibility so that we can respond effectively to the strategic opportunities we encounter along the way.
As we said 90 days ago, the new tax legislation enacted in December gives us increased financial and operational flexibility from the access to our global cash. It allows us to invest for growth in the United States more efficiently, and it also provides us the opportunity to work towards a more optimal capital structure. As we said in February, our goal is to become approximately net cash neutral over time.
Given our strong confidence in Apple's future and the value that we see in our stock, our board has authorized a new $100 billion share repurchase program, which we will start executing during the June quarter. Considering the unprecedented size of this new authorization, we want to be particularly thoughtful and flexible in our approach to repurchasing shares. Our intention is to execute our program efficiently and at a fast pace. As in the past, we will provide regular updates on our capital return activities at the end of every quarter.
We're also raising our dividend for the sixth time in less than 6 years. As we know, it is very important to our investors' who value income. The quarterly dividend will grow from $0.63 to $0.73 per share, an increase of 16%. This is effective with our next dividend, which the board has declared today payable on May 17, 2018, to shareholders of record as of May 14, 2018.
With over $13 billion in annual dividend payments, we are proud to be among the largest dividend payers in the world, and we continue to plan for annual dividend increases going forward. We will continue to review our capital allocation regularly, taking into account the needs of our business, our investment opportunities and our financial outlook. We will also continue to solicit input on our program from a broad base of shareholders. This approach will allow us to be flexible and thoughtful about the size, the mix and the pace of our program. We expect to provide a new update to our capital allocation plans approximately 12 months from now.
As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $7.7 billion and $7.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $400 million, and we expect our tax rate to be about 14.5%.
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.",1699

Now that we're a couple of quarters out from the launch of the iPhone X, given the $1,000 price point, it's clearly selling, but there's been a lot of questions in the market about sustainability of that price point and how you're thinking about it as you go look out sort of holistically across your lineup. So if you could talk a bit about what you're hearing from your customers on that and then I have a follow-up.",91

As Luca mentioned earlier, our revenues are up 14% year-over-year on iPhone, and that's a combination of single-digit unit growth and ASP growth that is mainly driven by iPhone X. I think that our iPhone line shows that there's a variety of different customers in a market that is as large as the smartphone market, and so we're going to continue to provide different iPhones to -- for folks to meet their needs. On iPhone X specifically, I think it's important to maybe emphasize again one of the things I mentioned in my opening comments that customers chose iPhone X more than any other iPhone each and every week in the March quarter just as they did following the -- following its launch in the December quarter. Also, since we split the line with the launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus back in 2014, this is the first cycle that we've ever had where the top of the line iPhone model has also been the most popular. And so with the customer sat that Luca referenced as well, the 99%, the iPhone X is a beloved product, and so it's -- I think that it's one of those things where like a team wins the Super Bowl. Maybe you want them to win by a few more points, but it's a Super Bowl winner. And that's how we feel about it. I could not be prouder of the product.",244

We hit an all-time record at $9.2 billion, first time we cleared $9 billion. The great news about it is it's not a single geo or a single service. If you look at it, each of the geos, the minimum was at 25%. So each of the geos were -- had -- did extremely well, and we set records from the App Store to the Apple Music, to iCloud, to Apple Pay and more. And underneath that, if you look at the subscriptions, the number of subscriptions, I think I mentioned this in my comments, paid subscriptions have moved up over 100 million on a year-over-year basis to over 270 million by the end of the quarter. And so it's very broad based in terms of type of service and geographic region. It's sort of exactly what we would like to see.

I think history shows us that countries that embrace openness and diversity do much, much better than the ones that are closed. And so I'm a big believer that the 2 countries together can both win and grow the pie, not just allocate it differently.

The -- again, the great thing about Services is there are several services that make up the total that are growing nicely.

This year, we're -- we're not going to release this number every quarter, but we've obviously grown again. And it's growing at a double-digit number on a year-over-year basis. And so with that kind of change in the installed base and with the services that we have now and others that we are working on, I think that this is just a huge opportunity for us and feel very good about the track that we're on.",135

IPhone X was the most popular smartphone in all of China last quarter. And so iPhone X has done well there. In order to hit a number like 21% on the growth that you see on your data sheet there, there has to be several things working well. And the things that have huge growth rates there are the other products category, which is our Wearables business in China and the Services business, which you and I just spoke about. The iPhone obviously had to do extremely well to get a 21% number, and we gained share in the market for the Mac as well. And so there's actually several vectors there that are working well for us. We also -- more broadly on the iPhone, the iPhone was the top 3 selling phones in China. And so it's iPhone X was #1, but we had several in the top.",153

I guess, first one, just touching on the gross margin dynamics. If I look at the guidance for June on a year-over-year basis, I think sales are up double digit, but gross margins are still flat at the high end, maybe down 20 basis points at the midpoint. Can you just talk about what's driving the lack of leverage on the gross margin basis on a year-over-year basis for June?",76

We tend to look at the -- our gross margin dynamics on a sequential basis, and essentially, we're guiding to about flat on a sequential basis. On a year-over-year basis, it's less relevant for our business, but in general, I would say that this year we are seeing a more difficult cost environment.

You're not our product, and so that's how we look at that. In terms of benefit, we don't really view it like that.

The dividend increase of 16% was relatively low relative to what you could have done. So are you really thinking the stock price is attractive here? And you said you would execute the buyback at a fast pace. Can you give us any time frame of that $100 billion? And how much debt do you think about in terms of net cash 0?",74
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, May 01, 2018",2018-05-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3463.0,1446519.0,57563544.0,Answer,Luca Maestri,,Executives,29,"Yes. Let's start with the dividend. We're increasing it by 16%. This is the largest increase that we've done since we've reintroduced the dividend back in August of 2012. So we think it's a very meaningful increase for all the investors that value income. Obviously, when we come down to capital allocation decisions, we obviously also keep in mind that -- the opportunity for us to do some M&A activities, which we do in an ongoing basis. But when it comes down between dividends and buyback, our view is that for a variety of reasons, the -- we see a lot of value in the stock. We believe the stock is undervalued, and so we have a bias towards the buyback. So the dividend is a very large component of capital return because we're going to be returning more than $13 billion a year to investors through dividends. But we believe that given where we are with the valuation of the stock, we think that we continue to do the buyback primarily. We are not giving an end date to the program this time because the amount is very, very large. And so we will -- we would try to execute it. As you've seen from our track record during the last 5 years, we will do that at a very fast pace. But we also want to do it efficiently. We want to make sure that we buy back the stock at the right time. And so with that in mind, we have done $23.5 billion of repurchases during the March quarter. We will give you an update to our activities at the end of every quarter. And then 12 months from now we will actually talk about an update to the entire program. So you will be able to keep track of our progress every 90 days.",309

Let me start with India, and then I'll talk more about China. India, we set a new first half record. So we continue to put great energy there and try to -- our objective over time is to go in there with all of our different initiatives from retail and everything else. And so we're working toward those things. It's a huge market, and it's clear that many people will be moving into the middle class over time as we've seen in other countries. China, I continue to believe is a phenomenal country with lots of opportunity from a market point of view but also lots of opportunity from an app developer point of view. We have almost 2 million application developers in China that are writing apps for iOS and the App Store, and they're doing unbelievably creative work and innovative work. And so we sort of -- we look at China holistically, not only as a market. On the market side, we've seen iPhone X, as I had mentioned before, as being the top-selling smartphone during the quarter. We gained share during the quarter. And I read some notes here and there about the market itself not being good. I think on -- in any kind of -- on a 90-day clock, lots of different things can happen, but my own personal view of China is that it's a great market. And I would -- I'm -- we are certainly looking far beyond 90 days and feel very bullish on the opportunity and the environment there. I would say that the market for us is more than iPhone. The Mac gained share there as well. The Watch is getting some traction there. Services is doing extremely well. And so it has several catalysts, and I'm very pleased with the results that we were able to show during the quarter.",314

And iPhone X is the most innovative product on the market, and as I've said a few times, we have -- they're sort of jam-packed with technologies that really set up the smartphone for the next decade. And so that's how we priced it. We were surprised somewhat that through all of this period of time that the iPhone X winds up at the most selling -- most popular for every week of the time since the launch, and so that's, I think, a powerful point. And it's #1 in China, which is another powerful point. And so obviously, at some point, if those technologies move to lower price points and that -- there's probably more unit demand. But the way we think about it is trying to price a reasonable price for the value that we deliver, and I feel that we did that.",154

So as you -- one, when do you expect these to turn into tailwinds? And when they do turn into tailwinds, do you -- would you consider reinvesting some of those into pricing? Or would you -- like should we think about you flowing those through to the bottom line?",93

I think you're right. I think we've been able to navigate a difficult foreign exchange environment for a number of years. And now as you know, because we have this hedging program, as the dollar has weakened a bit in recent months, although during the last week, it actually started to turn the other way again, we've got the hedging program that works both ways. And also on the memory front, we feel that for NAND, we're going to be turning the corner very soon. For DRAM, we also think that we are near the peak, possibly at the end of this year. And so that should provide some level of stability. As I said earlier this year, I think we are experiencing in total a more difficult cost environment. And so hopefully, that can turn into a positive for us. At the same time, it's very difficult for me to give you an indication of what is going to happen in the future because every product cycle is different, and as you know, we don't provide guidance past the current quarter. There are some elements that we understand quite well and we tend to manage well over the course of the cycle, for example, our cost structures that we are able to manage during -- throughout the year. But there are also elements that are not entirely under our control like foreign exchange. And the mix of products and services that we sell to our customers also has an impact on the overall gross margin. Our primary consideration is always around maximizing gross margin dollars, and that is the approach that we take around, for example, pricing decisions.",292

Tim, strategically, when we talk to investors, they often say, ""Oh, iPhone market is saturated. There's not much room for growth."" Yet when we do our analysis, we kind of still see emerging markets like India and all those still a growth. When you think about India and those markets, do you kind of believe that some of those markets could get to much higher or a more normalized market share that you have in some of the developing countries over time? And can you talk a little bit about some of those efforts you may be doing? And then, Luca, the question for you is about the gross margin. When we think about if component prices start to stabilize, seeing how Apple Services have been so successful and accretive to margins, should we start to look for some potential margin -- gross margin upside, again, should components stabilize?",168
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, May 01, 2018",2018-05-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3463.0,1446519.0,57563557.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,42,"Yes. Jim, thanks for the question. In terms of the -- let me address the smartphone market a bit, and then I'll mention iPhone. In terms of the market in general, if you look at last year, which was the last data point we have on the full market, was -- there were still 0.5 billion feature phones sold in the world. Now many of those were sold into emerging markets, not all of them but many of them, and we still believe that, over time, every phone sold will be a smartphone. And so it seems to us that with that many feature phones being sold, that's a pretty big opportunity. In terms of the iPhone itself, even though we sell quite a few phones across the course of a year, our market share globally is low compared to the -- our sales are low compared to the full market of smartphones. And so the -- our task is to convince people that currently -- or have another type of phone to switch while really taking care of people that have an iPhone so that they choose, when they elect to buy another phone, that they buy another iPhone. And so we spend quite a bit of time on that as you might guess. I do think that India -- India is the third largest smartphone market in the world. There's obviously huge opportunities there for us, and we have extremely large share in that market overall. And so we're putting a lot of energy there and working with the carriers in that market. And they're investing enormously on the LTE networks, and the infrastructure has come quite a way since we began to put a lot of energy in there because of their leadership and so forth. And so I do think -- I don't buy the view that the market's saturated. I don't see that from a market point of view or -- and certainly not from an iPhone point of view. I think the smartphone market is sort of like the best market for a consumer product company in the history of the world. And so that's how I feel about it. It's a terrific market, and we're very happy to be a part of it.",380

Our Services business, and I've said it in the past, is accretive to company margins, and so as we're able to grow the Services business, that should provide a positive, a tailwind. At the same time, within the Services portfolio that we have, we have services that have different levels of profitability, so we also need to take into account the mix of services that we're going to be selling. At a macro level, because about 2/3 of our company is outside the United States, a weak dollar is a positive for our gross margins. A strong dollar, as it's been during the last 4 years, has been a bit of a headwind for the company. We try to make it more stable through the hedging program. And in general, when we look at our process to innovate our products, typically, when we launch a new product, that product tends to have a higher cost structure than the product it replaces. And so that is something that we need to work through every time we launch a new product, and we have a pretty good track record and history of taking those cost structures down over time. So we need to balance all these different elements. I think we've done a pretty remarkable job during the last several years at managing all these different variables and coming up with a level of gross margins that we think is really good for investors. And certainly, it is our plan to continue to manage them that way, but it's very difficult for me to give you a prediction of where gross margins are going to be 6 months or 12 months from now.",300

Today, we're proud to report our best June quarter revenue and earnings ever, thanks to the strong performance of iPhone, Services and Wearables. We generated $53.3 billion in revenue, a new Q3 record. That's an increase of 17% over last year's results, making it our seventh consecutive quarter of accelerating growth, our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth and our strongest rate of growth in the past 11 quarters.
Our team generated record Q3 earnings per share of $2.34, an increase of 40% over last year. We are extremely proud of these results, and I'd like to share some highlights with you.
First, iPhone had a very strong quarter. Revenue was up 20% year-over-year, and our active installed base grew by double digits, driven by switchers, first-time smartphone buyers and our existing customers whose loyalty we greatly appreciate. iPhone X was the most popular iPhone in the quarter once again with a customer satisfaction score of 98% according to 451 Research. Based on the latest data from IDC, iPhone grew faster than the global smartphone market, gaining share in many markets including the U.S., Greater China, Canada, Germany, Australia, Russia, Mexico and the Middle East and Africa.
Second, we had a stellar quarter in Services, which generated all-time record revenue of $9.5 billion fueled in part by double-digit growth in our overall active installed base. We feel great about the momentum of our Services business, and we're on target to reach our goal of doubling our fiscal 2016 Services revenue by 2020.
Our record Services results were driven by strong performance in a number of areas, and I'd like to briefly mention just some of these. Paid subscriptions from Apple and third parties have now surpassed 300 million, an increase of more than 60% in the past year alone. Revenue from subscriptions accounts for a significant and increasing percentage of our overall Services business.
What's more, the number of apps offering subscriptions also continued to grow. There are almost 30,000 available in the App Store today. The App Store turned 10 years old this month, and we set a new June quarter revenue record. The App Store has exceeded our wildest expectations, igniting a cultural and economic phenomenon that has changed how people work, learn and play. Customers around the world are visiting the App Store more often and downloading more apps than ever before. And based on third-party research estimates, the App Store generated nearly twice the revenue of Google Play so far in 2018.
The app economy is thriving, and thanks to the App Store, it's generating jobs for tens of millions of people around the world. Our developers have earned over $100 billion from the App Store since its launch, and we couldn't be more proud of them and what they've accomplished. We're hearing lots of developer excitement around our upcoming OS releases, which I'll talk about more in a moment, and can't wait to see what they can come up with next.
We've experienced rapid growth in our App Store search ad service. And as we announced earlier this month, we are expanding our geographic coverage to Japan, South Korea, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.
We're also seeing strong growth in many of the other services as well. Just a few examples. Apple Music grew by over 50% on a year-over-year basis. AppleCare revenue grew at its highest rate in 18 quarters, partly due to our expanded distribution initiative. Cloud services revenue was also up over 50% year-over-year. Our communication services are experiencing record usage, which hit all-time highs for both the number of monthly active users of Messages and the number of FaceTime calls made, with growth accelerating from the March to June quarters. Siri requests have already exceeded 100 billion so far this fiscal year. And the number of articles read on Apple News more than doubled year-over-year.
Apple Pay continues to expand with well over 1 billion transactions last quarter, triple the amount from just a year ago, with growth accelerating from the March quarter. To put that tremendous growth into perspective, this past quarter, we completed more total transactions than great companies like Square and more mobile transactions than PayPal. Apple Pay is now live in 24 markets worldwide with over 4,900 bank partners, and we look forward to adding Germany later this year. We're excited to share that in the U.S., eBay is beginning to enable its sellers to accept Apple Pay, and CVS Pharmacy and 7-Eleven will roll out Apple Pay acceptance in locations nationwide this fall.
Transit is another important area of growth, and Apple Pay can be used with iPhone and Apple Watch to quickly and conveniently ride public transit in 12 metropolitan areas. Apple Pay Cash, our peer-to-peer payment service, is already serving millions of customers across the U.S. less than 8 months following its launch.
Our third highlight of the quarter is the outstanding results in Wearables, which comprises Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats and was up over 60% year-over-year, with growth accelerating from the March quarter. Our Wearables revenue exceeded $10 billion over the last 4 quarters, a truly remarkable accomplishment for a set of products that has only been in the market for a few years.
Apple Watch delivered record June quarter performance with growth in the mid-40% range. And we're thrilled to see so many customers enjoying AirPods. It reminds me of the early days of iPod when I started noticing white earbuds everywhere I went.
A number of other notable events in the quarter. We expanded distribution of HomePods, 3 additional markets, and we added new immersive listening features with support for HomePod stereo pairs and a new multiroom audio system.
In June, we hosted an extremely successful developers' conference that previewed many major advances coming this fall to our 4 operating systems: iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS. Developer and customer reaction has been very positive, and we have over 4 million users participating in our new OS beta programs.
Starting with iOS 12. Siri will take a major step forward with Siri Shortcuts, which deliver a new, much faster way to get things done and allow any app to work with Siri. We believe this will make Siri even more useful and significantly expand its adoption.
We've also designed performance improvements across iOS 12 to make everyday tasks faster and more responsive. Camera launches up to 70% faster, the keyboard appears up to 50% faster and apps can launch up to twice as fast. It's always been about empowering users to get the most from our products but not about spending all of their time using them. And so we're adding tools to iOS 12 to help our customers understand and take control of the time both they and the family spend interacting with their iOS devices.
Activity Reports will provide information on the amount and nature of time spent on iPhones and iPads, and Screen Time will enable parents to monitor and limit their children's activity from their own iOS devices using Family Sharing in iCloud.
Developers will be able to build even more intelligent apps with just a few lines of code using the power of machine learning with Core ML 2 and Create ML. We've also included our third release of ARKit in only 1 year. With ARKit 2, iOS 12 will provide an even more powerful platform to make dynamic AR apps, integrating shared and persistent AR experiences, object detection and image tracking. We believe AR can enable profound experiences, and Apple is uniquely positioned to provide the best AR experience because of the seamless integration of our hardware and software.
The new capabilities of ARKit 2 will build on the potential of the thousands of AR apps already available in the App Store that are changing the way iPhone and iPad users see and experience the world.
Turning to Mac. We want to empower our developers to bring their innovative apps from the iOS ecosystem to the Mac with minimal effort. Though iOS and macOS are different, they've shared common foundations from the very beginning. So we've taken key frameworks from iOS and adapted them to specific Mac behaviors like using a mouse or trackpad, resizing windows, copy and paste and drag and drop. We started with some of our own apps. So this fall, News, Stocks, Voice Memos and Home will be available on the Mac for the first time with macOS Mojave, and we'll be bringing these great new tools to our developers next year. We believe this will dramatically broaden the ecosystem to benefit all Mac users, creating even more great reasons to choose Mac. Also this fall, the Mac App Store is getting a full redesign with rich editorial content to help customers discover great Mac apps from our developers.
We believe privacy is one of the most important issues of the 21st century, and we're always working to make our products more private and more secure for our users. As we announced at WWDC, beginning this fall, Safari will prevent share buttons and comment widgets on web pages from tracking users without their permission. Safari already protects personal data as users browse the web, so they won't be retargeted by ads.
For Apple Watch, users will see a significant expansion of features and functionality in watchOS 5. Apple Watch will become an even stronger companion for fitness, communication and quick access to information with features including new workouts, activity sharing competitions, auto workout detection, advanced running features, walkie-talkie, podcast and third-party apps on the Siri watch face.
For Apple TV, we've seen major growth in sales since the introduction of Apple TV 4K last fall as video providers around the world choose Apple TV 4K to deliver their subscription services. Later this year, Charter Communications will begin offering Apple TV 4K to its customers in nearly 50 million U.S. households, providing access to live channels and tens of thousands of on-demand programs via the Spectrum TV app on Apple TV 4K, iPhone and iPad.
In tvOS, we'll take the cinematic experience of Apple TV 4K to the next level this fall with support for Dolby Atmos audio and new features to easily find popular shows and movies. Apple TV 4K already offers customers the largest collection of 4K HDR movies. And this fall, iTunes will be the home to the largest collection of Dolby Atmos-supported movies anywhere.
I'm proud that our team's hard work has an impact even beyond these innovative industry-leading products and services. We are always working to leave the world better than we found it. And as part of our commitment to address climate change and increase the use of renewable energy in our supply chain, we recently announced a first-of-its-kind investment fund in China.
Initially, 10 suppliers will join us in investing nearly $300 million over the next 4 years into the China Clean Energy Fund. The fund will invest in and develop clean energy projects totaling more than 1 gigawatt of renewable energy in China, the equivalent of powering nearly 1 million homes.
We're seeing great momentum in our Everyone Can Code and Everyone Can Create initiatives. More than 5,000 schools and community colleges are now teaching Everyone Can Code, and more than 350 schools have committed to incorporating Everyone Can Create into their curricula for the upcoming school year. Coding skills are opening doors for students and job seekers around the world as tremendous growth in the app economy creates opportunity everywhere we look. We're also teaming up with leading educators for blind and deaf communities across the United States, who will start teaching Everyone Can Code this fall.
Looking ahead, we couldn't be more excited about the products and services in our pipeline as well as limitless applications for augmented reality and machine learning technology. We're working with key partners in the enterprise to change the way work gets done with iOS and Mac. We're welcoming communities and offering learning opportunities at our retail locations through hundreds of thousands of Today at Apple sessions each quarter. We're expanding our reach into emerging markets and seeing strong double-digit growth in revenue, and we're making great progress toward our goal of significantly expanding our Services business.
And now for more details on the record June quarter results, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca.",2070
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 31, 2018",2018-07-31,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3595.0,1524098.0,60260713.0,Presenter Speech,Luca Maestri,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report the financial results of our best June quarter ever. As we have done in every quarter this fiscal year, we set new quarterly records for both revenue and earnings per share with revenue up 17% year-over-year and EPS up 40%.
We generated $53.3 billion of revenue with year-over-year growth in all of our geographic segments and new June quarter records in the Americas, Europe, Japan and rest of Asia Pacific. We grew in each of our top 15 markets with especially strong performance in the U.S., Hong Kong, Russia, Mexico, the Middle East and Africa, all places where revenue was up by more than 20%.
Gross margin was 38.3%, flat sequentially, as cost improvements and foreign exchange offset the seasonal loss of leverage. Net income was $11.5 billion, up $2.8 billion or 32% over last year, and it was also a new June quarter record. Diluted earnings per share were $2.34, up 40%, and also a new record for the June quarter. And cash flow from operations was very strong at $14.5 billion.
iPhone revenue grew 20% year-over-year, with iPhone ASP increasing to $724 from $606 a year ago, driven by the strong performance of iPhone X, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus across the world.
During the quarter, we sold 41.3 million iPhones, with double-digit unit growth in several markets including the U.S., Canada, Germany, Switzerland, Mexico, Hong Kong, Russia, the Middle East and Africa. Our performance from a customer demand standpoint was stronger than our reported results as we reduced iPhone channel inventory by 3.5 million units during the quarter. We exited the June quarter towards the lower end of our target range of 5 to 7 weeks of iPhone channel inventory.
Customer satisfaction with iPhone continues to be outstanding and is the highest in the industry. The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates that across all the iPhone models, customer satisfaction was 96%, and combining iPhone 8, 8 Plus and iPhone X, it was even higher at 98%. And among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the September quarter, 81% plan to purchase iPhones, up 3 points from the last survey.
Turning to Services. We had our best results ever with all-time record revenue of $9.5 billion. Services revenue included a favorable $236 million onetime item in connection with the final resolution of various lawsuits. Excluding this amount, Services revenue was still an all-time record, and the underlying growth rate of our Services business was a terrific 28% over last year. We generated double-digit Services growth in all our geographic segments, and the App Store, AppleCare, Apple Music, cloud services and Apple Pay all set new June quarter records.
Our other product category also set a new record for the June quarter with revenue of over $3.7 billion. That's up 37% from last year with great sales momentum for both Apple Watch and AirPods. Apple Watch continues to be the best-selling smartwatch by a wide margin, and units and revenue grew dramatically during the quarter. AirPods continue to be a runaway success, and we've been selling them as fast as we can make them since their launch 1.5 years ago.
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We were very happy to see double-digit year-over-year growth in our active installed base of Macs to a new all-time high, with nearly 60% of purchases during the quarter coming from customers who are new to Mac. Our year-over-year sales performance was impacted by the different timing of the MacBook Pro launch, which did not occur until early Q4 this year as opposed to June last year, with the subsequent channel fill during the June quarter. Even with the difficult launch comparison, we saw great momentum in many emerging markets with growth well into double digits, and we established new June quarter records for Mac sales in India, Turkey, Chile and Central and Eastern Europe.
iPad unit sales grew for the fifth consecutive quarter, and we gained significant share of the global tablet market based on the latest estimates from IDC. We recorded double-digit iPad unit growth in both our Greater China and rest of Asia Pacific segments with a new June quarter record for iPad sales in mainland China. Almost half of iPad purchases in the quarter were by customers new to iPad, and our active installed base of iPads reached a new all-time high. Our overall performance compared to last year was impacted by the introduction of new iPad Pro models in June of last year, which resulted in both a different mix with higher ASPs in channel sales a year ago.
NPD indicates that iPad has 60% share of the U.S. tablet market in the June quarter, up from 51% share a year ago. And the most recent consumer survey from 451 Research measured iPad customer satisfaction ratings of 94%. And among business customers who plan to purchase tablets in the September quarter, 75% plan to purchase iPads.
We continue to make great strides with enterprise customers across multiple industries. For example, financial services institutions are increasingly using iPads to deploy digital signature solutions for customer consent, compliance requirements, new account openings and services transactions. In the railway industry, businesses around the world are using iPhone and iPads to support operations, training, passenger engagement and maintenance activities.
And leading global automotive companies are deploying iPads in dealerships for sales enablement and end-to-end customer service management and are choosing iPhone as the standard mobile device for their employees around the world.
More and more companies are giving their teams a choice when it comes to the devices they use at work. And enterprises, including Salesforce and Capital One, are deploying Macs based on employee preference. In fact, at Salesforce, the majority of their 35,000 employees are using Macs. And companies tell us that Mac has been instrumental in helping them attract and retain talent while providing strong security, streamlined deployment workflow and significantly lower total cost of ownership.
We're also seeing great interest in Business Chat, our powerful new way for organizations to connect with customers. Business Chat lets customers get answers to questions, resolve issues and complete transactions directly from within Messages by starting a conversation on their iPhone or iPad and even continue that conversation on their Mac or Apple Watch.
Dish Network is making Business Chat available to customers across the U.S. to enhance the customer service experience for pay-TV. Customers can instantly reach a live agent with their questions, make account changes, schedule an appointment or order a pay-per-view movie or sporting event, all without leaving the Messages conversation.
And Citizens Bank Park, home of the Philadelphia Phillies, is testing Business Chat with Aramark to handle beverage orders during games. Fans simply use their iPhone camera to scan a QR code on the back of their seats, taking them directly to a Business Chat conversation in Messages. From there, they can order drinks, pay quickly and securely with Apple Pay and have them delivered directly to their seats without missing a moment of on-field play.
Our retail and online stores had a great quarter, thanks to very strong growth from iPhone, AirPods and Apple Watch and the expansion of HomePod to Canada, France and Germany. Our stores hosted more than 250,000 of our very successful Today at Apple sessions. We continue to have content across all Today at Apple topics, including popular new sessions on music and photography. We opened our 50th retail store in Greater China during the quarter, and we just opened a beautiful new store in Milan this month, putting the number of stores located outside the U.S. to 46% of the total.
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $243.7 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We retired $6 billion of debt during the quarter, leaving us with $102.6 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding for a net cash position of $129.1 billion. As we explained in February, we plan to reach a net cash neutral position over time.
We returned almost $25 billion to investors during the quarter, including $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents. We repurchased $20 billion worth of Apple shares, of which $10 billion related to the completion of our previous $210 billion buyback program and $10 billion to the beginning of the new $100 billion authorization we announced 3 months ago for a total of 112.8 million shares repurchased through open market transactions during the quarter.
As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $60 billion and $62 billion. As you will recall, our September quarter results last year included a onetime favorable adjustment of $640 million to our Services revenue. Taking that adjustment into account, our revenue guidance implies year-over-year growth of about 16% to 19%.
We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $7,950,000,000 and $8,050,000,000. We expect OI&E to be about $300 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 15% before discrete items.
Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.73 per share of common stock payable on August 16, 2018, to shareholders of record as of August 13, 2018.
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.",1591

First, for Tim, you're on track to hit your Services revenue target even earlier than planned. So how are you thinking about the next legs of Services growth as you move into the next 3 to 5 years? And then for you Luca, NAND prices are falling this year. Services mix is rising. Those should both positively influence gross margins. And yet, we're seeing gross margin sort of hang out here at 38%. What are the offsetting headwinds? And is it possible that we could see the tailwinds start to overpower those headwinds in the next couple of quarters and see gross margins drift higher?",112

On the Services side, we're thrilled with the results. They were very broad-based. We had double-digit Services growth in all of the geographic segments. And the App Store, AppleCare, Apple Music, cloud services, Apple Pay all set new June quarter records. And then, of course, subscriptions have now passed 300 million as I've mentioned before. And so we're -- we couldn't be happier with how things are going. In terms of the next leg of this, we're -- given the momentum that we're seeing across the board, we feel great about our current services. But obviously, we're also thrilled about our pipeline that have some new services in it as well. And so with the combination of these, we feel great about hitting our objectives and maybe even doing a little better.",140

Starting with the June quarter, typically, we see a decline in gross margin going from the March quarter to the June quarter. Last year, we were down 40 bps, 2 years ago, we were down 140 bps. This year, we were able to keep GM flat sequentially. During the quarter, we always have some loss of leverage because of our typical seasonality. This year, we were able to offset that with some cost improvements, and also we had some favorability in foreign exchange on a sequential basis. Unfortunately, as you know, the U.S. dollar has already appreciated again recently, so we do not expect to see that favorability to repeat during the September quarter. But those are the puts and takes for June, and we're very happy to see gross margin sequentially flat for June. For September, we're also guiding about flat sequentially at the midpoint. As you know, we typically have what we call product transition costs during the September quarter. And this year, we also have about 30 bps of headwind from foreign exchange, again because the dollar has appreciated recently. We expect those 2 factors to be offset by positive leverage because we've seen the revenue guidance that we provided and the mix to Services that you've actually mentioned during your question. So we feel pretty good about most of the guidance for the fourth quarter. Looking forward, you know we don't provide guidance beyond the current quarter, but I think we have a pretty good record over the last several years to make good business decisions, balancing units, revenue and margins. As you know, foreign exchange has been a very significant headwind over the last 3-plus years, but we've been able to manage that. On the memory front, it is true that prices have started to decline. It has been a significant headwind for the last 12 to 18 months and still in the June quarter was negative. We believe that we're going to start seeing some improvement from here on.",367

ASPs were above expectations. And now that you've had -- and that was clearly better than some of the comments from some of your competitors. Now that you've had about 9 months of experience with the high-end fully featured phone, can you talk a bit about what you think customers want, what the elasticity of demand is and how you're sort of thinking about your competitive position? And then I have a follow-up.",85

Shannon, we feel great about the results on iPhone, up 20%. And if you look for the cycle -- by the cycle, I mean Q1, Q2 and Q3, we've had, on an average weekly basis, growth in units of sort of mid-single-digit and ASP growth of double-digit. And so if you -- and look at iPhone X in particular, it's the most innovative smartphone on the market. We priced it at a level that represented the value of it, and we're really -- we could not be happier that it has been the top-selling iPhone since the launch, and so we feel terrific about iPhone X. If you look at the -- sort of the top of our line together, and by that I mean the iPhone X, the 8 and the 8 Plus, they are growing very nicely as you can probably tell from looking at the ASP, and we couldn't be happier with how that's gone. And so I think in this cycle, we've learned that customers want innovative products. And we sort of already knew that in other cycles and other points in times, but it just puts an exclamation point by that, I believe, with looking at the results. On the -- at the unit level, the iPhone SE had a difficult comp to the year-ago quarter, and so -- when we changed some of the configurations -- the memory configurations in the year-ago quarter. If you look at it on a geographic basis, the top 3 selling phones in urban China were iPhone, where iPhone X was #1 and has been for a couple of quarters. And iPhones make up 3 of the top 5 smartphones in the U.S., U.K. and Japan. And so it's difficult sometimes to get a read over exactly what's happening in the market. But given the industry numbers that we've seen, it's clear that we picked up global market share and picked up market share in several countries, not only iPhone but iPad as well.",336

And then can you talk a bit about China, up 19% -- Greater China, up 19% year-over-year during the quarter, I believe? Obviously, iPhone doing well, but -- there was some concern that maybe some of what's going on in the trade world might have impacted, it doesn't seem like that. So I'm just curious as to what you're seeing in China and how you're thinking about it as you look forward.",73
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 31, 2018",2018-07-31,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3595.0,1524098.0,60260723.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,13,"Yes, it's a good question. Thank you. This is the fourth consecutive quarter that we've had double-digit growth in Greater China. I mentioned how iPhone X and sort of the iPhones were selling. We did pick up share in iPhone and iPad. But if you look more holistically at our complete line, we had a double-digit growth from Services to iPad to iPhone and to our other product category, which the Watch did extremely well. And so there are lots of good things happening there. In terms of the tariffs themselves, maybe I could sort of take a step back because I'm sure that a lot -- some people have questions on this. And our view on tariffs is that they show up as a tax on the consumer and wind up resulting in lower economic growth and -- sometimes can bring about significant risk of unintended consequences. That said, the trade relationships and agreements that the U.S. has between -- between the U.S. and other major economies are very complex, and it's clear that several are in need of modernizing. But we think that in the vast majority of situations that tariffs are not the approach to doing that, and so we're sort of encouraging dialogue and so forth. In terms of the tariffs that have been imposed or have exited the comment period, I think that there's one that's exiting today, there have been 3 of those. And maybe I could walk through those briefly just to make sure everybody's on the same page. The first was the U.S. imposed a tariff on steel and aluminum that was -- many, many different countries, that started, I believe, at the beginning of June. There have been 2 other tariffs that have totaled about $50 billion of goods from China that have either been implemented or are exiting the comment period in this month. I think the latest one is today. If you look at those 3 tariffs, none of our products were directly affected by the tariffs. There is a fourth tariff, which includes goods valued at $200 billion, also focused on goods that are imported from China. That one is out for public comment. Probably like everyone else, we're evaluating that one, and we'll be sharing our views of it with the administration and so forth before the comment period for that one ends. It's actually a tedious process in going through it because you not only have to analyze the revenue products, which are a bit more straightforward to analyze, but you also have to analyze the purchases that you're making through other companies that are not related to revenue. Maybe they're related to data centers and this sort of thing. And so we're going through that now, and we'll be sharing our results later on those and feeding back from the comment. Of course, the risk associated with more of a macroeconomic issue, such as an economic slowdown in one or more countries or currency fluctuations that are related to tariffs is very difficult to quantify. And so that -- and we're not even trying to quantify that, to be clear about it. All of this said, we're optimistic, as I've been the whole time, that this will get sorted out because there's an inescapable mutuality with -- between the U.S. and China that sort of serves as a magnet to bring both countries together. Each country can only prosper if the other does. And of course, the world needs both U.S. and China to prosper, for the world to do well. That said, I can't predict the future, but I am optimistic that the countries will get through this. And we are hoping that calm heads prevail.",622

Thanks for the question. We're very excited to work with Oprah. We think that her incomparable ability and talent to connect with audiences around the world are -- there's no match. And we think that we can do some great original content together, and so we could not be happier in working with Oprah. As you know, we hired 2 highly respected television executives last year, and they have been here now for several months and have been working on a project that we're not really ready to share the -- all the details about it yet. But I couldn't be more excited about what's going on there. And we've got great talent in the area that we've sourced from different places and feel really good about -- felt really good about what we will eventually offer. In terms of the sort of the key catalysts and the changes -- the cord-cutting, in our view, is only going to accelerate and probably accelerate at a much faster rate than is widely thought. We're seeing the things that we have on the periphery of this like Apple TV units and revenue grew by very strong double digits, very, very strong double digits in Q3. As I mentioned in my opening comments, we're seeing different providers pick up the Apple TV and use it as their box to go to market with their subscription service. There are -- within the 300 million-plus paid subscriptions, some of these are third-party video subscriptions, and we see the growth that is going on there. It's like 100% year-over-year. And so all the things from a -- all the forcing functions here from the outside all point to dramatic changes speeding up in the content industry. And so we're really happy to be working on something but just not ready to talk about it in, in depth today. In terms of Apple Music, we're well over 50 million listeners now when you add the -- our paid subscribers and the folks in the trial. And so we're moving along at a very, very good rate. It appears to us and what we've been told is that we took the leadership position in North America during the quarter, and we had leadership position in Japan. And so in some of the markets that we've been in for a long period of time, we're doing quite well. But really, the key thing in Music is not the competition between companies that are providing music, it's the -- the real challenge is to grow the market because if you add everyone up that's providing subscription music today or streaming music, it's -- outside of China, it's less than 200 million probably around the world. And so it does seem to me, there's an extraordinary opportunity in that business to grow the market well. And I think if we put our emphasis there, which we're doing, that -- we'll be a beneficiary of that as other people will as well. But I like where we are. Our revenues on Apple Music grew over 50%, as I'd mentioned earlier, during the quarter. And so it's really, really strong, strong results. Thanks for the question.",536

Luca, I'm wondering, as we think about modeling Q4, iPhone ASPs are typically up sequentially about 2% to 4%, sort of low single digits. Perhaps you can help us think through how we should be thinking about Q4. I know you provided some commentary last quarter on how we should be thinking about Q3 ASPs.",65

But of course, we provide a guidance on revenue. And the guidance range implies growth of 16% to 19%. We expect the growth to come from strong growth from iPhone, from Services and from Wearables, which has been a bit of our pattern during the course of the year. On iPhone ASP, the only thing that I would point out is that, obviously, we're exiting the June quarter at a significantly higher level than in the past. And so that, I think it's important to keep in mind -- as we move into the September quarter, it's important to keep in mind the type of revenue growth that we've implied in our guidance.",131

Tim, I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit about the health of the smartphone market. Apple's smartphone iPhone units have been relatively flat for 4 years. And I think you've probably been a share gainer during the period, which would suggest, at least at the high end of the market, that is perhaps flat to down. And I'm wondering if you can comment on, a, whether you believe that and what you think might be happening with replacement cycles and specifically also what impact, if any, you've seen from wider availability and less expensive replacement batteries for iPhones.",103
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 31, 2018",2018-07-31,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3595.0,1524098.0,60260731.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,21,"I think the smartphone market is very healthy. I think it's actually the best market in the world to be in for someone that is in the business that we're in. So it's an enormous-sized market and whether it grows -- from our point of view, whether it grows 1% or 2% or 5% or 6% or 10% or shrinks 1% or 2%, it's a great market because it's just huge. And so that's kind of the way that I view that. iPhone revenues are up 20% for the quarter over last year. We're really pleased with that. And if you look at the sort of this cycle, which I'll define as Q1, Q2, Q3 for ease, you'll see that we've grown like mid-single digits and -- on an average weekly sales point of view and, of course, double-digit on ASP. And so I think it's really healthy. In terms of replacement cycles, as I've mentioned I think on a previous call, some replacement cycles are lengthening. I think that the major catalyst for that was probably the subsidy plans becoming a much smaller percentage of total sales around the world than they were at one time. And so I think that some are lengthening and -- but I think for us, the thing that we always have to do is come out with a really great innovative product. And I think that iPhone X shows that when you deliver great innovative product, there's enough people there that would like that, and it can be a really good business. And so that's how I look at that. In terms of the -- our installed base, which is something very important for us as it is one of the key drivers of Services, our active installed base on iPhone grew double digits over last year during the quarter. And so we're thrilled with that. And you can see that carrying through to the Services line, in the -- and the growth that we have there. In terms of batteries, we have never done an analysis internally about how many people decided to get a lower-priced battery than buy another phone because it was never about that for us. It was always about doing something great for the user. And I think if you treat the users and customers well, then you have a good business over time, and so that's how we look at that.",404

I'd like to focus on product road map and strategy. There is a war going on for the home, the connected home, over the Internet of Things.

I'm just trying to figure out strategically, when you think about where the puck's going, how important is it for you to have a beachhead in the home as well as out of home?",116

They're both important products clearly. But everybody has their iPhone at home as well and everybody has their Mac at home and everyone has their iPad at home. And so in terms of the -- Siri access points, there -- as you can tell from the 100 billion number I quoted in the script, there's an extraordinary amount of usage of these products that are used to perform home-related functions. I do that every day with controlling all my home automation and so on and so forth. Part of that is on HomePod, but part of it is with the Apple Watch and the iPhone and the iPad. And so I think home is important. Home is important. Work is important. The movement between the 2 are important. Health is important. So the smartphone has become the repository that goes across the whole of your life, not something that is just meant for a portion of it. And so I think all of those are important, and we're focused on all of them. Thanks for your question.",191

Before we dive into the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to talk about a significant milestone we recently crossed.
Apple's active installed base reached 1.3 billion devices in January and is at an all-time high for all of our major products. 1.3 billion devices represents an astonishing 30% growth in just 2 years. It speaks to the strength and reliability of our products and our ecosystem as well as the loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. It's also fueling tremendous growth in our services business, which I'll talk about a little later in the call.
Turning to the December quarter. We're thrilled to report Apple's biggest quarter ever, which set new all-time records in both revenue and earnings. We generated revenue of $88.3 billion, which is above the high end of our guidance range, and it is up almost $10 billion or 13% over the previous all-time record we set a year ago. 
It's also our fifth consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth, with double-digit growth in each of our geographic segments around the world. What makes this even more remarkable is that the quarter we're reporting today was 13 weeks long while the year-ago quarter was 14 weeks. When we look at the average revenue per week in the December quarter this year compared to last year, our growth was a stunning 21%.
Our growth was broad-based and a key driver was iPhone, which generated its highest revenue ever. iPhone X was the best-selling smartphone in the world in the December quarter according to Canalys, and it has been our top-selling phone every week since it launched. iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus rounded out the top 3 iPhones in the quarter. In fact, revenue for our newly launched iPhones was the highest of any lineup in our history, driving total Apple revenue above our guidance range. 
I want to take a moment to recognize the tremendous amount of work that went into creating iPhone X. Our teams carried out an extremely complex launch from both an engineering and operations perspective, executing an outstanding product ramp that required years of research and development, one that introduced innovative features like an edge-to-edge Super Retina display and the TrueDepth camera, which enables Face ID. Our customers love these new features and the new gestures like simply swiping up from the bottom, which make using iPhone even more intuitive and enjoyable.
Our team has put the technology of tomorrow in our customers' hands today, set the standard for the next decade of smartphones, and we are very proud of their achievements. 
It was another very strong quarter for services with revenue of $8.5 billion, up 18% over last year, and we're on pace to achieve our goal of doubling our 2016 services revenue by 2020. The number of paid subscriptions across our services offerings passed 240 million by the end of the December quarter. That's an increase of 30 million in the last 90 days alone, which is the largest quarterly growth ever.
We had an all-time record quarter for the App Store, with our best holiday season ever. We're seeing great excitement around augmented reality with customers now enjoying over 2,000 ARKit-enabled apps spanning every category in the App Store. In December, when Pokémon Go released its new augmented reality features built with ARKit, it jumped to the top of the App Store charts. 
Last week on a stop in Toronto, I met developers who are hard at work on creative applications using ARKit from art appreciation to e-commerce, and I was very impressed with what I saw. Just 4 months after ARKit launched to the public, we've already released ARKit 1.5 in beta to developers around the world, and the response has been tremendous. Augmented reality is going to revolutionize many of the experiences we have with mobile devices. And with ARKit, we're giving developers the most advanced tools on the market to create apps for the most advanced operating system running on the most advanced hardware. This is something only Apple can do.
In addition to the App Store, several other services had the biggest quarter ever, including Apple Music, iCloud and Apple Pay, all of which saw growth in both active users and revenue. Apple Pay has reached an important milestone in the U.S. As a result of 50% year-over-year growth in merchant adoption, it's now accepted at more than half of all American retail locations, which includes more than 2/3 of the country's top 100 retailers. Now available in 20 markets, global Apple Pay purchase volume more than tripled year-over-year, and we're delighted to be expanding to Brazil in the coming months.
Today, you can use Apple Pay to take a subway in Guangzhou, China, see a concert at London's Wembley Stadium or buy a souvenir in Yosemite National Park. In the U.S., we launched Apple Pay Cash in December, and it's off to a terrific start. Millions of people are already using it to send and receive money with friends and family quickly, easily and securely, to split a bill, pay someone back or send a last-minute gift right from the Messages app.
It was our best quarter ever for the Apple Watch, with over 50% growth in revenue and units for the fourth quarter in a row and strong double-digit growth in every geographic segment. Sales of Apple Watch Series 3 models were also more than twice the volume of Series 2 a year ago. Apple Watch is the most popular smartwatch in the world and gained market share during the quarter based on the latest estimates from IDC.
It was the third consecutive quarter of growth for iPad revenue, thanks to the strength of both iPad and iPad Pro. Based on the latest data from IDC, we gained share in nearly every market we track with strong outperformance in emerging markets. Worldwide, almost half of our iPad sales were the first-time tablet buyers or those switching to Apple. And that's true in some of our most developed markets, including Japan and France. In China, new and switching users made up over 70% of all iPad sales.
For Mac, we launched the all new iMac Pro in mid-December. It's an entirely new product line designed for Pro users who love the all-in-one design of iMac and require workstation-class performance. It's the fastest, most powerful Mac ever, delivering incredible computational power for simulation and real-time 3D rendering, immersive VR and complex photography, audio and video projects. Worldwide, 60% of our Mac sales were the first-time buyers and switchers. And in China, that number was almost 90%. 
We're looking forward to getting HomePod in customers' hands beginning next week. HomePod is an innovative wireless speaker, which delivers stunning audio quality wherever it's placed in the home, thanks to the advanced Apple-engineered hardware and software. Together with Apple Music, HomePod gives you instant access to one of the world's largest music catalogs. And with the intelligence of Siri, it's a powerful assistant you control through natural voice interaction. We're very happy with the initial response from reviewers who've experienced HomePod ahead of its launch, and we think our customers are going to love this new product.
We believe one of the key issues of the 21st century is education. And because of that, we've strengthened our commitment and investment into initiatives like Everyone Can Code. To find the innovators of the future, we need to nurture the students of today. Our App Development with Swift curriculum, which is available free on iBooks, has been downloaded more than 1.2 million times worldwide, with almost half of those coming from here in the United States.
It's also being taught in dozens of community colleges across the country, putting practical skills in the hands of today's jobseekers. I was in London 2 weeks ago as we announced that the program was expanding to more than 70 colleges and universities in Europe. Millions of students around the world will have the opportunity to add Swift to their coding vocabulary and gain skills that are essential for today's economy.
This is an exciting time at Apple. And with the best lineup of products and services we've ever had and a set of initiatives that show how business can be a force for good in the world, we could not be more excited about our future.
Now for more details on the December quarter results, I'd like to turn over the call to Luca.",1427

Good afternoon, everyone. Our business and financial performance in the December quarter were exceptional as we set new all-time records for revenue, operating income, net income and earnings per share.
Starting with revenue, we're reporting an all-time record, $88.3 billion, up nearly $10 billion or 13% over the prior record set last year. It is our fifth consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth. As you know, the December quarter a year ago spanned 14 weeks compared to 13 weeks this year, which is important to consider as we assess the underlying performance of our business this year. 
When we look at average revenue per week, our growth rate was even higher at 21%, with growth across all product categories for the third consecutive quarter. Our results were terrific all around the world, with double-digit revenue growth in all our geographic segments and all-time quarterly records in the vast majority of markets we track, including the U.S., Western Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia and Korea as well as Mainland China, Latin America, the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe and India.
In Greater China, we were very happy to generate double-digit revenue growth for the second quarter in a row. And in emerging markets outside of Greater China, we saw 25% year-over-year growth.
Gross margin was 38.4%, at the high end of our guidance range. Operating margin was 29.8% of revenue. Our net income was $20.1 billion, an all-time record and up $2.2 billion over last year. Diluted earnings per share were $3.89, also an all-time record, and cash flow from operations was very strong at $28.3 billion.
During the quarter, we sold 77.3 million iPhones, the highest number ever for a 13-week quarter. Average weekly iPhone sales were up 6% compared to the December quarter last year, with growth in every region of the world despite the staggered launch of iPhone X. We established all-time iPhone revenue records in nearly every market we track with double-digit growth in all of our geographic segments.
iPhone ASP increased to $796 from $695 a year ago, driven primarily by the launch of iPhone X and the success of iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. We exited the December quarter towards the lower end of our target range of 5 to 7 weeks of iPhone channel inventory, with less than 1 million more iPhones in the channel compared to the December quarter a year ago, in line with our growth in average weekly unit sales.
Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are very, very strong for both consumers and business users. The latest data from 451 Research indicates U.S. customer satisfaction ratings of 96% or higher across iPhone models. In fact, combining iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X, consumers reported an amazing 99% satisfaction rating. And among business customers planning to purchase smartphones in the next quarter, 77% plan to purchase iPhone. Our customers are also incredibly loyal, with Kantar's latest U.S. research reflecting a 96% iPhone loyalty rate, the highest ever measured.
Turning to services. We had a terrific quarter with revenue of $8.5 billion, up 18% year-over-year and up 27% in terms of average revenue per week. That is an acceleration to the 24% services growth run rate that we experienced in the September quarter.
The App Store set a new all-time revenue record. The store's all new design is off to a fantastic start, with quarterly store visitors, transacting accounts and paying accounts reaching new all-time highs. During the week beginning December 24, a record number of customers made purchases or downloaded apps from the App Store spending over $890 million in that 7-day period, followed by $300 million in purchases on New Year's Day alone. And according to App Annie's latest report, the App Store continues to be the preferred destination for customer purchases by a very wide margin, generating nearly twice the revenue of Google Play.
Across all our services offerings, paid subscriptions reached 240 million, with growth of 58% over last year, and they were a major contributor to the overall strong growth in services revenue.
As Tim mentioned, it was our best quarter ever for Apple Watch, and when we add the results from Beats and AirPods, our total revenue from wearables was up almost 70% year-over-year. In fact, wearables were the second largest contributor to revenue growth after iPhone, which is impressive for a business that started only 3 years ago. In total, our other products category set a new all-time record, with quarterly revenue exceeding $5 billion for the first time.
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.1 million Macs during the December quarter, which translates to a 2% year-over-year increase in average sales per week. Mac performance was particularly strong in emerging markets, with unit sales up 13% year-over-year and with all-time records in Latin America, in India, Turkey and Central and Eastern Europe. On a worldwide basis, the active installed base of Macs was up double digits year-over-year to a new record.
It was also another growth quarter for iPad. We sold 13.2 million units, with average iPad sales per week up 8% over last year's December quarter. iPad sales grew strong double digits in many emerging markets, including Latin America, the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe and India, as well as developed markets, including Japan, Australia and Korea. The active installed base of iPad has grown every quarter since its launch in 2010. And it reached a new all-time high in December, thanks to extremely high customer loyalty and large numbers of first-time iPad users.
NPD indicates that iPad had 46% share of the U.S. tablet market in the December quarter, up from 36% share a year ago. And the most recent surveys from 451 Research found that among customers planning to purchase tablets within 90 days, 72% of consumers and 68% of business users plan to purchase iPads. Customer satisfaction is also very high, with businesses reporting a 99% satisfaction rating for iPad.
We're seeing great traction in enterprise as businesses across industries and around the world standardize on iOS. For example, Intesa Sanpaolo, one of Europe's leading banks, has chosen iOS as the mobile standard for its entire 70,000 employee base in Italy. Choosing iOS for its security, user interface, accessibility and reliability, Intesa Sanpaolo will deploy native apps to improve employee productivity in customer support, human resources and marketing across the company.
And LensCrafters, one of the largest optical retail brands in North America, will be using over 7,000 iPad Pros to enable digital eye exams and digital optical measurements in a personalized and interactive experience. 
We're also rolling out a new initiative called Apple at Work to help businesses implement employee choice programs more easily and offer Apple products company-wide. Resources from both Apple and our channel partners will enable enterprise IT and procurement teams to buy or lease Apple products more efficiently, streamline the setup of iPhone, iPad and Mac and deliver a seamless onboarding experience for employees. We launched the program with CDW in the U.S. last week, and we will be expanding to more channels and regions later this year.
The December quarter was extremely busy for our retail and online stores, which welcomed 538 million visitors. Traffic was particularly strong during the 4 weeks following the launch of iPhone X, up 46% over last year. And across the quarter, our stores conducted over 200,000 Today at Apple sessions covering topics including photography, music, gaming and app development and art and design. 
Just last weekend, we opened our first store in Seoul, Korea, and we're looking forward to opening our first store in Austria in a few weeks. These newest openings will mark the expansion of our retail store presence to 21 countries.
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $285.1 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $16.2 billion. $269 billion of this cash or 94% of the total was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion in debt during the quarter, bringing us to $110 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding for a total net cash position of $163 billion at the end of the quarter.
We also returned $14.5 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid $3.3 billion in dividends and equivalents and spent $5.1 billion on repurchases of 30.2 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We launched a new $5 billion ASR program, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 23.6 million shares, and we retired 3.8 million shares upon the completion of our 12th ASR during the quarter. We have now completed over $248 billion of our $300 billion capital return program, including $176 billion in share repurchases against our announced $210 billion buyback program with $34 billion remaining under our current authorization.
Turning to taxes. Due to the recently enacted legislation in the U.S., we estimate making a corporate income tax payment of approximately $38 billion to the U.S. government on our cumulative past foreign earnings. This amount is very similar to what we have been accruing on those earnings in our financial results through fiscal year 2017. 
Including the $38 billion payment, we will have paid over $110 billion of corporate income tax on our total domestic and foreign earnings during the last 10 years for a cash tax rate of about 26%. Our tax rate of 25.8% for the December quarter was close to our guidance of 25.5% as the lower U.S. statutory rate from the new legislation was effectively offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax balances.
As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $60 billion and $62 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $7.6 billion and $7.7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $300 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 15%.
Tax reform will allow us to pursue a more optimal capital structure for our company. Our current net cash position is $163 billion, and given the increased financial and operational flexibility from the access to our foreign cash, we are targeting to become approximately net cash neutral over time. We will provide an update to our specific capital allocation plans when we report results for our second fiscal quarter, consistent with the timing of updates that we had provided in the past.
Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.63 per share of common stock payable on February 15, 2018, to shareholders of record as of February 12, 2018.
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.",1811

Of course, we've been talking about the importance of tax reform over the years because we believe it's really beneficial to the U.S. economy. What it means to us as a company, of course, is that we have additional flexibility right now from the access to the foreign cash. And in the past, we've been addressing this issue by having to raise debt as the cash was overseas, the majority of the cash was overseas. And so we are now in a position where we have $285 billion of cash. We've got $122 billion of debt for a net cash of $163 billion. And we have now the flexibility to deploy this capital. We will do that over time because the amount is very large. As I said earlier, we will be discussing capital allocation plans when we review our March quarter results. And when you look at our track record of what we've done over the last several years, you've seen that effectively, we were returning to our investors essentially about 100% of our free cash flow. And so that is the approach that we're going to be taking. We're going to be very thoughtful and deliberate about it. Obviously, we want to make the right decisions in the best interest of our long-term shareholders.",218

And then Tim, maybe could you talk a little bit more about what you're hearing from customers in terms of the iPhone demand? How you're thinking about the potential decay rate, for a lack of a better term, with the high-end phones and the over $1,000 phones versus balancing that with now your ability to [ shift ] phones down below $400 because you'd expanded the product line so much when you launched your phones in 2017?",78

The revenue growth from iPhone across all the geographic segments was in the double digits. And I think as Luca said earlier, when you change that to an average weekly sales basis, it's actually 22%, and so it was a stellar quarter for iPhone. The iPhone X was the most popular, and that's particularly noteworthy, given that we didn't start shipping until early November and were constrained for a while. The team did a great job of getting into supply-demand balance there in December. And -- but since the launch of iPhone X, it has been the most popular iPhone every week, every week since. And that is even through today -- actually, through January. And so we feel fantastic about the results. The most important thing for us isn't really the numbers though. It's customer satisfaction, and customer satisfaction is literally off the charts on iPhone X. You think about the advances in technology that were a part of the iPhone X from -- we went from Touch ID to Face ID. Face ID has been incredibly well received. The wireless charging, the edge-to-edge Super Retina display and totally new gestures, the user experience is different. And so it's great to get that kind of feedback. Now if you look at the sort of the overall iPhone line, which gets to the essence of the question I think, I looked -- I reviewed the top mini markets. I'll talk briefly about the top 4. In urban China and the U.S., the top 5 smartphones last quarter were all iPhones. And in Japan and the U.K., 6 of the top 7 were iPhones. And so in a market that is as large as the smartphone market is, people want some level of choice, and they're deciding which ones to buy. But we feel fantastic particularly as it pertains to iPhone X.",318

So just how should we read into a modest slowdown in average weekly growth as it relates to the last question around the decay of demand around the higher-priced products? Or any impact that you might be seeing from the lower-priced battery replacements or anything else in the market? Then I have a follow-up.",104
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2018",2018-02-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3625.0,1563149.0,61669228.0,Answer,Luca Maestri,,Executives,12,"Katy, I'll take the question. We are guiding to $60 billion to $62 billion. It's strong double-digit growth, 13% to 17%. In context, it's $7 billion to $9 billion above last year. So when you put things in perspective and you add the $10 billion of growth that we had in the first quarter and the $7 billion to $9 billion that we're guiding to for the second quarter, you're talking about $17 billion to $19 billion of growth in 6 months. This is at the macro level. We typically don't go into this level of detail but I think it's important this quarter to give you additional color. And maybe the 2 most important messages are that we believe iPhone revenue will grow double digits as compared to last year during the March quarter, and also and importantly, that iPhone sell-through growth on a year-over-year basis will be actually accelerating during the March quarter as compared to the December quarter. Let me explain the factors that we took into consideration as we came up with our iPhone units and ASP that are embedded in our guidance. Historically, because of the channel fill and the holiday season, our sell-in volume during the December quarter is generally higher than sell-through. This year, the difference was further magnified because we shipped iPhone X in November rather than the September quarter. We had a very successful product ramp. We were able to reach supply-demand balance in December, which placed the entirety of our channel fill for iPhone X in Q1. And this will have an effect on both units and ASP in Q2. Now for units, there is a second point to consider. We typically reduce channel inventory for our newest iPhones in Q2 because they enjoy very large demand in the initial weeks of sales, which are compounded by the holiday season in Q1. So we anticipate doing that in Q2 this year as well. For ASPs, there's also another element that we need to consider. As you know, our newest products this year have higher ASPs than they had in the past. And so as a result, as we reduce inventories of these newest products, the overall ASPs for iPhone in Q2 will naturally decline sequentially by a higher percentage than we have experienced historically. So in summary, our guidance for iPhone, we got double-digit year-over-year growth and acceleration of sell-through growth on a year-over-year basis. For the balance of the company, in the aggregate, we expect to grow strong double digits year-over-year and particularly very strong performance in service and in wearables like we've seen during the December quarter. I hope this helps.",443

Just a follow-up on gross margin. Guidance for flat gross margin in March is pretty seasonal, but you do have the tailwind from currency. And so if you can just comment on how you think that flows into the model over the next couple of quarters, the weaker dollar, and what your outlook might be around component costs in the near future.",66

So we're guiding about flat sequentially in spite of the loss of leverage, right? That is the largest element that we need to take into account because of our typical seasonality. And we expect to offset the seasonality impact with cost improvements and with mix. FX, on a sequential basis, is fairly muted because as you know, we got a hedging program that protects us from the volatility of currencies in the short term. Certainly, weaker dollar in the long term, if it holds, will be a positive, but it's not something that you're going to be seeing translate into gross margin tailwind quickly. And so I think we need to keep that in mind. We also need to keep in mind that we continue to experience a difficult memory pricing environment, which we think is going to start improving as we move into the second half of our fiscal year, but it still has a negative impact in the March quarter.",171

You commented on how your installed base over the last couple of years has grown 30%. And iPhone is clearly the largest component of that. And so iPhone installed base is probably growing close to that number, perhaps less, call it 20% or 25%. Yet if we look at iPhone unit growth for fiscal '18, sort of what's implied with your guidance, fiscal '17 and fiscal '16, it's been relatively flat. So you have an installed base that's 20-plus percent higher and a unit growth that's relatively flat, which would suggest that your upgrade rate is going down or your replacement cycle is elongating. And I'm wondering whether you agree with that and whether investors should be worried about that. And maybe if I could just add one other wrinkle to potentially get your response on is given consumers' heightened awareness of their ability to replace batteries going forward as opposed to upgrade, isn't that also something that investors should potentially be concerned about in terms of its impact on upgrade rate going forward? And then, believe it or not, I have a follow-up.",192

The way that I look at this, and I -- the numbers you quoted, I have a different view of them. But generally, what we see with iPhone is the reliability of iPhone is fantastic. The second -- or the previously owned market has expanded in units over the years. And you see, in many cases, carriers and retailers having very vibrant programs around trading an iPhone in. And because iPhone has the largest residual rate on it. It acts as a buffer for the customer to buy a new one, and it winds up with another customer somewhere else that is perfectly fine with having a previously owned iPhone. And so I view all of that to be incredibly positive. It's more people on iPhones, the better. I would like to point out that the -- every major product hit a high on the active installed base. And so that's iPads, it's Mac, and those are huge numbers as well. And so as we've always said, there's a large part of the -- or the vast majority of the services kind of are mapped to the installed base instead of the quarterly sales. And there's -- this quarter is no different on that. Toni -- on the battery, Toni, we did not consider in any way, shape or form what it would do to upgrade rates. We did it because we thought it was the right thing to do for our customers. And I -- sitting here today, I don't know what effect it will have.

First of all, the new tax law in the United States is complex. And I think we, as many other companies, are really trying to absorb what this all means. And I think we're going to be receiving, over the next few months, implementation guidance. So we've taken some provisional estimates in coming up with our tax entries for the quarter. And we will have to do that as we go forward here during the year. So it may be a bit bumpy in the short term as we understand the law in full and it actually gets explained in full. But I would say that for the current fiscal year, the guidance that we provided for Q2 should be approximately what you should be seeing. As we get into a new fiscal year, so many things change, and we need to take that into account, the geographic mix of our products and so on. So -- but I would say for the remainder of the year, it's what we're guiding to.",182

In those geographies that had -- in the early days of the smartphone market, had very traditional subsidies where you paid the $199 out the door, $99 or whatever, I think it's accurate to say those types of markets, the replacement cycle is likely longer. Where that isn't the case, I'm not nearly as sure on that. I would point out that, that happened some time ago, and so it's very difficult currently to ever get a real-time handle on replacement rate because you're obviously not -- you don't know the replacement rate for the products you're currently selling. You only know that in a historical sense. So it's not something that we overly fixate on.",130

It did not come from Apple. And so that's one of those things that kind of flowed out there, and I want to divorce Apple from that number.

Later, you talked about the importance of customer satisfaction.

And do you have confidence that you can monetize that installed base through additional hardware and services?",84

What I think is important, I think the active devices are hugely important. And that's the reason that we released the number 2 years ago and the reason that we're releasing that again today. That number speaks to the strength of the product, the loyalty of the customer, the strength of the ecosystem. And so I -- we do put a lot of weight behind that, and it obviously also fuels the services business. So I have long believed that a 90-day clock on unit sales is a very surface way to view Apple. I think that the far bigger thing is to look over a longer period of time. And customer satisfaction and engagement and number of active devices are all a part of that.",154

So you can say, ""Hey, Siri. I'm reading."" And your room will change to the things you would like happening in that particular room for when you read. Maybe it's a particular light, maybe it's a type of light, maybe it's the fireplace, so on and so forth. It also -- obviously, you can also do things with HomePod like use it as a speakerphone. And so if you're talking to your parents or they're talking to their grandkids, it's unbelievable audio quality for speakerphone. You can also have Siri call for you. You can have -- you can send messages, you can get an Uber car or a Lyft car. And so there's just a whole variety of things. And so I think the use cases on this, much like our phones, will be broad-based. Some people will use it significantly for music and others may use it significantly for -- as a digital assistant.

I guess, first one, could you just touch on what you're seeing in China in terms of underlying trends right now?

Just the puts and takes in China will be great.",68

It's a good question. Keep in mind that this year had 13 weeks, last year had 14 weeks. And so even though we're recording a similar year-over-year growth for Greater China, if you change that reporting to an average weekly sales, which is probably a much better way to look at it, there was actually a really nice acceleration. And specifically, the numbers this quarter, as reported, are 11% increase for Greater China year-over-year. But on an average weekly revenue basis, it was -- we were up 19%. Also mainland China, we had an all-time record for revenue in mainland China. And of course, a key part of that was iPhone. And as I've mentioned before, Kantar reported that the top 5 selling smartphones in urban China were all iPhones. And so we could not be more pleased with how we're doing. And if you look at the other -- we obviously grew share on -- for iPhone in the quarter, but we also grew share in iPad and Mac during the quarter. And our -- and wearables were extremely strong there in the quarter. And so everywhere I look, I feel really good about how we're doing in China.",204

I guess, Luca, maybe a question for you. When you talk about reducing your Apple's net cash levels to 0 effectively over time, I think that implies the number goes from $163 billion today to something like 0. I guess, what does ""over time"" mean for Apple? Is that 1 year, 3 years, 10 years? Just how do you define ""over time""? And does this change your thoughts around M&A at all? And is that one reason, you get that number from $163 billion to 0? Does it change your M&A thought process?",98

Our thought process around M&A has always been the same, and it really doesn't change. We've been acquiring companies over the years. During -- in calendar 2017, we've acquired 19 companies. And the thought process is always to acquire something that allows us to either accelerate our product road maps, filling a gap in our portfolio, providing a new experience to customers. So it's always the customer experience in mind, right, that we make acquisitions. We look at all sizes, and we will continue to do so. We have plenty of financial flexibility, of course. We had that even prior to tax reform. And as I said, we will talk about capital allocation plans when we report the March quarter, and that will include talking about time frames and pace and so on. And as I said, we'll try to be very thoughtful. As you said, $163 billion is a large amount, and there are even practical considerations around it. So we'll see.",170

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I just got back from Brooklyn, where we marked our fourth major launch at the end of the year. In addition to being a great time, it put an exclamation point at the end of a remarkable fiscal 2018.
This year, we shipped our 2 billionth iOS device, celebrated the 10th anniversary of the App Store and achieved the strongest revenue and earnings in Apple's history. In fiscal year '18, our revenue grew by $36.4 billion. That's the equivalent of a Fortune 100 company in a single year. And we're capping all that off with our best September quarter ever.
Revenue was $62.9 billion, ahead of our expectations. That's an increase of 20% over last year and our highest growth rate in 3 years. We also generated record Q4 earnings with 41% year-over-year growth in EPS. Record results from iPhone, Services and Wearables drove our momentum, and we produced strong double-digit revenue growth in all of our geographic segments.
It was a big year and a big quarter for iPhone. Q4 revenue was up 29% over last year, an increase of over $8 billion to a new September quarter record, fueled by continued momentum for iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X and the very successful launch of iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max. These latest devices are our most advanced iPhones ever with the industry's first 7-nanometer A12 Bionic chip with an Apple-designed 8-core Neural Engine capable of executing an astounding 5 trillion operations per second.
The A12 Bionic is many years in the making and a huge technological leap forward. It sets the iPhone experience far apart from the competition using real-time machine learning to transform the way we experience photo, gaming, augmented reality and more. It makes full use of the dual-camera system that shoots portrait mode photos with Smart HDR and dynamic depth of field, and Face ID is even faster.
The response has been powerful. As one reviewer put it, ""iPhone Xs and Xs Max are the perfect blend of design and craftsmanship as well as seamlessly intuitive user experience."" We're not done yet. Just last week, we began shipping iPhone XR, bringing the latest iPhone breakthroughs to even more users. With an all-screen glass and aluminum design and the most advanced LCD in a smartphone, the product reviews had been overwhelmingly positive.
iOS 12 has gotten off to an incredible start. It's been installed on more systems in its first month than any version of iOS ever. iOS 12 is delivering system-wide performance enhancements, Siri Shortcuts and new tools to help people reduce interruption and manage screen time for themselves and their kids.
Siri Shortcuts, in particular, is already deeply integrated with some of the most popular apps out there. Whether you're tracking your workouts or rushing to catch a flight, you can be sure all of your most relevant apps are working together with Siri in the driver seat.
iOS 12 also features ARKit 2, a major upgrade to our augmented reality engine. ARKit 2 makes possible simultaneous multi-user experiences and real-world object incorporation. Our developer community is really running with this technology. From gaming to shopping, we're seeing great new use cases emerge. iOS devices deliver the best AR experiences of any products in the market today, and with the announcement of our new iPad Pro this week, we've made that gap even wider.
More powerful than the vast majority of PC laptops, the new iPad Pro is unrivaled in its versatility and performance. And paired with the beautifully refined Apple Pencil and a new streamlined full-size smart keyboard, iPad Pro will extend its lead as the ultimate creativity and productivity device. And finally, just this week, we delivered the hotly anticipated group FaceTime functionality to all FaceTime-enabled devices.
For Services, it was our best quarter ever with revenue at $10 billion. Excluding the impact of a favorable onetime accounting adjustment of $640 million a year ago, our Services growth was 27%.
We set new Q4 records in all of our geographic segments and new all-time revenue records for the App Store, cloud services, AppleCare, Apple Music and Apple Pay. We also continued to see strong growth in paid subscriptions, reaching over 330 million in our ecosystem.
I want to spotlight the exceptional performance of Apple Pay, which is, by far, the #1 mobile contactless payment service worldwide. Transaction volume tripled year-over-year, and to put that into perspective, Apple Pay generated significantly more transactions than even PayPal mobile with over 4x the growth rate.
As a testament to accelerating U.S. growth, Costco completed the rollout of Apple Pay to over 500 U.S. warehouses last quarter, while Neiman Marcus is now accepting Apple Pay at over 40 stores across the country. With these additions, 71 of the top 100 merchants and 60% of all U.S. retail locations support Apple Pay.
We continue to invest in our strategy to replace the wallet with the recent launch of student ID passes at several major U.S. universities. And 10 months following its launch, Apple Pay Cash is the highest-rated mobile peer-to-peer service by Consumer Reports based on exceptional payment authentication and data privacy.
We set an all-time quarterly record for Mac revenue, thanks to strong performance in MacBook Pro and the impact of the back-to-school season. In September, we delivered macOS Mojave, bringing powerful new features to Mac like dark mode, stack and a completely redesigned Mac App Store. Considered alongside the release of iOS 12, watchOS 5 and a new tvOS, macOS Mojave tells a powerful story of the seamless integration of world-class hardware, software and services that define the Apple ecosystem.
As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, earlier this week, we announced exciting updates to the Mac lineup. The all-new MacBook Air brings a stunning Retina display, Touch ID, the latest processors and an even more portable design to the world's most beloved notebook. We also unveiled the biggest update ever to Mac mini, the small yet muscular desktop that powers everything from the music and sound effects of Broadway shows to the developers who build some of the most popular apps in the App Store. The new Mac mini boasts an amazing 5x faster performance than before.
With revenue growth over 50%, it was another record quarter for Wearables, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats products. With the highest customer satisfaction in the industry, Apple Watch has become an essential part of people's lives. The customer response to the Apple Watch Series 4 has been overwhelmingly positive, driven by its all-new design, larger display, faster performance, fall detection, enhanced cellular reception and electrical heart sensor.
Later this year, the ECG app will be available to Apple Watch Series 4 customers in the U.S., giving them the ability to take an electrocardiogram anytime right from their wrists. And for U.S. customers with Apple Watch Series 1 and later, watchOS will soon enable periodic checks for irregular heart rhythms that may be suggestive of AFib. These are unprecedented and potentially life changing features, showing how Apple Watch is not only an indispensable communication and fitness companion but also an intelligent guardian for your health. More broadly, we see this as just one further example of the kind of contribution we can make in the health space, and we look forward to making more in the future.
We are proud to bring HomePod to new customers. I was in Spain last week as HomePod became available there and in Mexico. HomePod delivers the highest fidelity audio quality, working together with an Apple Music subscription to stream over 50 million songs into any room in your home.
Our retail team posted record Q4 results to conclude their biggest year ever. They are transforming our stores into places where customers come to connect, learn and be inspired together with people from their community. Our Today at Apple sessions are a terrific example of what that looks like in practice. We hosted over 250,000 Today at Apple sessions this quarter, connecting aspiring creators with local photographers, illustrators and other experts who can help them get the most out of their devices. Apple Stores also hosted 74,000 kids at Apple Camp.
The relationship Apple has with our customers is about more than just making a purchase. With the recent addition of beautiful new stores in Italy, Japan, China and in just a few weeks, Thailand, we will have 506 stores where we can further those relationships, almost half of which are outside United States.
Before I turn the call over to Luca, I'd like to touch on 2 items that may not show up in our financial statement but are just as integral to Apple's mission and our commitment to making the world a better place. 
First, education. More than 5,000 schools, community colleges and technical colleges worldwide are now using Everyone Can Code, our free coding curriculum. Ideas, creativity and passion for technology's potential aren't limited by ZIP code or country, and we don't think opportunity should be either. We're also excited that educators in more than 350 schools around the world have started working with Everyone Can Create, the free collection of tools and project guides we introduced this spring designed to help unleash kids' creativity throughout their school day with the help of iPad.
Next is the environment. This was a milestone year for Apple's commitment to our planet. In April, we announced that 100% of our global operations are powered by renewable energy. We also made progress in doing the same in our supply chain. And just this week, we announced that the enclosures of new products like MacBook Air and iPad Pro will be made from 100% recycled aluminum, a strong, durable and beautiful new alloy designed by Apple.
This is a great example of how a commitment to do right on the issues that matter can drive once unimaginable innovation, new ways of approaching old problems and beautiful solutions that set us apart. I'd like to thank all of our employees, customers, developers and business partners for helping us deliver outstanding results across our fiscal 2018. We are headed into the holidays with our strongest product lineup ever, and we could not be more bullish about Apple's future.
And now Luca has more details to share with you on the September quarter. Luca?",1733

Good afternoon, everyone. We are extremely pleased to report record results for our September quarter, which capped a tremendously successful fiscal 2018, a year in which we saw double-digit revenue growth in every geographic segment and established new revenue and earnings records in every single quarter.
Revenue in the fourth quarter was $62.9 billion, up 20% and more than $10 billion over last year with strong double-digit growth in each of our geographic segments and record Q4 revenue in the Americas, in Europe, Japan and rest of Asia Pacific. In fact, we set new revenue records in almost every market we track with especially strong growth in Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Japan and Korea, all major markets where revenue growth was 25% or higher. We also set new fourth quarter revenue records for iPhone and Wearables and new all-time records for Services and Mac.
Gross margin was 38.3%, flat sequentially in line with our expectations as leverage from higher revenue offset seasonal transition costs. We set new September quarter records for net income, EPS and cash flow from operations. Net income was $14.1 billion, up $3.4 billion or 32% over last year. Diluted earnings per share were $2.91, up 41%. Cash flow from operations was $19.5 billion, up $3.8 billion from a year ago.
iPhone revenue grew 29% with growth of more than 20% in every geographic segment. iPhone ASP was $793 compared to $618 a year ago, driven by strong performance of iPhone X, 8 and 8 Plus as well as the successful launch of iPhone Xs and Xs Max in the September quarter this year, while we launched iPhone X in the December quarter last year.
We sold 46.9 million iPhones during the quarter with growth of 20% or more in several markets, including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, Chile and Vietnam. Customer satisfaction with iPhone continues to be outstanding and is the highest in the industry. The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone X, 8 and 8 Plus combined. And among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 80% plan to purchase iPhones.
Turning to Services. It was our best quarter ever in total and virtually in every market around the world with revenue of $10 billion. A year ago, we had a onetime $640 million favorable impact to Services revenue due to an accounting adjustment, and taking that into account, our Services growth in Q4 this year was 27%. As Tim mentioned, we reached new all-time quarterly revenue records for many Services categories, and we are well on our way to achieve our goal to double our fiscal 2016 Services revenue by 2020.
We now have over 330 million paid subscriptions on our platform, an increase of over 50% versus a year ago. We are very pleased not only with the growth but also with the breadth of our subscription business. In fact, 30,000 third-party subscription apps are available in the App Store today, and the largest of them all represents less than 0.3% of our total Services revenue.
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We saw great response to our new MacBook Pro models that we launched in July with strong double-digit revenue growth driving an all-time quarterly record for Mac revenue. We were especially pleased with Mac momentum in emerging markets with strong growth in Latin America, in India, the Middle East and Africa and Central and Eastern Europe. At over 100 million units, our active installed base of Macs is at an all-time high, and the majority of customer purchasing Macs in the September quarter were new to Mac.
We sold 9.7 million iPads during the quarter, gaining share in nearly every market we track based on the latest estimates from IDC. We generated iPad growth in a number of key regions around the world, including Latin America, Europe, Japan, India and South Asia. Among customers around the world purchasing iPads during the quarter, nearly half were new to iPad, and our active installed base of iPads reached a new all-time high.
NPD indicates that iPad had 58% share of the U.S. tablet market in the September quarter, up from 54% share a year ago. And the most recent consumer survey from 451 Research measured iPad customer satisfaction ratings of 96% for both iPad and iPad Pro. And among business customers who plan to purchase tablets in the December quarter, 74% plan to purchase iPads.
Other products revenue grew 31% to a new September quarter record with an increase of over $1 billion compared to a year ago, thanks to Wearables growth of over 50% and the strong performance of Apple TV in addition to the introduction of HomePod earlier this year.
As we look back across fiscal 2018, we have made great progress in the enterprise market, where iOS is transforming how business gets done across multiple industries. In fact, over 450 airlines and 47 of the top 50 around the world have adopted iOS to help pilots fly safer, more efficient flights. And many airlines are also using iOS to support better customer experiences and improve maintenance operations.
We're also making great strides in the retail sector, where 9 of the top 10 global retailers use iOS devices to transform their customer and employee experiences. We are seeing industry-wide adoption of iOS at thousands of retailers from neighborhood boutiques to many of the best-known retailers in the world. Deployment of iOS devices is growing steadily as retailers replace their traditional point-of-sale systems and use custom iOS apps on iPhones and iPads to provide highly personalized shopping experiences.
Our success in enterprise is supported by our key partnerships. Since launching our first strategic partnership with IBM, 240 large customers have signed MobileFirst for iOS deals. Additionally, earlier in the year, we introduced 2 new technology offerings: IBM Watson services for Core ML and the IBM Cloud Developer Console for Apple that are enabling businesses to combine machine learning and cloud for a new generation of dynamic smart apps made for iOS. Over 60 new signings across numerous industries have been added since launching these new tools.
In our new partnership with Salesforce, we're excited to bring together the #1 customer relationship management platform and iOS. Together with Apple, Salesforce is redesigning its apps to embrace the native mobile platform with exclusive new features on iOS. The company can also provide tools and resources for millions of Salesforce developers to build their own native apps with a new Salesforce Mobile SDK for iOS.
And finally, we recently announced Apple business manager, a new way for IT teams to deploy Apple devices at scale. The response from companies around the world has been tremendous with over 40,000 companies currently enrolled.
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.1 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We also had $102.5 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding for a net cash position of $122.6 billion. As explained earlier this year, it is our plan to reach a net cash neutral position over time. As part of this plan, we returned over $23 billion to investors during the quarter. We repurchased 92.5 million Apple shares for $19.4 billion through open market transactions, and we paid $3.5 billion in dividends and equivalents.
For our fiscal year 2018, revenue grew over $36 billion to $265.6 billion, an all-time record. Every geographic segment grew double digits with new records in the Americas, Europe, Japan and rest of Asia Pacific. We also set new all-time records for net income, up 23% versus last year and EPS, up 29%. And we returned a total of almost $90 billion to our investors during the year, including almost $14 billion in dividends and equivalents and over $73 billion in share repurchases.
Before we discuss our December quarter outlook, I'd like to describe a number of changes in our financial reporting that we're implementing as we enter our new fiscal year. First, given the increasing importance of our Services business and in order to provide additional transparency to our financial results, we will start reporting revenue as well as cost of sales for both total products and total services beginning this December quarter.
Second, also beginning this December quarter, we're adopting the FASB's new standard for revenue recognition. This will not result in any change to our total revenue, but it will impact the way we report the classification of revenue between products and services. In particular, the revenue corresponding to the amortization of the deferred value of bundled services such as Maps, Siri and free iCloud services was previously reported in product revenue. After adopting the new standards, this revenue will now be reported in Services revenue.
The change in classification between products and services will also apply to the costs that are associated with the delivery of such bundled services. After we file our 10-K, we will post a schedule to our Investor Relations website showing the reclassification of fiscal 2018 revenue from products to services in connection with the adoption of the new standard.
The size of this reclassification amounts to less than 1% of total company revenues. And for clarity, this reclassification was not contemplated in our previously stated goal of doubling our fiscal '16 Services revenue by 2020. That goal remains unchanged and excludes the revenue that is now shifting from products to services over that time frame.
Third, starting with the December quarter, we will no longer be providing unit sales data for iPhone, iPad and Mac. As we have stated many times, our objective is to make great products and services that enrich people's lives and to provide an unparalleled customer experience so that our users are highly satisfied, loyal and engaged. As we accomplish these objectives, strong financial results follow.
As demonstrated by our financial performance in recent years, the number of units sold in any 90-day period is not necessarily representative of the underlying strength of our business. Furthermore, our unit of sale is less relevant for us today than it was in the past given the breadth of our portfolio and the wider sales price dispersion within any given product line.
Fourth, starting with the December quarter, we will be renaming the other products category to wearables, home and accessories to provide a more accurate description of the items that are included in this product category.
As we move ahead to the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We have the strongest lineup ever as we enter the holiday season, and we expect revenue to be between $89 billion and $93 billion, a new all-time record. This range reflects a number of factors to be considered: First, we consider the effect on Q4 and Q1 of the launch timing of our new iPhones this year versus last year; Second, we expect almost $2 billion of foreign exchange headwinds; Third, we had an unprecedented number of products ramping, and while our ramps are going fairly well, we have uncertainty around supply and demand balance; and fourth, we also face some macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly in emerging markets.
We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $300 million. And we expect the tax rate to be about 16.5% before discrete items. Also, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.73 per share of common stock payable on November 15, 2018, to shareholders of record as of November 12, 2018.
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.",1972

And I have a follow-up.",88

Starting with emerging markets. The emerging markets that we're seeing pressure in are markets like Turkey, India, Brazil, Russia, these are markets where currencies have weakened over the recent period. In some cases, that resulted in us raising prices, and those markets are not growing the way we would like to see. To give you a perspective in -- at some detail, our business at India in Q4 was flat. Obviously, we would like to see that be a huge growth. Brazil was down somewhat compared to the previous year. And so I think -- or at least the way that I see these is each one of the emerging markets has a bit of a different story. And I don't see it as some sort of issue that is common between those for the most part. In relation to China specifically, I would not put China in that category. Our business in China was very strong last quarter. We grew 16%, which we're very happy with. iPhone, in particular, was very strong double-digit growth there. Our other products category was also stronger, in fact, a bit stronger than even the company -- overall company number. The App Store in China, we have seen a slowdown or a moratorium to be more accurate on new game approvals. There is a new regulatory setup in China, and there's -- things are not moving the way they were moving previously. We did see a few games approved recently, but it's very far below the historic pace. And as you're probably seeing, some of the larger companies there that are public have talked about this as they've announced their earnings as well. We don't know exactly when this will -- the approvals will sort of return to a normal pace. So I would not want to predict that. I do not view, just to try -- for avoidance of doubt here, I don't view that, that issue has anything to do with the trade-related discussions between the countries. I think that is strictly a domestic issue in China. In terms of larger developers, if you sort of step back and look at the value proposition for people from the App Store, there are 2 key constituencies in that equation. There's the user, and there's the developer. If you start with the user, what the App Store provides people is sort of the best and safest place for users to get apps. And we put a -- we have a tremendous process and infrastructure around achieving that. And where it is not perfect, we wind up reviewing 100,000 -- over 100,000 apps a week between new apps and updates for existing apps and then work with developers quickly to fix the issues. And we also provide the user a one-payment model for purchasing apps and subscriptions and in-app purchases, et cetera, so that they are not in a position that they have to share their private information across many companies. And so that's sort of the proposition for the user. For the developer, we obviously provide developers a tremendous amount of developer tools, programs, compilers, languages, of course, the operating system APIs, SDKs and have a huge developer relations team. And we do a tremendous amount of marketing for developers, including the new Today editorial that we just started in the past few months, personal recommendations search, tools and so on and so forth. And so if -- there will be -- there's no doubt, in my mind, there have already been some large developers that concluded that they could do something on their own. We're fine with that. I think Luca mentioned in his comments that the largest -- if I look at the largest developer, they make up less than 0.3% of the Services revenue. So it's probably good to think about that in that context, and there are millions of apps on the store obviously and 30,000 or so subscription apps. And so the subscription business itself is nearly as broad as the App Store itself is. And so that's the value proposition, I think, that the vast majority of people are very happy with it and including the most important people of all, which is the user.",710

If I could just ask you really quick on Apple's role in health care. It's been growing significantly since the early introduction on the Watch and then the various kits for developers, including HealthKit, CareKit, et cetera. And when you combine that with your very staunch advocacy for privacy, I see Apple could become a really large disintermediating force in all the friction in the health care industry today in the way medical information is shared and distributed. Is this the way that you see the future for Apple in health care? And do you see a means to also grow your Services business through the health care offerings that could become subscriptions to your customers?",119

And at the revenue level, we started from the fact that we are very, very excited about the lineup of products and services that we have getting into the holiday season. It's the strongest lineup that we've ever had. And our guidance range, by the way, represents a new all-time quarterly revenue record, right? As I explained in my prepared remarks, there are a number of things that need to be considered as part of this guidance range, right? The first one is the fact that the launch timing of the new iPhones this year is essentially in reverse order versus last year. And that has had an effect on Q1 -- on Q4 and will have an effect on Q1. Last year, we launched the top end of our iPhone lineup, which was iPhone X during Q1, and placed the entirety of the channel fill for iPhone X in Q1. This year, we launched the top end of the lineup, which is the Xs and the Xs Max during Q4. Obviously, this resulted in a more pronounced ASP growth in Q4 of '18 and obviously a tougher compare for Q1. So I think it's important to keep that in mind as you look at the revenue guidance that we provided. The second point that needs to be kept in mind, it is a fact of life and we've dealt with it for a number of years now, is the fact that when I look at currencies around the world, virtually every foreign currency has depreciated against the U.S. dollar in the last 12 months. And when we look at the impact of foreign exchange on our revenue for the December quarter, we're looking at 200 basis points of headwinds, which translate, given our -- the size of our business, to almost $2 billion of headwind to our revenue. The third point that I think is important to keep in mind, and Tim has talked about this, we are launching -- in the last 6 weeks, we've launched an unprecedented number of new products. They're all ramping right now. The ramps are going fairly well, but obviously, we have some uncertainty around supply-demand balance for some of these products. And then finally, the last point that we've taken into account is what Tim's talked about in terms of some level of uncertainty at the macroeconomic level in some emerging markets, where, clearly, consumer confidence is not as high as it was 12 months ago. So take that into account, and that's how we got to the range.",433

And then I just want to talk a little bit about the pullback in terms of guidance from a unit perspective. I understand you don't want to give guidance because 90 days is a short period of time and can be -- fluctuate. But what kind of qualitative commentary do you think you'll be able to provide? Because it's -- obviously, investors have spent the last however many years going P times Q. So how should we think about what we can expect? And sort of how are you going to manage this process as we go through? I know it's all our job to forecast but...",108

As I said, right, our objective is to make great products, provide the best customer experience and get our customers satisfied, engaged and loyal to our ecosystem. When you look at our financial performance in recent years, take the last 3 years, for example, the number of units sold during any quarter has not been necessarily representative of the underlying strength of our business. If you look at our revenue during the last 3 years, if you look at our net income during the last 3 years, if you look at our spot price during the last 3 years, there's no correlation to the units sold in any given period. As you know very well, in addition, our product ranges for all the major product categories have become wider over time, and therefore, a unit of sale is less relevant for us at this point compared to the past because we got this much wider sales price dispersion. So unit of sale per se becomes less relevant. As I know you're aware, by the way, our top competitors in smartphones, in tablets, in computers do not provide quarterly unit sales information either. But of course, we understand that this is something of interest. And when we believe that providing qualitative commentary on unit sales offers additional relevant information to investors, we will do so.",247

The Xs and Xs Max got off to a really great start, and we've only been selling for a few weeks. The XR, we've only got out there for, I guess, 5 -- 5 days or so at this point and so that it's -- we have very, very little data there. Usually, there is some amount of wait until a product shows -- another product shows up in look, but in -- that -- in looking at the data, on the sales data for Xs and Xs Max, there's not obvious evidence of that in the data as I see it.",105

And you mentioned record levels for various components of the Services business. As we look forward, if growth of Services is to maintain something close to the recent pace, what are the components of Services that you're particularly excited about that could drive that and be the strongest drivers?

Is that potentially materially contributor to services in the near future?",84

When we look at our Services business, we think about the fact that we have a very large and growing installed base. The installed base of all our major product categories is at an all-time high and has been growing over the last several quarters. So the opportunity for us to monetize our Services business continues to grow over time. Of course, we are also improving the quality of the services that we provide, and if you look back during the last 3 years, we've added new services to our portfolio. We added Apple Pay. We added Apple Music. We added this advertising business on our App Store. And clearly, we will want to continue to offer new services over time. So there are a number of vectors that allow us to continue to grow the business over time. We have stated that we want to double the size of the Services business from the level that we had in fiscal '16 by 2020. We are well on pace to achieve that, and we feel very, very confident about the future of -- and the opportunities that we have in the Services space.",233

We -- just a year ago -- practically, a year ago, we came out with ARKit 1. 6 months or so after that, we came out with 1.5. We then recently came out with ARKit 2. The number of things that you can do are growing significantly. The number of developers that either have done something or even more the case that are working on things that I've seen are growing tremendously. There's a lot of interest out there. And the number of categories that I'm seeing from gaming to shopping to -- I was in China a few weeks ago and saw AR in the -- in an art sense, an art exhibit. I was in Berlin last week and saw it being used in a historical educational kind of sense. I'm seeing it sort of everywhere I go now.

And let me give you the puts and takes, Katy. You're correct, we are going to be getting some benefits from commodities in general and memory in particular. Memory, on a sequential basis, it's about 30 basis points favorable for us going into the December quarter. And obviously, we're going to be benefiting from the leverage, which is typical of our seasonality in the December quarter. On the other hand, as I mentioned before, currencies have weakened against the U.S. dollar. And the impact that we expect at the gross margin level from foreign exchange is a 90 basis points headwind sequentially. And of course, at this point in the cycle, we also have higher cost structures because, as I said, we've launched so many new products in the last 6 weeks.

So can you help us address that? Is India going to potentially be a big area as I think you've got about only 1% market share, but it sounded like things may be softened there?

We've been in discussions with them, and the discussions are going quite well. There is -- as you point out, there are import duties in some or most of the product categories that we're in. In some cases, they compound. And this is an area that we're giving lots of feedback on. We do manufacture some of the entry iPhones in India, and that project has gone well. I am a big believer in India. I am very bullish on the country and the people and our ability to do well there. The currency weakness has been part of our challenge there as you can tell from just looking at the currency trend. But I sort of view these as speed bumps along a very long journey, though, in that the long term is -- I think is very, very strong there. There's a huge number of people that will move into the middle class. The government has really focused on reform in a major way and made some very bold moves, and I applaud them for doing that and sort of can't wait for the future there.",224

First of all, as Tim said, our approach to guidance -- providing guidance doesn't change at all, and we continue to provide the same metrics that we were providing before. In terms of reporting results, one of the things that we are doing, and it's new and it's an addition to the information that we provide to investors because we've heard some significant level of interest around this, is starting with the December quarter, for the first time, we're going to be providing information on revenue and cost of sales and therefore, gross margins for both products and services. And this will be the first time that we're going to provide gross margin information for our Services business, which we believe it is an important metric for our investors to follow. Given the rationale on why we do not believe that providing unit sales is particularly relevant for our company at this point, I can reassure you that it is our objective to grow unit sales for every product category that we have. But as I said earlier, a unit of sale is less relevant today than it was in the past. To give you an example, the unit sales of iPhone at the top end of the line have been very strong during the September quarter. And that's very important because we are attracting customers to the most recent technologies and features and innovation that we bring into the lineup, but you don't necessarily see that in the number that is reported. And so therefore, we will -- as I said, we'll provide the qualitative commentary when it is important and relevant, but at the end of the day, we make our decisions to -- from a financial standpoint, to try and optimize our revenue and our gross margin dollars. And that, we think, is the focus that is in the best interest of our investors.",326

Our installed base is growing at double digit, and so there's no -- and that's probably a much more significant metric for us from an ecosystem point of view and customer loyalty, et cetera. The second thing is this is a little bit like if you go to the market and you push your cart up to the cashier and she says or he says, ""How many units you have in there?"", it sort of -- it doesn't matter a lot how many units there are in there in terms of the overall value of what's in the cart.",111
