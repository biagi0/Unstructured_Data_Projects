This isn't the first time you've heard from us regarding the December quarter, so the first thing I want to do is provide some final results and connect those back to the letter we shared at the beginning of the month.
As you know, our December quarter revenue was below our original expectations coming in at $84.3 billion. That's down 5% from a year ago or down 3% adjusting for foreign exchange. We noted 4 factors that would impact our results when we provided guidance in November: different iPhone launch timing from a year ago, FX headwinds, supply constraints on certain products and macroeconomic conditions in emerging markets.
One of those factors, weak macro conditions in some emerging markets, was significantly more severe than we originally foresaw, especially in Greater China. As our letter noted, that challenge was compounded by quarterly iPhone upgrades that were lower than we anticipated. We'll return to upgrades in a moment, but I first want to say a bit more about our business in Greater China. Our revenue there was down by $4.8 billion from last year with declines across iPhone, Mac and iPad. Most of the shortfall relative to our original guidance and over 100% of our worldwide year-over-year revenue decline was driven by our performance in Greater China.
Despite iPhone upgrades being lower than we anticipated, our business grew outside of China, including new records in the Americas, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe and our rest of Asia-Pacific segment. We had record performance in large markets, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, Germany, Italy, Spain and Korea.
In the letter we shared earlier this month, we said we are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace and that we believe our business has a bright future there over time. But I think some of that got lost, so I want to share a bit more detail on the positives we see in China.
We generated record December quarter services revenue in Greater China, fueled by an amazing ecosystem with over 2.5 million registered iOS developers. We saw very strong results from our Wearables business there with revenues up over 50%. We also continued to grow our total active installed base by adding new customers. In fact, more than 2/3 of all customers in China who bought a Mac or an iPad during the December quarter were purchasing that product for the first time.
Finally, for perspective, despite the challenging December quarter, our revenue from China grew slightly for the full calendar year. Macroeconomic factors will come and go, but we see great upside in continuing to focus on the things that we can control.
Returning to iPhone, I'd like to talk about our results in the context of those lower-than-expected upgrades. iPhone XR, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max are, by far, the best iPhones we've ever shipped. They share advanced technologies, including the A12 Bionic, the most powerful chip ever in a smartphone with our next-generation Neural Engine capable of 5 trillion operations per second. These are also completely modern iPhones with stunning large full-screen displays and Face ID, the most secure authentication of any kind available in a smartphone.
And the cameras are simply amazing with portrait mode and depth control to allow users to create studio-quality photos as well as stunning 4K video, opening a whole new era of photography. We couldn't be more proud of our iPhone lineup and our industry-leading customer satisfaction. We wouldn't change our position for anyone.
Now our customers are holding on to their older iPhones a bit longer than in the past. When you pair this with the macroeconomic factors, particularly in emerging markets, it resulted in iPhone revenue that was down 15% from last year. Our iPhone results accounted for significantly more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, outside of iPhone, our business grew strongly by 19%. So what's behind this?
It's important to understand what's going on from the customer perspective at the point of purchase. We believe that it's the sum of several factors: first, foreign exchange. The relative strength of the U.S. dollar has made our products more expensive in many parts of the world. In Turkey, for example, the lira depreciated by 33% over the course of calendar 2018, and in the December quarter, our revenue there was down by almost $700 million from the previous year.
Second, subsidies. For various reasons, iPhone subsidies are becoming increasingly less common. In Japan, for example, iPhone purchases were traditionally subsidized by carriers and bundled with service contracts. Competitive promotional activity frequently increase the amount of subsidy during key periods. Today, local regulations have significantly restricted those subsidies as well as related competition. As a result, we estimate that less than half of iPhones sold in Japan in Q1 of this year were subsidized compared to about 3/4 a year ago and that the total value of those subsidies had come down as well.
Third, our battery replacement program. For millions of customers, we made it inexpensive and efficient to replace the battery and hold onto their existing iPhones a bit longer. Some people have suggested that we shouldn't have done this because of the potential impact on upgrades, but we strongly believe it was the right thing to do for our customers.
What's very important, however, is that in spite of these factors, our total active installed base of devices has grown from 1.3 billion at the end of January of 2018 to 1.4 billion by the end of December, reaching a new all-time high for each of the main product categories and for all 5 of our geographic segments. Not only is our large and growing installed base a powerful testament to the satisfaction and loyalty of our customers, but it's also fueling our fast growing Services business. In fact, Services revenue set an all-time record at $10.9 billion in the December quarter, growing 19%.
We not only generated our highest global Services revenue ever, but we also had all-time records across multiple categories of Services, including the App Store, Apple Pay, cloud services and our App Store Search Ad business, and we had a December quarter record for AppleCare. And I'm very proud to say that nearly 16 years after launching the iTunes Store, we generated our highest quarterly music revenue ever, thanks to the great popularity of Apple Music, now with over 50 million paid subscribers.
The App Store wrapped up its best year ever with record holiday period results propelled by the biggest Christmas Day and Christmas week ever. Customers also spent over $322 million on New Year's Day alone, setting a new single-day record for both the number of customers and purchase volume. It was also a great holiday season for Apple Pay with over 1.8 billion transactions in the quarter, well over twice the volume of the year-ago quarter. Merchant adoption continues to reach new milestones. Customers can now use Apple Pay with iPhone and Apple Watch at nearly 3,000 Speedway locations, while all Target, Taco Bell and Jack in the Box stores will be accepting Apple Pay soon.
We launched Apple Pay in 3 new countries in the December quarter: Germany, Belgium and Kazakhstan and it's now live in 27 markets around the world. The rollout in Germany has been a huge success with Deutsche Bank reporting more activations for Apple Pay in 1 week than for Android in an entire year. This is yet another example of what's possible when you bring together Apple's world-class hardware, software and ecosystem with our engaged and active user base. Shoppers around the world love Apple Pay, and it has increasingly become an indispensable part of daily life.
Revenue from cloud services continues to grow rapidly with year-over-year revenue up over 40% in the December quarter. And readership of Apple News set a new record with over 85 million monthly active users in the 3 countries where we've launched: the United States, the U.K. and Australia. Here in the U.S., the latest data from comScore shows that Apple News has the largest audience of all news apps. And the international audience will continue to grow with our first-ever bilingual launch in Canada available to customers later this quarter.
In summary, we're very happy not only with the growth but also the breadth of our Services portfolio. Our revenue from Services has grown from less than $8 billion in calendar 2010 to over $41 billion in calendar 2018. The largest category represents less than 30% of total Services revenue, and the new services we've launched in the last few years are all experiencing tremendous growth.
We had our best quarter ever for Mac revenue, which was up 9% fueled by our new MacBook Air and Mac mini introduced in October. The MacBook Air includes a beautiful new Retina display, Touch ID and Force Touch Trackpad, while the new Mac mini provides a powerful, flexible solution for everything from home automation to giant render farms.
iPad revenue was up 17%, its highest growth rate in almost 6 years, powered by the new iPad Pro released in November. With its edge-to-edge Liquid Retina display, Face ID and A12X Bionic chip, the new iPad Pro has been described by reviewers as a tablet with no equal and the most powerful mobile device ever made.
We also had our best quarter ever for Wearables, Home and Accessories with 33% growth in total and almost 50% growth from Wearables, thanks to strong sales of both Apple Watch and AirPods.
We don't measure our success in 90-day increments. We manage Apple for the long term, and when we consider the keys to our success over time, there are 3 that stand out: our highly satisfied and loyal customers; our large and growing active installed base; and at the heart of it all, our deeply ingrained culture of innovation. Thanks to all this, our ecosystem is stronger than ever before.
We have an amazingly talented team, creating hardware, software and services, optimizing each of them to create an unparalleled user experience. Apple Watch is a powerful example of that. It's humbling to read e-mails from customers around the world telling us how Apple Watch has dramatically changed their lives by motivating them to be more fit and active, by alerting them to potentially serious health conditions such as AFib and by helping them in times of crisis with features like fall detection and emergency SOS. We believe we are just beginning to see the impact we can make to improving health and are deeply inspired by the possibilities.
Another example is the work we're doing with silicon. We've embedded machine learning directly into the silicon with our A12 Bionic chip. Our custom Neural Engine not only provides power efficiency and incredible performance in a very small package, but it also enables processing of data and transactions directly on the device. This means iPhone can recognize patterns, make predictions and learn from experience, and it does all this while keeping personal information private. This is a powerful example of how innovation and privacy can go hand in hand at a time when these issues are increasingly important to our users.
We are undertaking and accelerating a number of initiatives to improve our results. It's not in our DNA to just stand around and wait for macroeconomic conditions to improve. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in an iPhone in our stores and raising awareness of this opportunity. Because of the quality and durability of iPhones, they maintain significant residual value, making trade-ins a great opportunity. It's not only great for the environment. It's great for the customer as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it's great for developers as the phone that is traded in and redistributed can help grow our active installed base.
Beginning last week, we started making it easier for people to pay for their phones over time with installment payments, and we're working on rolling out this program to more geographies as soon as we can. We are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business, and we have a very strong pipeline of products and services with some exciting announcements coming later this year. Apple innovates like no other company on Earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas. We'll continue to invest through near-term headwinds just as we always have, and we'll emerge stronger as a result.
Now for more details on our December quarter results, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca.",2114
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2019",2019-01-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3435.0,1643659.0,64768041.0,Presenter Speech,Luca Maestri,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. As Tim said, revenue for the December quarter was $84.3 billion. This result was below our expectations, but we were able to set new all-time revenue records in the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe and Korea. Our results were especially strong in the U.S., where revenue was up by more than $1.5 billion compared to a year ago and in several markets where revenue grew by double digits, including, among others, Germany, Spain, Poland, Mexico, Malaysia and Vietnam.
Looking at product categories. iPhone revenue declined 15% from a year ago, while revenue from the rest of our business grew 19% to an all-time record, including our best results ever for Services, for Wearables and for Mac. Company gross margin was 38%. This quarter, for the first time, we're making an important new disclosure to our investors as we believe it will foster a better understanding of our business. We're now reporting, on a quarterly basis, gross margin for products in aggregate and for services in aggregate. Products gross margin was 34.3%, and services gross margin was 62.8%.
On a sequential basis, products gross margin increased 60 basis points due to positive leverage from the holiday quarter partially offset by higher cost structures as we launched several new products and by headwinds from foreign exchange. Services gross margin also increased 170 basis points sequentially due to favorable mix and leverage partially offset by foreign exchange. While both products and services gross margins improved sequentially, total company gross margin was down 30 basis points due to a different mix between products and services.
Net income was $20 billion, about flat to last year; and diluted earnings per share were an all-time record at $4.18, an increase of 7.5% over last year. Operating cash flow was also very strong at $26.7 billion.
Let me provide more color for the various products categories. iPhone revenue was $52 billion. On a geographic basis, most of the decline from last year came from Greater China and other emerging markets, where difficult macro and foreign exchange conditions affected our results. We also believe that the reduction of carrier subsidies and our battery replacement program had an impact in a number of countries around the world. And as Tim mentioned, we had a lower number of upgrades than we had anticipated at the beginning of the quarter.
However, our global active installed base of iPhones continues to grow and has reached an all-time high at the end of December. We are disclosing that number now for the first time. And it has surpassed 900 million devices, up year-over-year in each of our 5 geographic segments and growing almost 75 million in the last 12 months alone. We plan to provide information on the iPhone installed base as well as total installed base on a periodic basis.
Customer satisfaction and loyalty for iPhone continue to be outstanding and are the highest in the industry. The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone XR, XS and XS Max combined. And among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the March quarter, 81% plan to purchase iPhones. Based on the latest information from Kantar, iPhone experienced a 90% customer loyalty rating for iPhone customers in the U.S., 23 points above the next highest brand measured.
Turning to Services. It was our best quarter ever with revenue of $10.9 billion, up 19% year-over-year with new December quarter records in all 5 of our geographic segments. Many Services categories set new all-time revenue records, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling our fiscal 2016 Services revenue by 2020. To be clear and as we've already explained 90 days ago, our 2020 goal remains unchanged, and it excludes the impact of the revenue reclassification between products and services we recorded in connection with ASC 606, the new revenue recognition accounting standard that we adopted at the beginning of fiscal '19.
The level of engagement of our customers in our ecosystem continues to grow. The number of transacting accounts on our digital stores reached a new all-time high during the quarter with the number of paid accounts growing by strong double digits over last year. And we now have over 360 million paid subscriptions across our Services portfolio, an increase of 120 million versus a year ago. Given the continued strength and momentum in this part of the business, we now expect the number of paid subscriptions to surpass 0.5 billion during 2020.
Our subscription business has become very large and diversified, covering many different categories from entertainment to health and fitness to lifestyle. In fact, more than 30,000 third-party subscription apps are available today on the App Store, and the largest of them accounts for only 0.3% of our total Services revenue.
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We saw great response to the new MacBook Air and Mac mini that we introduced in October, which helped drive a 9% increase in Mac revenue over last year to a new all-time record. Mac revenue was up in the vast majority of countries we track with double-digit growth in many large markets such as the U.S., Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, Japan, Korea and South Asia. Our active installed base of Macs reached a new all-time high, and half of all the customers purchasing Macs in the December quarter were new to Mac.
We also had great results for iPad with revenue up 17% from a year ago. And strong performance of both iPad and iPad Pro had generated double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 geographic segments. Similar to the Mac, our installed base of iPads reached a new all-time high, and among customers purchasing iPad during the quarter, half were new to iPad.
The most recent consumer survey from 451 Research measured a 94% customer satisfaction rating for iPad overall with iPad Pro models scoring as high as 100%. Among business customers who plan to purchase tablets in the March quarter, 68% plan to purchase iPads.
Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue grew 33% to a new all-time record in each of our geographic segments. Revenue from this category was up over $1.8 billion compared to a year ago, thanks to the amazing popularity of Apple Watch and AirPods, both of which were supply constrained as we exited the quarter. Based on revenue over the past 4 quarters, our Wearables business is approaching the size of a Fortune 200 company.
Our retail and online stores generated strong results from Mac and iPad and all-time record performance from Services and from Wearables. Following the launch of the new iPhone trade-in campaign, our stores more than doubled the volume of iPhones traded in compared to last year, reaching an all-time high in Q1. We added Thailand to our footprint with a beautiful store in Bangkok, and we opened a stunning new store on Champs-Élysées in Paris, exiting the quarter with 506 physical stores in 22 countries.
In enterprise, across multiple industries, our technology continues to enable businesses to do their best work. In health care, iPhones and iOS apps continue to streamline and support clinical workflows, communications and care delivery across leading health systems, including Johns Hopkins Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Stanford Health Care and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.
In manufacturing, SKF, the world's largest producers of bearings and seals, have transformed their manufacturing processes on iOS and iPhone with incredible success. With custom iOS apps available to production operators across their worldwide locations, SKF has reduced production errors from 20% to 0 while saving 70% in system-related time. Apple technology has made possible a simplified user experience integrating the SAP Cloud Platform, yielding better accuracy, efficiency and employee experiences across the board.
We're also seeing great innovation in the construction industry with iPad and new third-party apps made for iOS. For instance, Procore Technologies has introduced an app to help decrease building errors on the job site. By using Metal and Split View with the iPad camera, construction workers can compare building plans and 3D models to what is actually being built in realtime. This new iOS app reduces wasted raw materials and helps keep building projects on time and on budget.
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $245 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We also had $102.8 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding for a net cash position of $130 billion. As we explained in the past, it is our plan to reach a net cash neutral position over time.
As part of this plan, we returned over $13 billion to our investors during the December quarter. We repurchased 38 million Apple shares for $8.2 billion through open market transactions, and we paid $3.6 billion in dividends and equivalents. Consistent with our historical cadence, we plan to provide an update on our overall capital return program when we report our March quarter results.
As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $55 billion and $59 billion. This range reflects a negative year-over-year impact of $1.3 billion from foreign exchange, which represents about 210 basis points of last year's revenue and a more uncertain macroeconomic environment than a year ago, especially in emerging markets.
We expect gross margin to be between 37% and 38%. On a sequential basis, this range reflects seasonal loss of leverage and a 60 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, partially offset by commodity cost savings.
We expect OpEx to be between $8.5 billion and $8.6 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $300 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 17%. Also, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.73 per share of common stock payable on February 14, 2019, to shareholders of record as of February 11, 2019.
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.",1697

So can you talk about the factors that played into that slower growth? And then appreciate the new disclosure around paid subscribers. But if you compare what you added in 2018 versus what you expect to add over the next 2 years, that implies a slowdown in annual net new subscribers. So should we be thinking about Services as a lower growth segment than what you experienced in 2018? And then I have a follow-up.",86
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2019",2019-01-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3435.0,1643659.0,64768045.0,Answer,Luca Maestri,,Executives,7,"Yes, Katy, let me take that one. First of all, when we talk about the Services business, it's very important to start from the momentum that we have. As you know, we have set an ambitious target for ourselves to double the size of our business from fiscal '16 to 2020, which implied, at the time, a 19% CAGR. So far, we've been able to grow about 20%. In fiscal '18, we grew 22%, so we are on track to achieve our objective. And it's important to understand what is driving the growth of the business. First of all, it's our installed base. As we just told you, the installed base continues to grow very nicely. It has reached 1.4 billion active devices at the end of December, and really, very little of our Services revenue is driven by what we sell in the last 90 days. The second factor for the growth of the Services business is that, within this installed base, the percentage of users who are paying for at least 1 service is growing very strongly. This is due to several factors. First of all, we're offering more and more services. During the last few years, as you know, we launched Apple Music, Apple Pay and advertising service for our developers on the App Store. All these businesses are growing very strongly. Second, we are making it easier for our customers to transact on our digital stores. We accept many more payment methods today, which are very common in certain countries around the world. We've also increased the distribution coverage for many of these services. We're bringing AppleCare to more points of sale around the world. We are launching Apple Pay in more and more markets and so on. Thirdly, as you mentioned, our subscriptions are becoming a very large portion of our business, and they're growing very well above Services average. And the fact that we are saying that we will surpass 0.5 billion during 2020, we're not putting a specific date during 2020, but I think you've seen over recent quarters that we've been adding about 120 million on a year-over-year basis for a number of quarters now. And this is an incredible staggering number, right, when you think about it. We're also broadening the scope of many of these services. You should take Apple Pay as an example. It started off as the most convenient, most private and most secure way to make a payment in a store or in an app. Then, we took Apple Pay to Safari. Then, we started a peer-to-peer service, and we're launching it in new markets across the world every quarter. So we are broadening that scope. And of course, similar to what we've done in the past in the last 3 years we launched several new services, we're also looking to launch new services going forward that we believe will provide great value to our users. And we're really very excited about the opportunities that we see in front of us. I think you're referring to the deceleration in the growth rate that we've seen in the December quarter, and I think you're referring back to the growth that we reported in September. I think an important point I need to make and I think it's helpful that you asked the question is that a portion of this deceleration is truly just a reclassification of the amortization of free services that we've made in connection with the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. And as we explained 90 days ago, this amortization of free services in the past was reported under products and now gets reported under services. The reclassification is actually dilutive to our growth rate because the amortization of free services is a relatively stable number, which gets applied to our growing base. So this reclassification reduces our growth rate versus the previous classification. This factor, by itself, represents roughly 1/3 of the deceleration that you've seen. We talked about 27% growth in the September quarter. With the reclassification, that growth rate was about 24.5%. So that explains about 1/3 of that deceleration. There are, I would say, 3 factors that explain this difference between the 24.5% to the 19%. The first one is that foreign exchange plays a role. Roughly 60% of our Services business is outside the United States; and as you know, the U.S. dollar has appreciated in recent months. And in general, we tend not to reprice our services for foreign exchange on a very frequent basis. The second factor is a well-known issue around the App Store in China. The App Store in China is a large business for us. We believe this issue around the approval of new game titles is temporary in nature but clearly is affecting our business right now. And then thirdly, we are seeing some level of deceleration in AppleCare, which has had very, very strong growth during fiscal '18, where we're starting to lap some of the increase in distribution coverage that we put in place recently and the channel fill of Apple components that happened when we increased the distribution coverage. But in general, we are very, very pleased with 19% growth, and we think that the business will continue to grow nicely going forward.",883

What have you learned about price elasticity? And do you feel that perhaps you pushed the envelope a little bit too far and might have to bring that down in the future?",47

If you look at what we did this past year, we priced the iPhone XS in the U.S. the same as we priced the iPhone X the year ago. The iPhone XS Max, which was new, was $100 more than the XS. And then we priced the XR right in the middle of where the entry iPhone 8 and entry iPhone 8 Plus have been priced. So it's actually a pretty small difference in the United States compared to last year. However, the foreign exchange issue that Luca spoke of in the call and -- made that difference or amplified that difference in international markets, in particular, the emerging markets, which tended to move much more significantly versus the dollar. And so what we have done in January and in some locations and some products is essentially absorb part or all of the foreign currency move as compared to last year and therefore, get close or perhaps right on the local price from a year ago. So yes, I do think that price is a factor. I think part of it is that, the FX piece. And then secondly, in some markets as I had talked about in my prepared remarks, the subsidy is probably the bigger of the issues in the developed markets. I had mentioned Japan; but also even in this country, even though the subsidy has gone away for a period of time, if you're a customer that your last purchase was a 6s or 6 or in some cases, even a 7, you may have paid $199 for it -- and now in an unbundled world, it's obviously much more than that. And so we are working through those, and we've got a number of actions to address that, including the trade-in and the installment payments, which I had mentioned as well.",309

If you remember, our top models, the XS and XS Max shipped during the September quarter, which plays the channel fill and the initial sales in that quarter. While last year, the iPhone X shipped in Q1 in the December quarter but is in the channel fill and the initial sales in the December quarter. So we knew that this would create a difficult compare for Q1 of '19, and this is essentially what happened. It was pretty much in line with our expectations. To give you more color, I would say that the XR is our most popular model, and it's followed by XS Max and then the XS.",133

Luca, looks like the midpoint of your Q2 revenue guidance implies the steepest Q1 to Q2 sequential decline in iPhone revenues in history. It also implies a year-over-year deceleration in iPhone revenues. And I'm wondering if you can comment about whether that's conservatism, whether you're entering the quarter with a high level of channel inventory, and maybe you can comment explicitly on that, or whether you actually think the macroeconomic conditions are getting worse.",83

The first one is a question around conservatism. As we always do, when we provide a range, it's a range that we believe we're going to fall within. We've done pretty well with that up until the December quarter, right? I mean, we've been -- we didn't miss in years and years. So that's the idea. It's -- there is that specific level of conservatism. We believe that this is the range where we're going to fall within. On channel inventory, as you know, our historical pattern for iPhone channel inventory is that, typically, we increase inventory in Q1 and we decrease in Q2. And we think this year will be similar, and we've exited the December quarter with levels of inventory that we are comfortable with. So that leaves us with the reality that our iPhone performance in Q1, from a revenue standpoint, was minus 15%. And we expect that the key factors that Tim mentioned during the call affecting iPhone performance in Q1 will also have an effect on Q2 starting with the strong U.S. dollar environment. On a year-over-year basis, the negative impact from currency is going to be about $1.3 billion, so that's about -- a bit more than 2 points versus last year's revenue. And so that obviously plays a role. And the macroeconomic environment, particularly in emerging markets, will continue to be there. On the positive side, we expect that we will continue to grow revenue nicely from the rest of the business, which is not iPhone.",259

And Apple's clearly doing that by helping with the battery replacement program, iOS working on an older range of products, et cetera. But I guess, the question is why doesn't that mean that replacement or upgrade cycles for iPhones should continue to extend going forward, in part, because that's almost one of your objectives. And maybe to that end, maybe you can help us understand what iPhone's average replacement cycle might be today and how that may have changed over the last 3 to 5 years. And again, why wouldn't you expect it to elongate over time given some of the aforementioned things?",126

Some people hold onto those for the life of the product, and some people trade them in. And then that phone is then redistributed to someone else. And so it doesn't necessarily follow that one leads to the other. The cycles -- the average cycle has extended. There's no doubt about that. We've said several times, I think, on this call and before that the upgrades for the quarter were less than we anticipated due to the -- all the reasons that we had mentioned. So where it goes in the future, I don't know, but I'm convinced that making a great product that is high quality, that is the best thing for the customer and we work for the user.

I think you've seen that Services gross margins increased on a year-over-year basis by a significant amount. Let me start with sequential because I think it's probably most relevant for us. Sequentially, we increased 170 basis points. It's a business that is growing nicely, so we get good support from our scale. Some of these services are scaling quickly, and so we tend to expand gross margins there. And also, we had favorable mix. As you probably know, we have a very broad portfolio of services. Some of them tend to be accretive to the average gross margin for Services also because of the way we account for them. For example, you know that on the App Store, we book revenue on a net basis, and therefore, the gross margins tend to be accretive. But we also have services that are very successful that are below the average for the Services business. And so depending on how these separate businesses do in the marketplace, we're going to be seeing some level of movement going forward on Services margins. But you've seen that, for the last 12 months, they've gone up nicely, 450 basis points, and sequentially, they've gone up 170 basis points. But I wouldn't draw necessarily a conclusion on how this Services gross margin is going to move over time. We will report, of course, at the end of every quarter. But important to keep in mind, it's a broad portfolio with very different gross margin profiles within the portfolio. It is important for us to grow gross margin dollars. And if at times we grow services that are at a level of gross margins, which is below average, as long as this is good for the customer and as long as we generate gross margin dollars, we're going to be very pleased.",306

Shannon, we see huge changes in customer behavior taking place now, and we think that it will accelerate as the year goes by to sort of the breakdown of the cable bundle that's been talked about for years. And I think that it'll likely take place at a much faster pace this year. And so we're going to participate in that in a variety of ways. One of those is through Apple TV, and you're well familiar with that product. The second way is the -- is AirPlay 2, which we have -- as you just pointed out, we have support on a number of different third-party TVs. And we're excited about that. It makes the experience in the living room with people using our products even better. We think that people are really going to like that. Another way is, of course, the -- all the third-party video subscriptions that are on the store. We're participating in this today. And I would guess that, that's going to accelerate into the future as the bundle breaks down and people begin to buy likely multiple services in place of their current cable bundle. And then finally, original content, where -- we will participate in the original content world. We have signed a multiyear partnership with Oprah. But today, I'm not really ready to extend that conversation beyond that point. We've hired some great people that I have a super amount of confidence in, and they're working really hard.

Can you just describe how the math works on that? Is it that the free services are noncash revenue that's getting booked in the services revenue with no cost and the costs come out of products?

In essence, when we sell a product at a certain price, we make an assumption. We estimate the value that can be associated to providing free service. In our case, it's providing Maps services, providing Siri and providing free iCloud to all the customers that purchase our product. And so we calculate an estimated value. That value gets deferred and gets amortized over the estimated period of time that we deliver the free services. In the past, that deferral and the subsequent amortization was reported under products. Now in connection with the new revenue recognition standard, we are reclassifying essentially that amortization from products revenue to services revenue. So total revenue has not changed. We just report that estimated value under the services category. We also reclassify the cost that we need to incur to provide those services. So the gross margin rate of each services is clearly significantly dilutive to the overall Services margin. I hope I've answered that.",161

So it's in mixed services gross margin. Got it. And then my other -- my second question is just when you think about growth in Services, you have selling more to existing paid subscription customers or it's the 300 million going to 0.5 billion. If you can just talk, at a high level, as far as when you look at growth going forward, is it about -- what is the mix in terms of selling more to existing users, getting new users or -- and maybe some of the individual services that you see the biggest growth opportunity?",101

I mean, as I said, I mean, essentially, what -- the services -- I said services too is our installed base. So the first driver is growing the installed base. Installed base has grown nicely over the last several years. We've added 100 million in the last 12 months alone. So that's the first step. Then within that installed base, of course, we want to make sure that there are more people that are so interested in our services that, in addition to transacting on those services on a free basis, they also are interested in paying for those services. And I mentioned that the percentage of paid accounts has increased strong double digits. So we want to continue to do that. We want to make it easier for our customers to actually use our services, and so we are accepting more and more payment methods around the world. And clearly, as you said, the idea of adding new services is very important to us. During the last 3 years, we've added Apple Pay, which has been incredibly successful and is a wonderful customer experience. We've added Apple Music, where we now have more than 50 million paid subscribers and continues to grow very nicely. And we've added a very useful service to our developers. We provide an advertising service for developers on the App Store. The way we've added these services in the past, obviously, we're also very interested in adding new services that can provide great value to our customers in the future. And we don't want to get into product announcements here, but obviously, that is part of our strategy.",274

This has been an exciting and productive quarter for Apple. In my letter to investors at the beginning of January, I wrote that one of Apple's great strengths is our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity. This quarter featured some important announcements that speak to the power of our commitment to innovation and long-term thinking. I'd like to start with some top line highlights and then move into greater detail with you.
I'll get started with financial results. Our revenue was $58 billion, toward the high end of our guidance range. We see this result as a positive outcome in light of ongoing headwinds from weaker foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. In constant currency, our year-over-year revenue performance would have been 200 basis points better than our reported results indicate.
We had great results in a number of areas across our business. It was our best quarter ever for Services with revenue reaching $11.5 billion. We had a blockbuster quarter for iPad with revenue up 22% from a year ago. This is our highest iPad revenue growth rate in 6 years. And it was another sensational quarter for Wearables with growth near 50%. This business is now about the size of a Fortune 200 company, an amazing statistic when you consider it's only been 4 years since we delivered the very first Apple Watch. I'll talk more about these categories later.
While we grew year-over-year in developed markets and while we had record March quarter results in a number of major markets, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan, we did experience a revenue decline in emerging markets. But we feel positive about our trajectory. Our year-over-year revenue performance in Greater China improved relative to the December quarter, and we've seen very positive customer response to the pricing actions we've taken in that market, our trade-in and financing programs in our retail stores, the effects of government measures to stimulate the economy and improved trade dialogue between the United States and China. Our App Store results are still reflecting the impact of the slowdown of regulatory approval in gaming apps in China, but we're encouraged by the recent increase in the pace of approvals. We believe strongly in our long-term opportunity in China thanks to our robust ecosystem, our talented developer community and the country's growing population of tech-savvy consumers who value the very best products and services.
For iPhone, while our worldwide revenue was down 17% from a year ago, declines were significantly smaller in the final weeks of the March quarter. Looking back at the past 5 months, November and December were the most challenging, so this is an encouraging trend. We like the direction we're headed with iPhone, and our goal now is to pick up the pace.
Importantly, our active installed base of devices continues to grow in each of our geographic segments and setting new all-time record for all major product categories. That growing installed base is a reflection of the satisfaction and loyalty of our customers, and it's driving our Services business to new heights.
In fact, we had our best quarter ever for the App Store, Apple Music, cloud services and our App Store search ad business, and we set new March quarter revenue records for AppleCare and Apple Pay. Apple Pay transaction volume more than doubled year-over-year, and we're on track to reach 10 billion transactions this calendar year. Apple Pay is now available in 30 markets, and we expect to be live in 40 markets by the end of the year. More and more transit systems are accepting Apple Pay, and New York's MTA system will begin their rollout in early summer. As we've seen in places like London, Tokyo and Shanghai, contactless entry into transit systems helps to spur broader Apple Pay adoption, and we believe this will get even more people using Apple Pay in the United States.
And Ticketmaster has just announced that they will be accepting Apple Pay for ticket purchases on the web and through the Ticketmaster app. And over 50 of their entertainment and sporting event venues are launching contactless tickets this year, including the vast majority of NFL stadiums.
Subscriptions are a powerful driver of our Services business. We reached a new high of over 390 million paid subscriptions at the end of March, an increase of 30 million in the last quarter alone. This was also an incredibly important quarter for our Services moving forward. In March, we previewed a game-changing array of new services, each of them rooted in principles that are fundamentally Apple. They're easy to use. They feature unmatched attention to detail. They put a premium on user privacy and security. They're expertly curated, personalized and ready to be shared by everyone in your family. These features aren't just nice to have. They actually help to eliminate the boundary between hardware, software and service, creating a singularly exceptional experience for our users.
First, building on the great momentum of Apple News, which is already the #1 news app in the United States and the United Kingdom, we launched Apple News+. It will bring together over 30 popular magazines, leading newspapers and digital publishers into a beautiful, convenient and curated experience within the Apple News app. Apple News+ builds on our commitment to supporting quality journalism from trusted sources while providing the best magazine and news reading experience ever for mobile devices.
Advancing our vision to replace the wallet, we announced Apple Card, built on principles Apple stands for like transparency, simplicity and privacy. Apple Card is integrated into the Wallet app and delivers all new experiences that only Apple can provide, integrating our hardware, software and services in an elegant solution that places the customer at the center. It's the first card to encourage you to pay less interest, eliminate fees and give you daily cash on all your purchases, and customer interest to date has been terrific.
We also previewed Apple Arcade, the world's first game subscription service for mobile, desktop in the living room. With over 100 new games all with no ads or ad tracking, no additional purchases and respect for user privacy, we've created a service for players of all ages, kids to teens to adults and one that families can enjoy together. The App Store is already the world's biggest gaming platform, and we think Apple Arcade is a great way to unleash the creativity of the game developer community with a collection of new games not available on any other mobile platform or in any other subscription service. We can't wait for our customers to experience it for themselves beginning this fall.
We were thrilled to provide a peek at what's new for TV. Beginning in mid-May, the all-new Apple TV app will bring together the different ways to discover and watch shows, movies, sports, news and more in 1 app across iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Mac, smart TVs and streaming devices. And users can subscribe to and watch new Apple TV channels like HBO, Showtime and Starz, paying only for services they want, all on demand available on and offline. And coming this fall, Apple TV+ will be the new home for the world's most creative storytellers featuring exclusive original shows, movies and documentaries.
We also had several major product introductions during the quarter. We launched a new, more powerful iMac with dramatic increases in both compute and graphics performance, making it a great update for consumers and pros alike. For our Mac business overall, we faced some processor constraints in the March quarter, leading to a 5% revenue decline compared to last year. But we believe that our Mac revenue would have been up compared to last year without those constraints and don't believe this challenge will have a significant impact on our Q3 results.
For iPad, we were very happy to return to growth in Greater China while generating strong double-digit growth in each of our other geographic segments. Our great iPad results were driven primarily by strong customer response to iPad Pro. Late in the quarter, we launched an all-new iPad Air with an ultra-thin design, Apple Pencil support and high-end performance powered by Apple's A12 Bionic chip. In addition, we introduced a new iPad mini, a major upgrade for iPad fans who love an ultra-portable design, and like the new iPad Air, it delivers the power of the A12 Bionic and support for Apple Pencil.
Last month, we introduced new AirPods, the second generation of the world's most popular wireless headphones and demand has been incredible. This is nothing less than a cultural phenomenon. With the new Apple-designed H1 chip, the new AirPods deliver faster connect times, more talk time and the convenience of hands-free Hey Siri.
Our retail and online stores continue to be a key point of innovation. As we mentioned in January, we've been working on an initiative to make it simple to trade in our -- trade in a phone in our store, finance the purchase over time and get help transferring data from the old phone to the new phone. As part of this initiative, we rolled out new trade-in and financing programs in the U.S., China, the U.K., Spain, Italy and Australia. The results had been striking. Across our stores, we had an all-time record response to our trade-in programs and with more than 4x the trade-in volume of our March quarter a year ago.
With each passing quarter, we're more inspired by the impact our products are having on people's fitness and health. This quarter, we brought the ECG app on Apple Watch Series 4 to Hong Kong and 19 European countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the U.K. Just like when the ECG app launched in the United States, there's hardly a day that goes by that I don't get a letter or an e-mail from a customer in one of these countries talking about how this feature had significantly changed their life.
We believe we're really just beginning to tap into what we can do to help our users actively manage their health and well-being. For example, last month, Stanford Medicine reported results of the Apple Heart Study, the largest study ever of its kind, which enrolled over 400,000 participants from all 50 states in a span of only 8 months. And hundreds of institutions are now supporting health records on iPhone with recent additions including Michigan Medicine and UT Health Austin. In February, we announced that we are working with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to make health records on iPhone available to veterans. This will be the first record sharing platform of its kind available to the VA, which is the largest medical system in the U.S. providing service to more than 9 million veterans across more than 1,200 facilities.
Apple's innovation extends beyond the impact we have in the lives of our customers to the impact we leave on the world around us. We recently marked Earth Day with several major announcements about our efforts to leave the world better than we found it. We've completed the allocation of our $2.5 billion green bond proceeds across 40 environmental initiatives around the world to projects ranging from solar power generation to water conservation to development of custom alloys for our products made from 100% recycled aluminum.
We've announced a major expansion of our recycling programs, including quadrupling the number of locations where U.S. customers can send their iPhones to be disassembled by Daisy, our recycling robot. Each Daisy can now disassemble 1.2 million devices per year, allowing recovered materials to be recycled into the manufacturing process.
And we partnered with a record number of our suppliers to follow our lead and transition to 100% clean energy. With the help of these 44 suppliers, we will exceed our goal of bringing 4 gigawatts of renewable energy into our supply chain by 2020 with over 1 additional gigawatt projected within that time frame. In the last calendar year alone, the partners that have joined this effort have generated enough clean energy to power over 600,000 homes in the United States.
We're very proud of the progress that we and our partners are making and hope our actions will inspire other businesses to do what they can to protect the world that we share. We are as excited as ever about our great pipeline of hardware, software and services, and we're looking forward to sharing more information about the future of our 4 software platforms at our Worldwide Developer Conference now less than 5 weeks from now. Everyone here is hard at work to prepare for WWDC, and it's always a privilege to get to share the future of our platforms with the community of world-changing developers who bring it to life. You are not going to want to miss this one.
We're in the fortunate position of generating more cash than we need to run our business and invest confidently in our future, so today, we're announcing the latest update to our capital return program, including an increase to our share repurchase authorization and our quarterly dividend. For more details on that and our March quarter results, I'll turn the call over to Luca.",2225
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2019",2019-04-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3306.0,1716751.0,67388853.0,Presenter Speech,Luca Maestri,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone.
Revenue in the March quarter was $58 billion, near the high end of the guidance range that we provided 90 days ago and down 5% from last year. Our revenue decline reflects 200 basis points of negative foreign exchange due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. Overall products revenue declined 9% driven primarily by iPhone, while Services revenue grew 16% to a new all-time record. We also set a new March quarter record for Wearables, Home and Accessories, and we recorded our best iPad growth rate in 6 years.
Company gross margin was 37.6%, in line with our guidance. Products gross margin was 31.2%, down about 310 basis points sequentially due to the seasonal loss of leverage and headwinds from foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 63.8%, up 100 basis points sequentially due to a different mix and leverage from higher revenue. Net income was $11.6 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $2.46, and operating cash flow was $11.2 billion.
Let me provide more color for our various revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $31.1 billion. We're seeing positive customer response to recent pricing actions in certain emerging markets as well as enhancements to our trade-in and financing programs. And our year-over-year performance improved relative to our December quarter results in Greater China, in the Americas and in Japan. Our active installed base of iPhone reached a new all-time high at the end of March. This growing installed base reflects the industry-leading satisfaction and loyalty of our customers. The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone XR, XS and XS Max combined. And among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the June quarter, 81% plan to purchase iPhones.
Turning to Services. As Tim said, it was our best quarter ever with $11.5 billion in revenue, an increase of 16% from last year. We generated double-digit revenue growth across the App Store, Apple Music, cloud services, AppleCare, Apple Pay and our App Store search ad business. And we set all-time services revenue records in 4 of our 5 geographic segments. We're very happy with this performance. As you can see from our new disclosures, Services accounted for 20% of our March quarter revenue and about 1/3 of our gross profit dollars.
Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow. The number of transacting accounts on our digital content stores reached another new all-time high during the quarter with the number of paid accounts also setting a new all-time record and growing by strong double digits over last year. And we now have over 390 million paid subscriptions across our Services portfolio, an increase of 120 million versus just 12 months ago. All subscription categories are growing strong double digits, and as we mentioned a quarter ago, we expect the number of paid subscriptions to surpass 0.5 billion during 2020.
On the App Store, our subscription business is extremely diversified and is growing strongly around the world. In fact, the number of paid third-party subscriptions increased by over 40% compared to last year in each of our geographic segments. And across all third-party subscription apps, the largest accounted for only 0.3% of our total Services revenue.
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. Revenue was $5.5 billion compared to $5.8 billion a year ago with the decline driven primarily by processor constraint on certain popular models. In spite of this challenge, we generated double-digit Mac revenue growth in Japan and Korea, setting new all-time Mac revenue records in both markets. On a global basis, nearly half of the customers purchasing Macs during the quarter were new to Mac, and the active installed base of Macs reached a new all-time high.
We had great results for iPad with $4.9 billion in revenue and growth accelerating from the December quarter to 22%. iPad revenue grew in all 5 of our geographic segments with a return to growth in Greater China and strong double-digit growth in all other segments. We had our best March quarter ever for iPad in Japan, and we were especially pleased by performance in Korea, Thailand and Mexico where revenue more than doubled over last year. In total, over half of the customers purchasing iPads during the March quarter were new to iPad, and the iPad active installed base also reached a new all-time high.
iPad revenue growth has been fueled primarily by the great customer response to our new iPad Pros. These completely redesigned iPads with full-screen Liquid Retina display, Face ID, powerful A12X Bionic chip with Neural Engine and support for the new Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard make iPad Pro the perfect PC, laptop replacement for both consumers and professionals.
The most recent surveys from 451 Research measured a 93% customer satisfaction rating for iPad overall. Among customers who plan to purchase tablets, 77% of consumers and 75% of businesses plan to purchase iPads.
Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue set a new March quarter revenue record of $5.1 billion fueled primarily by the strong performance of our Wearables business, which grew close to 50%. Within this category, Apple Watch is the best selling and most loved smartwatch in the world and produced its best results ever for a nonholiday quarter. It's reaching many new customers with 3/4 of purchases going to customers who have never owned an Apple Watch before. Interest in AirPods has been off the charts, and we're working hard to catch up with the incredible customer demand.
Turning to our retail and online stores. We generated very strong double-digit revenue growth from Apple Watch and iPad. We also announced 50 new Today at Apple sessions during the quarter in 3 new and expanded formats, Skills, Walks and Labs, free at our stores around the world.
We're making important progress in the enterprise market, helping transform major industries. We're building on Apple's leading position in key functional areas to expand our reach and share within large accounts. Aviation is a strong example of this strategy at work. Across 450 airlines, iPad is overwhelmingly the preferred solution for the pilot's electronic flight bag. We've been making great progress expanding Apple's footprint beyond the cockpit into the cabin, where more than half of the top 50 airlines have now implemented iOS to enhance the guest experience as well as enable a new use case with mobile point of sale.
We're also seeing traction with other mission-critical airline functions in ground operations and flight maintenance. For example, one of the largest airlines in the world tells us that the adoption of iPad has cut maintenance delays in half. Apple services are also making their way onboard, including growing adoption of Apple Pay for food and beverage purchases and in-flight access to Apple Music.
We're also seeing significant iOS traction with large enterprise platforms, which are the face of complex back-end systems to tens of millions of employees around the world. The end user employee experience is vital to engagement and productivity, and with increasing mobility of today's modern workforce, those experiences are best on native iOS applications. We see great momentum through the growing number of iOS SDKs being delivered by the world's largest enterprise platforms. For instance, SAP's SDK for iOS continues to gain strong traction with their customers, growing by more than 40% in the last 6 months. And this past quarter, Salesforce released its SDK, enabling developers to be native iOS applications directly on top of the Salesforce platform.
And finally, our enterprise channels continue to build momentum. In February, our Apple at Work initiative was launched with AT&T. This extension to our ongoing collaboration with AT&T will make it easy for more customers to choose the best Apple products for their needs in the enterprise and modernize their business. AT&T will enable business services for Apple products to help companies with their IT strategy, including device management, security, productivity and collaboration.
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $225 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We also had $101 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding for a net cash position of almost $113 billion. As a result, we're in a very strong position that allows us to invest confidently in all areas of the business while continuing to return value to our shareholders. Just last year, we announced a commitment to contribute more than $350 billion to the U.S. economy over the next 5 years, including the creation of 20,000 jobs. More recently, we've announced a major expansion in Austin, Texas and in other cities across the country. All these efforts are essential investments to make sure that we're incorporating innovative ideas and top talent wherever they emerge.
As we execute those initiatives, we're also able to return over $27 billion to investors during the March quarter. We began a $12 billion accelerated share repurchase program in February, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 55.1 million shares. We also repurchased 71.7 million Apple shares for $12 billion through open market transactions, and we paid $3.4 billion in dividends and equivalents.
Our priorities for cash have not changed over the years. Most importantly, we always want to maintain the cash we need to run our business, maintain strategic flexibility and invest in our future. We're well on our way towards meeting the investment projections we laid out early last year. We also want to work towards a more optimal capital structure, and as we said before, it is our plan to reach a net cash neutral position over time.
Given our confidence in Apple's future and the value we see in our stock, our Board has authorized an additional $75 billion for share repurchases. And because we know many of our investors value income, we're also raising our quarterly dividend for the seventh time in less than 7 years to $0.77, an increase of about 5% from the previous amount. We paid over $14 billion in dividends and equivalents over the last 4 quarters alone, making us 1 of the largest dividend payers in the world. Going forward, we continue to plan for annual increases in dividends per share.
As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $52.5 billion and $54.5 billion. This guidance range comprehends 300 basis points of negative foreign exchange impact year-over-year. Also, as a reminder, in the June quarter last year, our Services revenue included a favorable $236 million onetime item in connection with the final resolution of various lawsuits.
We expect gross margin to be between 37% and 38%. We expect OpEx to be between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $250 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 16.5%. Also, reflecting the approved increase, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.77 per share of common stock payable on May 16, 2019, to shareholders of record as of May 13, 2019.
With that, I would like to open the call to questions.",1873

Thanks for the question, Shannon. We're seeing -- in the iPhone space, we saw a better year-over-year performance in the last weeks of the quarter as compared to the full quarter or November and December, which was sort of a -- appears to be the trough. I think there's a set of reasons for this. One, we made some price adjustments, essentially backing out the weaker currency effect and then some. The -- there's stimulus programs that the government has executed, including, and this happened in early April, VAT being reduced from 16% to 13%, so they've been aggressive in the stimulus side. Three, our trade-in and financing programs that we implemented in our retail stores have been very well received there, and I'm happy with the results to date there. And then four, the -- there's an improved trade dialogue between the U.S. and China. And from our point of view, this has affected consumer confidence on the ground there in a positive way. And so I think it's a set of all of these things, and we certainly feel a lot better than we did 90 days ago.",191

We're also expecting a relative improvement in our iPhone performance on a year-over-year basis in Q3 versus the first half. As Tim said, March was the strongest month of the quarter on a year-over-year basis, and so this has given the confidence to provide the guidance that you've seen.

In your opening remarks, Tim, you'd mentioned about pricing adjustments that you made in some of the markets, and then Luca talked also about the strength of the trade-in program or maybe it was Tim also. Can you help us understand about what type of lessons or elasticity you've learned about pricing and the trade-in programs of how it impacts like revenues and COGS and margins and things?",98

Jim, the -- in the opening remarks, I was really talking about China specifically. And I mentioned 4 things that I believe are responsible for the better year-over-year performance in the Q2 relative to Q1 and also the final weeks of March being better than the Q2 average. And those 4 are the price reductions but that's 1 of them. But there are 3 others, and 1 of the others is the trade-in and financing programs that we instituted in our retail stores. Clearly, what we've learned here and it's not a surprise really is that the -- many, many people do want to trade in their current phone. It does -- from a customer user point of view, the trade-in looks like a subsidy, and so it is a way to offset the device cost itself. And many people in literally every market that we've tried this in, there is a reasonable number of people that want to take and pay for something on installments instead of all at once. And so it's a little different in each market in terms of what the elasticity is, but you can bet that we're learning quickly on all of those.
The other 2 items that are not insignificant in China that I don't want to lose here is that the stimulus programs, I believe, are having an effect on the consumer. And the 1 that I got much visibility in -- that happened in early April was the VAT reduction from 16% to 13%, so it's a very aggressive move. But there are other stimulus programs as well that likely have an effect to the consumer level. And then finally, and this is not to be underweighted either, I think the improved trade dialogue between the countries affects consumer confidence in a positive way. And so I think it's sort of the sum of all of those things.",318

It's 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, 7, 7 Plus and then fewer 8 and 8 Plus. But there's some of each of those, and so you get customers that are on the 2-year cycle and customers -- some customers on the 1-year cycle and then customers as well on the 3- and 4-year cycles. And so it's really all over the place. In terms of the incentives, we're offering currently in our retail stores a trade-in value that has -- that is more than the sort of the blue book of the device, if you will, for lack of a better description. And so we have topped those up to provide an extra benefit to the user.
The installments are different in each geography. I would say that, at the moment, the geography that is doing the best in installments would be China. And we have a bit of a unique offering there, I think, versus the -- versus what you can get in the regular market, and so that probably further helps there. And so you can bet that we're learning on each of these, finding the parts that the user likes the most.
I think the key is we're trying to build a -- build something into the consumer mindset that it's good for the environment and good for them to trade in their current device on a new device. And we do our best of getting the current device to someone else that can use that or, in some cases, if the product is at an end of life, we are recycling the parts on it to make sure that it can carry on in another form.",299

And what I can tell you right now is that the -- we're taking sort of consumer interest on the Apple Card, and there's been a significant level of interest on that and we're excited. As you know, the -- gaming is the top category on the App Store. And so the Apple Arcade will serve some of that market, and it serves it with a different kind of game, which we think will be great for developers and great for users.
The TV+ product plays in a market where it's -- there's a huge move from the cable bundle to over the top. We think that most users are going to get multiple over-the-top products, and we're going to do our best to convince them that the Apple TV+ product should be one of them. And then we're working very hard to get everyone to give Apple News+ a look because we think it's a very unique product. And I love magazines, and we have really wanted to support the publishers. And so we're working very hard to -- at the -- but at the very beginning of the ramp there. We wouldn't do a service that we didn't think could be meaningful, so that's sort of the way I look at it.

We've opened a developer accelerator there, which we're very happy with some of the things coming out of there. It's a long-term play. It's not something that's going to be on overnight huge business, but I think the growth potential is phenomenal.

Good afternoon, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We're thrilled to report a return to growth and a new June quarter revenue record of $53.8 billion. We saw significant improvement in year-over-year iPhone performance compared to last quarter, very strong performances for both Mac and iPad and absolutely blowout quarter for Wearables, where we had accelerating growth of well over 50% and a new high watermark for services where we set an all-time revenue record of $11.5 billion. When you step back and consider Wearables and Services together, 2 areas where we have strategically invested in the last several years, they now approach the size of a Fortune 50 company. 
Geographically, we're happy with our performance across the board, including a return to growth in Mainland China. We accomplished these results despite strong headwinds from foreign exchange, which impacted our top line growth rate by 300 basis points compared to a year ago. That's equivalent to about $1.5 billion of revenue.
Importantly, in constant currency, our revenue grew in all 5 of our geographic segments. For iPhone, we generated $26 billion in revenue. While this is down 12% from last year's June quarter, it is a significant improvement to the 17% year-over-year decline in Q2. We're encouraged by the results we're seeing from the initiatives that we spoke about in January, including strong customer response to our in-store, trade-in and financing programs. In fact, iPhone in our retail and online stores returned to growth on a year-over-year basis in the month of June. Our active installed base of iPhone reached a new all-time high and was up year-over-year in each of our top 20 markets, underscoring the quality of our products and the satisfaction and loyalty of iPhone customers around the world.
Revenue, excluding iPhone, was up 17% from last year with growth across all categories. Starting with Services. We generated all-time record revenue of $11.5 billion. That's up 13% year-over-year, and if we exclude the $236 million favorable onetime item from the June quarter last year, Services growth was 15% or 18% in constant currency, which is consistent with our Q2 performance. 
Our strong Services performance was broad-based. We set new all-time records for AppleCare, Music, cloud services and our App Store search ad business, and we achieved a new third quarter revenue record for the App Store. What's more, we had double-digit services revenue growth in all 5 of our geographic segments. We surpassed 420 million paid subscriptions to services across our platform, and we remain on track to double our fiscal year '16 services revenue in 2020.
In May, we launched our all-new Apple TV app in over 100 countries, bringing together all the ways to watch TV in a single app across iPhone, iPad, Apple TV and select smart TVs. Monthly viewers in the Apple TV app in the United States are up over 40% year-over-year. We've seen our success being driven here by several factors: First, the fact that we have been able to integrate content from over 150 leading content providers all in one place; second, the same ease of use and unmatched user interface that sets Apple apart in other categories sets us apart in TV as well; and third, we're benefiting from a broader secular move to over-the-top services.
We're engaging with this third trend in 5 ways: Our Apple TV hardware; Apple TV Channels, where customers can choose to pay only for the channels they want; our massive library of over 100,000 iTunes movies and TV shows; the App Store, where users can find their favorite streaming services; and later this year, our original programming service, Apple TV+. 
Apple Pay is now completing nearly 1 billion transactions per month, more than twice the volume of a year ago. Apple Pay launched in 17 countries in the June quarter, completing our coverage in the European Union and bringing us to a total of 47 markets currently. Based on June quarter performance, Apple Pay is now adding more new users than PayPal and monthly transaction volume is growing 4x as fast.
In the United States, in addition to a successful integration into Portland's transit system in May, we're beginning the rollout of New York City transit and will launch in Chicago later this year. In China, Apple Pay launched the payment card for DiDi, the world's largest ride-hailing provider. As I've said before, transit integration is a major driver of a broader digital wallet adoption, and we're going to keep up this push to help users leave their wallet at home in more and more instances. On a related note, thousands of Apple employees are using Apple Card every day in our beta test, and we plan to begin the rollout of Apple Card in August.
As I mentioned at the outset, it was another sensational quarter for Wearables with growth accelerating to well over 50%. We had great results for Apple Watch, which set a new June quarter revenue record and is reaching millions of new users. Over 75% of customers buying Apple Watch in the June quarter were buying their first Apple Watch. We continue to see phenomenal demand for AirPods. And when you tally up the last 4 quarters, our Wearables business is now bigger than 60% of the companies in the Fortune 500.
We had great performance from iPad with revenue of over $5 billion and growth driven by iPad Pro and by strong customer response to the new iPad mini and iPad Air. This was our third consecutive quarter of growth and with revenue up 15% year-to-date, we feel great about where we're headed with iPad. With our current lineup of iPad, iPad mini, iPad Air and iPad Pro, we've got the perfect device for everyone from young learners to professionals.
We were also very happy with double-digit revenue growth from Mac, fueled by a strong performance of Macbook Air and MacBook Pro. Looking forward, there's an enormous amount to be excited about for Mac. On the heels of our Mac mini and iMac updates earlier in the fiscal year, we brought significant updates to the bulk of our notebook lineup in the last couple of months. We now have a $999 MacBook Air that is killer for college students, and for our Pro users who push the limits of what a Mac can do, we were thrilled to unveil the most powerful Mac ever, the new Mac Pro and the all-new Pro Display XDR, which will be available this fall.
They're designed for maximum performance, expansion and configurability and at breakthrough pricing, and they're the most powerful tools Apple has ever put in the hands of Pro customers. What's more, the Mac ecosystem as a whole is about to get a big boost. At our recent Worldwide Developers Conference, we announced a game-changing tool to help developers easily adapt their iOS and iPadOS apps for the Mac. I'll have a bit more to say on that in a moment.
I'd like to provide some color on our performance in Greater China, where we saw significant improvement compared to the first half of fiscal 2019 and returned to growth in constant currency. We experienced noticeably better year-over-year comparisons for our iPhone business there than we saw in the last 2 quarters, and we had sequential improvement in the performance of every category. The combined effects of government stimulus, consumer response to trade-in programs, financing offers and other sales initiatives and growing engagement with the broader Apple ecosystem had a positive effect. We were especially pleased with the double-digit increase in Services driven by strong growth from the App Store in China.
Turning to the future. Last week, we announced an agreement with Intel to acquire the majority of its smartphone modem business. This is our second largest acquisition by dollars and our largest ever in terms of staff. We're looking forward to welcoming all of them to Apple. We see this as a great opportunity to work with some of the leading talents in this field, to grow our portfolio of wireless technology patents to over 17,000, to expedite our development of our future products and to further our long-term strategy of owning and controlling the primary technologies behind the products that we make.
We also had our best WWDC ever last month, packed with announcements of great new features coming this fall across our 4 software platforms, making them more powerful, more personal and more private. For iPhone users, iOS 13 will take on a dramatic new look with dark mode, on delivering major updates to the apps you use every day, including Photos, Camera and Maps, iOS 13 offers great new ways to help you manage your privacy and security, including Sign-on with Apple, which uses Face ID or Touch ID to quickly sign into apps and websites without sharing your personal information. And improvements across the entire system will make iPhone even faster and more delightful to use than ever before.
For the first time, iPad is getting its own version of iOS called iPadOS, a strategic step forward that takes the iPad experience to a whole new level. The redesigned home screen, powerful new multitasking tools and deeper integration with Apple Pencil take productivity and creativity further, including using your iPad as an extended and interactive second monitor for your Mac. 
For Apple TV, tvOS 13 will make the big-screen experience even more personal. With a redesigned home screen and multi-user support, everyone in the family can get a more engaging and tailored experience with their favorite TV shows, movies, sports and news, along with Apple Music, photos and videos in iCloud and an App Store with thousands of great games and apps.
watchOS 6 is a major step forward in helping Apple Watch users stay healthy, active and connected. Apple Watch now has a dedicated App Store that users can access directly from the device and new watch faces, Siri enhancements, and music and audio features make Apple Watch more useful than ever.
And of course, we continue to innovate on Apple Watch's promise to be an intelligent guardian for your health. watchOS 6 includes powerful new features like notifications that warn about high decibel noise to protect your hearing and cycle tracking to aid in women's health care decisions. In the June quarter, we expanded the availability of the ECG app and regular rhythm notifications to 5 additional European countries and added Canada and Singapore just last week, making them available in 31 countries and regions around the world with more to come later this year. We're very proud of the muscle we've built in bringing regulated products like these to market. This is an important competency that creates exciting opportunities for us moving forward.
As I noted earlier, we believe macOS Catalina will be a breakthrough in the Mac ecosystem. A new tool included in macOS Catalina called Mac Catalyst gives developers a major head start in bringing their iOS apps to the Mac. Thousands of developers are already using it to bring their apps to the Mac ecosystem, and we expect to see a wave of popular apps arriving for the Mac as early as this fall.
Again, it's worth taking a step back and digesting the bigger picture here. These updates are the latest steps in a broader strategic effort to make the user experience across iOS, macOS, iPadOS, watchOS and tvOS more effortless and more intuitive. Apple is alone in offering this kind of value and ecosystem to its customers, and these devices and their platforms are unmatched in their ease of use, their seamlessness and their privacy and security. And while providing these things, we've created a dynamic environment where our developers benefit greatly from creating for and distributing on these platforms. And our customers, of course, benefit greatly from access to all of this creativity and innovation.
We also unveiled other exciting technologies to make it easier and faster for developers to create powerful new apps. Swift UI provides an intuitive new framework for building sophisticated user interfaces across our software platforms using simple, easy-to-use code. Core ML 3 supports the acceleration of more types of advanced real-time machine learning models and Create ML lets developers build machine learning models without writing code. 
We have the world's largest augmented reality-enabled platform and thousands of ARKit-enabled applications in the App Store. Building on this strategy and our momentum in this area, we introduced 3 new AR-based technologies: ARKit 3 uses on-device, real-time machine learning to recognize the human form and integrates people seamlessly into AR experiences; Reality Kit is a new developer framework built from the ground up to provide all the tools and technologies required to make AR objects virtually lifelike; and Reality Composer brings AR content creation to tens of millions of developers who had no 3D experience. Our developers are already running with these new technologies, and we think our customers are going to love some of the apps that these creators have in store in the months ahead.
On so many fronts, there's an enormous amount to look forward to over the next few months, including the launch of new services like Apple Arcade, Apple TV+ and Apple Card. And without giving too much away, we have several new products that we can't wait to share with you. Until then, thanks for joining us today, and for more details on the June quarter results, I'll turn the call over to Luca.",2255

Good afternoon, everyone. We're happy to report a June quarter revenue record of $53.8 billion, up 1% year-over-year. We returned to growth in spite of a difficult foreign exchange environment around the world, which impacted our year-over-year growth rate by 300 basis points. We set June quarter revenue records in the Americas, in Japan and the rest of Asia Pacific, and as Tim mentioned earlier, all our geographic segments grew in constant currency.
Overall products revenue was $42.4 billion, down 2% year-over-year, which is significantly better than the 8% decline in products revenue that we experienced during the first half of the fiscal year. Product categories outside of iPhone grew 20% with strong results in Wearables, Mac and iPad. Services revenue grew 13% to a new all-time record of $11.5 billion. Excluding the onetime item we highlighted a year ago in connection with the final resolution of various lawsuits, Services revenue growth was 15% and 18% in constant currency terms.
On a geographic basis, we saw marked improvement in our year-over-year comparisons from emerging markets relative to the first half of this fiscal year, particularly in the BRIC countries where year-over-year performance went from a 25% revenue decline in the first half to 3% growth in the June quarter. We set June quarter revenue records in several major developed markets, including the U.S., Canada, Germany, France, Japan, Australia and Korea. In emerging markets, we returned to growth in Mainland China, grew strong double digits in India and in Brazil, and we set new Q3 records in Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines.
Company gross margin was 37.6%, flat sequentially and in line with our guidance. Products gross margin was 30.4%, down about 80 basis points sequentially due to seasonal loss of leverage and product mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin was 64.1%, up 30 basis points sequentially primarily due to a favorable mix. Net income was $10 billion, diluted earnings per share were $2.18 and operating cash flow was $11.6 billion.
Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $26 billion, down 12% compared to a year ago. This was significantly better year-over-year performance than last quarter's 17% decline with sequential improvement in year-over-year comparisons in 15 of our top 20 markets. Our active installed base of iPhone continued to grow to a new all-time high in each of our geographic segments. And in the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone XR, iPhone XS and XS Max combined. Among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the September quarter, 83% plan to purchase iPhones.
Turning to Services. We reached an all-time revenue record in spite of foreign exchange headwinds with double-digit growth from the App Store, Apple Music, cloud services and AppleCare and triple-digit growth from Apple Pay and our App Store search ad business. All geographic segments had double-digit growth in Services revenue and set new June quarter records with all-time records in the Americas and rest of Asia Pacific. In total, Services accounted for 21% of Apple revenue and 36% of gross margin dollars.
Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow. The number of transacting accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high in the June quarter, and the number of paid accounts grew strong double digits compared to last year. We now have over 420 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platforms, and we are well on our way to our goal of surpassing the 500 million mark during 2020.
On the App Store, our growth accelerated sequentially. Our subscription business continues to grow strongly and is extremely diversified across many categories such as entertainment, lifestyle, photo and video and music. Third-party subscription revenue grew by over 40%, and across all third-party subscription apps, the largest accounted for only 0.25% of total Services revenue.
Among our many Services records, it was our best quarter ever for AppleCare. We are seeing an increase in service contract attach rates and our expanding distribution of AppleCare through our partners. We also recently expanded our authorized service provider network, and nearly 1,000 Best Buy stores across the U.S. are now offering expert service and repairs for Apple's products. This expansion provides customers with an even more convenient access to repairs using parts certified for safety, quality and reliability. In addition to Apple retail stores, there are over 1,800 third-party Apple Authorized Service Providers in the U.S., which is 3x as many locations as 3 years ago.
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. Revenue was $5.8 billion, up 11% compared to last year. Mac revenue grew in 4 of our 5 geographic segments and set June quarter records in the U.S., Europe and Japan as our overall market performance significantly outpaced the global PC industry. Nearly half of the customers purchasing Macs during the quarter were new to Mac, with revenue growing in both developed and emerging markets and the active installed base of Macs again reached a new all-time high.
We also had great results for iPad with $5 billion in revenue, up 8%. iPad revenue grew in all 5 of our geographic segments with a Q3 revenue record in Mainland China and double-digit growth in emerging markets. In total, over half of the customers purchasing iPads during the June quarter were new to iPad, and the iPad active installed base also reached a new all-time high. The most recent surveys from 451 Research measured a 94% customer satisfaction rating for iPad from consumers and among business customers who plan to purchase tablets in the September quarter, 75% plan to purchase iPads.
Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue accelerated across all our geographic segments, growing 48% to over $5.5 billion and setting a June quarter record. This growth was fueled primarily by the strong performance of our Wearables business, which was up well over 50% and has become the size of a Fortune 200 company over the last 12 months. In addition, we generated double-digit revenue growth from AppleTV and accessories during the quarter.
Our retail and online stores produced their best June quarter revenue ever with double-digit revenue growth across Apple Watch, iPad, Mac and accessories. Our trade-in program is showing great momentum with more than 5x the number of iPhones traded in compared to a year ago. We opened stunning new stores in the Carnegie Library in Washington, D.C. and the busy Xinyi District in Taipei as well as a beautiful new location in the Dallas Galleria. We ended the quarter with 506 physical stores in 22 countries alongside our online store presence in 35 countries.
In the enterprise market, we're gaining traction with our strategy of transforming major industries by expanding our leading positions in key functional areas to grow our reach and modernize customer and employee experiences. 
In the financial services industry, 90 of the largest 100 banks by asset size are deploying Apple products to improve efficiency and effectiveness across their organizations. iPhone and iPad are overwhelmingly the preferred mobile devices for bankers on the go. For example, 60% of the biggest banks are supporting iPads for wealth managers. In retail banking, 2/3 of top banks are deploying iPad for branch transformation and modernizing legacy interfaces with a unified iPad experience.
One of the world's largest banks created an iPad suite that reduced customer on-boarding time from more than an hour to just 12 minutes. Bank branch employees are also using Apple Watch for communication and notifications and Apple TV for customer presentations from iPads using AirPlay.
Financial institutions also tell us that they receive positive feedback from leveraging Apple solutions for direct customer engagement. American Express, Crédit Suisse, Discover and TD Ameritrade have launched Apple Business Chat as a dynamic way to support and interact with customers. The intuitive interface of messages on iOS enables rich communication between customers and contact center staff. TD Ameritrade has also become the first brokerage in the world to enable immediate funding of accounts using Apple Pay, eliminating the 2 to 3 business days it used to take to fund accounts by wire transfer.
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with almost $211 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We retired $3 billion of term debt and reduced commercial paper by $2 billion during the quarter, leaving us with total debt of $108 billion. As a result, net cash was $102 billion at the end of the quarter, and we continue on our path to reaching a net cash neutral position over time. We returned over $21 billion to shareholders during the quarter, including $17 billion through open market repurchases of almost 88 million Apple shares and $3.6 billion in dividends and equivalents.
As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $61 billion and $64 billion. This guidance includes almost $1 billion of year-over-year negative impact from foreign exchange. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $200 million, and we expect our tax rate to be about 16.5%.
Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.77 per share of common stock payable on August 15, 2019, to shareholders of record as of August 12, 2019.
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.",1607

First off, could you just talk about, when I think about the September quarter guide, it's implied, I think, up 16% or so sequentially. Historically, at least in that guide has been in the 10%, low double-digit kind of range. Just maybe help us understand what gives you the confidence for a better-than-seasonal guide in September either from a geo or product basis would be helpful.",71

Of course, this is our best estimate of where we think we will land. Clearly, we expect to have continued strong growth from the non-iPhone categories. We have great momentum in Wearables. We mentioned that we were up almost 50% in the June quarter or actually over 50% in the June quarter. Our Services business, we set an all-time record in June. And so these 2 categories have become really important and really large for us. And so as we continue to grow quickly, that is going to help us as we go through the year. Keep in mind that the guidance includes an estimated almost $1 billion of foreign exchange headwind for the quarter.",118

That's really helpful. And I guess if I just follow up on China, impressed to see the continued recovery you guys are seeing there despite all the headlines that are out there.

I apologize for my voice. I'm suffering from an allergy. But what happened last quarter in China was, it's a confluence of things. The government stimulus, this came in terms of a VAT reduction, a very bold one. We took some pricing action. We instituted our trade-in and financing programs in our retail stores and worked with certain channel partners on that as well. And we're seeing a growing engagement with the broader Apple ecosystem during the quarter.
And so when you look at it, each of our categories, iPhone, iPad, Mac, Wearables, Services, everything improved sequentially. So we couldn't be happier with the results or the progress, I should say. I would point out, as I think I had mentioned in my comments, that we actually grew in constant currency for Greater China, and we grew in Mainland China on a reported basis. So there's several things going on there that are quite positive.",159

I know Luca, you gave us some color in terms of the growth rates in that. But I'm just curious as -- and I know you won't talk about future products, but as you think about the opportunities, you think about what you've got now and in the future and then some of the -- what's been going on with China in that, is there something that could reaccelerate or -- again, the 18% on a constant currency basis is obviously quite strong. But how are you thinking about it?",108
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2019",2019-07-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3628.0,1829669.0,71548430.0,Answer,Luca Maestri,,Executives,12,"Yes. I think it's important to start with that 18% in constant currencies, Shannon. Our reported results are on a normalized basis, removing the onetime item from last year, was 15%. Clearly, FX plays a role around the world, 300 basis points of FX impact during the June quarter. In spite of that, it was an all-time record revenue. Our installed base continues to grow. It's growing in every geography and it's growing across all our major product categories, and that is very, very important for the Services -- for the Services business. 
I would say -- I'll give you a bit more color around 2 offsetting factors around this performance during the June quarter. On one side, the App Store, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that growth accelerated sequentially. We had double-digit growth on the App Store in every geography. In China, we saw significant acceleration. As you know, we tend to monetize in China on the App Store through game titles, and the government has approved a few key game titles during the quarter that has helped our performance there. 
On the other side, AppleCare. I mentioned AppleCare was an all-time record in June, so a really strong performance. But our growth has decelerated in AppleCare due to factors that we fully expected because we are comping this expansion of our coverage for AppleCare that we've had, we've had significant success during the last 18 to 24 months in really broadening our coverage of AppleCare around the world with some key partners, carriers and resellers. And obviously, as we go through the year, those comps become a bit more difficult. 
Having said all that, you know that we've given ourselves a couple of targets, and we feel very confident about reaching those targets. The first one is that we wanted to double the size of the Services business from our fiscal '16 to 2020. We are on our way there. Paid subscriptions is another target. It's important to us. It's an important way for us to monetize our ecosystem. We set a target of surpassing 0.5 billion paid subscriptions on the ecosystem during 2020. We're already at 420 million now. So we feel confident there. 
And of course, as you mentioned, we're very excited about the fact that we're going to be launching new services soon. As Tim said, we're starting the rollout of Apple Card in August. And there's 2 more very important services that we're going to be adding to our portfolio during the fall. One is Apple Arcade, which is our gaming subscription service, and of course, Apple TV+, which is our video streaming service. So obviously, these services will help us carry on with the momentum that we have in Services.",458

And this is probably for you too as well, Luca. Can you talk about gross margin? The guidance was pretty solid. Obviously, there are various things that are at play here.

So of course, Shannon, as you've seen, our guidance for margin is 50 basis points higher than the guidance that we had given for June. I would say on the positive, we expect to benefit from leverage, as you've seen from our revenue guidance, and from cost savings because, as you know, the commodity environment is fairly favorable right now. On the negative side, the headwind on gross margins on a year-over-year basis from foreign exchange is about 100 basis points. And so we need to keep that in mind, but we feel pretty good about the guidance we provided.",101

We've announced Apple News+, and this is the service that is available for consumers right now. We've announced our channel service, which has also become available a few weeks ago. The other 3 services, the Card is launching in August, the gaming service and the video service are starting in the fall. Keep in mind for all these services, there's a trial period upfront. There's going to be different trial periods, we'll see what they look like. So the road to monetization takes some time.

In retail, it was quite successful. We got going in a larger way during that quarter. We were pretty much just ramping in the previous quarter. And trade-in, as a percentage of their total sales, is significant and financing is a key element of it. Those 2 things in the aggregate led retail -- the combination of retail and online, we -- to short form that as retail, are Apple Store, led to growth in June. And so we feel very, very good about our trajectory. We are obviously taking those programs and advocating those more widely. And that is at different levels of implementation throughout different geographies because we're working with our carrier partners on those and retail partners.",123

That's very helpful, Tim. And then a follow-up for you, a much longer-term question. I understand we're in the very early innings of the Services growth story. Is there a way to think about it down the road that 3 or 5 years down the road, would the Services growth be focused or will it still be tethered to the hardware of the iPhone? Or do you think at some point down the road, Services would be independent by itself and not really tied to your hardware installed base?",93
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2019",2019-07-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3628.0,1829669.0,71548442.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,24,"Well, there are elements today that are not necessarily tethered to iPhone, right? We have other products where people are both purchasing things, they're watching Apple TV. We offer Apple Music on Android, and so there's a series of things that are outside of that. And so we'll see what we do in the future. I don't want to really get into that. 
But more broadly, to answer your question about growth as we go forward, the way I see it is we have the strongest hardware portfolio ever. We've got new products on the way. The pipeline is full of great new stuff, both on the product and services side. We're very fortunate and work very hard to have loyal customers and to continue attracting an impressive number of switchers. The installed base is growing, hit a new record. That's obviously good. And it hit a new record across all geographies and across all categories. And so this is a really good thing.
And we've got the Wearables area that is doing extremely well. We stuck with that when others perhaps didn't and really put a lot of energy into this and a lot of R&D and are in a very good position today to keep playing out the what's next there.
At the same time, on the market side, we have emerging markets where we have low penetration. And in -- during the quarter, tactically, emerging markets had a bit of a rebound. In fact, on a constant currency basis, we actually grew slightly in emerging markets. We still declined on a reported basis. India bounced back. During the quarter, we returned to growth there. We're very happy with that. We grew in Brazil as well. 
We're also continuing to focus on the enterprise market. Luca mentioned some of this in his comments, and we think that continues to be a big opportunity for us. And then we've got lots of what I would call core technology kinds of things like augmented reality, where we're placing big bets, and I think we have a big future in addition to the health kinds of things that may fall out of the Watch. And so hopefully that kind of gives you a view over the total. And so we're focusing on products and services and there will be some services that aren't hooked and some that are hooked not on current period sales are mostly -- very much services are rarely connected on that today or at least not a high percentage by any means. They're more correlated to the installed base, the active installed base and also the level of transacting customers that are there and the amount per customer, which relates also to the offering that we have.",460

I know there's been a lot of speculation around the topic of different moves and so forth. I wouldn't put a lot of stock into those, if I were you. The way that I view this is the vast majority of our products are kind of made everywhere. There's a significant level of content from the United States and a lot from Japan to Korea to China and the European Union also contributes a fair amount. And so that's the nature of a global supply chain. I think -- largely, I think that will carry the day in the future as well. In terms of the exclusions, we've been making the Mac Pro in the U.S. We want to continue to doing that. And so we're working and investing currently in capacity to do so because we want to continue to be here. And so that's what's behind the exclusions.

As you know, we're not getting into this topic very much, but I think I can give you some color here. You know that in general, we decreased our inventory during the March quarter and the June quarter. That has been traditionally what we've done.

But the first question, Tim. Regarding the installed base comment you've made, which is quite encouraging, but yet when you look at the iPhone revenue year-over-year, the past several quarters has been down. Can you help us bridge the gap of how is the installed base growing? 
Is it mostly because like secondary users are the new ones coming into the system as people are holding their phones longer? And what does that user typically bring in with them or something rather unique relative to what we historically know? And then for Luca, you've been investing a lot, a lot, lot, lot and a lot of these services are now coming to pass, whether it be AppleCare, Apple cloud, all these Wearables, and soon Apple Pay and Arcade. Are we at a point where now, a lot of harvesting is going to happen? Or do you kind of continue these relatively same investments that you've been doing for the future strategy?",197

I'll start with your installed base question. Installed base is a function of upgrades and the time between those. It's a function of the number of switchers coming into the iOS, macOS and so forth tents. It's a function of the robustness of the secondary market, which we think overwhelmingly hits incremental customer. And it's a function still in the emerging markets and somewhat developed markets, to a lesser degree, of people new that -- they're buying their first smartphone. There are still quite a few people in the world in that category.
And so the reason that the installed base doesn't correlate to the 90-day clock is that what's happening underneath the numbers is switchers are still a very key piece of what's going on. The secondary market is very key, and we're doing programs, et cetera, to try to increase that because we think we'd wind up hitting a customer that we don't hit in another way. And the upgrades, where people are holding on to their device a bit longer than they were, they're staying in the ecosystem. And then you have the people in the new category as well. And so that's sort of the equation. I don't want to go into the specific numbers, but I think you can see readily, mathematically, how the installed base is growing in an environment where the iPhone revenue is declining within a 90-day kind of window.",242

We want to improve the user experience and differentiate our products and services in the marketplace. So we will continue to do that. 
There are some types of investments, of course, that are very strategic for us and they will have long-term implications. You've seen the announcement that we made around the Intel acquisition. Very important strategically for us. It requires upfront investment, of course. As you've seen from this quarter and also from the past, we will continue to run our SG&A portion of OpEx tightly. We will -- of course, we'll continue to invest in marketing and advertising. We talked about a lot of new services that we are launching during the fall and Apple Card the next month. Obviously, they will require the appropriate level of marketing and advertising as we launch them to the general public.
When you look in total at where we are in terms of our expense-to-revenue ratio for operating expenses, you know quite well that we are extremely competitive relative to other tech companies. So we want to continue to be competitive and at the same time, we will not underinvest in the business.",225

I couldn't be happier with the developer tools around ARKit and AR in general that I went through earlier. Lots of interest there. Lots of interest from the watch App Store to the Catalyst that will be released with macOS Catalina, which allows developers quickly to port a iOS app to the Mac. We think this is huge and so great for the user experience. And so you look at all of these and all of the things that I talked about earlier and I couldn't be happier with the reception that we're getting and the work that is going on behind the scenes right now to ready -- for the developers readying their apps for the fall.",131

This was Apple's highest revenue in a September quarter ever, and I want to take you through some of the highlights before we get into greater detail on the conclusion of a remarkable fiscal 2019 for Apple. We achieved revenue of $64 billion in the quarter, at the high end of our expectations even in spite of a predicted foreign exchange drag of almost $1 billion. Geographically, we set new Q4 revenue records in the Americas and rest of Asia Pacific and saw further improvement in our revenue trends in Greater China.
In iPhone, where customers have only begun to get their hands on the strongly popular and unmatched iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro models, our year-over-year performance continued to improve. More on that in a moment. Outside of iPhone, our September quarter revenue was up 17%. We reached a new all-time high for Services with growth accelerating to 18%. We generated well over 50% revenue growth from Wearables, and I'm thrilled to say that we set Q4 records for Wearables in each and every market we track.
We've got a lot to cover so let's dive right into the details. iPhone revenue in the September quarter was $33 billion. This 9% decline over last year is a significant improvement over the 15% decline we saw across the first 3 quarters. The significant upswing in demand in the final part of the quarter is mirrored in the overwhelmingly positive reviews, customer feedback and in-store response we've seen for this new generation of devices, not to mention a wave of the best photos you've seen from a smartphone. 
iPhone 11 features the Apple-designed A13 Bionic, the fastest, most powerful chip ever in a smartphone plus an all-new dual camera system and even longer all-day battery life, all wrapped in 6 great new colors. Since its launch, the iPhone 11 has quickly become our best-selling iPhone.
iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max deliver even more advanced performance for users who want the very best out of their smartphone. The new Super Retina XDR display is the brightest ever in an iPhone, and the new triple camera system provides a pro level photography experience with an ultra-wide, wide and telephoto camera. All 3 of our new iPhones feature night mode, delivering huge improvements to photo capture in low-light environments, either indoors or outdoors. They also produce the highest-quality video in a smartphone, supporting 4K video with extended dynamic range for more highlight detail and cinematic video stabilization.
iOS 13 is driving user experience forward across the iPhone family with a bold new look in dark mode, major updates to the apps our customers use every day such as Photos and Maps, new ways to help protect their privacy with Sign in with Apple and performance improvements across the entire system. 
For Services, revenue was $12.5 billion. That's up 18% over last year, and it beats the previous record set in a June quarter by more than $1 billion. This isn't a local phenomenon. We saw double-digit Services revenue growth and all-time records in all 5 of our geographic segments. And it wasn't a narrow success either. We established new all-time highs for multiple services categories, including the App Store, AppleCare, Music, cloud services and our App Store search ad business. We are well on our way to accomplishing our goal of doubling our fiscal year '16 Services revenue during 2020.
I want to touch on a number of Services in brief. We had all-time revenue -- record revenues from payment services. For Apple Pay, revenue and transactions more than doubled year-over-year with over 3 billion transactions in the September quarter, exceeding PayPal's number of transactions and growing 4x as fast. Apple Pay is now live in 49 markets around the world with over 6,000 issuers on the platform. We believe that Apple Pay offers the best possible mobile payment experience and the safest, most secure solution on the market. We're glad that thousands of banks around the world participate.
Apple Card launched in the U.S. in August, and we've been thrilled by the positive reception we've seen. Users can apply for Apple Card through the Wallet app on iPhone in minutes and start using it right away in stores, in apps and on websites. They've told us they love Apple Card's simplicity, privacy, security and transparency, which has helped them make healthier financial choices. Apple Card has absolutely no fees and major apps and retailers like Uber, Uber Eats, Walgreens, Duane Reade and T-Mobile have already joined to offer 3% daily cash back on Apple Card transactions.
And I'm very pleased to announce today that later this year, we're adding another great feature to Apple Card. Customers will be able to purchase their new iPhone and pay for it over 24 months with 0% interest. And they will continue to enjoy all the benefits of Apple Card, including 3% cash back on the total cost of their new iPhone with absolutely no fees and the ability to simply manage their payments right in the Apple Wallet app on iPhone. We think these features appealed broadly to all iPhone customers, and we believe this has been the most successful launch of a credit card in the United States ever.
Last month, we launched Apple Arcade, our groundbreaking game subscription service, offering an all-new way for the whole family to enjoy games online or offline. Apple Arcade's subscribers get unlimited access to a curated selection of games from many of the most innovative developers of the world with almost 100 new titles playable across iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, Mac and Apple TV today and more are being added all the time. Customer feedback to date has been overwhelmingly positive, and we're very excited for the future of this service.
We're also thrilled to be working with Oprah Winfrey to bring Oprah's Book Club to Apple Books, connecting a community of readers worldwide to important stories by today's most thought-provoking authors. Together, we envision a vibrant global book club that has the power to bring the world together through reading. We've also expanded the reach of Apple News+ beyond the United States and Canada to readers in Australia and the United Kingdom, bringing together popular publications such as The Times of London, The Australian and Hello Magazine in addition to major publications like The Wall Street Journal, the L.A. Times, The New Yorker, People, GQ and much more.
And rounding out our newest services, just 2 days from now, we're launching the hotly anticipated Apple TV+ in over 100 countries and regions. It's the first all-original video subscription service with shows from the best, most ambitious and most creative minds in the industry. One of the great perks of this job is that I've gotten to binge-watch almost all of them, and while I won't spoil anything, there's so much to look forward to here for lovers of great storytelling.
We premiered shows like See and The Morning Show in L.A. and New York over the past couple of weeks, and the stage is set for a truly exciting debut. And we're pleased that customers who have purchased qualifying Apple devices starting September 10 can opt in to 12 free months of Apple TV+.
Turning to Wearables. We had amazing results, thanks to the phenomenal popularity of Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats products. As I said at the outset, we set Q4 revenue records for Wearables in every single market that we track around the world. In September, we launched Apple Watch Series 5 with the always-on Retina display that means you never have to pause a workout or task to raise or tap the display. New location features help users better navigate their day, while international emergency calling allows them to call emergency services directly from Apple Watch in over 150 countries even without an iPhone nearby. And combined with the power of watchOS 6, users are empowered to take charge of their health and fitness with new features like cycle tracking, the noise app and activity trends.
The ECG app, now available in 32 markets, including India, has become a widely celebrated illustration of Apple's commitment to your health, giving users the ability to document and monitor the functioning of their heart and provide critical data to their doctors. We're deepening Apple's commitment to medical research. We announced the new Research app paired with 3 unprecedented medical studies spanning hearing, heart and movement and women's health. We're collaborating with leading health institutions to reach more participants than has ever been possible, enabling them to contribute to potential medical discoveries and help create the next generation of innovative health products. Leveraging the devices customers use every day and world-class security and privacy, we hope to democratize medical research and bring everyone to the table to make the next big breakthroughs possible.
Turning to iPad. We generated 17% growth, driven by iPad Pro and the ongoing momentum of our wider lineup. In September, we introduced the seventh generation iPad, bringing more screen area and support for the full-sized Smart Keyboard to our most popular and most affordable iPad. For the first time, we also released iPadOS, built on the same foundation as iOS but with powerful apps designed for iPad's large multi-touch display, letting users multitask with intuitive gestures and drag-and-drop a file with a fingertip.
For Mac, we generated $7 billion in revenue. We had a tough comparison to last year's fourth quarter when we updated both models of MacBook Pro. But for fiscal 2019 overall, we generated the highest annual revenue ever from our Mac business. In July, we updated our Mac portables with great pricing for students, and MacBook Air, in particular, has been a hit in the back-to-school season.
Earlier this month, we released macOS Catalina with all-new entertainment apps, the innovative Sidecar feature that uses iPad to expand the Mac workspace and new accessibility tools that enable users to control their Mac entirely with their voice. Catalina also brings the Apple Arcade experience to the Mac, and we have already seen some amazing third-party developers bring their iPad apps to the Mac App Store with Mac Catalyst, including Twitter, Post-it and more.
And for our Pro customers who push the limits of what Mac can do, we're very excited about the upcoming launch of our newly redesigned Mac Pro this fall, which we are proud to be manufacturing in Austin, Texas.
Pulling back the lens from a single quarter, we are incredibly proud of our accomplishments over the course of a remarkable fiscal 2019, a year where we crossed $100 billion in revenue in the United States for the first time. We introduced new services from Apple Card to Apple TV+ and generated over $46 billion in total Services revenue, setting new yearly Services records in all 5 of our geographic segments and driving our Services business to the size of a Fortune 70 company.
We delivered incredible new hardware in all our device categories. Our Wearables business showed explosive growth and generated more annual revenue than 2/3 of the companies in the Fortune 500. And we set a yearly revenue record for Mac. All told, outside of iPhone, our revenue grew by $17 billion to almost $118 billion.
Our overall success was achieved widely across our markets with annual revenue records in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, the U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Poland, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. And as we head into the holiday season, we have an enormous amount to look forward to. We believe that we lead in innovation because we lead with our values. 
At a time of urgency and action on climate change, we continue to drive breakthroughs in clean power, sustainable materials and device recycling. By running 100% of our global operations on renewable energy and challenging our entire network of suppliers to do the same, we're driving a virtuous cycle of demand for clean sources of power. And we see the award Apple recently received from the United Nations Global Climate Action Program as a mandate to deepen this vital work.
We continue to invent and improve on cutting-edge renewable materials, including the 100% recycled aluminum alloy found in many of our products. And we've added rare earth elements to our list of recycled materials with the introduction of iPhone 11. We're disassembling, recycling or refurbishing millions of devices every year with the help of Daisy, our recycling robot, and we're pushing the entire global supply chain toward recycled or renewable materials.
We're driving access to critical coding skills development to educators and students through programs such as our teaching coding academies and our free Everyone Can Code curriculum. We continue to put user privacy at the center of everything that we do. And we know that Apple is strongest when our commitment to diversity and inclusion brings all voices to the table.
I'd like to thank our customers, our developers, our business partners and our employees for making fiscal 2019 such a success, and I look forward to another great year in 2020. Now for more details on our September quarter results, I'll turn the call over to Luca.",2231

Revenue for the quarter was $64 billion, up 2% from a year ago to a new September quarter record. As we have predicted, foreign exchange negatively impacted our revenue by close to $1 billion, and in constant currency, our growth was 3%. Products revenue was $51.5 billion, down 1% from last year, mainly due to iPhone but largely offset by very strong performance from Wearables and iPad. Services revenue grew 18% to $12.5 billion, up over $1.9 billion year-over-year and almost $1.1 billion sequentially to a new all-time record with broad-based growth around the world and across our portfolio. 
On a geographic basis, we set new fourth quarter revenue records in our Americas and rest of Asia Pacific segments. We also saw continuous improvement in Greater China where year-over-year revenue comparisons became more favorable each quarter of fiscal 2019 from a 27% decline in the first quarter to a 2% decline in the fourth quarter. At a country level, we established new Q4 records in many major developed and emerging markets, including the U.S., Canada, Germany, France, Korea, Singapore, Brazil, India, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam.
Company gross margin was 38%, up 40 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage from higher revenue. Products gross margin was 31.6%, up 120 basis points sequentially due to leverage and favorable mix. Services gross margin was 64.1%, even with the June quarter.
Net income was $13.7 billion. Diluted EPS was a Q4 record at $3.03 and up 4% year-over-year. And operating cash flow of $19.9 billion was also a Q4 record, up almost $400 million from the previous record we set last year.
Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $33.4 billion, a year-over-year decline of 9%. This was a meaningful improvement to the 12% decline in the third quarter and the 16% decline in the first half of the fiscal year. And we saw great customer response to the launch of iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max at the end of the quarter. Our active installed base of iPhone continued to grow to a new all-time high in each of our geographic segments. And in the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone XR, XS and XS Max combined. Among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 83% plan to purchase iPhones. 
Turning to Services. We had a very strong quarter with all-time record performance and growth accelerating from the June quarter. All 5 geographic segments set new all-time Services revenue records and all grew double digits. We also established new all-time records for the App Store, Apple Care, Music, cloud services, payment services and our App Store search ad business. In total, Services accounted for 20% of our revenue mix and 33% of our gross margin mix.
Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow, and the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high with double-digit growth in paid accounts in all our geographic segments. We now have over 450 million paid subscriptions across the Services on our platform compared to over 330 million just a year ago. And we are well on our way to our goal of surpassing the 500 million mark during 2020.
App Store revenue grew strong double digits, thanks to robust customer demand for both in-app purchases and subscriptions. Our third-party subscription business grew across multiple categories and increased almost 40% year-over-year. There are now more than 35,000 subscription apps on our platform, with the largest accounting for less than 0.25% of total Services revenue.
Among our many all-time Services records, it was the best quarter ever for AppleCare, thanks to strong service agreement attach rates and expanded distribution. And to better meet our customers' needs, we announced a new iPhone repair program, making it easier for independent providers across the U.S. to tap into the same resources as our Apple Authorized Service Provider network and offering customers additional options for the most common out-of-warranty iPhone repairs. The new program complements our continued investment in our growing global network of over 5,000 Apple Authorized Service Providers that lead the industry for customer satisfaction and help millions of people with both in- and out-of-warranty service for all Apple products.
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. Revenue was $7 billion, down 5% from last year due to a different mix of products, given the strength of our MacBook Air lineup and a difficult comparison to last year's launch of MacBook Pro models. Despite the tough compare, we generated an all-time revenue record for Mac in the U.S. and in India and a fourth quarter revenue record in Japan. More than half of the customers purchasing Macs during the quarter were new to Mac, and the active installed base of Macs again reached a new all-time high. 
We had great results for iPad with revenue of $4.7 billion, up 17% from a year ago. iPad revenue grew in all 5 of our geographic segments with a Q4 revenue record in Japan. In total, over half of the customers purchasing iPads during the September quarter were new to iPad, and the iPad active installed base also reached a new all-time high.
The most recent surveys from 451 Research measured a 95% customer satisfaction rating for iPad from consumers and 97% from businesses. And among both consumers and businesses who plan to purchase tablets in the December quarter, more than 80% plan to purchase iPads.
Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new fourth quarter record with revenue of $6.5 billion, up 54% year-over-year, with growth accelerating from the third quarter across all 5 geographic segments. The performance was driven by tremendous growth across Apple Watch, AirPods, Beats products and accessories. And as Tim mentioned, we set Q4 records for our Wearables category in every single market we track around the world.
Our retail and online stores produced fantastic results, generating record September quarter revenue in all 5 geographic segments and strong double-digit growth across iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and accessories. We also continued to see great results from our trade-in program with more than 5x the iPhone trade-in volume we had a year ago. 
Last month, we reopened the stunning Apple Fifth Avenue in New York with an even more welcoming layout beneath the landmark glass cube, providing nearly twice the space of the original store. This iconic store is open 7 days a week, 24 hours a day and provides an even better environment for customers to experience our latest products, meet with our Geniuses, creative pros and specialists and attend our free daily Today at Apple sessions.
We also opened our newest and largest store in Japan and fifth store in Tokyo in the Marunouchi business district across from the historic Tokyo Station. And we opened a beautiful new store in the heart of Mexico City's vibrant Polanco district to welcome visitors to experience the best of Apple in Mexico.
We're seeing strong demand for our products in the enterprise market with growth significantly ahead of our business overall, and we have great momentum transforming major industries. One example is retail. 80 of the 100 largest retailers in the world are choosing Apple to modernize their customers and employee experiences across all functions of their business. Retailers are using iPhone, iPad and Mac to optimize their back-of-house operations, modernize point of sale and deliver differentiated customer and employee experiences. Customer engagement and assisted selling have been areas of particular focus, and we're seeing great results for iconic brands such as Burberry, Ralph Lauren, Sephora USA, Gap Inc. and many others. 
We're also helping government agencies around the world use technologies to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the way they deliver critical services to the public. For example, the U.S. Census Bureau is making fundamental changes to the design and implementation of next year's census with a goal of producing quality results, while reducing cost by leveraging the mobility, user experience and privacy of iOS. Hundreds of thousands of Apple devices would be deployed this fiscal year to support an innovative new model for the collection and management of census data. And we are proud that our products will play an important role in driving quality to this critical initiative while safeguarding the privacy and security of this data.
CDW, Apple's partner in this initiative, will also utilize Apple Financial Services, our enterprise financing platform, to help minimize the cost to the public by taking advantage of the uniquely strong residual value of Apple devices.
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with almost $260 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We issued $7 billion of new term debt, retired $3 billion of maturing debt and reduced commercial paper by $4 billion during the quarter, leaving us with total debt of $108 billion. As a result, net cash was $98 billion at the end of the quarter, and we continue on our path to reaching a net cash neutral position over time.
We returned over $21 billion to shareholders during the September quarter, including almost $18 billion through open market repurchases of 86 million Apple shares and $3.5 billion in dividends and equivalents. We also retired an additional 7 million shares in the final settlement of our 14th ASR.
As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the type of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $85.5 billion and $89.5 billion. This range includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of over $1 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $9.6 billion and $9.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $200 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 16.5%.
Also, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.77 per share of common stock payable on November 14, 2019, to shareholders of record as of November 11, 2019.
Before we open the call to questions, I also have a special announcement to make today. Nancy Paxton, our Head of Investor Relations for the last 23 years, has decided to retire at the end of December after a wonderful 33-year career at Apple and 93 earnings calls. Nancy has been the face of Apple with analysts and investors over a period of incredible growth and success. Her passion for our company, her commitment and dedication to serve our entire investor base and her sense of humor will be missed greatly. Personally, I'm very grateful for the advice and support you have given me during these last 6 years. We all wish you the very best for the next and exciting phase of your life.
With that, let us open the call to questions.",1835

As you said, I mean, at the midpoint of the range, we are essentially flat sequentially. On one side, we expect -- on the positive side, we expect leverage from higher revenue. On the other side, foreign exchange for us continues to be probably the biggest headwind that we got right now. It's going to be negative 70 basis points on a sequential basis. Also, keep in mind that during the holiday season, we have a higher mix of products revenue than we have in other quarters. And that obviously is dilutive to the company margin. On a year-over-year basis, we're also about flat. And on one side, we've got better commodity pricing. The environment is better than it was a year ago, but foreign exchange is a negative impact of 120 basis points on a year-over-year basis.",142

But related to Apple's initiatives in health care, do you think health-related features are a primary driver of Wearables growth?

The Wearables have done extremely well. It was an acceleration further from the previous quarters, so we're thrilled with the results. As to what's driving it, it's the totality that's driving it. For some people, it's about fitness. For some people, it's about health. For some other people, it's about communication, and for some people, it's all of the above. And I think the new feature of always-on on Series 5 is a game-changer for many of our users. 
And in terms of other health-related things that we have going, we will be continuing to build out our health records connection into the Health app, really democratizes the information about people's health, and so they can easily go from doctor to doctor. We've got the research going that I've mentioned earlier. There will be more of those through time. And obviously, we've got things that we're not going to talk about just yet that we're working on. But as I've said before, my view is there will be a day in the future that we look back and Apple's greatest contribution will be to people's health.",190

First one, Tim, if you think about the Services business, you're less than $2 billion away from the targets you had laid out a few years back. But I'm wondering if you think about the growth rates you've had in the business over the last several years, the high teens average, I think, how much of that do you think was driven by the installed base growing versus incremental monetization of the installed base? And do you see that ratio essentially flipping or changing as you go forward?",96

As Luca mentioned in his comments, we continue to grow across every category, hit new highs in the last quarter. And we hit new highs in all of our top 20 markets. And so the installed base is clearly a piece of it. Getting the trade-in program going and the secondary market moving has been helpful in that as well. And of course, the -- ultimately, the thing that builds the installed base is to make customers happy. And that's our -- always our top objective is to have satisfied customers.
The other thing that is obviously happening is in many areas, the ARPU is increasing. And so as there's more offers out there, I mean, the one that is today getting the attention is on the streaming side. But if you look at the number of services that have been added over the years, it's significant. And people love them. And so it's really both of those. And obviously, finally, getting more people that are enjoying things for free to elect to pay for some of the premium services. So it's sort of all 3 of those.",202

And then if I could just kind of go back to the Wearables discussion, I mean, and especially if you think about Apple Watch and AirPods. Is there a sense or a way to think about what's the attach rate today to iOS devices for Apple Watch or AirPods? I guess I'm just trying to understand, if I think about 900 million-plus iPhone installed base, what kind of penetration do you have at Wearables and how long could this one may be as you go forward?",88

The -- what we're seeing in terms of new ads on the watch, I think Luca may have mentioned this in his comments, is about 3/4 of the Apple Watch buyers are new to Apple Watch. And so we are still and significantly in the build mode there. And so don't think of the penetration as anywhere near a sort of a mature penetration. We got a lot left there. 
And the AirPods just keep hitting new highs. And I anticipate that will carry over to this quarter too, and we're really proud to add another product up there for people wanting noise-canceling with the AirPods Pro beginning to sell today.",134

And I don't know, Tim, if you can talk more about what you're seeing in China, the trends during the quarter, the reception specifically there to the iPhone. Any thoughts on Hong Kong used to be a big market. There's obviously some turmoil there. So if can you just provide some more in China that will be helpful.",65

We had a very good September, Shannon, and the lead of that is sort of the reception of iPhone 11 and 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max. And so we feel really good about how we've gotten started there. As you can tell from the numbers, we've significantly improved since the beginning of the year. We've gone from minus well into the 20s to minus 2% last quarter. And if you looked at that in constant currency, we actually grew 1%. And so there's a very slight growth there. We obviously want that to be better. But we feel good about how we're doing. 
I think it's a combination of things that are -- that have turned things around. On a macro basis, I think the trade tension is less, and that clearly looks positive right now with the comments that we've been reading in the press. Secondly, the products have been extremely well-received there. Third, the things that we've done from a pricing and monthly payments point of view, and trade-in, getting the trade-in program up and running, all of these things have moved the dial. And so it's sort of a -- the sum of all of that. 
I would also say it's not all about iPhone in China. The Services area grew double digit. We began to see more gaming approvals in the quarter or I should say some key gaming approvals. It's not all about quantity but about which ones. We saw that. Also, Wearables, where Wearables are doing so great at a company level, they're doing even better in China. And so lots of positives there.",272

It continues to grow significantly faster than revenue. So I'm just curious as to where you're targeting the incremental spend. And then is there a point at which we might just see some leverage?",54

In some cases, our revenue growth exceeds our OpEx growth. In other cases, like fiscal '19, it was the other way around. But our approach frankly is not changing over time. We want to invest in the business. Our primary investments during the last few years have been in the R&D space because obviously we want to continue to innovate, improve the user experience, differentiate our products. 
We continue to run SG&A tightly. Obviously, if you look at what we've launched during the last few quarters and few years, we launched a lot of new products, and now we're launching a lot of new services. And when we do that, we need to make the adequate investments in marketing and advertising to raise the awareness of the new products and new services. And that is what you're seeing, for example, in the guidance that we provided for the first quarter as we're launching new services right now. And so we're making investments both in engineering and in advertising to support the new launches.",180

If I look at your guidance, the midpoint of your guidance for revenues on a sequential basis, it's up about 36.5%. Historically, fiscal Q4 to Q1 was up 50% or more. And even last year, given that iPhone is a slower-growing product, you guided for revenues to be up 45% sequentially. So given the enthusiasm about the iPhone 11 launch and the new Wearables products and the new Services, I guess the question is why is your guidance not stronger for Q1 on the top line? And is that sort of a reflection of conservatism, given that there's a lot of uncertainty in the world and we certainly saw that last year? Or are there other forces at work that we should be considering?",138
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 30, 2019",2019-10-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3567.0,1860712.0,72802394.0,Answer,Luca Maestri,,Executives,29,"Toni, thanks for the question. The guidance that we are providing, if you look at it at the midpoint, implies an acceleration of growth from the performance that we've seen during the course of fiscal '19. As I said earlier, foreign exchange is clearly a headwind for us right now. There's about $1.1 billion of negative foreign exchange on a year-over-year basis. So that is something to keep in mind. 
We feel very good, as Tim said, about the iPhone, the way the new cycle has started. And we do expect an improvement in our year-over-year growth rate on iPhone. Wearables has very, very strong momentum. The portfolio of Services also has incredible momentum. One thing to keep in mind as we look at this guidance range is the fact that we also contemplated the comparison to the launch of the iPad Pro a year ago for iPad as well as the new MacBook Air that was launched during the December quarter last year. So for the iPad and Mac categories, you need to keep in mind that our launch timing is different on a year-over-year basis.",187

And then if I could follow up. Just on the bundling of Apple TV+. I guess for you, Tim, this is really the first time we've seen a significant bundling of services offering and a hardware offering. And I'm wondering if you view this as kind of a strategic advantage of Apple and whether we might see more hardware plus services offerings -- bundled offerings. And ultimately, to you, do you ever believe that your hardware itself might be offered as a bundled service? And maybe while we're on that, either you or Luca could give us the 30-second tutorial on how we should think about the deferred revenue accounting, approximately how much of the $60 are you going to be deferring and what's your expectation for attach rate on that?",132
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 30, 2019",2019-10-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3567.0,1860712.0,72802396.0,Answer,Luca Maestri,,Executives,31,"Let me cover that accounting issue first. Obviously, we need to make some assumptions around the take rate of our customers on the -- on Apple TV+, right? And we don't want to get into the details of that because we view those assumptions as confidential and competitively sensitive. 
But you need to keep in mind that we contemplate a number of factors, including the fact that we have family sharing as part of the service, the fact that there are multiple device purchases, the geographic availability around the world, the availability of local content at the beginning of the service, how many people do we have with payment methods on file. So we use all these things to make assumptions around what the take rate is going to be. Obviously, those assumptions will possibly change over time as we get more information on how the customers behave. We haven't launched the service yet. We're going to start serving our customers tomorrow, so we'll see how it goes, but we take into account all these different factors.",177

And on the TV+, we concluded that a great way to get more people to see the content would be to do this, and it would be a good gift for our users, and so that's what we're doing. You can also see that on the other services, we're not doing that. So it's not part of a broader pattern or -- although I wouldn't want to rule out for the future that we might not see another opportunity at some point in time.
In terms of hardware as a service or as a bundle, if you will, there are customers today that essentially view the hardware like that because they're on upgrade plans and so forth. And so to some degree, that exists today. My perspective is that will grow in the future to larger numbers that will grow disproportionately. And one of the things we're doing is trying to make it simpler and simpler for people to get on these sort of monthly financing kind of things that's a part of what we announced with the Apple Card earlier in the call. And so we're cognizant that there are lots of users out there that want sort of a recurring payment like that and the receipt of new products on some sort of standard kind of basis. And we're committed to make that easier to do than perhaps it is today.",251

And it looked like margins and the revenues did well on that. And it also followed some price adjustments you made in emerging markets last year.

Chris, I think that the price moves we've made have been smart and well-received and do show a level of elasticity. But the most important thing by far is the product. And I think we've got the best lineup we've ever had, and the customer response to the product, what the product does for them is really incredible. And the photos I'm getting from many users around the world are just incredible that people are taking. And so I think it's product first and then price sort of falls out of that. And we did decide to be more aggressive. And looking at the results in the early going, I think it was the right call. 
In terms of emerging markets, we picked sort of locally relevant prices. And in some cases where the dollar had become stronger, we took an exchange rate that would've reflected a while back instead of the current exchange rate. And in other words, we tried to stay as close as we could to a local price point that we knew was effective for that particular market. And those, in addition to the U.S. price that have gotten more of a discussion, have been extremely well-received.",202

People are just coming out of the 30-day trial period in the last few days or a week or so, and so it's really too early to tell what the conversion rate will be. But I feel like we're off to a good start, and the -- most important of everything, the customer feedback to date has really been incredible, and we're very excited for the future of the service.",100

And as I've mentioned before, 3 out of 4 customers buying an Apple Watch currently or last quarter, I should say, were buying an Apple Watch for the first time. And so there's still a very, very large new to Apple Watch in this regard. I do think the upgrade market will get larger over time but just don't have a current view as to how often and so forth.
On the AirPods, we're anxious to see the customers for the new AirPods Pro. But I would guess that one, particularly in the early going, will be people that have AirPods today and want to have a -- also have a pair for the times that they need noise cancellation.",143
