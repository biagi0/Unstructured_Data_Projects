Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. And after that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. 
Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. 
For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2014 and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. 
And I'd also like -- just like to remind you that as we indicated in our last quarterly call, we're now including the results of our retail stores in the geographic segments where the stores are located and retail is no longer classified as an operating segment. 
We've also updated our product summary reporting and we're now reflecting 5 categories of results: iPhone, iPad, Mac, services and other products. We prepared schedules showing reclassifications of historical operating segment and product results for each of the last 12 quarters to conform to these new groupings, and they are available now on our website at apple.com/investor. 
So I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.",251

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we're reporting on a historic quarter and I'm incredibly proud of everyone who contributed to the amazing results you're about to hear. Interest in Apple products is at an all-time high, with over 0.5 billion customer visits to our physical and online stores during the quarter. 
Demand for iPhone has been staggering, shattering our high expectations, with sales of over 74 million units, driven by the unprecedented popularity of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. This volume is hard to comprehend. On average, we sold over 34,000 iPhones every hour, 24 hours a day every day of the quarter. 
The execution by all of our teams to achieve these results was spectacular. By the end of the quarter, our new iPhones were available in 130 countries around the world, making this our fastest and most successful rollout ever. 
Additionally, the App Store and the Mac each set new records for quarterly revenues. Mac units were up 14% to 5.5 million, while the rest of the PC market continued to decline. App Store revenues were up a remarkable 41%. 
Demand was strong around the world. Flurry estimated that Apple products accounted for over half of all mobile device activations globally from the 19th to the 25th of December. It was truly a momentous quarter for iOS. On November 22, we shipped our 1 billionth iOS device. It was a space gray 64-gigabyte iPhone 6 Plus, which we've saved here at Apple. 1 billion devices is an almost unfathomable milestone, and we are all incredibly proud to be a part of it. 
Apple's mission is to make the greatest products on earth and enrich the lives of others. Through the success of iOS, we have provided hundreds of millions of people with powerful personal technology that is simple and fun to use. Our customers are using Apple products to transform education, discover new ideas for business and express their creativity in ways that no one could have imagined when we sold the first iPhone less than 8 years ago. It's amazing to watch, and it reminds us that people and great ideas are the reason we make the things we make.
Our strong overall performance in the December quarter resulted in total company revenue of $74.6 billion and earnings of $18 billion. Both of these numbers are all-time records for us, with revenues up 30% and earnings up 38% over last year. And due to our very large capital return activities, earnings per share were up even more at 48% to $3.06, also an all-time quarterly record. Our results would have been even stronger absent fierce foreign exchange volatility. 
We've also made great progress on a number of very exciting new initiatives to further strengthen our ecosystem. We've been blown away by the reaction to Swift, our new programming language. Inventing a new programming language is something very few companies can do and we believe it will have a profound effect on our ecosystem. Swift became available in September as part of the Xcode tools, and in the first month, those tools were downloaded over 11 million times. A recent report from Redmonk showed that Swift has had unprecedented growth and is quickly climbing the list of the most popular programming languages. 
We've seen many of our developers choosing Swift as they build significant new projects. And we are seeing fantastic work with Swift going on in education. Very recently, Stanford University released their Developing iOS 8 Apps with Swift course, which was posted to iTunes University, making this amazing resource available to everyone in the world.
There's also been incredible interest in HealthKit, with over 600 developers now integrating it into their apps. Consumers can now choose to securely share their health and wellness metrics with these apps, and this has led to some great new and innovative experiences in fitness and wellness, food and nutrition and health care. 
For example, with apps such as American Well, users can securely share data such as blood pressure, weight or activity directly with physicians. And leading hospitals such as Duke Medicine, Stanford Children's and Penn Medicine are integrating data from HealthKit into their electronic medical records so that physicians can reach out to patients proactively when they see a problem that needs attention. 
With HealthKit and the iOS Health app, we believe we're just at the beginning of amazing new health and wellness solutions for our customers. Our extensions of iOS in the home with HomeKit and in the car with CarPlay are also continuing to progress. And this year, we are looking forward to amazing HomeKit-enabled products from several companies and CarPlay-enabled vehicles from over 30 automotive brands.
Also, as you know, we introduced 2 new categories in the fall, and we're making great progress on both of them. Apple Pay is off to a very strong start, and the feedback that we are getting from both individuals and institutions is extremely positive. Today, about 750 banks and credit unions have signed on to bring Apple Pay to their customers. And in just 3 months after launch, Apple Pay makes up more than $2 out of $3 spent on purchases using contactless payment across the 3 major U.S. card networks. 
In merchants who already accept Apple Pay, the rates are even higher. Panera Bread tells us Apple Pay represents nearly 80% of their mobile payment transactions. And since the launch of Apple Pay, Whole Foods Market has seen mobile payments increase by more than 400%.
You can use Apple Pay up and down Main Street: to pick up a prescription at Walgreens or Duane Reade; get office or school supplies at Office Depot and Staples; and shop for groceries at national and regional stores from coast to coast, including BI-LO, Harveys, Save Mart, Wegmans Food Markets, Whole Foods and Winn-Dixie, among others. 
More merchants are excited to bring Apple Pay to their customers and adoption is strong. Just today, USA Technologies announced and made Apple Pay available at about 200,000 places where everyday payments happen, including vending machines in businesses, airports and schools, commercial laundry machines in colleges, universities and laundromats and parking meters and payment kiosks in lots across the country. 
Point-of-sale suppliers tell us they are seeing unprecedented demand from merchants, and all of our partners and customers simply love this new service. With all of this momentum in the early days, we are more convinced than ever that 2015 will be the year of Apple Pay.
Development for Apple Watch is right on schedule, and we expect to begin shipping in April. Developers are hard at work on apps, notifications and information summaries that we call Glances, all designed specifically for the watch's user interface. The creativity and software innovation going on around Apple Watch is incredibly exciting, and we can't wait for our customers to experience them when Apple Watch becomes available. 
We're also making great progress in our partnership with IBM, and our collaboration is winning over new customers. In December, we delivered the first 10 MobileFirst for iOS apps for banking, retail, insurance, financial services, telecommunications, governments and airlines, making iPhone and iPad even more productive for enterprises by providing app and cloud services with IBM's big data and analytics capabilities. 
Another 12 apps will be released this quarter, including 3 new industries: health care, energy and utilities and industrial products. This will bring us to a total of 22 apps, and we're on track to have over 100 by the end of 2015.
In just over 1 month, more than 1 dozen enterprise customers have signed on as foundation clients to transform their companies with iPhone, iPad and IBM MobileFirst solutions, including Miami-Dade County, the seventh largest county in the United States by population, and American Eagle Outfitters, which operates more than 1,000 retail stores and ships to over 80 countries worldwide. And the list of new customers is expanding rapidly. IBM has engaged with more than 130 additional companies looking to empower their employees with MobileFirst for iOS solutions, and the list keeps growing. We couldn't be more pleased with this partnership.
In addition to all these initiatives, we have a robust product and services pipeline that we are very excited about. And we look forward to sharing more about them with you throughout the year.
In addition to the contributions we make to humanity through our products, we made great progress on imported projects during the quarter, including ConnectED and (PRODUCT)RED. With ConnectED, we're focused on making a difference for students and communities who need it the most. We recently chose 114 schools across 29 states to receive an Apple ConnectED grant. Despite their economic challenges, all of these schools share a vision of what their students' lives would be like with Apple technology, and we're proud to help them bring that to life. 
And in December, we undertook our largest-ever initiative to help (PRODUCT)RED achieve the goal of an AIDS-free generation. To commemorate World AIDS Day, we worked with some of our developer partners to create and donate the proceeds from 25 special apps. And we also contributed a portion of sales at our retail and online stores on 2 of the year's busiest shopping days. As a result, Apple's donation set a new record. 
Delivering the results we're reporting today reflects months and years of focus and determination from teams across Apple, as well as our amazing developers and business partners. I'd like to thank all of them for their commitment and performance. And I'd also like to thank our incredible customers for their ongoing loyalty and enthusiasm. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca to discuss our December quarter results in more detail.",1629
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2015",2015-01-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3633.0,749675.0,32856619.0,Presenter Speech,Luca Maestri,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. In the December quarter, we generated all-time record revenue of $74.6 billion, an increase of $17 billion or 30% year-over-year. We achieved this exceptional performance despite significant foreign exchange headwinds from many currencies. 
Our growth was broad-based across the world, with revenue from developed countries up 20% and revenue from emerging countries up 58%. The performance of our Greater China segment was particularly impressive, with revenue up 70%. 
Sales were well ahead of our expectations in a number of areas. The unprecedented demand for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, combined with our tremendously successful production ramp, allowed us to build and ship several million more iPhones than we had expected when we provided guidance back in October. And also Mac revenue and services revenue reached all-time highs. 
Gross margin was 39.9%, above our guidance range, and operating margin was $24.2 billion, representing 32.5% of revenue and our highest operating margin percentage in 10 quarters. Net income was $18 billion, surpassing our previous all-time record by almost $5 billion. This translated to diluted earnings per share of $3.06, a 48% year-over-year increase. Cash flow from operations was exceptional at $33.7 billion, also a new all-time record. 
For details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 74.5 million iPhones, an increase of 23.4 million over last year, representing 46% growth. iPhone sales grew strongly in both developed and emerging markets. Among many great results around the world, unit sales were up 44% in the U.S. and up 97% in the BRIC countries. Sales doubled year-over-year in China, our second-largest iPhone market, as well as in Brazil and in Singapore.
Thanks to the popularity of iPhone 6 Plus and the increased value customers saw in our highest storage capacity offerings, iPhone ASPs were $687, an increase of $50 over the year-ago quarter. This led to iPhone revenue growth of 57% year-over-year, with quarterly sales exceeding $50 billion for the first time ever.
We had a 200,000-unit decline in iPhone channel inventory during December quarter this year compared to an increase of about 1 million iPhones during the year-ago period, and we were not able to reach supply-demand balance until this month. This left us below our target range of 5 to 7 weeks of channel inventory on a look-forward basis. 
We're now working with about 375 carriers, representing 72% of the world's mobile phone subscriber base, and we have over 210,000 points-of-sale for iPhone across the globe. 
Our customers love their iPhones. A December ChangeWave survey measured a 97% customer satisfaction rating for iPhone. A study published by Chitika Insights last month indicated that iPhone accounts for 53% of North America smartphone web traffic, almost twice the level of the next closest brand. And in the corporate market, ChangeWave found that among IT buyers planning to purchase smartphones in the March quarter this year, 77% intend to purchase iPhones. 
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.5 million Macs, an increase of almost 700,000 units over last year, a 14% growth rate. Thanks to the popularity of our stunning new iMac with Retina 5K display, Mac ASPs increased by $58 sequentially, driving all-time record revenue for Mac of $6.9 billion. 
We achieved double-digit year-over-year unit growth in both desktops and portables. These results are truly remarkable given the contraction in the global PC market, which IDC estimates declined by 3% in the quarter. We have now gained market share for 34 of the last 35 quarters. We ended the quarter with Mac channel inventory slightly below our 4- to 5-week target range.
Turning to iPad. We sold 21.4 million units compared to 26 million in the December quarter last year. Given the introduction of new iPads in October, we increased iPad channel inventory by 1.1 million units during the quarter compared to an increase of about 2.1 million in the December quarter last year. This left us within our 5- to 7-week target range of channel inventory on a look-forward basis.
Customer experience and usage data for iPad continue to be excellent. In a November survey, ChangeWave measured a 98% customer satisfaction rate for iPad Air and also found that among people planning to purchase a tablet within 90 days, 60% plan to purchase an iPad. And among businesses planning to purchase tablets, the intent was even stronger at 78%.
Chitika Insights' most recent report indicated that iPad users in North America generate over 70% of tablet-based web traffic, more than 6x the web traffic of the next closest competitor. And Custora's latest e-commerce report indicates that iPad accounts for 82% of all U.S. e-commerce transactions from tablets. 
All these results are consistent with usage data from the holiday shopping season. IBM's Digital Analytics Benchmark service found that iOS devices accounted for more than twice the online traffic and almost 4x the e-commerce sales on Android devices during November and December. 
The Apple ecosystem continues to thrive. Combining all of our services, revenue grew to $4.8 billion in the December quarter, a new all-time high and an increase of 9% year-over-year. This record performance was driven primarily by the tremendous momentum of the App Store, with revenue growing 41% in the December quarter. 
Our iOS developers have earned over $25 billion from the App Store to date and we're thrilled with their success. Total sales of media and software from iTunes were $2.6 billion compared to $2.4 billion in the year-ago quarter. 
Our direct channel performance was also outstanding. We welcomed more visitors than ever before and generated record revenue in both our physical and online stores. We opened 10 new retail stores during the quarter, bringing us to a total of 447, 182 of which are outside the United States. We've opened 2 new stores in this month in Greater China, and we're on track to add 40 stores in Greater China by mid-2016.
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $178 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $22.7 billion. We completed our first international debt offering, issuing EUR 2.8 billion denominated notes at very attractive interest rates and greatly diversifying our debt investor base. 
We spent $5 billion to repurchase 46 million Apple shares to open market transactions, paid $2.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and utilized over $500 million to net-share-settle vesting employee RSUs. We also retired an additional 8 million shares in connection with our accelerated share repurchase programs.
We have now taken action on almost $103 billion of our $130 billion capital return program, including $73 billion in share repurchases, with 4 quarters remaining to its completion. In the last 12 months alone, we have returned over $57 billion to our investors. 
We review our capital return program on an ongoing basis. We continue to solicit feedback from a broad base of investors, and we're on track to announce an update to the program in April when we report our second quarter results.
Now as we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $52 billion and $55 billion compared to $45.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. And this represents a very significant revenue increase despite growing foreign exchange headwinds from the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies. 
We expect gross margin to be between 38.5% and 39.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $5.4 billion and $5.5 billion, and we expect OI&E to be about $350 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.3%.
Also today, our board has declared a dividend of $0.47 per common share, payable on February 12, 2015, to shareholders of record as of February 9, 2015. 
With that, let's open the call to questions.",1317

I'll talk about what we're looking for Q2 and possibly even further, right. Obviously, what we've seen during Q1 has been unprecedented movements in currencies. I would say during the course of the quarter, the biggest impact came from the Japanese yen, the Russian ruble, but also from euro, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar. Our revenue growth during Q1 would have been 4 percentage points higher on a constant-currency basis. On a profitability standpoint, our hedging program partially mitigated the impact from the volatility in currencies. As we look forward and we look into particularly the March quarter, the foreign exchange headwinds will be stronger in Q2 than they were in Q1 for 2 main reasons. The first one is the fact that the U.S. dollar has continued to appreciate against foreign currencies during the last few weeks. And the other one is the fact that our existing hedges expire. They get replaced by new contracts at current levels, and therefore, the protection that is provided to us by our hedging program diminishes over time. What that means to us going forward for the March quarter is that revenue growth on a year-over-year basis in constant currency would be 5 points higher than what we are guiding to if it wasn't for the FX movements. In terms of gross margins, and you know that we look at gross margins on a sequential basis, the gross margin percentage, after the offset that we're getting from the hedging program, will be impacted by over 100 basis points. Now having said that, we have factored the impact that I just described into the guidance that we've provided to you, so that's where we are right now. Of course, as you look further out, we do not provide guidance past the March quarter. But it goes without saying that at current levels, again, those headwinds will continue to become stronger for the reason I explained earlier, that our hedges continue to expire, they get replaced by new hedging contracts at current levels and ASO, and there is the impact that we would see during the course of the year. It goes without saying strong U.S. dollar has a negative impact on our international business. Having said all that, we have provided what we believe is a very strong guidance for the March quarter. We remain very, very confident about the portfolio of products and services that we have in the market today. And we remain very, very confident in the pipeline of products and services that we have.",433

And as a follow-up to that, can you talk a little bit about the pricing power?

That would be obviously our preference. That's what we do in normal times. When currencies move as much as they have in places like Russia, for example, sometimes we need to take mid-cycle action to realign pricing. So we'll see what happens.

We don't report out the precise mix. But what I can tell you is that iPhone 6 was the most popular iPhone last quarter. But obviously, to sell 74.5 million, they were really all popular and all did well. There is clearly a geographic preference difference where some geos would skew much higher on their preference to iPhone 6 Plus than other geos. And so it's something that is not consistent around the world. But both did incredibly well and we're really proud of them, along with the iPhone 5s and c as well, which continues to be in the lineup.",105

And that left us outside of our target range on the low -- outside the low end of the range, to be specific. We -- just recently, we became in supply-demand balance on the 6 and 6 Plus in January. We were not able to reach a balanced state during our fiscal Q1. On iPad, we increased channel inventory by 1.1 million units from beginning of the quarter to end of the quarter. That compares to the previous year where we're increased to 2.1 million. Obviously, that inventory was required because of all the new products that we announced on iPad with the iPad Air 2 and the iPad mini 3 in the October time frame during the quarter. At the end of the quarter, we were within the target range of channel inventory on iPad. In terms of growing channel inventory, in particular on iPhone where we're outside of it, we wouldn't expect to see a large step function increase. We would expect it to occur more gradually over time than sort of an all-at-once type of thing. But we don't guide to channel inventory specifically, as you know.",214

You can see from the March guidance that we've given that we're incredibly bullish about iPhone going forward. We believe that it's the best smartphone in the world. Our customers are telling us that. The market is telling us that. We're doing well in virtually every corner of the world. And so we're very bullish that it does have legs. I would point out that only a small fraction of the installed base has upgraded, and so there's a lot more people within the installed base. But I would also point out that we had the highest number of customers new to iPhone last quarter than in any prior launch and also that the current iPhone lineup experienced the highest Android switcher rate in any of the last 3 launches in any of the 3 previous years. And I -- we didn't look back to the other years, so I don't know about those. And so we see that we're appealing to new customers, both new to smartphone and new to iPhone and people switching. We're very bullish on the product and getting great feedback about the quality of the products we're shipping, and so we're very, very bullish. The emerging markets, which has been a source of great questions over time, the growth was absolutely stunning in Brazil and Mainland China, more than doubling year-over-year, which is a 3x to 4x what those markets were doing according to IDC. And so we entered the quarter with quite a bit of momentum.",257

I mean, on both fronts, we certainly expect more favorable costs in the March quarter than we've seen in the December quarter. It goes with our product cycle. The foreign exchange headwinds, as I was explaining to Shannon, they will be, on a sequential basis, a headwind of more than 100 basis points. So if you were to exclude that foreign exchange impact, we would actually be guiding to sequential increase in margins. The other element that is there, and it's very seasonal, it's always there, is the loss of leverage that we got from Q1 into Q2. When you look at our revenue guidance, we are guiding to a sequential decline between 26% and 30%. So you obviously have that loss of leverage. But without a doubt, the biggest headwind that we got right now is foreign exchange. Having said all that, guiding 38.5% to 39.5%, we feel, frankly, very good about where we are right now in the cycle.",164

And just to clarify, what we have been saying was early 2015, and we sort of look at the year and think of early is the first 4 months, mid is the next 4 months and late is the final 4 months. And so to us, it's sort of within the range. And so it's basically when we thought [ph].

And so the local competition isn't new. I think we did really well there. I'm very proud of how we're doing. I was there right after the launch in October. And the excitement around the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were absolutely phenomenal. And you can see that in the results with Mainland China being up 100% year-on-year despite not having a full quarter of sales since we launched in the second half of October. I -- we're -- you can tell that we're a big believer in China. We're looking at our investment. We're growing the number of stores. We'll hit 20 soon and we're doubling that by mid-2016, as Angela said earlier and Luca said in his prepared comments as well. We're also growing the channel there. Our online store has expanded to over 350 cities now. And in fact, our online revenues in China last quarter were more than the sum of the previous 5 years. And so it's an incredible market.

As you noted, your iPhone channel inventory is below your target range as well, so if anything, that might be going up. So I'm wondering if you could just discuss a little bit what factors are contributing to this deeper-than-normal decline this quarter, particularly given your ongoing enthusiasm for the phone.",99

I mean, it is -- first of all, it's a 20% year-over-year growth that we're guiding at the top end of the range. So we obviously feel good about a 20% growth. As we look at it on a sequential basis, there's a couple of things that I think is important to point out. I mentioned the foreign exchange headwinds. They are there. We need to deal with them, but they obviously are a negative to revenue. Those are headwinds that we have this year and were not there a year ago. So that's one factor. We've also said the manufacturing ramp that we've had this year in the December quarter has been the fastest that we've ever had, and so that's also a factor that impacts the sequential compare. And then there's a couple of specific events that happened last year in the March quarter, which are not going to repeat this year. One of them is the fact that last year in January, we launched China Mobile, and we had the subsequent channel fill for China Mobile that, of course, is not going to repeat this year. And we also had a very, very strong quarter in Japan in the March quarter a year ago, which was driven by very significant carrier promotional activities and a pull forward of sales into the March quarter in anticipation of a consumption tax increase that took place on April 1. And again, that is not going to repeat. So when you take those factors into account, I think that explains the sequential decline that we see this year. Again, I want to point out to the 20% year-over-year growth.",284

Tim, I was wondering if I could have my -- direct my follow-up to you, which is the iPad. You've spoken on prior calls about your enthusiasm for the product on a go-forward basis. Over the last year, it's down double digits from a unit perspective and ASP has also been declining. So I was wondering if you could comment on whether your bullishness about the iPad persists. And is it really -- do you believe it's a replacement cycle that we will ultimately see that will start to drive growth? Or is there really innovation in product that is both necessary and forthcoming that's going to drive that growth?",112
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2015",2015-01-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3633.0,749675.0,32856649.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,33,"Toni, I am still very optimistic and bullish on iPad over the long run, as I've indicated before. When you measure it in these 90-day clips, as we do, in the short run, I don't think you're going to see a miraculous change in the -- or an improvement in the year-over-year. But here's what I see when I look at it and the reason that I'm so optimistic. I see that the first-time buyer rates are very high. And so by very high, I mean that if you look in some of the developed markets like the U.S., Japan, the U.K., you would find that 50% of the people are buying an iPad for the first time. If you look in China, it's over 70%. And so that -- when you have that kind of first-time buyer rates, you don't have a saturated market. When I look at the customers sat on iPad, it's literally off the charts. In some cases, 100%, which is unheard of in surveys to get these kind of customer sat ratings. When I look at the usage, the usage is 6x our nearest competitor. The usage, as defined -- as measured in web browsing, is like 71% of total tablets, as I think Luca covered earlier. Also, the commerce taking place across the iPads is enormous. Essentially, over 80% of the commerce on tablets are taking place on iPad. And so when I back up and look at all of these, and I believe that over the long arc of time, that the iPad is a great business. I also had visibility, obviously, to what's in the pipeline and feel very, very good about that. That said, I'm not projecting -- to be clear with everyone, I'm not projecting something very different next quarter or the next. I'm thinking over the long run. In terms of what I think is going on, I think what you said is absolutely true that the upgrade cycle is longer. It's longer than an iPhone, probably between an iPhone and a PC. We haven't been in the business long enough to say that with certainty but that's what we think. There's probably some level of cannibalization that's going on with the Mac on one side and the phone on the other. And so you probably have a little bit of that, that is shaking out. How much, very hard to tell on the early going, particularly since we just shipped the new phones a few months ago. And so I think there's some things like that, that are going on. On the other side, I think the partnership with IBM and the work that we have going on, on the enterprise is profound. I think we're really going to change the way people work. I'm really excited about the apps that are coming out and how fast that the partnership is getting up and running. And so I think that can move the dial there. And so I'm not predicting the 90-day clips and so forth. But over the long arc of time, I really believe that iPad is a great space, a great product and with the -- also coupled with the product innovation we've got, I think there's a very, very bright future for it.",549

Gene, on Apple TV, we had a solid quarter with the existing product. We've sold over 25 million Apple TVs now. It's -- at the sake of repeating myself, it's something that we continue to look at and work on and find a way that we can make an even greater contribution in what we're doing. On Apple Pay, both the contactless payment and the in-app are both important. I think they're both huge opportunities. I think they'll play out differently in different geographic regions as to which one is larger than the other and will -- likely the mix of those things will change over time as more and more commerce flows across apps and so forth. In terms of how it evolves, I think we're in the first inning on it. I'm not even -- we haven't even completed the first inning yet. There's tons of things on our roadmap of adding functionality to it. We're obviously -- we're just in the U.S. right now and so there's tons of countries to go to. And there's not a day that goes by that I don't get notes from many businesses outside the U.S. wanting Apple Pay and banks and merchants. And of course, we still have a lot of merchants left in the U.S. But I have to tell you that given that we launched in October, I'm actually unbelievably shocked, positively shocked, at how many merchants were able to implement Apple Pay in the heart of their holiday season because generally, most people sort of lock down and don't do very much. And -- but we were able to get this in a lot of different merchants and I give them a lot of credit for that. But I think we're just on the front end. And I think that this is the year of Apple Pay. And some of the things you mentioned and others are all things that we're looking at and in many cases working on in terms of where it can take us.",341

But the issue is -- so the issue is not that, and it's not a market share number because our market share is extremely high. The issue is that enterprises, generally speaking, are only deploying iPads to a small percentage of their workforce. And so the real opportunity is to bring mobility into the enterprises and change how people work. In order to do that, you obviously need apps that are written to specific jobs, not just apps that are general productivity apps like word processors and spreadsheets and presentation tools, et cetera. And so that's what -- that's one of the things that working with IBM provides us, is both that and the knowledge of the verticals, which they bring a significant amount of knowledge on all of the verticals that I've mentioned earlier. And so where can we take that to? I think if we can really change the way people work, I think the opportunity is enormous. We're not hanging numbers out there to be measured on at this point. But we don't do a lot of big partnerships, as you probably know. And so when we do one, it is significant and it's because we really believe in it.

We obviously feel good about the business. During the December quarter, our revenue exceeded, in terms of growth, our growth in operating expenses. There's going to be quarters where the opposite is going to happen. Our expense-to-revenue ratio during the December quarter was 7.4%. It was the lowest that we've had in 2 years. It's among the lowest ratios that we've ever had. But obviously, we're investing in the business and we will never underinvest in the business. The majority of the increase will continue to come from R&D given the fact that we've expanded our product portfolio, and we're making investments all the time ahead of the revenue that will be generated in the future. We also expect to continue to invest in marketing and advertising. We're expanding distribution all over the world. We've taken our brand to more places.

Considering the iPhone 6 Plus brought you into an entirely new segment of the smartphone market, can you give us a bit more color on the customer composition for this device? Specifically, you mentioned the differences in geographic adoption, but how about on the Android switcher comments you made earlier and first-time adopters relative to the traditional iPhone 6 and your other iPhone models in the past? And I guess related to that, what do you think this tells you about your ASP and unit opportunity for growth in 2015?",109

Bill, at this point, in the -- just shortly after the quarter, we don't have all of our research in from all of the people that bought last quarter yet. But in the aggregate, as I mentioned before, we saw more new customers to iPhone than we'd ever seen before. And we had a higher rate of Android switchers than we had in the 3 previous launches, and it's not that we had more in the fourth one, and I don't know what those numbers are. It wasn't something we were looking at. And so between the switchers and the people that are just new to smartphones and selected an iPhone and are upgrades, which we're very happy with but represent a small fraction of our installed base, we feel really great about what's in front of us.",139

We have a lot of great news to talk about so I'll jump right in. Today, we're reporting our strongest March quarter ever with 27% revenue growth and 40% earnings per share growth year-over-year. We're seeing fantastic results for iPhone, with revenue growth of 55% year-on-year, and we're seeing a higher rate of switchers than we've experienced in previous iPhone cycles. The success of iPhone has been extremely strong in emerging markets where unit sales were up 63% year-on-year.
The App Store had its best quarter ever, with a record number of customers making purchases, driving a new record for revenue and 29% year-on-year growth. We also reached an all-time quarterly record of $5 billion in total services revenue.
We also continued to defy the trend of declining global PC sales, with double-digit Mac unit growth in a market that IDC estimates contracted by 7%. We're now halfway through fiscal 2015, and our year-to-date results have been simply staggering. We sold over 135 million iPhones, 34 million iPads and 10 million Macs in the first 6 months of the year. Our revenue has grown by 28% to over $132 billion; net income has increased 36% to over $31 billion and EPS has grown by 44%.
We're making many strategic investments in Apple's future in research and development, in our supply chain and in our infrastructure, and we've made 27 acquisitions in the last 6 quarters. We're in the very fortunate position of generating more cash than we need to run our business and keep making these important investments.
So today, we're announcing another significant update to our capital return program, expanding its size to $200 billion through March of 2017 to reflect our strong confidence in what lies ahead for Apple. Luca will go into this in more detail in a moment.
We're also making great progress in many other areas. The Apple ecosystem continues to expand in exciting ways. We're seeing great momentum with Apple Pay. Discover announced today that its card members in the United States will be able to make contactless payments in participating stores through Apple Pay beginning this fall.
And last month, we said that the number of locations accepting Apple Pay has tripled, and we continue to see great progress with merchants. Best Buy, which has been a long-time strong partner of ours, has just announced that it's now offering Apple Pay in-app and, later this year, will offer Apple Pay in all of their U.S. stores.
And merchants aren't the only ones jumping on board. Earlier this month, a leading health care payment network announced acceptance of Apple Pay for its clients, so over 50 major hospitals across the country, including Stanford Health Care and Aspen Valley, will accept Apple Pay this year for co-pays and bill payments at registration and check-in.
We're also incredibly inspired by the momentum we're seeing in health-related solutions. Since we released HealthKit with iOS 8 last September, over 1,000 apps have been developed to transform how people track, manage and interact with their health and they're now available on the App Store.
Just this past weekend, Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles turned on the largest HealthKit integration to date, giving more than 87,000 patients the ability to share their health and fitness data seamlessly with their My CS-Link app, which syncs with their electronic medical record.
And last month, we announced ResearchKit, an open source software framework that helps doctors and scientists gather data from medical research participants more efficiently and accurately using iPhone applications. The response so far has been simply amazing, far exceeding our expectations.
The first research apps developed using ResearchKit study asthma, breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and Parkinson disease and had enrolled over 60,000 iPhone users in just the first few weeks of being available on the App Store. Over 1,000 researchers had contacted us expressing interest in performing studies through ResearchKit. We think these types of solutions have the potential to revolutionize medical studies in life-changing ways, and we're proud that Apple is helping make this possible.
Last quarter, we also announced a major economic investment in Europe, where we will spend $2 billion to build data centers in Ireland and Denmark. These will be our largest data centers in the world. Apple is now responsible for creating over 670,000 jobs across the European continent. Most of them have grown out of success of the App Store, which has generated more than $7.5 billion for European developers since just 2008.
We feel great about the economic contribution we've been able to make in Europe. The 2 data centers we're building will run on 100% renewable energy from day 1. This is just part of the work we're doing to protect the environment and leave the world better than we found it. Today, 100% of Apple's U.S. operations and 87% of global operations are powered by renewable energy. Just before Earth Day, we announced our plan to move to renewables in China. We're undertaking a groundbreaking partnership with several companies to build a 40-megawatt solar farm in Sichuan province that will generate far more than the amount of energy used by all of our offices and retail stores in China combined.
We also announced an innovative new partnership with The Conservation Fund to permanently protect more than 36,000 acres of working forest in Maine and North Carolina to help offset the impact that our packaging has on the world's supply of sustainable virgin fiber. Apple is deeply committed to these initiatives and will continue to make them a priority.
The June quarter is off to an exciting start with great new products and services. Three of them in particular are giving our customers a glimpse of the future, and we are very happy with the reception that each of them is receiving.
First, the all new MacBook began shipping just over 2 weeks ago, and we're very happy with the response we're getting from customers. The new MacBook is our lightest, most compact Mac notebook ever. And you really have to see it to believe it. It features a stunning 12-inch Retina display, a new Force Touch trackpad, all-day battery life and a revolutionary new keyboard. We believe, and I think most everyone agrees, this is the future of the notebook.
Second is the new streaming service from HBO, which is available on Apple TV and iOS. We teamed up with HBO last month to help launch HBO NOW, a standalone service that lets customers stream the content they love from HBO on the devices they love from Apple, all without requiring a subscription to cable. HBO NOW has been incredibly popular with Apple TV users since its debut, and it has been one of the top downloaded apps on the U.S. App Store as well.
And third, of course, is Apple Watch. It's been really great to see the reaction of customers since their watches began arriving on Friday morning. All around the world, we've seen the excitement on social networks as people start using their Apple Watch. The response has been overwhelmingly positive.
Adding to the surprise and delight of Apple Watch are the more than 3,500 apps that are already available. Our developer community has already seen the potential in this new category and put some of their best thinking into what wearable technology can do. We can't wait to see more of the inspiring apps developers dream up for Apple Watch as we head into our Worldwide Developers Conference 6 weeks from now.
I'd like to thank all of those developers and our hundreds of millions of customers for their loyalty and support. I'd also like to thank all of the Apple employees around the world for their creativity, tireless effort and passion for delivering the very best products in the world. With that, I'll turn the call over to Luca.",1320
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2015",2015-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3447.0,795256.0,34649190.0,Presenter Speech,Luca Maestri,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. As Tim mentioned, we just completed another outstanding quarter. Revenue for the March quarter was $58 billion, an increase of $12.4 billion or 27% year-over-year. Growth was driven primarily by the very strong performance of iPhone and the continued strength of the App Store and Mac sales. We achieved these terrific results despite growing foreign exchange headwinds.
Our performance was particularly impressive in our Greater China and rest of Asia-Pacific segments. In Greater China, we established an all-time quarterly record for revenue, which grew 71% year-over-year to $16.8 billion. Gross margin was 40.8%, ahead of our expectations, mainly due to stronger-than-expected iPhone results. Operating margin was 31.5% of revenue and net income was $13.6 billion, a new Q2 record. Diluted earnings per share were $2.33, a 40% year-over-year increase, and cash flow from operations was $19.1 billion, also a new March quarter record. For details by product, I will start with iPhone.
We sold 61.2 million iPhones in the quarter, representing 40% year-over-year growth, and demand for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus has remained incredibly strong. iPhone sales more than doubled in Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam, and they were up 80% or more in several other markets, including Canada, Mexico, Germany and Turkey.
Strong mix of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, combined with the popularity of our higher capacity offerings, led to iPhone ASPs of $659, an increase of $62 year-over-year despite the very significant foreign exchange headwinds I already mentioned. We increased iPhone channel inventory by 1 million units during the quarter, which allowed us to get into the low end of our target range of 5 to 7 weeks of channel inventory.
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4.6 million Macs, representing 10% year-over-year growth, which is particularly impressive in the context of IDC's latest estimate of a 7% global PC market contraction. The growth was led by portables and spurred by the updates to MacBook Air and MacBook Pro in March. We ended the quarter within our 4- to 5-week target range for Mac channel inventory.
Turning to iPad. We sold 12.6 million compared to 16.4 million in the year-ago quarter. iPad sell-through was 13.7 million as we reduced channel inventory by about 1.1 million units coming after the holiday quarter. This left us within our 5- to 7-week target range of iPad channel inventory.
We set a new March quarter record for iPad sales in Japan and an all-time record for iPad sales in China, but performance in other markets was more muted during the quarter. iPad turns 5 years old this month and, in every year since introduction, it has been the #1 tablet in sales, in quantity and quality of tablet apps, in usage and, most importantly, in customer satisfaction. And based on the latest data from NPD, iPad maintains a very strong leadership share in all the price bands where we compete.
iPad has also consistently been the #1 tablet in enterprise. A recent ChangeWave survey found that among corporate buyers planning to buy tablets in the next 6 months, 77% plan to purchase iPads. In fact, we are seeing very high interest from companies who want to use iPads to transform how work gets done. The vast majority of the app opportunities that have been identified as part of the Apple and IBM partnership are specifically for iPad. In addition to IBM, we're working closely with more than 2 dozen other leading business software and solution providers, including Box, DocuSign, MicroStrategy, Revel and ServiceMax to bring a broad range of innovative mobile solutions to more customers on iPad.
Turning to services. Revenue grew to a new all-time record of $5 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year. The growth was led by the App Store, which remains incredibly popular with our customers around the world, with revenue up 29% in the March quarter. According to App Annie, the App Store generated 70% more global revenue in the March quarter than Google Play, up from a 60% lead in the September quarter.
Traffic to our retail and online stores was excellent, with a 22% year-over-year increase in customer visits. We are progressing well with our plans for retail store expansion in Greater China, where we added 6 new stores in the past quarter alone, bringing us to 21 stores in 11 cities. We're on track to have 40 stores open in Greater China by the middle of next year.
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $193.5 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $15.6 billion. Over $171 billion of this cash was offshore. In the March quarter, we issued $6.5 billion U.S. dollar-denominated notes and CHF 1.3 billion Swiss franc-denominated notes as we continued to diversify our global debt investor base. We now raised a total of $40 billion of term debt at very attractive rates.
We spent $7 billion to repurchase 56.4 million Apple shares through open market transactions, paid $2.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and utilized about $100 million to net-share-settle vesting employee RSUs. We also retired an additional 13.3 million [ph] shares during the quarter, with the conclusion of the accelerated share repurchase program we launched last August.
We have executed our capital return program aggressively, and we've now taken action on over $112 billion of our $130 billion program, including $80 billion in share repurchases at an average price of $85. As we said consistently, creating value for shareholders by developing great products that enrich people's lives will always be our top priority and the key factor driving our investments and our capital allocation decisions.
With this framework in mind, Apple's board and management team continue to review capital allocation regularly, and we solicit input on our program form a broad base of shareholders. This process allows us to be thoughtful about the size, the mix and the pace of the program. We very much appreciate all the input that many shareholders have provided us. 
We continue to be in the fortunate position of being able to return significant capital to shareholders. We first announced our capital return program 3 years ago with an initial size of $45 billion, and we've increased it annually since then. Today, we're announcing the third update to our program, expanding its size by the largest amount yet and extending its duration.
The existing program was set to conclude at the end of this calendar year, and we are now extending the program by 5 quarters to the end of March 2017. Once again, with this update, we're allocating the majority of the expansion of the program to share repurchases, given our strong confidence in the future of Apple and the value we see in our stock. 
The board has increased the share repurchase authorization by $50 billion, raising it from the current $90 billion to $140 billion. We will also continue to net-share-settle vesting employee restricted stock units.
We also understand that a dividend is very important to many of our investors, and we're raising it for the third time in less than 3 years. The quarterly dividend will grow from $0.47 per share to $0.52 per share, an increase of 11%. This is effective with our next dividend, which the board has declared today, and is payable on May 14, 2015, to shareholders of record as of May 11, 2015.
We believe this is a meaningful increase for the shareholders who value income, and we continue to plan for annual dividend increases going forward. With over $11 billion in annual dividend payments, we are proud to be one of the largest dividend payers in the world. In total, the size of our revised capital return program will increase by over 50% from approximately $130 billion to $200 billion.
As we've done in the past, we expect to fund our capital return program with U.S. cash, future U.S. cash flow generation and borrowing from both domestic and international debt markets. And we plan to provide the next update on our program at about this time next year.
Now as we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $46 billion and $48 billion compared to $37.4 billion in the year-ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 38.5% and 39.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $5,650,000,000 and $5,750,000,000. We expect OI&E to be about $350 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.3%.
With that, let's open the call to questions.",1451

Let me give you some numbers on the currency because I know it's a topic that is top of mind. You're asking about gross margin, and you know we look at this on a sequential basis. And I mentioned during the call in January that we were expecting FX to have a negative impact on a sequential basis of about 100 basis points after the effect of the hedges. And that is exactly what happened in our actual results. So that was pretty much in line with what we were anticipating. Of course, we expect this headwind to continue. And on a sequential basis, when we look into the June quarter, we expect to see another 40 basis points of negative impact from currency. We're dealing with these headwinds as they're part of business. And so we're dealing with them in many ways. We are looking at, in some cases, at the potential to increase prices in certain markets. We are looking, of course, at our cost structures, and we try to remain as competitive as possible. So we feel very good about the gross margins that we've generated in the March quarter and we feel very good about the guidance that we've provided, given the severity of the impact.",216

Right now, demand is greater than supply, and so we're working hard to remedy that. We made progress over the last week or so, and we're able to deliver more customers an Apple Watch over the weekend than we had initially anticipated. We're going to keep doing that, and so we've already sent some notes out today with moving other customers in versus what we had communicated to them previously. So I'm generally happy that the -- that we're moving on with the ramp. It is a new product for us. And with any kind of new product, you wind up taking some time to fully ramp. Having said that, I think we're in a good position. And by -- sometime in late June, we currently anticipate being in a position that we could begin to sell the Apple Watch in additional countries, and so that's our current plan. From a demand point of view, it's hard to gauge when your -- and you don't have product in stores and so forth, and so we're filling orders completely online at the moment. The customer response from people that have gotten theirs over the weekend have been overwhelmingly positive. And we're far ahead of where we expected to be from an application point of view. To give you a comparison, when we launched the iPhone, we had about 500 apps that were ready. When we launched iPad, we had about 1,000. And so our internal goal was to be able to beat the 1,000 level. And we felt -- we thought it'd be great if we were able to do that by a little bit. And as I've mentioned before, we now have over 3,500 apps in the App Store for the Watch. And so we're -- we couldn't be happier about how things are going from that point of view. We are learning quickly about customer preferences between the different configurations. There is a much larger breadth of possibilities here for customers than in our other products. And in some cases, we called that well. In some cases, we're making adjustments to get in line with demand. But I'm really confident that this is something we really understand how to do and will do. And so I'm really happy where we are currently and happy enough that we're looking forward to expanding into more countries in late June.",411

We now develop 2 new iPhones every year, we were not doing that a few years ago -- develop 2 iPads. Of course, now we have the Apple Watch. We're also developing some core foundational technologies more in-house now than we were in the past. And of course, we're also spending ahead of some of the products that will generate revenues in the future. So when you combine all these factors, that is the reason why you see these research and development increases year-over-year. Research and development is the core of the company, innovation is the core of the company. And we're very proud of the fact that when you look, for example, at the last 2 quarters, the first half of 2015, our revenue growth has been higher than our OpEx growth. And when you look at our expense/revenue ratio, which for the first half of the year, has been 8.2%, it's lower than it was a year ago, and it's definitely something that we consider extremely competitive and we're very proud of.",203

And if you kind of look through at the different countries, in almost every country, we grew at a multiple of the market. And as I'd mentioned before, in emerging markets, we did extremely well. And so I feel really good about where we are. And you can hopefully tell with a strong guidance that we provided that we're very bullish on the current quarter as well. And so I think things look very, very good. We're also pleased, in addition to the switcher number, that we're doing fairly well with first-time buyers, which is also a key metric for us.

I'll talk about Q3 because this is the period that we provide guidance for. And when we guided to 38.5% to 39.5%, which is slightly down versus our performance in Q2, and this is driven by a number of things. First of all is the loss of leverage from the sequential decline in revenue. This is typical of our seasonality. There's foreign exchange element that I mentioned before, the negative impact on a sequential basis about 40 basis points. And also we're launching the Apple Watch. Apple Watch is not only a new product, but it's a brand new category with a lot of new features, a lot of new innovative technologies. And Apple Watch margins will be lower than company average.",131

Tim, I think you said when you were talking about your new products, you said we're ""very happy with the reception"", and in response to a previous answer, you said relative to demand, it's hard to gauge with no product in the stores. I would say relative to other product launches where your commentary around demand was characterized by superlative after superlative, that assessment feels very modest. And part of the reason that I ask is, a, are we reading you right in terms of that? But if we look at consensus, consensus is expecting that Apple will ship more Watches in its first 2 quarters than it did iPad despite, as you said, very limited distribution in terms of only selling through your stores. So I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about putting those demand comments in context, given that they do seem different from how you've characterized product demand for other products. And how, if at all, we should think about a modeling demand in the context perhaps of the iPad, which was your most recent significant new category. And then I have a follow-up, please.",198

In any situation, whether it's the Watch or in the past on iPad or on iPhone, when demand is much greater than supply, it's difficult to gauge exactly what it is. And so as you know, we don't like long-term forecasts on here. We make forecast for the current quarter. And so I don't want to make any comment about consensus numbers. Honestly, I haven't even studied those. We have enough to think about here. I feel really great about it. The customer response, I mean, literally from what I've seen, is close to 100% positive.

So I'm wondering if you believe that the Watch is -- Watch's gross margins are being burdened by lower volumes and startup costs and that you believe that as a category, Watch margins will be, in total, including everything else that you sell with it, will be, on a sustained basis, lower than the company average.",122

It was an incredible quarter. We were up 71% year-over-year. We set a record in China for revenues. We did that now in a quarter that included Chinese New Year, and so we had the help of a strong holiday season, much like the U.S. has a strong season in December. China's is obviously in the March quarter. iPhone led the way with -- was up over 70% year-on-year. And the current estimates from Kantar are that, that would mean that we would gain more than 9 points of share on a year-over-year basis. And so we -- by everything I can see, we did extremely well. The Mac also had an unbelievable quarter in China, and I'm particularly very happy with this, that Mac unit sales were up 31%. And like the rest of the world or most of the rest of the world, IDC is projecting that PC sales in China contracted by 5% last quarter and so, once again, bucking the tide. Also in China, consistent with the company but at a much different rate, the App Store had a record quarter and grew over 100% year-over-year. And so you can see the iPhone, the Mac and the App Store adding. And with the iPad in the -- in PRC, not in Greater China, but in the PRC, iPad had its best quarter ever, higher than all the others and also grew in a market that contracted for the overall market. And so really and truly sort of everything you look at in China was extremely good. We had been working significantly on expanding our ecosystem there. And so we added UnionPay as a payment option for customers. We increased the iPhone point-of-sales to over 40,000 during the quarter. That's up about 9% year-on-year. And more importantly than the total number, we are in many more cities than we were before. We worked on significantly on our online store, and our online store revenue was up over 3x year-over-year. As you probably heard us say before, we've opened several stores in China recently. We're now at 21 in Greater China and we're on track still to achieve 40 stores by the middle of next year. The online store will also be expanding from around 319 cities to where they can hit 2-day delivery to 365 cities, so adding about 50 new cities by the end of this quarter. And so the net is we're adding -- we're investing a lot across the board in our infrastructure, in our products, on partnering with different companies. The Chinese developers are coming on in significant numbers. We've now made payments to developers in Greater China of almost $5 billion, over half of which was in the last 12 months. And so you can see this enormous momentum building in the developer community there as well. And so lots of positive things. And as I've -- as you probably heard me say before, I've never seen as many people coming into the middle class as they are in China. And that's where the bulk of our sales are going. And so we're really proud of the results there and continue to invest in the country.",537

And then just sort of a follow-up on the iPad side. What do you think will it take to reaccelerate iPads? I mean, the sell-through was better than the sell-in this quarter. But are we seeing cannibalization from the iPhone 6 Plus? And how are you sort of thinking about the IBM partnership as it relates to iPad?",63

So we have to -- where we don't have to have an inventory correction, that was over 1 million units. Two, have we had cannibalization? The answer is yes. We're clearly seeing cannibalization from iPhone and, on the other side, from the Mac. And of course, as I've said before, we've never worried about that. It is what it is. That will play out and, at some point, it will stabilize. I'm not sure precisely when, but I'm pretty confident that it will. The IBM partnership, I think, is in its early stages in terms of bearing fruit here. But everything I see, I like on it. I'm a big believer in the ability for iPad to play in a major way in enterprise. And so I'm looking forward to seeing that play out as we move forward. When you look at the underlying data, it makes you feel a lot better than the sales do. And so things like first-time buyer rates, the latest numbers from the U.S. are somewhere around 40%. And if you look at China, they're almost 70%. And so these numbers are not numbers that you would get if the market were saturated. And so I continue to believe, even though I've seen different people write that, that I think that theory is not correct and do not see that. We also see usage numbers that are off the charts, so far above competition. It's -- I mean, it's not even in the same planet. And we see customer satisfaction at the -- at or near 100%. And so these kind of numbers, along with intent-to-buy numbers, everything looks fantastic, the e-commerce numbers. And so my belief is that as the inventory plays out, as we make some continued investments in our product pipeline, which we're doing, that we already had planned and have had planned for some time. Between that, the inventory playing out, the enterprise starting to take over, I think still, I believe the iPad is an extremely good business over the long term. When precisely it begins to grow again, I wouldn't want to predict, but I strongly believe that it will.",382

So the logic has not changed over the years. We look at our business plans, we look at what we want to accomplish from a product perspective. We look at the capital needs that we have to run the business and to grow the business. And then we see that we're in this great position that we can return cash to shareholders. We know Apple very well. We are very excited by the level of customer response that we got for our current portfolio. We're super confident about the pipeline of products and services that we have. And therefore, we believe that there is great value in our stock. And that is the reason why, again, this year, we're allocating the majority of the increase, which is the largest increase that we've ever done. We're increasing the program by $70 billion, right? And the vast majority of that, we're allocating to the share repurchase because, again, we believe there's great value in the stock. We also know and understand that we have several investors that value income. And so that's important for us to increase the dividend. And as we said in the past, we plan to continue to increase the dividend every year. And as we said in the past, we will come back at about this time next year and give you another update to the program because we'll have better information and we'll be able to be very thoughtful about the size and the mix and the pace of the program. From a funding standpoint, of course, you have a very strong balance sheet. We do have some cash in the U.S.. We will continue to generate cash in the U.S. But definitely, a good portion of the program will be funded through debt. We will raise debt both in the U.S. and outside the United States. And of course, we've got very, very strong balance sheet. We've got a very open dialogue with the rating agencies. And so we feel we still have a lot of room for us to fund the program.

And this accounted for just slightly less than 40% of the company's revenue. If you look at BRIC within the emerging markets, BRIC countries were up 64% year-over-year. And so as I look at that, without having market research data on the demographics that you're asking, it's clear to me that it has to be coming from middle class because the upper income earners, there's only so many of those. And you can't grow those kind of numbers without getting significantly into the middle class. And so I think that's where we are. I hope we're also beyond the middle class. But I don't have the data to suggest that, that's the case or not the case. But it's clear to me that the middle class statement has to be true.",157

My follow-up, Tim, I'm going to stay with you for a second. If you could -- it sounds like HBO NOW is off to a -- it sounds like it's a great opportunity today and as you look out. If you could just speak more specifically how we should be thinking about Apple as a conduit for something like HBO NOW and other products. Is that that, a, a meaningful revenue opportunity without getting specifics and/or is it more about selling incremental devices? Or is it about expanding the revenue pie as you look at opportunities like HBO NOW?",103

And so I think HBO, in particular, has some incredibly great content. And so we're marrying their great content, our great product and ecosystem. And it's clear from looking at the early returns, we've only been at this for a couple of weeks or so, that there's a lot of traction in there. And so where could it go? I don't want to speculate, but you can speculate probably as good as I can about where that can go. I think we're on the early stages, just major, major changes in media that are going to be really great for consumers. And I think Apple can be a part of that.",162

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. It's been a busy and exciting quarter, and I'm delighted to talk to you about the highlights.
Today, we're proud to report record June quarter results with revenues of $49.6 billion and earnings of $10.7 billion. Our year-over-year growth rate in the fiscal third quarter accelerated over the first half of fiscal 2015. Revenues were up 33%, our fastest growth rate in over 3 years. And earnings per share were up 45%. We achieved these incredibly strong results despite reducing channel inventories across our product lines by over 1 million units and despite the challenging FX environment.
Revenue exceeded the high end of our guidance by $1.6 billion as we topped our internal expectations for sales of iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch. 
We had another stellar quarter for iPhone, establishing a new June quarter record. iPhone unit sales grew 35%, which is almost 3x the rate of growth of the smartphone market overall, and we gained share in all of our geographic segments. iPhone revenue grew even more strongly, up 59%. The strong iPhone results were broad-based in both developed and emerging markets, and we experienced the highest switcher rate from Android that we've ever measured. 
Most importantly, iPhone customer metrics are tremendous. ChangeWave's most recent survey of U.S. customers found that iPhone has the highest customer satisfaction rate of any smartphone brand by a wide margin. And that among iPhone owners planning to purchase a new phone, 86% plan to purchase another iPhone. That compares to 50% repurchase intent for the next highest brand measured. 
We also had a tremendous record quarter for Mac, continuing to defy the industry trend with unit growth of 9% and a market that IDC estimates contracted by 12%. Growth was fueled by great response to our new MacBook, and we're working hard to catch up with customer demand. 
We generated over $5 billion in services revenue, setting a new all-time record. Within services, the App Store produced its best quarter ever, with revenue growing 24%. Our results from Greater China were outstanding, with revenue growth of 112% and iPhone unit growth of 87%. This is particularly impressive, given IDC's estimate of only 5% growth for the Greater China smartphone market. 
We also achieved our highest-ever PC market share in the segment, with Mac sales growing 33% over last year. And our ecosystem in China continues to grow at a very fast pace, with App Store revenue more than doubling in the quarter. Luca will go into more detail on our product and financial results in a moment. 
A major highlight of the past quarter for all of us here at Apple was the launch of Apple Watch in April. As you know, we've been very excited to get this revolutionary product to customers. We started taking preorders in 9 countries on April 10, and demand immediately exceeded supply by a wide margin. 
To prioritize those first orders and to deliver the best experience for our customers, we delayed the availability of Apple Watch in our own retail stores until mid-June. We made huge progress with the production ramp across the quarter and near the end of the quarter expanded into 6 additional countries. And in just the past few days, we've been able to catch up with demand, enabling us to expand Apple Watch availability to a total of 19 countries currently, with 3 more countries to be added at the end of this month. 
The feedback from Apple Watch customers is incredibly positive, and we've been very happy with customer satisfaction and usage statistics. Market research from Wristly measured a 97% customer satisfaction rate for Apple Watch, and we hear from people every day about the impact it's having on their health, their daily routines and how they communicate. 
Our own market research shows that 94% of Apple Watch owners wear and use it regularly, if not, every day. Messaging and activity features are among the most popular and social networking apps, including Twitter, WeChat and LINE are seeing the most usage among third-party apps. 
We believe that the possibilities for Apple Watch are enormous, and that's been reinforced in just the first few weeks since it became available to customers. For example, doctors and researchers at leading hospitals in the U.S. and Europe are already putting Apple Watch to work in improving patients' lives. Nebraska Medicine, the latest hospital to adopt Apple Watch, has rolled out new apps that facilitate communication between patients and doctors and provide quick access to important chart and dosage information. 
Ochsner Health System of Louisiana is using Apple Watch with hypertension patients to gather important information like daily activity and blood pressure level. And leading cancer centers like London King's College Hospital are incorporating Apple Watch into trials for ongoing care and monitoring of cancer patients.
Great Apple Watch solutions go well beyond health care. Users are tracking their fitness; getting breaking news alerts; following their investments; connecting with friends and living a healthier day. The user experience for Apple Pay and Siri is nothing short of incredible. And customers are enjoying countless other features through the over 8,500 third-party apps available for Apple Watch. 
This is just the beginning of what this new platform can deliver. With Apple watchOS 2, developers now have the ability to build richer and more powerful native apps for Apple Watch, taking advantage of the heart rate sensor, the digital crown, accelerometer and more, ushering in a whole new class of apps designed specifically for the wrist. 
It's a rare and special privilege to launch a new platform with such promise and potential, and I know I speak for everyone at Apple when I say that we can't wait to see what our developers and customers do with it.
We hosted a fantastic developers’ conference in June, with thousands of attendees from 70 countries coming together with Apple engineers to share in the excitement of our 3 operating systems, OS X, iOS and watchOS. We've been working hard to make our products even more intelligent, more powerful and more meaningful in all aspects of our customers' lives, while adding new continuity features to make the experience across our devices more seamless than ever and preserving the security and privacy that our customers deserve. Public betas of OS X El Capitan and iOS 9 are available now, and customer versions of all 3 updated OSs are on schedule and will be delivered in the fall. 
We're very excited about our News app coming to iPhone and iPad with iOS 9. We believe it will be the best news reading experience on any mobile device, combining a beautiful magazine layout with real-time customized digital media content. News will follow over 1 million topics and pull relevant stories based on the user's specific interests without compromising their privacy. 
We've already signed 25 leading publishers, representing more than 75 of the world's most influential news, sports, business and magazine titles, including CNN, New York Times, the Financial Times, ESPN, Bloomberg Business, Condé Nast, Hearst, Reuters, Time Inc. and the Daily Telegraph. 
The September quarter is off to an exciting start. We're thrilled by the response to Apple Music, which launched in over 100 countries on June 30. Apple Music is a single immersive app that combines the best ways to enjoy music all in one place. It's an incredible streaming music service, a pioneering worldwide live radio station broadcasting 24 hours a day and a great place for music fans to connect with their favorite artists. 
Customers and reviewers love the human curation features of Apple Music and the way it's helping people discover new music. Millions and millions of customers are already experiencing the new service using the 3-month trial period and the numbers are growing substantially every day. Over 15,000 artists have signed up to post on Connect, where we are already seeing great original content, including a world premiere video by Drake. 
Millions of listeners around the world are tuning in to Beats 1, the first of its kind worldwide radio station featuring some of the most talented and passionate music lovers on the planet. This all adds up to a renewed sense of excitement around music, which we love and expect to continue as Apple Music gets traction with customers.
Last week, we launched Apple Pay in the U.K., bringing customers our easy, secure and private way to pay. On day one, we had an incredible roster of over 0.25 million locations and major credit and debit cards for many of the U.K.'s most established banks supporting Apple Pay. Customers are using Apple Pay to ride the London underground as well as the overground system of transports for London, and we hope this will be a model for other public transportation systems around the world.
In the U.S., we've seen fantastic support from merchants of all sizes. We are excited to see this momentum continue with the new Square reader coming this fall. It will bring Apple Pay to even more neighborhood businesses where you pay every day from your corner coffee shop to your local farmer's market, bolstering the 80,000 small and medium-size businesses we're already adding every month. 
American Express will add Apple Pay support for its robust portfolio of corporate cards next month, offering businesses and their employees a new way to make easy and secure payments. And as we head into the school year, 700 universities and colleges across the U.S. will accept Apple Pay such as Auburn University, the University of California, Irvine, Colorado State University, the University of Kentucky and the University of Oklahoma, among many others. We're on track for Apple Pay acceptance at over 1.5 million U.S. locations by the end of 2015.
I'd like to thank our customers, developers, business partners and employees for another record-breaking quarter. We're very hard at work on our exciting pipeline and new hardware, software and services, and we're continuing to expand our global reach into new markets. And we're passionately committed to leaving the world better than we found it. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Luca.",1695
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2015",2015-07-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3483.0,835410.0,36081684.0,Presenter Speech,Luca Maestri,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. As we have done for the first half of our fiscal 2015, we are reporting another record quarter today. Revenue for the June quarter was $49.6 billion, an increase of $12.2 billion or 33% year-over-year. Our growth was driven by the tremendous performance of iPhone, the introduction of Apple Watch and the continued strength of Mac and App Store sales. We achieved these great results in the context of a very challenging foreign exchange environment around the world and a reduction in channel inventory of over 1 million units across our product lines, which makes our growth performance even more remarkable. 
As Tim mentioned, our results were especially impressive in Greater China, where revenue more than doubled year-over-year to over $13 billion. Emerging markets overall grew 79% to almost $18 billion and represented 35% of our total company revenue. Company gross margin was 39.7%, better than our expectations, mainly due to strong iPhone sales. Operating margin was 28.4% of revenue, and net income was $10.7 billion, a new June quarter record. Diluted earnings per share were $1.85, a 45% year-over-year increase. And cash flow from operations was $15 billion, also a new third quarter record. 
For details by product, I'll start with iPhone. We sold 47.5 million iPhones in the quarter, representing 35% year-over-year growth, and demand for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus has continued to be terrific all around the world. iPhone sales more than doubled in Germany, Korea, Malaysia and Vietnam. We're up over 85% in Greater China and in India and increased more than 45% in several countries, including Italy, Spain, The Netherlands and Turkey. 
The strong mix of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus led to an iPhone ASP of $660, an increase of $99 year-over-year despite the significant negative foreign exchange impact I referred to earlier. We reduced iPhone channel inventory by about 600,000 units during the quarter, which left us at the low end of our target range of 5 to 7 weeks of channel inventory.
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4.8 million Macs, representing 9% year-over-year growth. As we've done for several years in a row, we continue to gain significant market share based on IDC's latest estimate of a 12% global PC market contraction. Mac growth was driven by portables, and we are delighted with the very strong customer reception of our new MacBook. We ended the quarter slightly below our 4- to 5-week target range for Mac channel inventory.
Turning to iPad. We sold 10.9 million compared to 13.3 million in the year-ago quarter. iPad sell-through was 11.2 million as we reduced channel inventory by about 300,000 units. This left us within our 5- to 7-week target range of iPad channel inventory. 
iPad customer metrics continue to be extremely positive. ChangeWave recently measured a 97% customer satisfaction rate for iPad Air 2. And among consumers planning to purchase a tablet within 90 days, over half plan to purchase an iPad. For corporate buyers, the purchase intent was even stronger at over 70%. We do not participate in the low end of the tablet market, but we are extremely successful where we do compete. NPD recently indicated that iPad has 76% share of the U.S. market for tablets priced above $200.
We're very excited about the advances in the iPad experience coming in iOS 9 in the fall, including the Slide Over and Split View features for easier multitasking, Picture in Picture for FaceTime and video and enhanced QuickType for composing text even faster. 
We're also seeing great momentum in the enterprise market. For instance, riding on the success of iPad use by its pilots, United Airlines has not only renewed its iPad program with more than 10,000 iPad Air 2s but has also made a strategic decision to provide iPhones to over 20,000 flight attendants. In the near future, United plans to introduce new apps to transform the customer experience and improve integration with flight operations. 
We're also very happy with the progress of our IBM partnership. IBM released 13 new MobileFirst for iOS apps in the June quarter, including new apps in retail, banking and health care, as well as new horizontal apps for HR and sales. There are now 35 apps in IBM's MobileFirst for iOS catalog that connect users to Big Data and analytics right on their iPads or iPhones. And we expect a total of 100 apps to be available by the end of 2015. 
Active customer engagements have also grown to over 500. And recent notable customer wins include Air Canada, National Grid in the U.K. and Banorte in Mexico. In April, Apple, IBM and Japan Post announced a joint initiative to deliver iPads with IBM-developed apps and analytics to connect Japanese senior citizens with services, health care, community and family. Japan Post hopes to reach 4 million to 5 million Japanese customers with these solutions by 2020. 
Since announcing this initiative less than 3 months ago, we're already seeing strong interest from other countries looking for innovative ways to support an aging population. Importantly, we also continue to work closely with leading business software and solution providers to help businesses of all sizes transform work with iPad and iPhone. The number of these mobility partners has expanded rapidly to over 40. They're developing new and differentiated solutions on iOS across many industries and attracting very significant customer interest.
Turning to services. We generated over $5 billion in revenue, a new all-time record at an increase of 12% over last year, thanks primarily to strong growth from apps. Revenue from the App Store increased 24% and the number of transacting customers grew 19%, also setting an all-time record. Services growth was particularly strong in China, where App Store revenue more than doubled year-over-year. China-based developers have created 250,000 apps for our China App Store, and the response from our customers has been tremendous.
The revenue from other products grew sharply, up 49% over last year. The contribution from Apple Watch accounted for well over 100% of the growth of the category and more than offset the decline of iPod and accessory sales. As we said in the past, we do not plan to disclose Apple Watch metrics because we don't intend to provide insight that could help our competitors. 
Our retail and online stores had a very busy quarter, with customer visits up 49% year-over-year, driven especially by the very strong interest in Apple Watch. Thanks to a very popular Apple Store app, mobile traffic to our online stores during the quarter equaled desktop traffic for the first time ever. 
We opened 3 new stores, our second store in Brazil, our sixth store in Manhattan and our 22nd store in Greater China. That brought us to a global store count of 456, of which 190 are outside the United States. And we're on track to have 40 stores open in Greater China in the middle of next year.
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $202.8 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $9.3 billion. $181 billion of this cash or 89% of the total was offshore. In the June quarter, we issued a total of $10 billion of term debt, consisting of $8 billion U.S. dollar-denominated notes and JPY 250 billion denominated notes as we continued to diversify our global debt investor base. This left us with $50 billion of term debt outstanding at the end of the quarter. 
During the quarter, we returned over $13 billion to our investors. We paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents, and we spent $4 billion to repurchase 31.2 million Apple shares to open market transactions. We also launched a $6 billion accelerated share repurchase program in May and received an initial delivery of 38.3 million shares. The purchase period for the new ASR will end in or before November of 2015.
We have continued to execute our capital return program at a fast pace, and we've now taken action on over $126 billion of our $200 billion program, including $90 billion in share repurchases. The weighted average price for all open market purchases and completed ASR programs to date is $86.
Now as we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $49 billion and $51 billion compared to $42.1 billion in the year-ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 38.5% and 39.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $5,850,000,000 and $5,950,000,000. We expect OI&E to be about $400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.3%.
Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.52 per share of common stock payable on August 15, 2015, to shareholders of record as of August 10, 2015.

As Luca mentioned, the channel inventory did go down by 600,000. We sold more units than we thought we would and so that was a part of that. The other part of it is that we always run with just the amount of inventory that we think we need. And so to the degree that sales are distributed in the countries with -- disproportionately with shorter supply chains or the standard deviation demand is less, we would always choose to have less. And so in this particular quarter, we were able to end basically right at the bottom end of our range. And we view that as a good thing, not a bad thing. Obviously, the revenues could have been much higher if we would have expanded the channel. But if you don't need to do that, i.e. that's not how we think about the business, we run the business for the long term, not the 90-day clock. In terms of the -- what's going on with iPhone, the 35% growth is almost 3x the market. And if you look at it at a little narrower regional level, Western Europe grew 30% versus a market of 7%, so 4x market. Japan grew over 5x market. We doubled in Korea versus a market that was shrinking. And India, we grew at 93%. And this is on top of the Greater China numbers that we've already covered that grew 87% during the quarter against a market of 5%. And so we did exceptionally well, I think, in any way that you look at it. In terms of our -- the percentage of customers that have upgraded to a 6 and 6 Plus versus -- that were -- that have not upgraded, it's 73% or meaning the 27% of the installed base of customers prior to the launch of 6 and 6 Plus have now upgraded. And so we view that as a very bullish sign on the future that there's a lot of headroom left for upgraders. We also are incredibly happy to see the highest Android switcher rate that we've observed. And so from our point of view, iPhone is doing outstanding.",364

What is the framework that you use to convince yourselves that iPhone units can continue to grow over the longer term?",60

And obviously, the kind of numbers that we have indicated growth in the revenue means that iPhone would have another stellar quarter. And so we're very confident that this quarter is going to be great. How the future looks, we'll take it 1 quarter at a time. But as I backed up from it and look at it more from a macro point of view, the things that makes me very bullish is the 27% number I just quoted, the fact that we are seeing the highest Android switcher rate, the customer satisfaction that we have on the iPhone versus the competition, it's a huge margin. The loyalty rate that we have versus competition, an enormous gap there. I also look at the first-time iPhone buyers. And we're still seeing very, very large numbers in the countries that you would want to see those in, like China and Russia and Brazil and so forth. I also see a market that, over a 5-year horizon, if you look at the IDC numbers, is projected to grow from 1.3 million in '14 to over 1.9 -- this is billion rather, 1.9 billion in 2019. And so it's an incredible market. I think everybody is going to own a smartphone. And I think we've proven that we can compete for a fair number of those as you can see from our results.",246

So we're guiding to 38.5% to 39.5%. And so just keep in mind, last year in Q4, our gross margin declined by 140 basis points sequentially. So this year, we're expecting a sequential decline of 220 basis points. I would point to 3 main factors for the decline. First of all, to your point around foreign exchange, it continues to be a challenging environment, given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. In our case, the impact on margin after the hedges is going to be about 30 basis points for Q4. Also, I want to point to a different mix, which is typical of our seasonality as we enter the back-to-school season during Q4, and, thirdly, the transition cost that you mentioned as we prepare for a busy fall. And so those are the 3 factors that will have an impact on gross margin sequentially. I would point out that in general, costs continue to be -- particularly commodity costs, continue to be favorable, and so there will be a partial offset to the factors that I mentioned.",182

And then can you give us a bit more color on the mix dynamics for the iPhone in the June quarter and how this compares to prior generations in your expectations?

So as we mentioned, the ASP for iPhone was up $99, 18% increase year-over-year. And this is really driven by the mix, by the fact that we've added iPhone 6 Plus to a new price point. And in general, iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are doing extremely well as a percentage of the portfolio. And keep in mind that this $99 was partially offset by $24 of unfavorable foreign exchange, so the number would have been even better. So yes, clearly, 6 and 6 Plus. And I think we talked about it in prior calls. The 6 Plus is doing particularly well in the markets that you would expect: Greater China, other Asian markets, those are markets where our growth rates are particularly strong. And the 6 Plus, because of the screen size, is doing extremely well.",138

In other words, is -- should the margin trends that we've seen in other cycles continue into next year? And then a follow-up or another question for Tim here is that the Watch has been under a lot of interest from investors, and some may have wanted a little bit more. You outlined some of the opportunities and some of the progress you've had, but any thoughts that you have for investors who may say that the category is just not taking off as fast as they would have hoped?",119

As Tim said before, obviously, we guide to the current quarter. As we look at it at a macro level, I think there are -- every cycle is different for a variety of reasons. There are also things that are not necessarily within our control. So for example, currency markets can be very different from one year to the next. We know that the next year is going to present an additional challenge, given where the dollar has moved. Commodity markets may be very different from one year to the other. There are things that are -- that remain relatively similar as we launch new products. For example, we innovate the products, we want to make them better all the time and that typically requires additional cost. And so the cost structures of our products, new products tend to be higher than the products that they replace. Having said that, as you know, we've got a very good track record to reduce those cost structures over the life cycle of the products. I think this should give you a bit of color. Of course, maybe the one thing that I want to point out again as we get into the following year is that, of course, currency will be an issue.",219

Let me talk about the Watch some. As you know, we made a decision back in September, quite certain months ago, not to disclose the shipments in the Watch. And that was not a matter of not being transparent. It was a matter of not giving our competition insight that we've -- a product that we've worked really hard on. However, let me give you some color so -- to avoid reaching sort of a wrong conclusion. If you look at the other products category and look at the revenue in this category, it would not be an accurate thing to just look at the sequential change or the year-over-year change and assume that were the total Watch revenue because the aggregate balance of that category, both sequentially and year-over-year, is shrinking. Obviously, iPod is a part of that, but there are other things in there, accessories and so forth, that are shrinking. Secondly, to provide a bit more color, sales of the Watch did exceed our expectations, and they did so despite supply still trailing demand at the end of the quarter. And to give you a little additional insight, through the end of the quarter, in fact, the Apple Watch sell-through was higher than the comparable launch periods of the original iPhone or the original iPad. And we were able to do that with having only 680 points of sale. And as you probably know, as I have reviewed earlier, the online sales were so great at the beginning, we were not able to feed inventory to our stores until mid-June. And so those points of sale pretty much -- the overwhelming majority of the low number of sales were not near until the last 2 weeks of the quarter. And so as I look at all of these things, we feel really great about how we did. Now our objective for the quarter wasn't primarily sales. Beyond the very good news on sales, we're more excited about how the product is positioned for the long term because we're starting a new category. And as I back up and look at this, we have 8,500 apps; we've already announced the next operating system, watchOS 2, it will bring native apps, which are going to be killer, to the Watch. Even though the store layout was delayed, we've learned a lot about the buying experience. Based on that experience, we are now planning to expand our channel before the holiday because we're convinced that the Watch is going to be one of the top gifts of the holiday season. Now most importantly of all of this is the customer sat is off the charts, because we've constantly seen if you can get the customer sat off the charts, you can wind up doing fairly well over time. We've also learned a lot about managing quite an assortment and so forth. And so I sort of back up and look at this and I feel fantastic about what the team has done and delivered. And I know I never go anywhere without the Watch, and it's not because I'm a CEO of Apple. I'm that attached to it. And I get lots of notes from a lot of people that feel the same way. And so that's how I look at the Watch.",558

And I'm wondering, if you think about the iPhone and your market share in the premium category, how do you think about it? So I've seen market data that says you have 60% market share for phones above $300 or you have actually 90% market share for phones above $600. And I'm wondering if, Tim or Luca, you could maybe talk about how you think about your market share, where you play, given that your ASP is comfortably above $600. What do you think your market share is above $500 or $600 in smartphones? And how do we think about that market share going forward?",130

We look at it a bit differently than you do. We look at it as our job is to grow our products regardless of the price, which means that we need to convince, in some cases, people to move from 1 price band to the other. And that we think that if we do a great job with a product, that people will be willing to spend more because they get so much more out of it. And I think you can look at the results on the iPhone and see that in action. I mean, we grew 87% in China. We grew 90-plus percent in India. Emerging markets are growing 65%. These numbers are unbelievable, and they're done in an environment where it is not the best of conditions. So that's how we look at it. We don't do the NBA analysis of there's only x people buying in a price band, and therefore, we can only get x minus y percent. That's not the way we've ever looked at it. If we did, we wouldn't be shipping [ph] any products.",185

It's also true that there's some people that are switching from comparable price points to the iPhone, and that's great, too. But I think the answer is that both of those things are happening.

And then if I could just ask you to comment on how you think about replacement cycles with the current iPhone 6 cycle. So when you look at replacement cycles over the last 3 quarters, are they similar to what you saw 1 and 2 years ago when you think about replacement? And one of the things that also sort of struck me was I think you cited market research having repurchase intention of 86% versus your competitors at 50%. Quite frankly, the 86% sounds low to me. Is that actually consistent with what you see in the marketplace, about 86% of iPhone buyers ultimately buy another iPhone? So perhaps if you can just help us think about replacement cycle and how that's changed and the percentage number and how that jives with reality.",135

Our own data would look better than that. But the numbers are only comparable if I quote the third-party source for both. And so that's what I'm doing. On the upgrade cycle, what we're seeing, it's not remarkably different. However, there's a number of plans that people begin signing up for in the last year that could change it. These are upgrade anytime kind of plans. They may be 1-year leases that could actually help the upgrade rate. And I think we'll -- I think it'll be interesting to see how that plays out over the next horizon. But generally speaking, I see positive vectors there not negative in the aggregate.",130

And at different phases of their life, they've seen tremendous high growth, whether it's iPad, iPhone, iPod. And iPhone looks like it's facing some very challenging comps here in the next few quarters. Does this make you shift even more strategic focus into broadening the reliance on a couple products such as -- you've mentioned Apple Radio. There's a lot more content on the Apple Watch in apps and then also Apple Pay. Are you increasingly focusing on hiring and kind of [indiscernible] hard-workings? Or are these kind of more peripheral activities and still the focus is kind of right now on the phone?",117

We think the phone has a lot of legs to it. I mean, many, many, many years, there's tons of innovation left at the phone. I think we're in the early innings of it, not in the late innings. And I think the market rate of growth over the long haul will also be impressive. And so it will be multiple winners here. And so that's how I see it. In terms of the other things that we're doing, we have some great capability and great teams in Apple and so we can do more than one thing. And so we have other things that we're working on as well. But at the aggregate level, we still remain very focused, because if you look at our size versus the number of projects we have going, it's much smaller compared to most. But that's how we do things and that's how we get the level of quality that we want out of each one of those. And so the other things that you named, whether it be Apple Music or Apple Pay, both of these are very important to us. And things that you didn't mention, the Mac continues to perform very well. I am still bullish on iPad. We've got -- with iOS 9, there's some incredible productivity enhancements coming in. With Split View and Slide Over and Picture in Picture, these things are incredible features. The enterprise business is clearly picking up. And more and more companies are either contracting for or writing apps themselves. I think -- and I believe that the iPad consumer upgrade cycle will eventually occur, because as we look at the usage statistics on iPad, it remains unbelievably great. I mean, the next closest usage of the next competitor, we are 6x greater. And so these are extraordinary numbers. It's not like people have forgotten iPad or anything. It's a fantastic product. So I see a lot of runway. And as I look geographically, where we've been doing really good in the emerging markets, our share is still not high in any of them. And so there's a lot of headroom there as well, as there is in most developed markets as well. And so I look around, I see opportunity left and right, and that's what we're focused on.",394

How do you think that plays out for Apple? On one hand, you've got more stores, broader distribution, the 4G infrastructure is playing out. On the other hand, the economy might be weakening.

And we remain extremely bullish on China, and we're continuing to invest. Nothing that's happened has changed our fundamental view that China will be Apple's largest market at some point in the future. It's true, as you point out, that the equity markets have been -- have recently been volatile. This could create some speed bumps in the near term. But to put it in context, which I think is important, despite that volatility in the Chinese market, they're still up 90% over the last year, and they're up 20% year-to-date. And so these kind of numbers are numbers I think all of us would love. Also, the stock market participation among Chinese household is fairly narrow. And the stock ownership is very concentrated in a few people who put what appears to be a smaller portion of their wealth in the market than we might. And so I think generally, this has been -- or at least as we see it, maybe it's not true for other businesses, that this worry is probably overstated. And so we're not changing anything. We have our -- the pedal to the metal on getting to 40 stores mid-next year as we had talked about before. We're continuing to expand the indirect channel as well. As you point out, and I think this is a major point that many people miss, the LTE penetration in China is only at 12%. And China doesn't possess the level of fiber that some other countries do. And so in order to get great video performance, et cetera, raising that penetration is really great. I think that really plays to an incredible smartphone future there. Also, and I can't underestimate -- I can't overstate this, the rise of the middle class there is continuing and it is transforming China. McKinsey -- I saw a recent study from McKinsey that's projecting the upper middle class to grow from 14% to 54% of households over the 10-year period from 2012 to 2022. So we're within that period at this moment. And you can see -- for all of us that travel there so much, with every trip, you can see this occurring. And so I think we would be foolish to change our plans. I think China is a fantastic geography with an incredible, unprecedented level of opportunity there. And we are going to be there.",403

So obviously, FX has been a significant hit in many ways, of course. I mean, it reduces our growth rates. We would be 800 basis points higher this quarter from the 33% that we've reported if it wasn't for the movement in currencies around the world. And really, when you look around the world, it's really -- if you exclude China, essentially, every single currency has weakened against the dollar. We are pretty careful and thoughtful about where we increase prices and when and by how much during mid-cycle because it's not something that we particularly like to do. We've had circumstances around the world this year where, frankly, we didn't have many options because the currency movement was so large and so we've had to reprice. I have to say that it's been remarkable. Look, in the long run, a strong U.S. dollar is not a positive for our international business. It's normal to see a drop in demand when prices go up. That goes without saying. It's been remarkable so far to see that we did take prices in a few markets, but it's been remarkable to see how resilient iPhone sales have been because we have increased -- in spite of these price increases, we've increased sales and we've increased market share in all our geographies around the world without exception.",226

On -- maybe the best way to talk about this is sort of at the product level. On the Watch, our June sales were higher than April or May. I know -- I realize that's very different than what some of the -- is being written, but June sales were the highest. And so the Watch had a more of a back-ended kind of skewing. The phone itself followed what I would call a normal seasonal kind of pattern. And if you look at the -- it sounds like you're honing in on the Greater China results themselves. The -- there's no obvious impact from last -- for last quarter in the Greater China numbers.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, we're reporting a very strong finish to a record-breaking year, and I'd like to reflect on some of the highlights. We completed our fiscal year in September, and we are proud to report revenue of $234 billion, an increase of 28% and $51 billion over 2014. This is our largest absolute revenue growth ever.
To put that into some context, our growth in 1 year was greater than the full year revenue of almost 90% of the companies in the Fortune 500. We made huge inroads into emerging markets, generating over $79 billion in revenue and growing 63% despite very strong headwinds from foreign exchange rates.
These results are made possible by Apple's commitment to innovation and creating the best products on Earth. In the past 12 months around the world, we've sold over 300 million devices, including 231 million iPhones, 55 million iPads and 21 million Macs, setting new unit records and increasing our global market share for both iPhone and Mac.
We crossed 100 billion cumulative downloads from the App Store, and we added powerful new services to our ecosystem, including Apple Pay in the United States and the United Kingdom, Apple Music in over 100 countries and Apple News in the U.S. We also entered an entirely new category with Apple Watch, and we are in the very early earnings of this promising new part of our business.
We generated over $53 billion of net income and grew earnings per share by 43%. We returned almost $50 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while continuing to invest confidently in research and development, marketing and distribution, our retail and online stores, our supply chain and our infrastructure. We also completed 15 acquisitions to enhance and accelerate our road map for products and services.
We accomplished all of these things while intensifying our efforts to protect the environment, to promote equality and human rights and to ensure the security and privacy we know our customers deserve. We're ending the year on a high note with a record-breaking September quarter, including sales of 48 million iPhones, beating our expectations and up 22% year-over-year. Momentum for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus remained very strong across the quarter, and we established a new launch record for iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus near the end of the quarter.
We're seeing strong interest around the world, and we've been getting great feedback from customers who love the iPhone's new features, including 3D Touch, Live Photos, the new iSight camera and the powerful new A9 processor in the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. We exited the quarter with demand for a new iPhones exceeding supply, but we've made good progress with our manufacturing ramp in the initial weeks of October.
We sold an all-time record 5.7 million Macs, continuing to defy the negative trend in the global personal computer market, which IDC estimates contracted by 11%. The App Store set new all-time quarterly records for both the number of transacting customers and overall revenue. The strong performance of the App Store helped fuel $5.1 billion in services revenue, also an all-time record.
Sales of Apple Watch were also up sequentially and we're ahead of our expectations. This quarter, we introduced beautiful new Apple Watch cases and bands, including new gold and rose gold aluminum Apple Watch Sport models. We released watchOS 2 in September, paving the way for a whole new class of native apps that are faster and can take advantage of the hardware capabilities of Apple Watch such as the microphone, speaker and the heart rate sensor. Today, there are over 13,000 apps on the Watch App Store, including over 1,300 native apps such as Facebook Messenger, MLB  At Bat and Runkeeper and the number is growing rapidly.
Apple Watch has already had a tremendous effect on customers' health and fitness, and the stories we're hearing about its impact are truly inspirational. I personally heard from people who credit Apple Watch with saving their lives, and customers are finding new applications all the time in their day-to-day activities.
Revenue in Greater China nearly doubled year-over-year, and we continue to focus and invest heavily there. I just returned from a 4-day visit to Hangzhou and Beijing where we announced major new initiatives to provide renewable energy for our supply chain. I also visited our retail stores in China, which are among the busiest in the world. On Saturday, we opened a new store, our 25th in Greater China, to a very enthusiastic crowd. And we are on track to achieve our goal of 40 stores by the middle of next year.
Yesterday, we started taking orders for the all-new Apple TV, and it was a huge first day for this exciting new product. We want to provide the same innovation in the living room that we delivered in our iOS devices. People are already watching more TV through apps today, and we think apps represent the future of TV. We've built a new foundation around this vision with a new operating system called tvOS, innovative ways to connect with your screen and a smart use of Siri to search for what to watch.
Next month, we'll begin shipping iPad Pro, the most powerful iPad we've ever made. iPad Pro will enable a new generation of apps for entertainment and productivity, design and illustration, engineering and medical and much more. And with the Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard, users can customize their experience, making iPad Pro an even more powerful tool for everyone from students to artists to business professionals. 
iOS 9 has hit the ground running, on track to be downloaded by more users than any software release in Apple's history, with 61% of active iOS devices already running at less than 6 weeks after its September 16 release.
In late September, we also launched OS X El Capitan, which has made the world's most advanced desktop operating system more refined and powerful than ever before.
Apple Music has set a completely new standard, redefining and combining the best ways to enjoy music in a single immersive app. Over 15 million individual and family accounts are experiencing Apple Music, including over 6.5 million paying customers. We're thrilled to bring Apple Music to China beginning this quarter, along with iTunes Movies and iBooks. And we're especially happy to offer such great new and diverse content to our large highly engaged and rapidly growing customer base in China. We're also looking forward to bringing Apple Music to the new Apple TV beginning this week.
Apple Pay is seeing double-digit growth in transaction month after month, and we continue to add major businesses, including Starbucks, which will roll out Apple Pay support to all its U.S. stores in 2016. Apple Pay now supports merchant rewards programs as well and popular retailers will be coming online in the next few weeks.
We're thrilled to announce today that we're partnering with American Express to bring Apple Pay to eligible customers in key global markets so even more people can experience the easy, secure and private way to pay. Apple Pay will be available to eligible American Express customers in Australia and Canada this year and is expected to expand to Spain, Singapore and Hong Kong in 2016.
The reach of our ecosystem continues to grow, and iOS is changing more and more aspects of our customers' lives in very meaningful ways from their health to their homes to their cars. In health, there are now more than 1,600 HealthKit-enabled solutions that are helping us live a healthier day. In the home, there are over 50 brands working on HomeKit-enabled accessories that can be privately and securely controlled from your iPad and iPhone. And in the car, more than 50 automobile models have been announced with CarPlay support, which provides a smarter, safer and more fun way to use iPhone in the car. And we will continue to work to make the iOS experience even more meaningful across more touch points of our daily lives.
The impact of ResearchKit also continues to build. We recently announced new studies on autism, epilepsy and melanoma, adding to the important studies already underway on conditions from asthma to diabetes to Parkinson's disease.
Our iOS News app is off to a great start. Nearly 40 million people are reading Apple News, and we've been getting very positive feedback from the publishers. We have now signed more than 70 publishers representing hundreds of titles, and we're happy to announce that News just launched in the United Kingdom and Australia with partners such as the BBC, News Corp., The Telegraph, the Guardian, Financial Times, Daily Mail and the Australian Broadcasting Service.
And finally, we're making great strides in the enterprise market, announcing a new strategic partnership with Cisco in September while furthering our progress with IBM and building our mobility partners program. We estimate that enterprise markets accounted for about $25 billion in annual Apple revenue in the last 12 months, up 40% over the prior year and they represent a major growth vector for the future.
I'd like to thank our talented and incredibly hard-working employees, our developers and our business partners around the world, and of course, our very loyal customers for making 2015 Apple's most successful year yet. With that, I'll turn the call over to Luca to go over the September quarter results in more detail.",1579
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2015",2015-10-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3475.0,884719.0,37948832.0,Presenter Speech,Luca Maestri,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. It's great to conclude our record fiscal 2015 with our strongest September quarter ever. Revenue for the quarter was $51.5 billion, an increase of $9.4 billion or 22% year-over-year. Our growth was driven by the very strong performance of iPhone, the expanded availability of Apple Watch and all-time high services revenue and Mac sales. We achieved these outstanding results despite severe and persisting weakness in foreign exchange rates around the world that affected all our geographic segments. And this makes our year-over-year growth rates even more remarkable. In constant currency, our growth during the fourth quarter would have been 800 basis points higher.
We once again reported very strong numbers in Greater China, with revenue growing 99% year-over-year to $12.5 billion. Emerging markets performance was strong overall, up 65% year-over-year and representing 31% of total company revenue for the quarter.
Company gross margin was 39.9%, up sequentially, better than our expectations, mainly due to lower-than-expected cost. Operating margin was 28.4% of revenue and net income was $11.1 billion, a new September quarter record. Diluted earnings per share were $1.96, a 38% year-over-year increase, and cash flow from operations was $13.5 billion, also a new fourth quarter record.
For details by product, I'll start with iPhone. We sold 48 million iPhones in the quarter, up 22% year-over-year, with strong performance around the world throughout the quarter. Total iPhone sales were up 120% in Mainland China, grew over 35% in South Asia and increased by over 20% in several markets around the world, including Germany and Italy.
iPhone ASP was $670, an increase of $67 year-over-year, thanks to more favorable mix and in spite of the very significant negative impact from foreign exchange that I referred to earlier. We increased iPhone channel inventory by less than 2 million units in order to support our new product launch at the very end of September quarter. We exited the quarter with demand exceeding supply and channel inventory below our target range of 5 to 7 weeks.
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.7 million Macs, which is an all-time quarterly record and represents 3% year-over-year growth. We extended our very long-running trend of PC market share gains based on IDC's latest estimate of an 11% global market contraction. Mac growth was driven primarily by the great customer response to our new MacBook and sales of MacBook Pro also remained strong. We ended the quarter below our 4- to 5-week target range for Mac channel inventory.
Turning to iPad. We sold 9.9 million compared to 12.3 million in the year-ago quarter. iPad sell-through was 10.4 million as we reduced channel inventory by about 500,000 units. We exited the quarter below our 5- to 7-week target range of iPad channel inventory. 
iPad customer metrics remain extremely positive. In August, ChangeWave measured a 97% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad Air 2. And among consumers planning to purchase a tablet within 90 days, 70% plan to purchase an iPad. Corporate buyers reported a 95% satisfaction rate for iPad and a 90-day purchase intent of 73%.
In the segments of the tablet market where we compete, we continue to be very successful. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad has 73% share of the U.S. market for tablets priced above $200. And the latest data published by IDC indicates that iPad has 74% share of the U.S. commercial tablet market.
As Tim mentioned, our enterprise initiatives continue to expand. In September, we announced a new strategic partnership with Cisco to optimize their networks for iOS devices, with the goal of providing iOS mobile users with great performance advantage over other mobile platforms.
Also during the September quarter, IBM released new MobileFirst for iOS apps in health care, financial services, travel and transportation and industrial sectors, including new apps leveraging iOS 9 and watchOS 2. There are now 55 apps in the IBM MobileFirst for iOS catalog, and the list of project signings is growing rapidly.
Inside IBM, Macs are gaining tremendous traction. There are currently over 30,000 Macs deployed within the company, with 1,900 more being added each week. IBM tells us that each Mac is saving $270 compared to a traditional PC, thanks to much reduced support costs and better residual value. This is a terrific example of the kind of opportunity our devices offer to improve user experience and create value in the enterprise world.
Our mobility partner program also continues to grow, with more than 25 new partners added in the September quarter, bringing the total to over 65. And we're already seeing some great success stories with this program. We're also very excited about the potential of iPad Pro in the enterprise. For example, with the Bloomberg professional app, more than 325,000 financial professionals would be able to use iPad Pro to gain instant global access to finance and business news, market data and portfolio tracking and trading tools.
Turning to services. We generated $5.1 billion in revenue, an all-time record and an increase of 10% over last year, mainly due to strong growth from apps. The revenue from the App Store increased 25% and the number of transacting customers grew 18%, also setting an all-time record.
Services growth was particularly impressive in China, where Apple App Store revenue grew by 127% year-over-year. The momentum behind the App Store in China has been tremendous, with huge interest from developers and customers alike. Our developer program in China has grown dramatically in the last year with over 1 million members in our program today.
Revenue from other products grew strongly, up 61% over last year, thanks to the growing contribution from Apple Watch. We expanded Apple Watch distribution significantly over the course of the quarter, and it was available at almost 5,000 locations in 32 countries by quarter end.
Our retail and online stores had a very busy quarter. We opened 7 new stores, including our first store in Belgium. That brought us to a global store count of 463, of which 195 are in 15 countries outside the United States. In fiscal '16, we expect to open or replace between 40 and 50 stores, and we continue to place particular emphasis on Greater China where we plan to have 40 stores open by the middle of next year.
Customers have been very interested in the iPhone Upgrade Program offered in our U.S. retail stores. The iPhone Upgrade Program gives customers purchasing a connected device, an easy convenient way to get a new phone every year with low monthly payments to a third-party lender, along with the security and protection of AppleCare+. After making 12 or more installment payments, customers can upgrade to a new iPhone.
Let me also quickly discuss 3 accounting matters: first, relative to the iPhone Upgrade Program that I just mentioned, we will be reducing revenue at the time of sale for the cost associated with the program and deferring the portion of revenue related to AppleCare, software upgrade rights and non-software services for each iPhone sold.
Second, in September, based on an analysis of market offerings, we reduced the estimated selling price of future software upgrade rights and non-software services that we defer for each iOS device and Mac sold. The reduction is between $5 and $10 per unit.
Third, also in September, we lengthened the time period over which the deferred revenue associated to iPads will be recognized from 2 years to 3 years.
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $205.7 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $2.8 billion. $187 billion of this cash or 91% of the total was outside of the United States.
In the September quarter, we issued a total of $5.8 billion of term debt, consisting of GBP 1.25 billion denominated notes, AUD 2.25 billion denominated notes and EUR 2 billion denominated notes. This left us with $56 billion of term debt outstanding at the end of the quarter.
We were very active in the market during the quarter and returned over $17 billion to our investors. We paid $3 billion in dividends and equivalents, and we spent $14 billion to repurchase almost 122 million Apple shares through open market transactions.
We also completed our fifth accelerated share repurchase program in July and retired an additional 10 million shares at settlement. We've now completed over $143 billion of our $200 billion program, including $104 billion in share repurchases, of which $36 billion was repurchased in fiscal 2015 alone.
Now as we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $75.5 billion and $77.5 billion compared to $74.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 39% and 40%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.3 billion and $6.4 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $400 million. And we expect the tax rate to be about 26.2%.
Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.52 per share of common stock payable on November 12, 2015, to shareholders of record as of November 9, 2015.
With that, let us open the call for questions.",1554

You have to consider the constant currency growth rates. And so if you do that, our guidance is actually 8% to 11% because we have about a 700 basis point FX headwind in Q1. And so the growth is actually quite good underneath that, and that's obviously a problem that everyone's struggling with. Sort of zooming out to the more macro question about growth, here's what I see currently. We believe that iPhone will grow in Q1, and we're -- we base that on what we're seeing from a switcher point of view. We've recorded the highest rate on record for Android switchers last quarter at 30%. We also looked at the number of people that have upgraded that were in the installed base prior to iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. And that number is in the low 30 percentages. So we feel like we have a very open field in front of us. Our performance in emerging markets, although it's quite good and our revenue is good, our market share is low, and the LTE penetration in these markets is quite low. Also if I zoom out and look at China, as I've said before and just to make the point once again, is we see an enormous change in China over the next several years. The latest study I've seen from Mackenzie indicates if you look back 5 years, China's middle class had about 50 million people in it. If you look ahead 5 years, it will have 10x that number in it. And so -- and I feel like we're reasonably well positioned in China. I'm sure we can do better, but I think we're doing fairly well there. It's not the only market that we are working on obviously. I was really impressed last quarter with our progress in Vietnam and Indonesia and India, among others. Also from the currencies point of view and the weak global economies, we don't overly focus on this. It's -- my view is it's sort of a transitional kind of thing, and we invest for the long term. So we're continuing to invest for Apple's future. In addition to those, Apple TV is off to a great start. Apple Watch is just getting going. The App Store hit a new record again last quarter and the growth seems to be really great there. I'm really happy with the early days of Apple Music and the people moving from the free trial to the music business. And finally, the enterprise business is not to be underestimated. I doubt very many people knew that we had a $25 billion enterprise business that we've quietly built in not too many years. But our penetration is low, but we have significant actions going on to really deepen that. So sort of everywhere I look, I see significant opportunity. Long answer, but I thought you might be interested.",486

Just as a follow-up on growth, if you look at large services companies Facebook, Amazon, Google, they're all growing over 20%, and it's largely driven by activity of Apple users on iOS devices. Do you feel like there's more that Apple can do to participate in that services growth or you relegated to fundamentals that are tied to device upgrade cycles?",65

It grew 25% last quarter and so we feel very good about that. That's become a sizable business. I would also point out that the -- that some of these upgrade programs that are in the market where -- they sort of begin to look more like a subscription business in terms of the way they operate. And so we think that in the aggregate they may reduce upgrade cycles. And also the iPhone that has been sold to someone else hits a price point that we're not hitting today largely which could help further fuel the services revenue, which we did quite well on last quarter.",115

Eugene Munster,,Analysts,11,"Tim, you just briefly touched on reducing, I guess, the time between upgrades, but how do you think about the iPhone upgrade cycle compressing over the next few years?

And then lastly, Luca, you mentioned some of the accounting changes related to the iPhone Upgrade Program. Any sense in terms of what percentage of the Plus -- the S upgrades were associated with the upgrade program?",92

Our current view is that we do think that the broader upgrade program -- so I'm not just talking about our program that in retail. I mean, that is relatively small compared to our total iPhone sales in the company. But the broader thing obviously is that many of the carriers are offering these plans. And that if you look at them, in the aggregate, we think that it would have a positive impact on replacement cycles. We do like the fact that it creates a market for an iPhone at a different price point as well that is a better product than the customer maybe currently buying, which will further help from an ecosystem point of view, and that's not to be underestimated. It also seems like that from a rollout point of view, there's -- you will see these plans offered in a significant way in the United States already. But in fact, there's -- these plans are being offered in some derivation in over a dozen countries in the world. They're not as pervasive as they are in the U.S., but it seems like we're on the front end of a fairly major trend in the industry.",214

Of course, we deduct also upfront the costs associated with the program essentially to provide interest-free financing, and we need to estimate the fair value of the upgrade option for the customer. But as Tim said, it's a popular program in our U.S. store, but in the scheme of things, it's a small percentage of our worldwide iPhone sales.

I think the investor concern is that Q1 will benefit, at least on a year-over-year basis, from 3 extra weeks of availability in China. And it will also benefit from more of those initial launch days, that only 2 of them were in the September quarter and the remainder will be in the December quarter. And so I guess the investor concern is December is a structurally advantaged quarter in the sense of benefiting from both of those tailwinds on a year-over-year basis. But if we look out beyond December, wouldn't that point to notably lower seasonal growth in the March quarter? And how do we think about the factors affecting unit growth beyond the December quarter? And then I have a follow-up, please.",140

I do think that the sort of the macro things I spoke about earlier, the upgrade programs, the Android switcher rate, the sort of the iPhone momentum in the emerging markets and the LTE penetration in these markets, these trends are not 1 quarter things. These are longer-term things. And so the same -- my same response applies. But I think we'll do quite good in iPhone, I do believe we'll grow this quarter as we put in our guidance. That when you start with a number in the low 30s in terms of the percentage of the installed base that's upgraded that had a phone pre the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, that number is still likely to leave a lot of headroom beyond December. So that's how I look at that. 
In terms of your first comment, you didn't ask me to comment on that. But just to be clear, I would have -- our forecasting doesn't work like you articulated it. I recognize that people can have their own models and so forth, but just to make it clear that I'm not agreeing with your point.",199

And then just on the follow-up. The reported gains from currency hedging in fiscal year '15 were significant, several billion-dollar contribution to the company. And again, this is not an Apple-specific issue, Luca, as you pointed out several times. But how do we think about this notion of currency hedges effectively rolling off and being replaced with hedges that are likely to have less of an impact? How do we think about that impacting the P&L on a go-forward basis, perhaps starting with Q1, but then qualitatively or directionally over the course of the year? And what are some of the kinds of things that you've undertaken or are planning to undertake that can mitigate some of those concerns?",120

I mean, what's going to happen in practice is that we got this portfolio of hedge contracts that over time provides protection to our margins and to our results. But that protection diminishes as we go through the year. And so we should expect that over time, during the course of fiscal '16, that protection will come off, assuming that the dollar stays at current levels. Keep in mind that there are some currencies around the world that where we cannot economically hedge, and so those currencies are a bit excluded from what we're talking about right now. I think my conclusion is that the guidance that we're providing for the first quarter, the 39% to 40%, is actually an incredible level of guidance, given the foreign exchange headwinds that we're dealing with. How do we deal with them? We will continue to hedge. So our program continues on an ongoing basis, and we will continue to provide some level of protection to foreign exchange movements. In some cases, we have realigned prices. Particularly when we launch new products, we tend to do that in a number of countries where the foreign exchange moves are being particularly extreme. And so we tend to recovery that through pricing. And then finally, of course, we are putting in place a number of cost initiatives that will allow us to deal with the foreign exchange situation. So overall, we feel very strong guidance for the first quarter. And beyond the first quarter, as you know, we're not guiding and so we'll see over the course of the year.",274

I know you have a relatively small sales force internally and obviously are utilizing the joint ventures. But as you noted, you see that it's an important driver of growth. So how do you attack that market going forward? Will there be changes? Is this something that you need to shift or focus product in a little bit of a different direction to make sure you can adequately attack it? Just in general, how are you thinking about it?",103

Sort of with every release, there are more enterprise features. And so I would describe it as sort of a continuation of that cadence, perhaps with a little more intensity. From a go-to-market point of view, we will be working with or are working with IBM, with Cisco. We're already working with 75 mobility partners that are principally in the U.S., but that's expanding quickly to international as well. And so many of these companies have, in some cases, very large sales forces, and in many cases, a reasonable size of sales force. And in addition to a direct sales force, there is a huge worldwide indirect channel that many customers buy from and count on buying some services from. And so I don't -- do not envision Apple having a large enterprise sales force. We'll clearly make -- continue adding some people more on the engineering side, but I don't envision having a large direct sales force.",176

And then can you give us some more color on China? 120% year-over-year growth in iPhone. But can you talk in general about what you're seeing in the marketplace and perhaps where you think you are in terms of penetration from a smartphone standpoint, especially with say China Mobile, which has a substantial opportunity to grow, given the LTE penetration?",62

The -- if you look at China, we grew -- from an iPhone point of view, Greater China, we grew 87%. The market grew 4%. If you take iPhone out of the market number, so the market ex- iPhone actually contracted slightly. And so we've been able to grow without the market growing. iPhone 6 was the #1 selling smartphone in Mainland China last quarter and iPhone 6 Plus was #3. And so we did fairly well. The sort of the economic question, which I know there's been a lot of attention on; frankly, if I were to shut off my web and shut off the TV and just look at how many customers are coming in our stores regardless of whether they're buying, how many people are coming online and in addition, looking at our sales trends, I wouldn't know there was any -- there was any economic issue at all in China. And so I don't know how unusual we are with that. I think that there's a misunderstanding probably, particularly in the Western world about China's economy, which contributes to the confusion. That said, I don't think it's growing as fast as it was, but I also don't think that Apple's results are largely dependent on minor changes in growth. I think it's much more of contributing -- I think other things contribute to that much more. That doesn't say we'll never have a problem there because the economy, I'm not saying -- I'm not dumb enough to think that. But I just think that the area that it's currently operating within, it's hard to tell a difference at the consumer level for us. I mean, you really can't tell the difference if you look at it sort of our daily and weekly numbers. So we're very bullish on it. And I would point out that we're investing in China not for next quarter or the quarter after or the quarter after. We're investing for the decades ahead. And as we look at it, our own views is that China will be Apple's top market in the world. And that's not just for sales, that's also -- the developer community is growing faster than in any other country in the world. And so it's -- the ecosystem there is very, very strong. I was very impressed with the number of developers I met last week, and of course, the customers in stores are enthusiastically contagious.",409

In terms of selling to current customers, you indicated about 1/3 of the base has moved to the 6 line. As much as people talk about that being a huge upgrade cycle and what is the 6s have incrementally, 33% is not that big a number. I would have thought it'd be bigger than that. Does this suggest that there's maybe more of a consistency to upgrading than the Street perceives? 
And then on the other side in terms of new customers, just want a clarity on the switcher number. Are you saying that 30% of iPhone shipments in the quarter went to Android switchers to iOS? And do you believe that you could actually have more new customers to Apple in fiscal '16 than you had in fiscal '15?",152

Let me start with Android switcher. What this means is that for customers who purchased an iPhone last quarter and replaced a smartphone, that 30% of those switched from an Android device. And so there would have been some switchers on top of that from other operating systems. But obviously, Android is the largest one by far. And so that's what that means. And that number is the largest that we've ever recorded since we began measuring it 3 or so years ago. And so it's a huge number. We're very, very proud of that number. In terms of 2016 versus 2015 new customers, it's hard to predict. I'm very happy with how we're doing. We're doing better than we've ever been doing. People -- I know there's a fixation on the upgrade rate. When I look at the upgrade rate, Steve, what I see is I feel good that it's a low number because that low number means that there's 69% of the people that are out there prior to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus that haven't bothered to upgrade just yet. That's a large number. And so I see that as opportunity. Do I think it has anything to do -- does it link to consistency? I think part of it is. And I believe that the iPhone upgrade plans that are out there, as I've mentioned before, it seems to me, only the future will tell it is true or not, but it seems to me it's going to act as a catalyst to accelerate some of those upgrades. And I think that's not something that we're going to see this quarter or next quarter, but it seems like it's going to happen beginning a year from now or so. Begins to be -- you've seen the plans. They look more and act more like a subscription than they do like a purchase. And that's great for the customer because many of them want to upgrade on a frequent basis, and they can do this very, very simply. In terms of new, I don't know whether we'll have more new or not. I can tell you that, that's always our objective. We want to add a lot more people to the ecosystem. And certainly, if you look in the emerging markets, even like -- nobody's asking me about iPad on the call. But if you look at iPad as just an example, in China, 68% of the people that purchased an iPad, it was the first tablet they've owned, and 40% of those had never owned any Apple product. Just to go through one product with one set of numbers. I don't want to go through a bunch of numbers because it's competitive data that I don't want to share. But these are things that we're very focused on. And the first-time buyer number is surprisingly strong. And keep in mind that we have a good history of once people buy one Apple product, they have a great experience, they begin to look at other Apple products. And of course, we make sure they all work well together.",527

What we've seen -- in a number of these markets, we've seen that iPhone sales have been very resilient and that's shown in our growth rates. Most recently, we've adjusted some prices around the world for the launch of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. We are -- we feel very positive about the sales trends around the world. It's a bit early to tell because the phones have been out there just for 4 weeks. So it's a bit early to tell there. Obviously, when we increase prices around the world, it's normal to see some impact on sales rates, but so far, we've been very encouraged by the response.",125

We'll actually look at the detail because it's much more important to us to look at by iPhone model by country, what percent is going to a first iPhone buyer, somebody that's never owned an iPhone before. And so if you look at China as an example, it's over 50% of people that bought a 6 and a 6 Plus are -- were buying their first iPhone. As you move down the line, that number goes up. And so a 5s, generally speaking, is higher in most countries. And so that gives you a feel for a very important market and kind of where the numbers are.",151

I guess, first, could you talk about the gross margin dynamics as you go from September to December? The midpoint implies down 40 basis points. I think the last 5 years, that's only happened once, the gross margins have gone down in fiscal Q1. Can you just talk about what the FX dynamic or what are the other headwinds that you think that implied gross margins being down in December?",76

On the positive side, of course, as you mentioned that we will have positive leverage from the higher seasonal volumes. Also what we've seen over the last several quarters is a commodity environment that has been quite favorable, and we expect it to remain favorable during the December quarter. On the other hand, of course, we are launching a lot of new products. We've launched some during -- in September. We are launching some now. And every time we launch new products, we make them better, we add features and new technology. And these products, when we launch them, tend to have higher cost structures than the products that they replace. We have a very good track record over time to reduce those cost structures, but every time we introduce a new product there is a headwind at the beginning of the cycle for gross margin. What is different from a year ago, very significantly is the foreign exchange impact that we mentioned before. It remains a very significant headwind. As I mentioned earlier to Toni, I believe we're dealing with that through a combination of hedging, price realignments, cost initiatives. But on a net basis, foreign exchange will clearly be a sequential headwind.",220
