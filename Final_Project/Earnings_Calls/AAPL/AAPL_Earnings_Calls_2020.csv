We're thrilled to report Apple's biggest quarter ever, which set new all-time records in both revenue and earnings. We generated revenue of $91.8 billion, which is above the high end of our guidance range, with revenue growth accelerating for the third consecutive quarter. Geographically, we set all-time records in the Americas, Europe and rest of Asia Pacific and saw Greater China return to growth. 
Our record performance was fueled by iPhone, where December quarter revenue was up 8% year-over-year and by our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth outside of iPhone including a new all-time record for Services and another blowout quarter for Wearables. Our active installed base of devices has now surpassed 1.5 billion, up over 100 million in the last 12 months alone, reaching a new all-time high for each of our main product categories and geographic segments. Not only is our large and growing installed base a powerful testament to the satisfaction, engagement and loyalty of our customers but it's also fueling our growth across the board, particularly in Services. 
Let's take each category one by one. On iPhone, revenue in the December quarter was $56 billion. Again, that's up 8% over a year ago, thanks to the exceptional demand for the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max. In fact, iPhone 11 was our top-selling model every week during the December quarter, and the 3 new models were our 3 most popular iPhones. We had double-digit growth in many developed markets, including the U.S., the U.K., France and Singapore and also grew double digits in emerging markets, led by strong performances in Brazil, Mainland China, India, Thailand and Turkey. These new models are, by far, the best iPhones we've ever shipped with advanced technologies, an unprecedented leap in battery life to easily get through the day and a best-in-class camera experience. We have been wowed with the photos customers have shared in our all-new Night mode photo challenge this month. 
Turning to Services. Q1 revenue reached $12.7 billion, an all-time record, growing 17% over last year. Once again, we saw double-digit growth in all 5 of our geographic segments and established new all-time records for multiple categories including cloud services, music, payment services and our App Store search ad business as well as setting a December quarter record for the App Store and AppleCare. 2019 was a historic year for our Services business, and I'd like to touch on some highlights. 
For the App Store, 2020 started off strong with customer spending a new single-day record $386 million on New Year's Day alone, a 20% increase over last year. Apple Arcade, our new game subscription service, has been fast off the blocks with a catalog of over 100 new and exclusive games you won't find anywhere else, all playable across Apple devices with new games and expansions added every month. 
Apple TV+ is off to a rousing start, and I want to congratulate the entire team at The Morning Show for their multiple Golden Globe nominations: Jennifer Aniston on her Screen Actors Guild award; and Billy Crudup on his Critics' Choice Award. We continue to focus on telling stories that matter like Little America, which recently premiered to widespread critical acclaim with much more great content still to come. 
Apple News now draws over 100 million monthly active users in the U.S., U.K., Australia and Canada and provides a curated and personalized experience using on-device intelligence to recommend stories. Apple News+ continues to add new titles, offering subscribers seamless access to the world's top publications across all of their devices. 
For Apple Pay, revenue and transactions more than doubled year-over-year with a run rate exceeding 15 billion transactions a year. Apple Pay transit support expanded with customers paying for journeys on Transport for London more easily with Apple Pay Express Transit. And in spring of 2020, iPhone and Apple Watch customers will be able to simply tap to ride trains and buses in even more cities, including Shenzhen and Guangzhou. 
We are thrilled with the continued growth of Apple Card, and last month, customers began using Apple Card monthly installments at Apple retail and online to purchase new iPhones and pay for them over 24 months. We see great promise for these recently launched services, and we're optimistic about what we've got in the pipeline for each of them. 
Now turning to Wearables. We had another incredible quarter, setting an all-time record in virtually every market we track around the world, and this product category is now the size of a Fortune 150 company. Demand for AirPods continues to be phenomenal, particularly for our recently launched AirPods Pro, our new addition to the AirPods family that features active noise cancellation. 
Apple Watch had a great start to fiscal 2020, setting an all-time revenue record during the quarter. It continues to have a profound impact on our customers' lives, and it continues to further its reach as over 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter were new to Apple Watch. Both AirPods and Apple Watch were must-have holiday gifts, helping drive unprecedented results for the category even as we face supply constraints for Apple Watch Series 3 and AirPods Pro. 
Mac and iPad generated $7.2 billion and $6 billion in revenue, respectively, and the high level of customer satisfaction and loyalty for both products drove the active installed base of both Mac and iPad to new records in all geographic segments. For iPad, we saw growth in key emerging markets like Mexico, India, Turkey, Poland, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. With our current lineup of iPad Pro, iPad Air, iPad mini and iPad, along with the new iPadOS, we give customers an unparalleled tablet experience integrating hardware, software and services in a way that only Apple can. 
This was also a very exciting quarter for the Mac as we launched our most powerful notebook ever, the 16-inch MacBook Pro as well as Mac Pro and Pro Display XDR, the most powerful tools Apple has ever put in the hands of pros. And we've already seen a strong response from the pro community from developers, photographers and music producers to filmmakers and scientists who rely on the Mac to create their life's best work. 
We also want to take a moment to congratulate all the Grammy-winning and nominated artists this past weekend, who rely on Logic Pro X and their Mac to create incredible music we all love. I want to call out and celebrate the exceptional work of our retail and online teams. This quarter, we opened a beautiful new store in Kawasaki, Japan, and exciting things are taking place inside each and every store. Thanks in part to a doubling in iPhone trade-ins versus last year, our retail and online stores set an all-time record and delivered strong double-digit growth in iPhone. We see a very bright future for these efforts, and we continue to innovate to ensure that everyone who visits an Apple retail location has a great experience. 
We began 2020 with our greatest product lineup ever, and we are only deepening our commitment to do our part to make the world a better place. In November, we released a completely redesigned Everyone Can Code curriculum to help introduce more elementary and middle school students to the world of coding. The new curriculum includes even more resources for teachers, a brand-new guide for students and updated Swift Coding Club materials. Today, millions of students in more than 5,000 schools worldwide use Everyone Can Code curriculum to bring their ideas to life and develop important skills, including creativity, collaboration and problem-solving. 
November also saw the launch of our new Research app, the latest in our ongoing effort to put the future of health in the hands of every user. Customers in the U.S. can enroll in 3 landmark multiyear health studies that we're undertaking with leading academic and research institutions: the Apple Women's Health Study, the Apple Heart and Movement Study and the Apple Hearing Study. As in everything we do, we built user privacy into the Research app from the ground up. 
This quarter, we also announced a $2.5 billion plan to help address the housing availability and affording crisis in our home state of California. We feel a great responsibility to help the region we have always called home stay vibrant and to ensure that it remains a great place for everyone to live and raise a family, including those who do so much to serve the community like firefighters and teachers. 
In much more recent news, we're closely following the development of the coronavirus. We're donating to groups that are working to contain the outbreak. We are working closely with our Apple team members and partners in the affected areas, and our thoughts are with all of those affected across the region. 
As we close the books on a record-breaking December quarter, we are already well underway on some new and exciting developments for the future. Apple's strength will always be its balanced creativity and innovation, and this year will be no different. 
But for now, for more details on the results, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca.",1549
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2020",2020-01-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3413.0,1895808.0,74280809.0,Presenter Speech,Luca Maestri,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. 
Our business and financial performance in the December quarter were exceptional as we set new all-time records for revenue, net income and earnings per share. Revenue for the quarter was $91.8 billion, up $7.5 billion or 9% from a year ago in spite of a $1 billion headwind from foreign exchange. 
Geographically, we established all-time revenue records in many major developed and emerging markets, including, among others, the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Brazil, the U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Poland, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam. Products revenue was $79.1 billion, up 8% as iPhone returned to growth, and we had incredibly strong results in Wearables, where we set all-time records for both Apple Watch and AirPods. 
Services revenue grew 17% to a new all-time record $12.7 billion with double-digit growth in every geographic segment and new all-time records across our portfolio. Company gross margin was 38.4%, up 40 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage from higher revenue in spite of a negative 60 basis point impact from foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 34.2%, up 260 basis points sequentially, thanks to leverage and favorable mix. Services gross margin was 64.4%, up 30 basis points sequentially, driven by favorable mix. 
Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 14.2%. Before discrete items, the rate was 16.5%, exactly in line with our guidance. A favorable onetime item impacted the rate by 230 basis points. Net income was an all-time record at $22.2 billion, up $2.3 billion or 11% over last year. Diluted EPS was also an all-time record at $4.99, up 19%, and operating cash flow was a very strong $30.5 billion, an improvement of $3.8 billion over a year ago. 
Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue of $56 billion grew 8% year-over-year as we saw great customer response to the launch of our newest iPhones. We set all-time revenue records in several countries, including the U.S., Mexico, the U.K., France, Spain, Poland, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam. Our active installed base of iPhones has reached an all-time high and is growing in each of our geographic segments. In the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max combined. Among business buyers planning to purchase smartphones in the next quarter, 84% plan to purchase iPhones. 
Turning to Services. We set an all-time revenue record of $12.7 billion with double-digit growth in all of our 5 geographic segments. As Tim mentioned, we established new all-time records for Apple Music, cloud services, payment services and our App Store search ad business and December quarter records for the App Store and AppleCare. We are well on our way to accomplishing our goal of doubling our fiscal year '16 services revenue during 2020. We've actually already reached that goal on a run rate basis with the results of the December quarter. 
Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow, and the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high, with paid accounts growing double digits in all of our geographic segments. We now have over 480 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 120 million from a year ago. And at this point, we expect to hit our goal of surpassing the 500 million mark already during the March quarter. Given the tremendous momentum we are experiencing across our Services offerings, we are increasing our target for paid subscriptions and aim to reach 600 million before the end of calendar 2020. 
App Store revenue grew strong double digits, thanks to robust customer demand for both in-app purchases and subscriptions. Our third-party subscription business grew across multiple categories and increased almost 40% year-over-year. Our first-party subscription services also continued to perform extremely well. Apple Music set an all-time revenue record, offering a catalog of over 60 million songs to our customers. iCloud also generated an all-time revenue record, growing very strong double digits while offering our customers a safe, secure and seamless experience across all their devices. 
It was a December quarter record for AppleCare, thanks to strong service agreement attach rates and expanded distribution. Many of our partners have come to appreciate the strength of the AppleCare brand and our ability to deliver the very best service and support in the world. That value resonates with both our partners and our customers, and we're very happy to see that quality of experience delivered to more and more of our users. 
Next, I'd like to talk about Mac and iPad. Mac revenue was $7.2 billion and iPad revenue was $6 billion. Both products had a difficult year-over-year comparison due to the launches of MacBook Air, Mac mini and iPad Pro during the December quarter a year ago and the subsequent channel fill. Despite the tough compare, on a demand basis, our performance for both Mac and iPad was around even to last year. Importantly, around half of the customers purchasing Macs and iPads around the world during the quarter were new to that product, and the active installed base for both Mac and iPad reached a new all-time high. 
The most recent surveys from 451 Research measured a 93% customer satisfaction rating for iPad from consumers and 92% from businesses. And among both consumers and businesses who are planning to purchase tablets in the March quarter, 78% plan to purchase iPads. 
Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new all-time record with revenue of $10 billion, up 37% year-over-year, with very strong double-digit performance across all 5 geographic segments and growth across Wearables, Accessories and Home. We set all-time records for Wearables in virtually every market we track even as we experienced some product shortages due to very strong customer demand for both Apple Watch and AirPods during the quarter. 
We also continue to see strong demand for our products in the enterprise market as our technology solutions enable businesses to do their best work. 100% of Fortune 500 companies in the health care sector use Apple technology in areas such as patient experience, clinical communications and nursing workflows. And we're also seeing smaller companies in this sector drive innovation with our technology and apps. 
One example is Gauss Surgical, which uses Core ML in iOS to more accurately estimate blood loss during childbirth and surgery. This helps clinicians have more complete and timely information on whether a patient needs an intervention, which can impact both clinical outcomes and costs. 
Another example is Butterfly Network, a medical imaging company which makes a handheld ultrasound device that connects to iPhone or iPad to enable clinicians to take an ultrasound anywhere at a cost that is dramatically lower than other solutions on the market today. 
Let me now turn to our cash positions. We ended the quarter with $207 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We issued a 2 billion euro-denominated green bond, retired $1 billion of maturing debt and reduced commercial paper by $1 billion during the quarter, leaving us with total debt of $108 billion. As a result, net cash was $99 billion at the end of the quarter, and we maintain our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time. 
We returned nearly $25 billion to shareholders during the December quarter. We began a $10 billion accelerated share repurchase program in November, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 30.4 million shares. We also repurchased 40 million Apple shares for $10 billion through open market transactions, and we paid $3.5 billion in dividends and equivalents. As we have done for the last several years, we will share our plans for the next phase of our capital return program when we report results for the March quarter. 
Finally, as we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $63 billion and $67 billion. The wider-than-usual revenue range comprehends uncertainty related to the recently unfolding public health situation in China. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 39%. We expect OpEx to be between $9.6 billion and $9.7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $250 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 16.5%. 
Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.77 per share of common stock payable on February 13, 2020, to shareholders of record as of February 10, 2020. 
With that, let's open the call to questions.",1438

On Wearables, fairly impressive to see it's already a $10 billion business for you guys. Can you just touch on the growth that you see on the Wearables side? How much of the growth do you think is coming from first-time buyers of AirPods or Apple Watch versus folks that seem to be just upgrading the products that they have? Because it looks to us adoption rates are fairly low in your installed base so there should be a long runway, but love to just understand how you see the growth divided between those 2 buckets.",102

If you look at the Apple -- or the Wearables as a category within the Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue, Wearables grew 44%, so it was very strong, as you say. The -- both Apple Watch and AirPods did very well in terms of collecting new customers. Apple Watch, in particular, 75% of the customers are new to the Apple Watch, and so it's still very much selling to new customers at this point.",78

And I guess, Luca, if you could just touch on gross margins. The March quarter guide, I think, implies gross margins are flat to actually up 10, 15 basis points. It's rare for you guys to actually guide gross margins up in March, I think, because you have a fairly high seasonal sales deleverage happening. So what are the offsets that's enabling what looks like a better-than-seasonal guide for gross margins?",72

It's about flat sequentially and, by the way, significantly higher on a year-over-year basis. But on a sequential basis, you're right. On one side, we got the loss of leverage from the usual seasonality, but we expect that, that loss of leverage will be offset by better mix and cost savings.",55

We are primarily measuring ourselves on the number of subscribers. As you can tell from the way that we launched the product, we started with a very aggressive price at $4.99. And in addition to that, we have our bundle, where if you buy pretty much any device, you're getting a year for free, and so we're very focused on subscribers. That said, our -- the product itself is about storytelling. And we think if we do that well, then we'll find that there will be some number of those that will also be critically acclaimed and we're seeing that with The Morning Show. We're seeing that with Little America and others.",115

In terms of China, the results from last quarter and then I'll get into the coronavirus second. For the results from last quarter, we had double-digit growth for iPhone in Mainland China, so that was an important change from where we had been running. We also had double-digit growth in Services in Mainland China, and we had extremely strong double-digit on Wearables. And so really, there were a number of different factors. 
In terms of the things that customers are responding to, iPhone 11 is doing particularly well there. The product has been very well received with its battery life, and the camera is unbelievable. We also, as you probably know, have certain trade-in programs going and financing programs. These have also been well-received. And so it's sort of the sum of all of this, and we're attracting quite a large percentage of new customers on products like the Mac. 3/4 of the customers buying a Mac in China are new, and nearly 2/3 of the customers buying iPad are new. And so it was a terrific quarter. We had 3 of the top 4 selling smartphones in urban China according to Kantar. 
In terms of the coronavirus, as I mentioned earlier, first and foremost, our thoughts are with all of those that are affected across the region. And as I've mentioned, we're donating to groups that are working to contain the outbreak. We're also working very closely with our team and our partners in the affected areas, and we have limited travel to business-critical situations as of last week. The situation is emerging, and we're still gathering lots of data points and monitoring it very closely. As Luca had mentioned, we have a wider-than-usual revenue range for the second quarter due to the greater uncertainty. 
I'll talk about supply chain and customer demand some to give you some color. With respect to the supply chain, we do have some suppliers in the Wuhan area. All of these suppliers, there are alternate sources, and we're obviously working on mitigation plans to make up any expected production loss. We factored our best thinking in the guidance that we provided you. 
With respect to supply sources that are outside the Wuhan area, the impact is less clear at this time. The reopening of those factories after Chinese New Year has been moved from the end of this month to February 10, depending upon the supplier location. And we've attempted to account for this delayed start-up through our larger range of outcomes that Luca mentioned earlier. 
With respect to customer demand and sales, we've currently closed 1 of our retail stores, and a number of channel partners have also closed their storefronts. Many of the stores that remain open have also reduced operating hours. We're taking additional precautions and frequently deep cleaning our stores as well as conducting temperature checks for employees.

As I said earlier to the question around the gross margin guidance for the March quarter, we are seeing a benign commodity environment.

The 17% during the December quarter, we look at it against our fiscal year '19 growth rate, which was 16%, so we feel very good about the results for the December quarter. As Tim and I mentioned during our prepared remarks, it was a very broad-based growth because we grew double digits in Services across all the 5 geographies. We set all-time records for many, many categories, music, cloud, search ads, payment services, December records for the App Store and AppleCare.
If you remember, we had set 2 goals for ourselves in the Services segment. First, we set a goal to double our fiscal '16 revenue during 2020, and when we look at it on a run rate basis, we've already achieved that goal with the results for the December quarter. We also set a goal to pass 500 million paid subscriptions during 2020. And given that we are already at 480 million at the end of December, we expect to pass that mark during the March quarter. And so now we are setting a new target for ourselves for paid subscriptions. And so we are now aiming to reach 600 million before the end of calendar 2020. 
So we feel that the Services business is growing incredibly well. Of course, we have launched new services very recently. For example, Apple TV+ just launched in November. And so while these services did not have a material impact in our December quarter results, we expect that over time, these are contributing to the growth of the Services business. But we feel very happy with the 17%.",274

And Luca, can you just clarify if the Services revenue this quarter had any impact of deferrals associated with TV+ at all? And how can you help us maybe size the impact of the amortization of the content cost associated with TV+ as we think about the next couple of years?",52
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2020",2020-01-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3413.0,1895808.0,74280844.0,Answer,Luca Maestri,,Executives,38,"Yes. So yes, of course, we launched the service, and so there was a very small contribution to revenue from the deferral. And there was also a contribution to revenue from the people, the subscribers that are actually paying for the service. When you think about what goes into the Apple TV+ revenue, at this point, there are 2 components: the paid subscribers, these are the customers that pay for the service and we recognize revenue over the subscription period; and then we've got the what we call the Apple TV+ bundle subscribers, these are the customers that buy an eligible hardware device and redeem the offer for a free year of TV+ services. We defer revenue for this offer based on 3 items. The first one is the value of the service that is being provided, the 1-year of Apple TV+. The second one is the number of customers that are eligible for the offer, and the third one is our estimate of the expected number of customers that will redeem the offer. So you need to keep in mind that from our total eligible device sales, you need to make a number of reductions for family sharing, for multiple device purchases and for geographic availability. Also the take rate can also be impacted by the availability of local content, and we also require a payment method on file. So this estimate is reviewed quarterly and gets updated based on actual trends of the offer. 
And so these inputs provide us with the amount of revenue that we defer for each device sale that then gets recognized over the 1-year period that the TV+ service is provided. And so when you take the combination of pay subscribers and bundled subscribers, you get the Apple TV+ revenue. Of course, because we launched the service very recently, the amount of revenue that we recognized during the quarter was immaterial to our results. 
With regard to the cost of the service, of developing the content, we -- essentially, as we incur these costs, we put them on the balance sheet, and then we amortize them over a certain period of time depending on the type of content that we produce.",368

But at the same time, it looks like you guys have proven that there is a market for low-cost geographies with phones like iPhone SE.

I think we felt good about our OpEx results because they were at the low end of our guidance range. But clearly, we want to make all the necessary investments in the business. And from -- in terms of the new services, not only for TV+ but all the new services that we launched during 2019, this is a period where we're making the necessary investments in advertising and marketing, and that level of investment is reflected in our OpEx results. 
And also, as you correctly stated, we completed the acquisition of the Intel baseband business during the December quarter. And so we had -- we reflected the run rate of the expenses related to that business partially during the quarter after the completion of the transaction. And we -- that is a very important core technology for the company, so we will continue to make all the necessary investments also there. There is a third category of expenses that affected the December quarter and is the fact that our revenue was very strong, and we have certain variable expenses, for example, credit card fees that are associated with higher volume and, of course, impacted our OpEx results.",199

This is the reason I'm so excited about it, is you rarely have a new technology where business and consumer are both -- most see it as key to them. And so I think it's -- the answer is that that's the reason that I think it's going to pervade your life, is because it's going to go across both business and your home life. And I think these things will happen in parallel. There are already companies that are deep into the enterprise business that are working on applications for the enterprise.

I think that the mix helped us both in Q1, and it's helping us with the guidance for Q2. And as you said, some of it is mix of iPhones.

And so certainly, better mix within iPhone. 
The other point that I'd like to point out is that as we move from Q1 to Q2, the proportion of revenue coming from Services increases versus the holiday quarter. And given the fact that Services are accretive to gross margin for the company, we end up getting a better mix from Services as well.",130

There are years when our OpEx grows faster than our revenue, but we've also had years in the recent past where the opposite has happened. We continue to believe that we have a lot of great opportunities in front of us. And just if you look at this past year, we launched many new initiatives, for example, on the Services front, which we want to support with the appropriate level of investment, not only marketing and advertising but also in R&D. 
As I mentioned earlier, we closed the acquisition of the Intel baseband business because we think it's a very important strategic core technology for the company going forward. And I think from the results that you've seen during this quarter and the guidance that we provided during -- for the March quarter, I think we're doing a pretty good job at balancing the level of investments that we are making on the expense front with the level of returns that we get, both in terms of revenue and in terms of profitability that we're getting.

So Japan was down 10% during the December quarter, was primarily due to iPhone performance, which was challenged because there were some regulatory changes that took effect on the 1st of October, where essentially, the regulators decoupled the mobile phone pricing from the 2-year contracts and are capping the maximum amount of carrier discounts that can be made. At the same time, I would say, within a more difficult macro environment, iPhone did incredibly well during the quarter. 6 of the top 7 selling smartphone models in Japan during the December quarter were iPhones. So it was a very strong performance by iPhone in a difficult environment. 
Also, in Japan, we had very strong double-digit growth from Services, stronger than company average, and very strong double-digit growth in Wearables, also stronger than company average. So we feel very good. Japan is a country where it's starting to -- we've had great success. The customers are very loyal and very engaged, and we have a very strong position there, and we feel we have a very good momentum.",178

Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I hope you're staying safe and well. Today, Apple reports $58.3 billion in revenue, an all-time record for Services and a quarterly record for Wearables, Home and Accessories. It was also a quarterly revenue record for Apple retail powered by phenomenal growth in our online store. Amid the most challenging global environment in which we've ever operated our business, we're proud to say that Apple grew during the quarter.
But before we dive more deeply into the numbers, I want to speak just for a bit on COVID-19. This is something Apple has been contending with since January, and I think that how we have responded, what we have been inspired to do tells an important story about Apple's great durability as a business and the enduring importance of our products in our customers' lives. It also speaks to Apple's unmatched capacity to be creative, to think always in terms of the long term and to forge ahead when others may feel an instinct to pull back.
Before COVID-19 was on the horizon, we anticipated that Q2 was going to be a prolific and energetic period for Apple. And when the pandemic did strike, our teams not only succeeded in growing the business, in introducing powerful new products and in meeting our customers' needs, but they also rose to the occasion in terms of meeting our broader obligations to the communities in which we live and work.
Let's look quickly across the business. At the same time that they were leaving no stone unturned to get our latest generation of devices manufactured and into our customers' hands, our worldwide network of supply chain partners, logistics and operations folks in every part of the company were also sourcing more than 30 million masks for frontline medical workers, ensuring they're donated to places of greatest need in every region around the world. While our product teams were preparing to launch a new iPad Pro, Magic Keyboard, Macbook Air and the new iPhone SE, all of which have been very well received by reviewers and consumers alike, they were also working with our suppliers to design, test, manufacture and distribute more than 7.5 million face shields, and we continue to ship more than 1 million of these every week to the doctors, nurses and medical personnel on the front lines.
In a quarter where our Services teams achieved strong growth, which Luca will dig into in a minute and which speaks to the real durability of our Services strategy, these teams were also putting COVID-19 front and center. As Apple News reached 125 million monthly active users, we elevated trusted information from reliable sources through a special COVID-19 vertical. We let customers skip payments without incurring interest on Apple Card for March and April in light of financial hardship for many families. We worked with everyone from Oprah to Lady Gaga to inform, entertain and give back through Apple TV. And Services like FaceTime and Messages set new all-time records for daily volume during this quarter as users rely on their devices to stay connected in a new reality.
In software, at the same time that our teams worked with great creativity and excitement as we prepared to deliver our first ever all-online Worldwide Developers Conference later this quarter, they also worked with the same creativity and speed to put together our COVID-19 symptom checking website and app in partnership with the CDC. As of today, the app has been installed nearly 2 million times, and the web tool has received over 3 million unique visits. And just this month, to accelerate contact tracing, we are launching a joint effort with Google to enable the use of Bluetooth technology to help governments and health agencies spread the -- reduce the spread of the virus with user privacy and security central to the design.
We paired these programmatic efforts with a broader strategy to give back where it's needed most. We've made major corporate donations to response efforts around the world to support Global Citizen as well as a new fund for Americans experiencing food and security as a result of the crisis. When you tally these things up and consider our ongoing 2:1 match for employee donations, Apple's contributions to the global response are significant, diverse and a great source of pride for the whole team.
We're also doing what we can to help our employees, their families and, by extension, their communities stay safe and well by modifying our operations where appropriate. This extends, of course, to our retail employees. They are Apple's face to our customers and an instrumental part of our business, and we're compensating them normally despite store closures. During a quarter where circumstances evolve by the hour, we have been gratified by the resilience and adaptability of our global supply chain. While we felt some temporary supply constraints in February, our operations team, suppliers and manufacturing partners have been safely returning to work, and production was back at typical levels toward the end of March.
At this time of social distance, of shuttered schools and gathering places, of delayed plans and new ways of socializing, we have seen significant evidence that our products have taken a renewed importance for customers. Teachers and students around the world are relying on our technology to teach, learn and stay connected with each other. We are in the process of deploying major orders of iPads to school systems working to keep learning going strong at a distance, including tens of thousands in Ontario, Canada; Glasgow, Scotland; and Puerto Rico; 100,000 to the city of Los Angeles; and 350,000 to New York City, our largest educational iPad deployment ever.
Since early March, we've seen unprecedented demand for our Pro apps from students, enthusiasts and creative professionals. These folks are keeping us all entertained and inspired as we stay at home, and to help them do it, we made Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro X available for free for 90 days for everyone. And the reaction has been overwhelming, driving software downloads and usage to record levels.
And doctors and medical professionals are making even greater use of Apple Watch and other health features to communicate with patients and to treat them safely from a distance when necessary. With new FDA guidance on noninvasive remote patient monitoring, for example, the ECG app on Apple Watch is increasingly being used to facilitate remote ECG measurements and recordings for telemedicine usage, reducing patient and health care provider contact and exposure. Many hospitals, such as Geisinger Health System, NYU Langone Health and Stanford Health Care are using apps on iPad and iPhone to support communication and video conferences between hospitalized patients and their care teams. This enables the care teams to keep a close watch on patients without entering isolation rooms, which helps to minimize exposure and reduces some of the need for personal protective equipment.
Now when you step back and tally all this up, when you consider all the ways COVID-19 has touched Apple, our customers and the way we work, this may not have been the quarter it could have been absent this pandemic, but I don't think I can recall a quarter where I've been prouder of what we do or how we do it. As I said at the outset, we achieved revenue of $58.3 billion, and underneath that was product revenue of $45 billion. The performance of our product business had 3 very different phases during the March quarter. Based on Apple's performance during the first 5 weeks of the quarter, we were confident we were headed toward a record second quarter at the very high end of our expectations.
In the next 5 weeks of the quarter, as COVID-19 started impacting China, iPhone supply was temporarily affected as well as demand for our products within China. This caused us to withdraw our revenue guidance in February. At that point, demand for our products outside of China was still strong and in line with our expectations. During the last 3 weeks of the quarter, as the virus spread globally and social distancing measures were put in place worldwide, including the closure of all our retail stores outside of Greater China on March 13 and many channel partner points of sales around the world, we saw downward pressure on demand, particularly for iPhone and Wearables.
Given the lack of visibility and certainty in the near term, we will not be issuing guidance for the coming quarter. Over the long term though, we have a high degree of confidence in the enduring strength of our business. Our global supply chain is profoundly durable and resilient. We have shown the consistent ability to meet and manage temporary supply challenges like those caused by COVID-19. We have continued to deliver innovative new products across multiple categories that appeal to a broad cross-section of customers, including the all-new iPhone SE, which achieved unmatched technological capacity at an incredible value.
Our teams worldwide have tackled the complexities of this moment with unmatched creativity, good humor and dedication to our customers. For a company whose business is innovation, there are real upsides in periodically having to figure out how to do just about everything in a brand-new way. Our long-running investment in our Services strategy is succeeding. This business is growing and is a reflection of our enduring, large and growing installed base. We expect to meet our long-standing goal of doubling our fiscal 2016 Services revenue in 2020.
We have always run Apple for the long term. We entered this period with unmatched financial strength, a robust cash position and our best product pipeline ever. Major investments, including our 5-year commitment to contribute $350 billion to the economy here in the United States, are moving forward full speed ahead. It's in these moments that we set ourselves apart. We've always managed through difficult moments by doubling down and investing in the next generation of innovation, and that's our strategy today.
And so while we can't say for sure how many chapters are in this book, we can have confidence that the ending will be a good one. Apple will continue to do everything we can do to help the global response and to keep our customers learning, creating, sharing and connecting so that life can remain as normal as it can during this challenging time.
With that, I'll hand things off to Luca.",1748
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",2020-04-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3432.0,2024258.0,79195047.0,Presenter Speech,Luca Maestri,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. It has been a very different quarter than we were expecting when we last talked to you at the end of January. But we could not be more proud of our Apple teams around the world, our role in supporting local communities and our partners throughout the value chain and how resilient our business and financial performance has been during these challenging times.
Total revenue for the quarter was $58.3 billion, up 1% from a year ago despite the extreme circumstances from the impact of COVID-19 and a headwind of 100 basis points from foreign exchange. Products revenue was $45 billion, down 3%. After a very strong January, our performance was impacted, particularly during the last 3 weeks of the quarter when lockdowns and point-of-sale closures increased due to COVID-19 spreading around the world and affected our product sales. However, on a demand basis, our performance was stronger than our reported results as we reduced iPhone channel inventory more than we did a year ago. Importantly, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high in all of our geographic segments and all major product categories.
Services revenue followed a different trend with very strong year-over-year growth of 17%. We set a new all-time revenue record of $13.3 billion with all-time records in many of our Services categories and in most countries we track. I'll provide more details on this later.
Company gross margin was 38.4%, flat sequentially with cost savings, a mix shift towards Services offset by the seasonal loss of leverage. Products gross margin was 30.3%, decreasing 380 basis points sequentially due to loss of leverage and unfavorable mix. This drop was more pronounced than under normal circumstances due to the COVID-19 impact I mentioned earlier.
Services gross margin was 65.4%, up 100 basis points sequentially driven by favorable mix. Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 14.4%. This was lower than our 16.5% guidance due to onetime discrete items. Net income was $11.2 billion and earnings per share were $2.55, up 4%. Operating cash flow was very strong at $13.3 billion, an improvement of $2.2 billion over a year ago.
Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue of $29 billion declined 7% year-over-year as both iPhone supply and demand were affected by the impact of COVID-19 at some point during the quarter. On the supply side, we suffered from some temporary supply shortages during February, but we've been extremely pleased with the resilience and adaptability of our global supply chain as well as its ability to get people back to work safely when circumstances allow.
Our operations team and manufacturing partners put forth an extraordinary effort to restore production quickly, and we exited the quarter in a good supply position for most of our product lines. On the demand side, after a very strong first 5 weeks, we saw the impact of COVID-19 affect demand in China for the next 5 weeks and then more broadly around the world for the last 3 weeks of the quarter when lockdowns and point-of-sale closures became more widespread in many countries.
While we did see a slight elongation in our replacement cycle towards the end of the quarter, which we attribute to the widespread point-of-sale closures, our active installed base of iPhones has reached an all-time high. This speaks to the quality of our products and strength of our ecosystem. In fact, in the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max combined.
Turning to Services. We set an all-time revenue record of $13.3 billion. We had strong performance across the board with all-time revenue records in the App Store, Apple Music, video, cloud services and our App Store Search Ad business. And we also set a March quarter record for Apple Care. Our new services, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+ and Apple Card, continue to add users, content and features while contributing to overall Services growth. As Tim mentioned, we're well on our way to accomplishing our goal of doubling our fiscal '16 Services revenue during 2020.
App Store revenue grew by strong double digits thanks to robust customer demand for both in-app purchases and subscriptions. Our third-party subscription business grew across multiple categories and increased over 30% year-over-year, reaching a new all-time high. Our first-party subscription services also continued to perform very well. Apple Music and cloud services both set all-time revenue records and Apple Care set a March quarter record. Paid subscriptions for all 3 of these services were up strong double digits.
Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow strongly, and the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the March quarter. In particular, the number of paid accounts increased double digits in all of our geographic segments. We now have over 515 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 125 million from a year ago. On a sequential basis, paid subscriptions grew by over 35 million. This is the highest sequential growth we have ever experienced. With this momentum, we are confident we will reach our increased target of 600 million paid subscriptions before the end of calendar 2020.
Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new March quarter record with revenue of $6.3 billion, up 23% year-over-year with strong double-digit performance across all 5 geographic segments. Our Wearables business is now the size of a Fortune 140 company, and we're very excited by the many opportunities in front of us for this product category. For example, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach at over 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch around the world during the quarter were new to the product.
Next, I'd like to talk about Mac and iPad. Mac revenue was $5.4 billion. iPad revenue was $4.4 billion. Towards the end of the quarter, we launched a brand-new iPad Pro that includes a first-in-class LiDAR scanner with some really exciting augmented reality applications and MacBook Air with significantly improved performance at a lower price. We're very pleased with the strong customer interest for both products.
Importantly, around half of the customers purchasing Macs and iPads around the world during the quarter were new to that product, and the active installed base for both Mac and iPad reached a new all-time high. And the most recent surveys of consumers from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 95% for iPad and 96% for Mac.
In the enterprise market, businesses everywhere have been making the transition to working remotely. We've created content to assist our customers in this transition, including an on-demand video learning series focused on topics like remote deployments of iPads and Macs and security. We have also realigned our own retail business and enterprise teams to provide timely and relevant support to customers as they navigate new work environments. Some of our largest customers offering Mac to employees, such as IBM and SAP, have been able to pivot quickly to allow employees to easily set up and secure their devices from home, benefiting from Apple Business Manager and zero-touch deployment. And we've seen countless examples of new projects and remote deployments implemented in just a few hours. Peloton, for instance, worked with our New York teams to deploy an entire fleet of Macs overnight so their team could work remotely.
In essential sectors such as grocery and financial services, we're seeing organizations adopt our technology to better serve their customers safely. Leading grocers around the world like Trader Joe's, Woolworths, Lawson, Sainsbury's, Lidl and Carrefour offer Apple Pay so customers can use contactless payments, and a store shift to become fulfillment centers for online orders, organizations are leveraging apps for remote shoppers and food delivery to reduce foot traffic.
In banking, where safety and security is a top priority, one way to protect company and client information is by providing corporate iOS devices to employees who use mobile phones daily as part of their jobs. As an example, Bank of America is purchasing tens of thousands of additional iOS devices for their workforce.
Let me now turn to our cash position. First, I want to note that liquidity has not been an issue for us during these highly unusual financial market conditions. We have an extraordinarily strong balance sheet, very deep access to capital markets and unmatched free cash flow generation. We ended the quarter with $193 billion in cash plus marketable securities, total debt of $110 billion, and as a result, net cash was $83 billion at the end of the quarter. We returned $22 billion to shareholders during the March quarter, including $18.5 billion through open market repurchases of 64.7 million Apple shares and $3.4 billion in dividends and equivalents.  
Finally, as we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to provide some color on what we are seeing, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. As Tim mentioned, given the lack of visibility and certainty in the near term, we will not be issuing guidance for the coming quarter. However, based on what we have seen in April and how we think things might play out, I would like to provide some additional insight on headwinds and tailwinds we're facing.
From a foreign exchange standpoint, the U.S. dollar has appreciated recently against most currencies around the world, and as a result, we expect our revenue to be negatively impacted by more than $1.5 billion on a year-over-year basis. Our global supply chain is back up and running. We are in a typical supply position, including our usual ramp associated with new products recently launched. These newly launched products, iPad Pro, MacBook Air and iPhone SE have all received outstanding customer response even during these extreme circumstances.
On iPhone and Wearables, we expect the year-over-year revenue performance to worsen in the June quarter relative to the March quarter. On iPad and Mac, we expect the year-over-year revenue performance to improve in the June quarter. On Services, we are seeing 2 distinct trends. First, customers are actively engaging with our ecosystem and digital services, and we believe the very strong recent performance in the App Store, video, Music and cloud services will continue throughout the June quarter. Second, due to the overall reduced level of economic activity due to the lockdowns around the world, services like Apple Care and advertising have been impacted. Apple Care is comprised of our product repair business and the warranty agreements with our customers, both of which have been obviously affected by store closures and reduced level of customer traffic. Advertising, which is comprised of third-party agreements, our App Store search ads and Apple News ads has been impacted by overall economic weakness and uncertainty on when businesses will reopen.
For gross margin, sequential headwinds include foreign exchange, the mix within products and the seasonal loss of leverage on our product business. Foreign exchange will have a 70 basis points impact sequentially and 130 basis points impact year-over-year. Regarding product mix, keep in mind the commentary we provided at the revenue level. Sequential tailwinds include cost savings and the mix shift towards Services.
With regard to capital allocation, our approach remains unchanged. We continue to invest confidently in our future while also returning value to our shareholders. We are in the midst of developing our most exciting pipeline of products and services ever while contributing over $350 billion to the U.S. economy and expanding our footprint in many cities around the country over a 5-year period.
We also continue to believe that there is great value in our stock, and we are maintaining our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time. As a testament to the confidence we have in our business today and into the future, our Board has authorized $50 billion for share repurchases in addition to the over $40 billion authorization remaining under the current share repurchase plan. Our Board has also authorized a 6% increase in our quarterly dividend and today declared a cash dividend of $0.82 per share of common stock payable on May 14, 2020, to shareholders of record as of May 11, 2020.
Finally and most importantly, we are managing Apple for the long term as we've always done. During uncertain times historically, we have continued to invest in the business, and this remains our philosophy. We will continue to stay focused on what we do best, investing in our product and service pipeline, managing the business wisely and taking care of our teams and believe we will come out from this stronger.
With that, let's open the call to questions.",2134

Tim, you talked about seeing some improvement in the second half of April. So I was wondering if you could just talk maybe a bit more on the segment and geographic basis what you're seeing in the various regions that you're selling in and what you're hearing from your customers. And then I have a follow-up.",61

If you look at -- I'll start with China. If you look at what happened in China, we were having a really good January. The lockdown started there toward the end of January as you know. February, we saw a steep decline in demand. We closed our stores in February. As the lockdown completed in mid-February toward the second half of February, we began to open stores. We opened them on a staggered basis. That took about 30 days until mid-March. And from a demand point of view, we saw an improvement in March over February. And if you look at kind of where we are today, we've seen further improvement in April as compared to March. And so that's China.
If you look at the rest of the world, we were doing great in January, the first 5 weeks of the quarter. And we do believe that we were headed toward the sort of the top end of our expectations that we had talked to you about on the last call, that the next 5 weeks were spent sort of reacting and getting the supply chain back up in full force and working through the sharp decline in China that I already talked about.
The real thing for the rest of the world happened in March when the shelter-in-place orders went in and the work from home began. For those 2-, 3-week period, at the end of the quarter, we saw a sharp decline in demand. If you now step out into April and look at that, early April started like the end of March, but in the second half of April, we've seen an uptick across -- really across the board. It's not just related to a certain geo or a certain product. We think, by looking at it, a part of it is due to just our new products. A part of it is due to the stimulus programs taking effect in April, and then a part of it is probably the consumer behavior of knowing this is going to go on for a little while longer and getting some devices and so forth lined up to work at home more.
In particular for, as I think Luca shared, we believe that iPad and Mac are going to improve on a year-over-year basis during this quarter. And that's customers that are either taking online education or working remotely. And so complex answer to your question but that's what we're seeing.",415

Tim, in past downturns, we have not really seen Apple pull back from investing, and you as a company have largely maintained the product introduction cadence. But given these are unprecedented times and there are a lot of challenges associated with product development during a time when you have a global footprint for such activities and unable to really do a lot of things in person, how should we think about the product development and introduction cadence as we go over the next several quarters? And I have a follow-up.",94

And so as you can tell, along with everything else going on, we were able to launch and ship the iPhone SE, the iPad Pro with the Magic Keyboard and the MacBook Air. And so business continues and the new products are our lifeblood. And so we're continuing to work. Everybody is getting used to the work at home. In some areas of the company, people may be even more productive. In some other areas, they're not as productive, and so it's mixed depending upon what the roles are. But as you can tell from what we did this quarter, despite the environment, we have our head down, are working because we know that our customers want the products that we've got. They are even more important in these times.",135

But I was wondering, would you consider using the strength of your balance sheet maybe a little differently structured, maybe deferred payments or things like that? And -- or do you think that there could be other steps like bundling that you will consider versus what you already currently do?",79

We're working on doing that for other products as well, and you'll see something on that shortly. So we're very focused on the affordability point. The trade-in programs also are fairly wide across the board and act as both something great for the environment, also something great from a way to get that entry price down.
In terms of deferred payments, nothing to announce today. But as you know, having access to the Card, at least in the United States, gives us more degrees of freedom, and that is not using our balance sheet. It's -- but we play a key role in deciding what kind of programs go with the Card.",127

Tim, I want to start on a longer-term question. Where do you see structural changes on the back of this health crisis that might present opportunities for new revenue streams at Apple? And I'm particularly thinking about your past comments on health and augmented reality, but I'm sure there's even more areas of inspiration and creativity coming out of the company. And then I have a follow-up.",77

And it's pretty clear to me that where things will get a lot closer to normal than they are today, obviously, I think many people are finding that they can learn remotely, and so I suspect that trend will accelerate some. I think that's probably also true about working remotely on -- in some areas and in some jobs. And so I think we have significant solutions and products for those -- for all of those groups.
On the health area, I gave some examples in my opening comments about the ECG being used on the Watch. You can bet that we're looking at other areas in this. We were already doing that because we've viewed that, that area was a huge opportunity for the company and a way for us to help a lot of people. And so you will see us continue on that. I wouldn't say that the health door opened wider. I would say it was already opened fairly wide.",185

And then as a follow-up, the $50 billion share repurchase authorization is impressive in absolute terms, but it is a bit lower than the last couple of years. So just any context around the thought process of landing on $50 billion? And then related to that, you have one of the strongest balance sheets in the world. Does the current environment change your thinking at all around M&A opportunities?",70

First of all, on the buyback, as I said, in general, our approach to capital allocation has remained the same for the last several years, and it's not changing now. Keep in mind here, we're talking about just the authorization, right? And when you look at our actual results at the end of every quarter, you see how much we actually do in terms of share repurchases. The $50 billion is in addition to over $40 billion that is still remaining from the past authorization that we've received from our Board, right? So it's the total available or outstanding in terms of authorization is over $90 billion.
And as you look at our run rate during the last several years, you know that, that is a very adequate amount. And as you know, we will provide an additional update a year from now. So nothing really has changed there.
And nothing has changed on our approach for M&A. We've been quite active over the last several years. We purchase companies on a very regular basis. We're always looking for ways to accelerate our product road maps or fill gaps in our portfolio, both on the hardware side, on the software side, on the Services side. So we will continue to do that. And so also on the M&A front, nothing has changed.",228

I guess, first off, on the channel inventory, I was hoping if you could talk about how did channel inventory look like in the March quarter because it sounds like it may be below the historical ranges. And then the discussion you had for June quarter performance of iPhones, what are you embedding from a channel building back inventory levels in that expectation?",68

If you look at the iPhone channel inventory during Q2, the reduction of it was more than the reduction from the previous year. It's not unusual that we reduce in Q2, and in fact, if you look back on -- generally speaking, in the first half of the calendar year, we reduce channel inventories. During the second half of the calendar year, we generally raise channel inventories. That's a seasonal thing. And I believe -- sitting here today, I believe that will happen this year as well. So hopefully, that answers your question. And by the way, we ended in a comfortable position, so you could conclude from that, that we were within a target range.",119

And could I just follow up? Tim, I was hoping you could maybe talk a little bit about how do you think about Apple's manufacturing strategy and perhaps need for some diversity, especially given everything the company and everyone has gone through over the last 12 months. How do you think about that? And do you feel comfortable that the supply chain and the manufacturing base is well situated today to launch the traditional fall products that they used to get from Apple?",87

As you know, our supply chain is global and so our products are truly made everywhere. And I would focus on that versus focus on one element of the manufacturing process, which tends to get more visibility, which is the final assembly. We have some final assembly in the United States. We have final assembly in China as well. I think you'd have to conclude or at least I conclude that if you look at the shock to the supply chain that took place this quarter, for it to come back up so quickly really demonstrates that it's durable and resilient. And so I feel good about where we are. That said, we're always looking at tweaks, and it's just not something we talk about because we view it as confidential and competitive information. And so we will look at the -- as we get out of this totally, we will look to see what we learned and what we should change.",163

The segment was solid in the quarter in spite overall macro weakness. I can kind of see launch behind it being strong despite product weakness overall. As you kind of look at the rest of the year, do you think that's sustained? Or at some point, does the macro impacts worldwide impact the Services line?",64

We typically don't give a lot of specifics about our categories. But I've said, as we look into the June quarter, we see 2 distinct trends in our Services business overall. Our ecosystem is very strong. Our customers are very engaged. We are continuing to grow double digits the number of transacting accounts and paid accounts. And so we expect our digital services to continue at the same level of performance that we have seen during the March quarter. And that includes the App Store, of course, our video business, our Music business, cloud services, so we expect all these businesses to continue to grow very strongly.
Given the overall economic environment, the level of demand right now, there are 2 businesses that we believe are going to be impacted during the June quarter. One of them is Apple Care. Apple Care is essentially comprised of our product repair business and the warranty agreements that we signed with our customers when they purchased our devices. Both these businesses have been affected obviously by the store closures, not only our retail stores but also our partners' points of sale. And obviously, they reduced level of customer traffic because of the social distancing measures, right? And we do expect Apple Care to be affected during the June quarter.
The other business which we think is going to be impacted by the overall economic weakness and the uncertainty on when businesses will reopen is advertising, which is the sum of our advertising business on the App Store, on Apple News and the third-party agreements that we have on the advertising front. So these are 2 things that, during the June quarter, will create a headwind for the Services business.",292

My second question comes about the overall purchasing decisions consumers are making. So far through April, have you seen increased perhaps downticks across your product line? So for example, somebody might have a shift maybe towards the lower end of the storage mix of certain products. And do you expect that going forward as unemployment uptick and macro impacts kind of layer on through rest of '20?",71

I have seen a strong customer response to iPhone SE, which is our most affordable iPhone. But it appears that those customers are primarily coming from wanting a smaller form factor with the latest technology or coming over from Android. And so those are the 2 principal kind of segments versus somebody buying down as you're talking about it. We've also seen -- we launched the iPad Pro in the midst of all of this, and the reception there has also been incredibly good. And that's obviously our top-of-the-line iPad. And so I'm not seeing what you're alluding to at least at this point.",112

But is that driven by more kind of footfall in the stores or what you're seeing relative to online activity and how much of this recovery is driven online? Any thoughts on that, please?",60

What we saw in China for the full quarter, and I'll speak about Mainland China because I think that's the source of your question, we saw strong results in iPad and in Wearables and in Services. And if you look up underneath the full quarter, we saw a strong January and then a significantly reduced demand in February as the shelter-in-place orders and the lockdowns went into effect in China and the stores closed. And then in March, as stores reopened, we -- the recovery began, and then we've seen further recovery in April. Where that goes, we will see, but that's kind of what we've seen so far there.
To your question about store traffic, store traffic is obviously up from where it was in February, but it is not back to where it was pre the lockdown. There has been, however, more move to online. And as I'd mentioned earlier in my remarks, the -- it's pretty phenomenal actually. Retail had a quarterly record for us during the quarter, and that's despite stores being closed for the 3-week period around the world ex China and then China was closed prior to that 3 weeks. And that's partly because the online store had such a phenomenal quarter, and that included in China but it was also other regions as well. So there is definitely a move. And whether that's a permanent shift, I would hesitate to go that far as I think people like to be out and about. They just know that now is not the time to do that.",263

And if I can just follow up on your previous comment about the strong demand you're seeing for iPhone SE, just given the price point, I'm wondering if you're expecting any change in terms of the geographic mix of where the demand comes from relative to typically what you see for other iPhones in the lineup just given the lower price point.",64

Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. Before we begin, I join the many millions across this country in mourning and memorializing Congressman John Lewis who was laid to rest earlier today. We've lost a hero who walked among us, a leader in the truest sense who urged this country to aim higher and be better until the very end. I was humbled and fortunate to know him, and as an Alabama native, his example inspires me still. It now falls to every American to be a living memorial to John Lewis and to carry forward the work and the mission that defined his life. 
Throughout the call, I'll speak in greater detail about Apple's support for equity and justice, topics of great urgency on a number of fronts, but first, I want to pull the lens back to consider the quarter in full. In an uncertain environment, Apple saw a quarter of historic results, demonstrating the important role our products play in our customers' lives. We set a June quarter record with revenue of $59.7 billion, up 11% from a year ago. Both products and services set June quarter records and grew double digits, and revenue grew in each of our geographic segments, reflecting the broad base of this success. 
As always and especially in times of real adversity, what makes us proud as a company is not merely what we did but how we did it. As millions marched for justice in big cities and small towns alike, we committed $100 million to launch Apple's Racial Equity and Justice Initiative as well as new and renewed internal efforts to foster diversity and inclusion at all levels of the company. As COVID-19 continues to represent great risk for individuals and great uncertainty for our communities, care and adaptability are defining how we conduct our work, wherever we work. In some places, that has meant responsibly reopening our operations in retail stores with enhanced health and safety precautions. In others where the virus has reemerged, it's meant taking the challenging but necessary step of reclosing stores. I'll touch on these topics more in a little bit, but first, I want to offer some more context on the quarter's results. 
Due to the uncertain and ongoing impacts of COVID-19, we did not provide our typical guidance when we reported our results last quarter, but we did provide some color on how we expected the June quarter to play out. I'd like to contextualize our results in terms of that color across each of our product categories beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue grew 2% this quarter. In April, we expected year-over-year performance to worsen but we saw better-than-expected demand in May and June. We attribute this increase in demand to several interactive causes, including a strong iPhone SE launch, continued economic stimulus and potentially some benefit from shelter-in-place restrictions lifting around the world. We expected iPad and Mac growth to accelerate, and we saw very strong double-digit growth for these devices this quarter. 
This remarkable performance came in spite of supply constraints on both products. We're working hard to get more iPads and Macs into customers' hands as quickly as possible, recognizing how integral they have become to working and learning from home, providing entertainment and staying connected with loved ones. Wearables growth decelerated as we expected but still grew by strong double digits and set a revenue record for a non-holiday quarter. Building on powerful new features built into watchOS 7 and AirPods Pro announced this quarter, we are very excited about the many opportunities in front of us for this product category. These strong results helped drive our installed base of active devices to new all-time records across each of our product categories. 
Reflecting the deep integration of hardware, software and services, Services generated a June quarter record of $13.2 billion, up 15% year-over-year. As we mentioned during our last call, there were 2 distinct trends we were seeing and they played out as we thought: First, results for advertising and AppleCare were impacted by the reduced level of economic activity and store closures to a degree that was in line with our expectations. Second, we had strong performance in our digital services with all-time revenue records in the App Store, Apple Music, video and cloud services as well as elevated engagement on iMessage, Siri and FaceTime months. Customers are loving new offerings across Apple's services, like Apple News Today, our new daily audio briefing, and Greyhound, our new summer blockbuster starring Tom Hanks. In fact, Apple TV+ just hit a history-making 95 awards nominations and 25 wins and accolades. 
Based on these results and our performance over the last 4 quarters, we are proud to announce that we have achieved our goal of doubling our fiscal 2016 Services revenue 6 months ahead of schedule. We're conscious of the fact that these results stand in stark relief during a time of real economic adversity for businesses large and small and certainly for families. We do not have a zero-sum approach to prosperity, and especially in times like this, we're focused on growing the pie, making sure our success isn't just our success and that everything we make, build or do is geared toward creating opportunities for others. 
The App Store is a great example. This quarter, a new study by independent economists at the Analysis Group found that the App Store facilitated more than $0.5 trillion in commerce globally in 2019 alone. Especially in a time of COVID-19, you can measure economic resilience in the ways in which the App Store supports remote ordering for restaurants, digital commerce for small businesses and an enduring entrepreneurial opportunity for creators and visionaries. 
Keeping learning vibrant and impactful in the time of COVID-19 is a priority everyone shares. Earlier this month, we announced significant enhancements to the Develop in Swift and Everyone Can Code curricula, and we launched a new professional learning course available exclusively to educators. And just 2 weeks ago, our community education initiative added 10 more historically black college and university regional coding centers to our roster, bringing the total to 24 locations nationwide, 12 of which are HBCUs and 21 of which serve majority black and brown student populations. 
In Apple's backyard, we announced that we're allocating $400 million of our multiyear $2.5 billion affordable housing commitment to new housing construction, homebuyer assistance programs and support for those at greatest risk of experiencing homelessness across Silicon Valley. 
Apple's results this quarter are only possible due to our people and their ongoing ingenuity, flexibility, resilience and determination during these ever-changing times. I want to thank our AppleCare and retail teams, who have paired exceptional service during a time of intense demand with great adaptability during a quarter where stores have reopened in some places and reclosed in others. A dedicated team of specialists and experts has shouldered the task of caring for the well-being of our teams and communities, store by store, location by location with evidence-driven granularity and agility that is unrivaled anywhere. 
Innovation from adversity certainly defined this year's Worldwide Developers Conference as well. This is an event where traditionally, Apple's worldwide community of developers gathers together to share, celebrate and do big things together. Though we could not be together in person, Apple set a new standard for what online events can achieve with our celebrated all-virtual event. The results here speak for themselves. More than 22 million viewers tuned in across all of Apple's streams. For our developers, we distributed more than 72 hours of video content. That's 3 full days of video. The week saw more than 200 direct-to-video engineering and design sessions and about 4,500 person-to-person appointments with developers across 227 virtual labs. 
And of course, that's even before you get to this year's announcements. From iOS 14, which boasts a radical redesign to the Home Screen, powerful updates to Messages, streamlined and effortless App Clips and even greater privacy transparency and controls to major updates to Apple Pencil, Siri and calling in iPadOS 14, to much anticipated sleep tracking, new fitness and wellness features and unprecedented customization in watchOS 7, to the new macOS Big Sur boasting the biggest redesign upgrade to macOS since OS X. No less important for Apple's innovation road map is our transition to Apple silicon for the Mac. This 2-year effort will achieve both unprecedented performance for the Mac and a common architecture across all Apple products. 
Looking forward, we are profoundly optimistic about Apple's future. And we recognize that with this success comes a real responsibility to lead with our values because those values help make that success possible in the first place. We are just as proud of our announcement this month that Apple will be fully carbon-neutral by 2030 across our entire supply chain and including the energy use of every device we make as we are of any hardware innovation because they spring from the same instinct to leave the world better than we found it. 
We're committed to standing with those marching for the lives and dignity through our new $100 million commitment to Apple's Racial Equity and Justice Initiative. And we're deepening our diversity and inclusion efforts internally because our future as a business is inextricably linked with the future of our communities. 
There are times when things seem to move slowly when needed progress, economic or social, seems bogged down, when the instinct to turn away from the horizon and hold on to what you've got feels inescapable. And then there are times like this when people of goodwill step forward, when progress unmoors itself, when the insistence of hope forces something new. This is an immensely challenging moment. COVID-19 is still devastating many places, and we have work left to do to care for the health and well-being of the communities in which all of us live and work. But no community of people, whether a company or a country, can afford to miss this call when it comes. At Apple, we never have and we don't intend to start now. 
With that, I'll hand things off to Luca.",1693
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3357.0,2078621.0,81576906.0,Presenter Speech,Luca Maestri,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Our June quarter was a testament to Apple's ability to innovate and execute during challenging times. Our results speak to the resilience of our business and the relevance of our products and services in our customers' lives. 
Total revenue was $59.7 billion, a new June quarter record, up 11% from a year ago despite a 300 basis point headwind from foreign exchange. Our performance was strong across our entire portfolio as we grew revenue in each of our product categories and set June quarter records for Mac, for wearables and for services. Similarly, our results were very strong all around the world, with growth in all geographic segments and new June quarter records in the Americas, in Europe, in Japan and rest of Asia Pacific. 
Products revenue was $46.5 billion, up 10% and a June quarter record. iPhone returned to growth and we saw very strong double-digit growth from iPad, Mac and wearables. Lockdowns and point-of-sale closures were widespread during April and impacted our performance, but we saw demand for all products improve significantly in May and June. As a result of our strong performance and the unmatched loyalty of our customers, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high in all of our geographic segments and all major product categories. Our Services continue to grow strongly, up 15% year-over-year and reached a June quarter record of $13.2 billion. We set all-time records in many Services categories and June quarter records in each geographic segment. I'll cover this in more detail later. 
Company gross margin was 38%. This was down 40 basis points sequentially due to unfavorable FX of 90 basis points and a different mix of products, partially offset by cost savings and Services mix. Products gross margin was 29.7%, decreasing 60 basis points sequentially due to FX and a different mix, partially offset by cost savings. Services gross margin was 67.2%, up 180 basis points sequentially mainly due to mix. Net income was $11.3 billion, and earnings per share were $2.58, up 18% and a June quarter record. Operating cash flow was also a June quarter record at $16.3 billion, an improvement of $4.6 billion over a year ago. 
Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue grew 2% to $26.4 billion with customer demand improving as the quarter progressed. COVID-19 was most impactful during the first 3 weeks of April when lockdowns and point-of-sale closures became more widespread in many countries. We saw marked improvement around the world in May and June, which we attribute to an improved level of customer demand helped by the very successful launch of iPhone SE and economic stimulus packages. Our active installed base of iPhones again reached an all-time high as a result of the loyalty of our customer base and strength of our ecosystem. In fact, in the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max combined. 
Turning to Services. As I said, we set a June quarter record of $13.4 billion of revenue. We had all-time record performance and strong double-digit growth in the App Store, Apple Music, video and cloud services. Our new services, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+ and Apple Card, are also contributing to overall Services growth and continue to add users, content and features. At the same time, customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow at a fast pace. The number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the June quarter, with paid accounts increasing double digits in each of our geographic segments. In aggregate, paid subscriptions grew more than 35 million sequentially, and we now have over 550 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 130 million from a year ago. With this momentum, we remain confident to reach our increased target of 600 million paid subscriptions before the end of calendar 2020. 
Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new June quarter record with revenue of $6.5 billion, up 17% year-over-year. Our wearables business is now the size of a Fortune 140 company, and we set June quarter records in the majority of markets we track. Importantly, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with over 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter new to the product. 
Next, I'd like to talk about the impressive performance of Mac. Revenue was $7.1 billion, up 22% over last year and a June quarter record. We grew double digits in each geographic segment and set all-time revenue records in Japan and rest of Asia Pacific as well as June quarter records in the Americas and Europe. Customer response to our new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro launches has been extremely strong. 
iPad performance was equally impressive with revenue of $6.6 billion, up 31% and our highest June quarter revenue in 8 years. Demand was strong around the world with double-digit growth in each of our geographic segments, including a June quarter record in Greater China. The launch of our new iPad Pro has been received incredibly well in every region of the world. 
Both Mac and iPad are extremely relevant products in the new working and learning environments, and the most recent surveys of consumers from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 96% for Mac and 97% for iPad. Around half of the customers purchasing Mac and iPad during the quarter were new to that product, and as a result, the active installed base for both products reached a new all-time high. 
Our retail business had record June quarter revenue, thanks to the performance of our online store. We set records in all geographic segments and grew across all major product categories. In June, we launched Apple Card monthly installments for more products in our U.S. stores, allowing customers to pay for their devices over time with 0% interest. We're very pleased with the level of customer interest this new offering has generated. 
In the enterprise market, we continue to see companies leverage Apple products and offerings to successfully navigate their businesses through COVID-19. In health care, we're seeing rapid acceleration of telehealth to support a more flexible model of patient care. Many hospitals, such as UVA Health, Rush University Medical Center and UC San Diego Health are using apps on iPad and iPhone to help triage, monitor and care for patients who are at home. This helps free up hospital capacity to support patients who need inpatient care while enabling continued care for patients who do not require in-person visits. 
Since many call center employees are currently working remotely, Apple Business Chat has proven an invaluable tool for staying connected with customers. This quarter, HSBC deployed Apple Business Chat in its U.S. and U.K. contact centers. Apple Business Chat provides a flexible and secure channel for digital banking assistance through a native Apple experience, improving the efficiency and experience for both customers and agents. We are seeing similar adoption by hundreds of other organizations. 
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with almost $194 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We issued $8.5 billion of new term debt, retired $7.4 billion of term debt and increased short-term borrowing facilities by $1.1 billion during the quarter, leaving us with total debt of $113 billion. As a result, net cash was $81 billion at the end of the quarter, and we continue on our path to reaching a net cash neutral position over time. 
We returned over $21 billion to shareholders during the June quarter, including $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $10 billion through open market repurchases of 31.3 million Apple shares. We also began a $6 billion accelerated share repurchase program in May, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 15.2 million shares. And finally, we retired an additional 4.8 million shares in the final settlement of our 15th ASR. 
As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to provide some color on what we are seeing, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Similar to last quarter, given the uncertainty around the world in the near term, we will not be issuing revenue and margin guidance for the coming quarter. However, we will provide some additional insight on our expectations for the September quarter for our product categories. 
On iPhone, we expect to see recent performance continue for our current product lineup, including the strong customer response for iPhone SE. In addition, as you know, last year, we started selling new iPhones in late September. This year, we project supply to be available a few weeks later. We expect the rest of our products categories to have strong year-over-year performance. For Services, we expect the September quarter to have the same trends that we observed during the June quarter except for AppleCare, where during the September quarter a year ago, we expanded our distribution significantly. 
As a consequence, we expect a difficult comp for AppleCare also considering the COVID-related point-of-sale closures this year. For gross margin, keep in mind that we will have a different mix than in prior years, as I just explained. For OpEx, we expect to be between $9.8 billion and $9.9 billion. We expect the tax rate to be about 16.5% and OI&E to be $50 million. 
Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.82 per share of common stock payable on August 13, 2020, to shareholders of record as of August 10, 2020. 
And finally, today, we're announcing a 4-for-1 split of Apple common stock to make our stock more accessible to a broader base of investors. Each shareholder of record at the close of business on August 24, 2020, will receive 3 additional shares for every outstanding share held on the record date, and trading will begin on a split-adjusted basis on August 31, 2020. 
With that, let's open the call to questions.",1686

And then I have a follow-up.",67

And that's in addition to trade-in, which is becoming a more common trend now, which I think is terrific because it is great for the environment and it acts as a subsidy, if you will, against the price of a new phone. And so when you compound these 2 things with the financing and the trade-in, it makes the product super affordable. And we're really happy with what we're seeing in that regard.",104

As you pointed out, the installed base is larger today. Our math would suggest that replacement cycles, in some cases, are elongated.

It was better than we thought largely because, as we pointed out in the prepared remarks, May and June were much better. If you look at iPhone in totality, the things that get me very optimistic is the size of the active installed base. The fact that if you look in the major geographies like the U.S., we had the top 2 selling smartphones. In the U.K., we had 3 of the top 4. In Australia, we had 5 of the top 6. And in Japan, we had the top 4. Urban China, we were -- iPhone 11 was the top-selling smartphone in the country. And so these are some very different geographies with very different competitive situations and we're doing fairly well. 
The iPhone SE, it's also clear that from the early data, we're seeing a higher switcher number than we did in the previous year, which we feel very good about. And it also seemed to appeal to some people that were holding onto the device a little longer because they wanted a smaller form factor phone. And so the combination of the smaller form factor and an incredibly affordable price made the iPhone SE very popular. iPhone 11 is still the most popular smartphone, but iPhone SE definitely helped our results. And as we -- as Lucas said in his outlook, we do see that continuing into this quarter currently.",243

Shannon, the growth that -- we did see growth in Greater China for the quarter of 2%. Currency affected China a bit more than in other places. It affected 400 basis points, and so in constant currency, we would have grown at 6%. As I'd mentioned before, the iPhone 11 has been our best-selling phone and has been #1 in Urban China, and so we're very, very proud of that. iPad was helped in the June quarter there by the work-from-home and distance learning as it was in other geographies, and the Mac also grew strong double digit during the quarter. And Services set a new June quarter record there. We also continue to see extremely high new customer rates on Mac and iPad there.

And so it's a combination of all of those. And as you know, we've been having a strong cycle with the iPhone 11 and the 11 Pro.

And I guess, Luca, if I could just follow up with you. I'd love to get your perspective on how do we think about the overall 38% gross margins. What do you think are the levers to improve this as you go forward, not really September quarter but over the next 1 or 2 years? And in that context, do you see a point where the product gross margins start to stabilize because they have been trending somewhat lower for the last couple of quarters now?",89

Let me start with what we've seen during the June quarter. We were -- at 38%, we were down slightly sequentially but up the same amount on a year-over-year basis. And really, the big negative impact that we felt for several quarters now has been the strength of the U.S. dollar. So the foreign exchange impact on a sequential basis was 90 basis points, on a year-over-year basis was 130 basis points. So obviously, that is something to keep in mind. And then the other aspect, I think it's always important to keep in mind, Amit, is that we sell many different products. They have different margin profiles. And so sometimes, a different mix can have an impact on the aggregate level of products' gross margins. And we're very pleased to see the performance of Mac, iPad and wearables, but obviously, it's a different mix. 
Going forward, the variables are always the same. It's -- the foreign exchange will continue to play an impact. The mix of products that we're going to be selling will have an impact as well. The commodities market has been relatively benign, and we'll see how that plays out over time. As you know now for several years, we've been managing gross margin, I would say, fairly well in spite of some difficult situations like the one with the strength of the dollar, and we plan to continue to make good trade-off decisions between revenue and units and margins.",245

It showed that there's still a high proportion of the installed bases on 6, 7 and 8 devices. I know you talked about the trade-in programs and promotions that you've been doing there. I wonder if you can tell us whether there's anything else that you're doing to get these customers into your latest technology. What might those customers be looking for? And how should we think about when an upgrade cycle might come on more strongly there in China?",94

But I mean much like in other geographies, the upgrades have extended some. It extended some during the depths, if you will, of the pandemic in China and the rest of the world and probably, to some degree, is happening still at this point. The key things that we can do is keep innovating, deliver a product that people can't imagine going through life without and obviously keep rolling out these programs that make the front-end purchase be much less. And this is things like the financing and the trade-in programs that you mentioned. And I do feel like those are going quite good in a number of geographies.",133

And so that, to me, makes the -- bodes well for the future. There's clearly -- as we had indicated, there's some amount of work from home and remote learning that do affect the results of Mac and iPad positively. They probably affect wearables and iPhone the other direction and -- but on Mac and iPad, these are productivity tools that people are using to stay engaged with their work or stay engaged with their school work.

Obviously, travel is a perfect example. The number of meetings that we had internally, some of those costs have been reduced. We've also invested heavily in initiatives. For example, we're really trying to help during very difficult circumstances. For example, we have had a program, for example, where we match our employee donations. We made donations directly as a company around the world to many institutions and governments. On a net basis, I would say probably, the costs have outweighed the savings both during the March and the June quarter, but we think it's absolutely the right thing to do. 
From an employee perspective, what we said so far is that here in the United States, most -- the majority of our population will continue to work from home until the end of the year. And then we'll see. I mean we've taken an approach that we try to understand how the virus is evolving over time. We've taken a very cautious approach both with our corporate facilities and with our retail stores. I think what you've seen with retail stores is that we have reopened in a number of geographies around the world. We've reopened here in the United States. We've had to reclose some of the stores here in the United States as the number of cases has gone up, and we will continue to track how the virus is doing. And hopefully, at some point, we're going to get to a point where there is a vaccine or there is a cure. And so we'll make those decisions as we get more information.",286

I'd like to focus on the gross margin expansion within the Services line, all-time record for the quarter. I'm just curious whether you think that will sustain.

We have a very broad portfolio. And depending on which one of the services does better, then we have an impact on Services gross margins. We like the Services business because it's a recurring type of revenue and the margins are accretive to company margin. We did over 67% this quarter. But we want to offer very competitive services across the board, and the same -- I think I'm going to make the same comments that I made on products. What matters to us is to be successful with everything that we do and provide great products and services to our customers. So the relative success of our products and services in the marketplace will drive, to a certain extent, what our margins are. That's -- the margins are a by-product of our success in the marketplace.",163

So I think as stores closed, it puts more pressure on that. I was -- we did come out sort of the way we told you last quarter. We were going to come out from a -- from the color that we gave you.

Because it just seems like it's a little bit different, but Apple is really showing a lot more strength coming into this Christmas than maybe some of the past years. 
And then for Luca. I think today, a quick comment, Luca, that -- you mentioned something about a few weeks later. Was that for like iPhone, iPhone chips or product launches?

Back in April, I said we were in the most challenging environment in which Apple as a company has ever operated. That atmosphere of uncertainty, of resolve, of making difficult calls with limited information, has not only come to define Apple's year but each of our lives as individuals across this country and around the world. It has been a chapter that none of us will forget. 
In the face of these challenges, Apple stayed relentlessly focused on what we do best, seeing in every obstacle an opportunity to do something new, something creative, something better on behalf of our customers. 
Today, we report a quarter and a fiscal year that reflects that effort. This quarter, Apple achieved revenue of $64.7 billion, a September quarter record despite the anticipated absence of new iPhone availability during the quarter and the ongoing impacts of COVID-19, including closures at many of our retail locations. We also set a new all-time record for Mac and Services. Outside of iPhone, each of our product categories saw strong double-digit year-over-year growth despite supply constraints in several product categories. 
Our results for this quarter were ahead of our expectations, driven by stronger-than-expected iPhone and Services performance. As we anticipated, we launched new iPhone models in October, a few weeks later than last year's mid-September launch. Up to that mid-September point, customer demand for iPhone was very strong and grew double digits. On Services, we saw stronger-than-expected performance across the board. 
Geographically, we set September quarter records in the Americas, Europe and rest of Asia Pacific. We also set a September quarter record in India, thanks in part to a very strong reception to this quarter's launch of our online store in the country. Greater China is the region that was most heavily impacted by the absence of the new iPhones during the September quarter. Still, we beat our internal expectations in the region, growing non-iPhone revenue strong double digits, and iPhone customer demand grew through mid-September. 
When you pull back the lens to the entire fiscal year, it's a testament to the team's work and to the resilience of the business in the era of COVID-19. This year, we set an all-time revenue record of $274.5 billion, growing 6% year-on-year. We grew every quarter, set all-time yearly records in Mac, Wearables, Home and Accessories and Services and grew by double digits in every product category outside of iPhone. 
When we first began to grapple with COVID-19, I said there are worse things for a company whose business is innovation than having to periodically do just about everything in an entirely new way. This year, we not only launched our most powerful and compelling generation of hardware, software and services ever, we did it in a way that pushed us to reimagine every part of that innovation process down to how we share these announcements with the world and how we get new products into our customers' hands. Working from kitchen tables and bedrooms, in distanced office settings and reworked labs and manufacturing facilities, the team rebuilt every part of the plane while it was midair, and the results speak for themselves. 
In a year that has been enormously challenging, our retail teams, contact centers and all those who work with our customers most closely have gone to creative and dedicated lengths to keep serving our customers, from adapting our stores for contactless pickup to new Apple express storefronts to new online customer support options. Amid store closings, reopenings and reimaginings, these teams have been an unfailing source of energy, creativity and determination. Innovation isn't just about what you make, it's about how you approach problems, and these teams and every team across Apple have not faced a single question this year that they haven't found an answer to with passion and resolve. Their actions didn't just meet the moment, they will make us a better company moving forward. 
The pandemic has hit home for all of us, and at Apple, we have seen it as a call to action. We have seen the pain in our communities. Many of us have seen our children work hard to adapt to remote learning. And we have -- and we all know that the road ahead is uncertain. This quarter and throughout the year, our response to this crisis has been to ask, how can we help? In terms of COVID-19 response, that has meant sourcing and donating millions of face masks, designing and manufacturing millions of face shields and scaling the production of millions of test kits. 
But we have tried to live our values more broadly. We've pledged $100 million to our new Racial Equity and Justice Initiative. We've committed to be fully carbon-neutral by 2030 across our entire supply chain and device usage as massive wildfires, hurricanes and floods bring home the consequences of climate change for all of us. And we've deepened our enduring educational partnerships, from coding education beginning in elementary school to new efforts with dozens of historically black colleges and universities. 
One of the many areas where COVID-19 continues to have a significant impact is in education. As teachers, students and parents alike work hard to keep education relevant, creative and effective, our products have helped them meet the moment. In a typical year, the back-to-school season is a bustling time for us. This year, that was true in the biggest way ever. We've helped school districts around the world meet this moment in an unprecedented way, including starting 9 of our 10 largest school district deployments ever that alone will support over 1 million students and teachers. We have also supported these deployments and educators and learners everywhere with free tools and training, reaching over 150,000 teachers and millions of parents and students around the world. 
Looking forward, we feel great optimism about the road in front of us. We're in the midst of our most prolific product introduction period ever. In addition to the announcement of HomePod mini, which achieves unmatched sound quality and Siri and smart home capabilities in a small and affordable format, we just marked the beginning of a new era for iPhone with the arrival of our first 5G-enabled devices. The iPhone 12 and 12 mini boast powerful breakthroughs like an edge-to-edge Super Retina XDR display, unprecedented durability with a new Ceramic Shield developed with our partners at Corning, new MagSafe charging and accessories, the fastest-ever A14 Bionic chip and a new dual camera system driven by computational photography. 
The iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max take all of this to an even higher level, driven by the most powerful photo and video tools ever delivered by a smartphone, including an all-new LiDAR scanner and the ability to shoot in Apple ProRaw and full Dolby video. 
And of course, all of these devices bring the 5G experience users have been waiting for, with lightning-fast downloads and uploads, a new standard in video streaming, more responsive gaming and much more. The early product reviews have been tremendously positive, and our customers have been similarly excited to get their hands on this next era of devices. We're very optimistic about what the next few weeks will bring. 
We're also seeing a very positive response to our September announcement. The all-new Apple Watch Series 6 boasts powerful new health and wellness features, including a blood oxygen sensor, a next-generation altimeter and a wide variety of new colors and bands. The potential for Apple Watch's powerful health and wellness capabilities continues to grow. 
Just yesterday, the government of Singapore and Apple launched LumiHealth, a first-of-its-kind program designed to encourage healthy activity and behaviors using Apple Watch. Created in collaboration with a team of physicians and public health experts, LumiHealth uses technology and behavioral insights to encourage Singaporeans to keep healthy and complete wellness challenges through their Apple Watch and iPhone. Singapore is a trailblazer here, and we're proud to be their partner. 
Our iPad lineup continues to set the pace for the category, including the new iPad Air now shipping with the A14 Bionic, our most powerful chip ever. We announced Apple Fitness+, which delivers deep personalization and integration across the fitness tools our users love and depend on. And Apple One, launching tomorrow, is the easiest way for users to enjoy Apple services like Music, TV+, Arcade, iCloud, News+ and Fitness+ on a single plan that is right for them and their family. 
Looking across Services more broadly, we're really excited about what we see. This was a record quarter for the App Store, AppleCare, cloud services, Music and payment services. The App Store, in particular, continues to play an essential role in helping small businesses, educational institutions and workplaces adapt to COVID-19. Apple TV+ continues to impress from fan favorites like Ted Lasso, which has won a worldwide audience with its hopeful tone during challenging times, to critical and award praise, including a Primetime Emmy for Billy Crudup in The Morning Show. 
Luca will speak in greater detail about our expectations for the December quarter. Without giving away too much, I can tell you that this year has a few more exciting things in store. Before I hand things off, I want to offer 1 more comment on resilience because I think if I had to describe our performance this quarter in a single word, it's resilient. Financial performance aside, I don't think this year will be a time that any of us look back on with great fondness or nostalgia. Those of us who wake up every day hoping for a return to normal can count ourselves fortunate. Others don't have that luxury. There is the great pain of a lost loved one, the uncertainty and fear of a lost job, a deep well of concern for people we care about who we are not able to see. A sense of opportunities missed, of plans delayed, of time lost. 
Even though we're apart, it's been obvious this year that around the company, teams and colleagues have been leaning on and counting on each other more than in normal times. I think that instinct, that resilience has been an essential part of how we have navigated this year. Work can't solve for all the things we're missing right now, but a shared sense of purpose goes a long way. A belief that we can do more together than we can alone, that people of goodwill, driven by creativity and passion and that certain itch of a big idea, can still do things that help other people in our own small way to teach, to learn, to create or just to relax at a time like this. 
Even as the things we make require us to operate at the very cutting edge of technology, in materials, products and ideas that didn't exist just a few years ago, this year has forced us to face plainly the things that make us human: disease, resilience and hope. You never wish for a year like this one, but I couldn't be prouder of the team, the work we have done and the small role we have played in helping our communities find hope and resilience in this time. With that, I'll hand things over to Luca.",1886
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2020",2020-10-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3636.0,2154196.0,84651504.0,Presenter Speech,Luca Maestri,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased to report today a new September quarter revenue record, which caps a remarkable level of performance for our fiscal year 2020, during which we set new all-time records for revenue, earnings per share and free cash flow in spite of an extremely volatile and challenging macro environment. We could not be more proud of the way our team has innovated and executed throughout this unprecedented period of uncertainty. 
We reported total revenue of $64.7 billion for the September quarter, up 1% from a year ago. This is a very impressive level of performance when we consider that this year, we did not launch and ship any new iPhone models during the quarter. Outside of iPhone, we grew 25% in aggregate and had strong double-digit year-over-year revenue growth in each of our product categories. We set all-time records for Mac and Services and a September quarter record for Wearables, Home and Accessories. 
We also achieved new September quarter records in the vast majorities of countries that we track, including, among others, the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Turkey, Russia, India, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam. Products revenue was $50.1 billion, with very strong underlying performance across each product category. Our products outside of iPhone grew a combined 30% despite supply constraints on iPad, Mac and Apple Watch throughout the quarter. 
For iPhone, through mid-September, customer demand grew double digits. As a result of this level of sales performance and the unmatched loyalty of our customers, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high in aggregate and in each of our major product categories. Our Services set an all-time record of $14.5 billion, growing 16% year-over-year. We established new all-time records in many Services categories and September quarter records in each geographic segment. I'll cover this in more detail later. 
Company gross margin was 38.2%. This was up 20 basis points sequentially due to cost savings and a higher mix of services, partially offset by a different mix of products. Products gross margin was 29.8%, growing 10 basis points sequentially, driven by cost savings, partially offset by a different mix. Services gross margin was 66.9%, decreasing 30 basis points sequentially, mainly due to a different mix. 
Let me get into more detail for each of our product categories. iPhone revenue was $26.4 billion as we did not have availability of new iPhone models during the September quarter this year, which we had mentioned during our call in July. While COVID-19 and social distancing measures impacted store operations in a significant manner, demand for iPhone remained very strong. In fact, through mid-September, customer demand for our current product lineup grew double digits and was well above our expectations. 
Our active installed base of iPhones reached a new all-time high, thanks to the exceptional loyalty of our customer base and strength of our ecosystem. In fact, in the U.S., the last survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max combined. 
Turning to Services, as I said, we set an all-time revenue record of $14.5 billion. We grew strong double digits and set all-time records in App Store, cloud services, Music, advertising and payment services. We also set an all-time record in AppleCare as in-store traffic improved and we were able to support more customers. Our new services, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+ and Apple Card, are also contributing to overall Services growth and continue to add users, content and features. 
The key drivers for our Services growth all continue to be moving in the right direction. First, our installed base continues to grow and is an all-time high across each major product category. Second, the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high. during the September quarter, with paid accounts increasing double digits in each of our geographic segments. Third, paid subscriptions grew more than 35 million sequentially, and we now have over 585 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 135 million from just a year ago. With this momentum, we are very confident to reach and exceed our increased target of 600 million paid subscriptions before the end of calendar 2020. 
Finally, as Tim mentioned, we continue to improve the breadth and the quality of our current Services offerings and are adding new service offerings that we think our customers will love, like Apple One and Apple Fitness+. 
Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new September quarter record with revenue of $7.9 billion, up 21% year-over-year. We set September quarter records in every geographic segment and for each of the 3 product categories: Wearables, Home and Accessories. As a result, our Wearables business is now the size of a Fortune 130 company. Importantly, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with over 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. We're very excited about the future of this category, including the recent launches of our new products: Apple Watch Series 6 and SE, HomePod mini and the MagSafe ecosystem of accessories. 
Next, I'd like to talk about Mac. Revenue was, by far, an all-time record at $9 billion, up 29% over last year and $1.6 billion above our previous record in spite of supply constraints during the quarter. We grew strong double digits in each geographic segment and set all-time revenue records in the Americas and rest of Asia Pacific as well as September quarter records in Europe and Japan. We have seen amazing customer response to the new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro and very strong demand during the back-to-school season. 
iPad performance was also very impressive with revenue of $6.8 billion, up 46% and our highest September quarter revenue in 8 years despite supply constraints. Demand exceeded our expectations around the world as we grew very strong double digits in every geographic segment, including an all-time record in Japan and a September quarter record in the Americas. 
Both Mac and iPad are incredibly relevant products for our customers in the current working and learning environments, and we are delighted that the most recent surveys of consumers from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 93% for Mac and 95% for iPad. With this level of customer satisfaction and with around half of the customers purchasing Mac and iPad during the quarter being new to that product, it is no surprise that the active installed base for both products reached a new all-time high. 
In the enterprise market, our products are helping companies grow their business while achieving their sustainability goals. One example is Vestas, a leading producer of wind turbines. Vestas is using Apple products and native iOS apps extensively across their operations to deliver renewable energy efficiently to customers worldwide. For instance, they use iPads to help -- optimize on-site construction operations, having crane usage, on average, by 1 day per project. Vestas' field technicians are using iPhone for work orders, troubleshooting and remote collaboration, saving them 400,000 service hours annually. More recently, they have started piloting the augmented reality capability in iPads to help customers visualize wind turbine installations in the field. 
Another example of how organizations are using Apple products to reduce carbon impact is digitizing paper workflows. In Switzerland alone, Zurich Insurance has reduced paper consumption by over 10,000 sheets per day by equipping 1,000 customer advisers with iPads. Air Canada is reducing its carbon footprint by over 2,200 metric tons annually by loading flight plans and manuals onto iPads rather than using paper. We are thrilled that our products are helping businesses run more efficiently and sustainably. 
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with almost $192 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We issued $5.5 billion of new term debt and decreased short-term borrowing facilities by $6.2 billion during the quarter, leaving us with total debt of $112 billion. As a result, net cash was $79 billion at the end of the quarter as we continue on our path to reaching a net cash neutral position over time. We returned nearly $22 billion to shareholders during the September quarter, including $3.5 billion in dividends and equivalents and $18 billion through open market repurchases of 168.7 million Apple shares. We also retired an additional 3.1 million shares in the final settlement of our 16th ASR. 
Before looking ahead, I want to provide just a few highlights for the amazing fiscal year we just completed. In fiscal '20, we grew revenue by 6% to $274.5 billion, a new all-time record. We showed remarkable resilience throughout the year as we were able to grow both revenue and installed base of active devices in every quarter. In spite of the most challenging economic environment we can remember, we set new revenue records in the Americas, in Europe and in the rest of Asia Pacific. We grew our business outside of iPhone by 16%. We grew earnings per share 10% to a new all-time record. And most importantly, we continued to deliver innovative products and services that our customers love. 
As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to provide some color on what we are seeing, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we will not be issuing revenue guidance for the coming quarter. However, we are providing some insights on our expectations for the December quarter for our product categories. These directional comments assume that COVID-related impacts to our business in November and December are similar to what we've seen in October. 
We just started shipping iPhone 12 and 12 Pro, and we're off to a great start. We are also excited to start preorders on iPhone 12 mini and 12 Pro Max next Friday. Given the tremendously positive response, we expect iPhone revenue to grow during the December quarter despite shipping iPhone 12 and 12 Pro 4 weeks into the quarter and iPhone 12 mini and 12 Pro Max 7 weeks into the quarter. We expect all other products in aggregate to grow double digits, and we also expect Services to continue to grow double digits. 
For gross margin, we expect it to be similar to our most recent quarters despite the costs associated with the launch of several new products. For OpEx, we expect to be between $10.7 billion and $10.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be around $50 million and the tax rate to be around 16%. 
Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.205 per share of common stock payable on November 12, 2020, to shareholders of record as of November 9, 2020. With that, let's open the call to questions.",1816

And in terms of linearity, I think, Luca, you'd mentioned that Services in all regions were at an all-time high. I'm not sure exactly what your comment was. But maybe give us a little idea of whether you're seeing any blowback or benefit from the Huawei situation and just dig a bit more into the trends you're seeing in China. And then I have a follow-up.",75

If you look at China and look at last quarters -- I'll talk about both last quarter and this quarter a bit. Last quarter, what we saw was our non-iPhone business was up strong double digit for the full quarter. And then if you look at iPhone and you look at it in 2 parts: one, pre-mid-September, which is pre the point at which the previous year we would have launched iPhones, that, that period of time, which was the bulk of the quarter, iPhone was growing from a customer demand point of view. And of course, the -- not shipping new iPhones for the last 2 weeks of September makes that number in the aggregate a negative. 
But the net is the underlying business in China last quarter was very strong and perhaps very different than you might think from just a quick look at the stated number. 
In terms of this quarter, given the explanation for last quarter and the momentum that we've got, and as importantly, given the initial data points that we see on iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro, although we don't guide to revenue, as Luca said, I would tell you that we are confident that we will grow this quarter in China. And so we're very bullish on what's going on there. 
A little more color on last quarter. We had a much more significant inventory drawdown on the channel side than other regions. And so that is one reason why the numbers are different than other regions. And additionally, the new products in the year-ago quarter were a higher percentage of our iPhone sales than they were in other regions. So hopefully, that explains what's going on in China. 
In terms of the market there, 5G is fairly advanced there. They're forecasting 600,000 base stations by the end of the year, and so we're entering the market at a very good time. And with the reception that we've gotten so far, we're very confident there.",335

And then can you talk a bit about just overall in the world -- the cadence that you see sort of for the 5G adoption launch? What you see will be sort of the key drivers?

We're working hard to provide the best experience for our iPhone users. To do so, we've been collaborating closely with carriers all around the world to ensure iPhone has great throughput and coverage and battery and call quality. We've completed 5G testing so far on over 100 carriers, in over 30 regions. And so it's pretty pervasive around the world. But grantedly, it will continue to roll out in more places as carriers continue to expand their coverage, and this will happen every week. And so it's just going to get better. There are obvious places in the world where it's more ahead than in others, but we feel like we are entering at -- sort of at exactly the right time.",123

I guess -- I appreciate the guidance for revenues to grow. But I guess my question, perhaps if I could, is relative to seasonality. You guys -- over the last 5 years, your seasonality is typically up about 50% quarter-on-quarter. Do you think that you can beat that even with the later release? And I have a follow-up.",59

So you need to keep in mind a couple of things that are unique about this quarter versus the past. And then I mentioned again, the launch timing of the phones is different from the past. So we're launching the new iPhones 4 weeks into the quarter for 2 models, for the 12 and the 12 Pro; and 7 weeks into the quarter for the other 2, the iPhone mini and the 12 Pro Max. So that is something to keep in mind as you think about the growth rates. 
With regard to all the other product categories, as I said, we are expecting to grow double digits essentially across the board for the rest of our products and for services. And so we are incredibly optimistic about what we're seeing so far. Obviously, we started taking preorders 5 days ago, and so it's a bit early for the phone. But we think that there are a lot of tailwinds this year for iPhone, for the entire cycle, some of the comments that Tim has already made, right? We've got the best lineup of iPhones that we've ever had. We've got an installed base of iPhone that is very large, continues to grow. It's at an all-time high. 
Obviously, 5G is a once-in-a-decade opportunity. And as you've seen in some markets, certainly here in the United States, carrier offers are very aggressive. And so that is very good for consumers and ultimately very good for us. So very, very optimistic, given what we've seen so far.",276

Thank you so much for that context and giving us some of the levers to think about. I'd like to ask a little bit more of a strategic one, a little bit longer term in nature. I think the one thing that's interesting about the Apple One bundle is the desire to bundle in the first place. I guess I'm wondering, and some investors have asked me this as well, is that why wouldn't you also take that rationale perhaps to hardware, perhaps maybe AirPods and iPhone or AirPods, Watch and iPhone? Because if it makes sense to bundle services, wouldn't it also make sense to bundle hardware? And if that's not the case, then are there benefits of services bundling that don't necessarily translate to hardware bundling?",129

We don't have anything to announce today on a hardware bundle. But backing up a bit, and we do view that people like to pay for their hardware, or at least some substantial portion of it, monthly. And so that's the reason that we have implemented installments in our stores and online. And that's the reason you see in some of the channels, too, selling a hardware on a per month kind of basis. That begins to look like subscription perhaps to some buyers because they're used to holding the phone for X period of time and then turning it over and using the residual value of that phone in a way that gives them a de facto kind of subsidy on a new phone. And so there is something today in the market that works somewhat similar. On the Services side, we had customers coming to us and asking for an easier way to buy all of our services, and we wanted to provide that, and we're looking forward to tomorrow to getting Apple One out there.",179

What I said in my prepared remarks, we expect gross margins in total for the company to be pretty much in line with what we've seen during the last quarter, which obviously, as you said, it's very good, right, because we are offering the new phones at price points that are essentially unchanged, and we're taking on a lot of new technology into the phones. 
The -- I would say the commodity environment is good. For the first time in many, many quarters, I don't have to say that foreign exchange is a headwind getting into the quarter. It's not going to be a factor during the quarter. As we've made clear in our comments, we are bullish about our sales performance expectations, so we should be getting some leverage. And so I think the gross margin dynamics are good, and it's very good to see that we're able to offer so much more technology and still able to deliver the level of gross margins that I think investors are expecting.",186

And shifting to the Services business. This isn't dependent on certainly any one service, but licensing and other historically has been a driver of growth. That's where the ad-based revenue comes in.

And do you see opportunities for other services to make up for any potential weakness?",72

And our data would suggest replacement cycles are getting elongated. And if I take all of that together, along with the fact that if iPhone users are like me with embarrassingly high weekly usage rates, does that, in aggregate, give you better confidence, better clarity that we could enter an extensive period of iPhone revenue growth versus what we've seen in the last couple of years?",101

And so when I think about all of those, I'm really -- and I looked at the initial data points that we've got on the iPhone 12 and the 12 Pro, we are off to a great start.",146

And then I guess, Luca, I had a follow-up for you on the Services gross margins, which have kind of continued to move higher rather nicely. I mean do you think these levels at 67% essentially are sustainable? And what do you think are the 2 or 3 factors that are enabling these gross margins to remain here as we go forward?",64

As you said, they've been expanding almost 300 basis points on a year-over-year basis. The reason for that is, of course, that we are growing the Services revenue and therefore, we're getting leverage on a lot of these Services, right? Some of it, as explained in the past, we have a portfolio of services that got different margin profiles. And so sometimes depending on the mix of products we have, we can see margin expansion through mix as well. 
So -- but we're also launching new services that where we need to invest heavily upfront. And -- but we think we've been able to show, for example, this year that we've launched a lot of new services, made all the necessary investments and still being able to expand gross margin. So we feel quite confident about the trajectory that we have for Services. And we're very, very happy to see the customer response to really all of them because, as we've mentioned earlier, I mean, we've seen revenue records across essentially every category and across the entire world, right? We've seen September quarter records in every geography around the world. So all the dynamics, all the levers that we have in the Services business are working very well right now. And that translates also into margin, of course.",232

I think just looking at some other factors here, earlier in the year, you had mentioned that iPhone sales were seeing an uptick with stimulus checks going out to consumers, helping in the consumer spending overall here in the U.S. So as we see some delays here on that front, are you seeing anything change on the consumer spending side? Is the macro impacting how you think about iPhone sales, particularly even with the new product lineup? And I have a follow-up.",109

So there's a lot of momentum there, and there is a lot of momentum even much more so now given the launch of the 12 Pro and the iPhone 12. If you're asking whether it could have been even more with a different macro spending environment, I believe the answer to be yes. But you can't run the experiment, and so I don't know for sure. But I suspect that just the COVID, in general, takes something off from a worldwide economic point of view.",101

And so with our stores as an example, we've come up with a new concept that puts an -- essentially turns the store into an express storefront. And we've implemented that in a number of places where we believe it helps from the safety of our employee and the safety of the customer's point of view but still allows for an interaction to take place. 
And so we've also put a lot more people on the phones because a lot more people are reaching out to us in that way. And of course, the online store has stayed up and running through the whole of this. I think if you take some of those, the channel is doing some similar things and then some different things as well. And so I think everybody, to the best of their ability, is putting in contingency plans and finding a way to adapt to the environment. But it is difficult to call, and there's a level of uncertainty in it, obviously, and that's what Luca was referring to earlier.",189

First 1 for Luca. I understand you don't want to give color on gross margin by product or segment. But Luca, you mentioned gross margin should be similar in December versus September, and Services should grow around double digits. There's a general view that on the iPhone side, the BOM cost would be a headwind for gross margin, but the carrier subsidies would be a tailwind. So I'm kind of curious, how should we think about the different like gross margin levels into December quarter? And then I had a follow-up for Tim.",98

So typically, during the December quarter, we have positive factors because we have the typical seasonal leverage, right, sequentially as we go from September to the holiday season. And we also have an improved mix between products, particularly this year, as we've launched the new iPhone. At the same time, we shouldn't forget that we have launched a lot of new products during the last several weeks. We launched 4 new models of iPhone. We launched new models of Apple Watch, new models of iPad. And so clearly, every time we launch a new product, the cost structure is higher, and so that is going to be the other side of the coin. But we think that those 2 things should balance out. And again, as I was saying earlier, we are accomplishing this while delivering a lot of new technologies, a lot of new features to our customers. This time, foreign exchange is not a factor, and that's something that is a bit different from the past. So -- but those are the pluses and minuses.",178

There's just a limited number of things I can talk about, it's kind of the reason I didn't talk about it. We're -- we continue to be very enthusiastic about the whole payment services area. Apple Card is doing well, and Apple Pay is doing exceptionally well. As you can imagine, in this environment, people are -- less want to hand over a card, so this contactless payment has taken on a different level of adoption in it that I think will never go back. The U.S. has been lagging a bit in contactless payment, and I think that the pandemic may well get -- put the U.S. on a different trajectory there. And so we are very bullish about this area and view that there are more things that Apple can do in this space. And so it's an area of great interest to us.",150

Kyle, I don't know if you're talking about iPhone in particular. But if you look at iPhone, we are constrained today, and that's not a surprise, we're at the front end of the ramp, if you will. And how long we will be supply constrained, it's hard to predict. I mean we haven't taken orders yet for the iPhone 12 mini or the Pro Max either. And so those are coming, and so we shall see. But right now, we are supply constrained. 
We are also supply-constrained -- for avoidance of any confusion, we're supply-constrained on Mac. We're supply-constrained on iPad, and we're supply-constrained on some Apple Watches as well. And so we have a fair number of areas right now of focus, and we're working really, really hard to remedy those as quickly as we can. But at this point, I can't estimate when we'll be out of that.",151

And then switching to Mac and iPad. How do you think about the durability of the strength you're seeing there with Mac and iPad? Is there any potential for stronger-than-seasonal pullback after the strong back-to-school season and holiday season? And the supply constraints make it feel like there's a good chance for continuation of the strong demand trends and flow-through of that. What should we think about the seasonality into the December and March quarter, being more positive than seasonal or less positive than seasonal?",87

We've placed our thoughts in the color that Luca provided when he said that all products excluding iPhone -- all products and services excluding iPhone -- or all products, rather, excluding iPhone would grow in the double digits. And so we continue to be bullish on what Mac and iPad can do. The -- I think the moves that have taken place to remote learning and remote work are not going to go back to normal. Normal will become something different because I think people are learning that there are aspects of this that work well. And so I don't believe that we're going to go back to where we were. 
And I think that means that iPads and Macs are even more important in those environments. The growth in both of these last quarter were phenomenal, as you can tell from your -- from data sheet with Mac at 29 and iPad at 46. These are tremendous numbers. And as Luca said, the September quarter was the all-time high for Mac in the history of the company and by -- not by a little bit, by $1.6 billion. And so it was a substantial difference. Now we did have an aggressive promotion for college students that were going back to school. And so that was an invariably part of it. But I think the other part of the remote work thing is not something that's going to step back to the way it used to be anytime soon.",250

I guess first question is on iPhone pricing. There were some changes in the iPhone price back this year. The iPhone price point for iPhone 12 moved up a bit. And I guess the difference, the gap between 12 and 12 Pro is smaller. And I guess that's after you made some adjustments years prior where the price points came down a bit. Can you talk through the thought process behind that and the potential implications for either unit elasticity or blended ASP as a result of the price changes?",91
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2020",2020-10-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3636.0,2154196.0,84651543.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,42,"Well, the iPhone 12 family starts at $699 in many places because you get -- and the deals that people are really paying are very different than that because a lot of people, particularly in this country but also in several of other countries in the world, connect to a carrier plan. And of course, those offers are much more aggressive. And so the price that a customer is paying is probably the most important one. 
The iPhone 12 is at $799, and so I think what you're saying is there's a $200 difference there. But I would guess that people are viewing it more as a $300 difference between the 12 mini and the 12 Pro. And so we'll see what the mix turns out. Right now, we have no data other than 12 and 12 Pro. We lack the data on the 12 mini and the Pro Max because we're not taking orders yet. But what we try to always do in pricing is give the customer a great value, and I feel like we really did that this year. And that's despite, as was mentioned earlier, all of the extra features that we placed into the phones, including 5G. Thanks for the question.",206

As a follow-up, the -- you mentioned some of the carrier incentives we've seen here in the U.S. And if you could provide some more color about that, about what you're seeing now. And obviously, as we went through years ago, the incentives from carriers were a lot larger. Does this mark some shift in the approach of carriers as we're moving into 5G? What's the extent of the permanence of some of these incentives? And then as 5G rolls out around the world into other geographies, is this something we should expect that as either they try to protect from switchers or kind of promote the 5G networks, we'll see a higher prevalence of incentives from carriers as we go forward?",124

That would be up to them to talk about their plans. Generally, I think it's, to the vast, vast majority of carriers around the world, to their -- in their interest to move customers to 5G, and I think it's in the customers' interest to move to 5G. And obviously, we like that as well. And so I think you have a situation where everyone's oaring in the same direction. And that's a very different kind of situation than normally we would have. 
And so it is one of the things, as I alluded to earlier, that makes me very bullish, only one though -- the other things are very important, too, the size of the installed base, the product lineup. These things are critically important as well.",138
