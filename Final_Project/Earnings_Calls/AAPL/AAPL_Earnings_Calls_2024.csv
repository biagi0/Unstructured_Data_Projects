Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $119.6 billion for the December quarter, up 2% from a year ago despite having 1 less week in the quarter. EPS was $2.18, up 16% from a year ago and an all-time record. We achieved revenue records across more than 2 dozen countries and regions, including all-time records in Europe and rest of Asia Pacific. We also continued to see strong double-digit growth in many emerging markets, with all-time records in Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland and Turkey, as well as December quarter records in India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Chile.
In Services, we set an all-time revenue record with paid subscriptions growing double digits year-over-year. And I'm pleased to announce today that we have set a new record for our installed base, which has now surpassed 2.2 billion active devices. We are announcing these results on the eve of what is sure to be an historic day as we enter the era of spatial computing. Starting tomorrow, Apple Vision Pro, the most advanced personal electronics device ever, will be available in Apple Stores for customers in the U.S., with expansion to other countries later this year.
Apple Vision Pro is a revolutionary device built on decades of Apple innovation, and it's years ahead of anything else. Apple Vision Pro has a groundbreaking new input system and thousands of innovations, and it will unlock incredible experiences for users and developers that are simply not possible on any other device. There's already so much excitement behind this product from reviewers, customers and developers. They are praising everything from the incredible experience of watching a movie on a 100-foot screen to remarkable new machine learning capabilities like hand tracking and room mapping. We can't wait for people to experience the magic for themselves.
Moments like these are what we live for at Apple. They are why we do what we do. They're why we're so unflinchingly dedicated to groundbreaking innovation and why we're so focused on pushing technology to its limits as we work to enrich the lives of our users. As we look ahead, we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future. That includes artificial intelligence where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we're excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year.
Now let's turn to the results for the December quarter, beginning with iPhone. We're proud to report that revenue came in at $69.7 billion, 6% higher than a year ago. The iPhone 15 lineup has earned glowing reviews and been embraced by customers. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature a gorgeous new design with color-infused back glass and contoured edges, Dynamic Island, A16 Bionic and a new 48-megapixel camera system. And the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max set the gold standard for smartphones with a beautiful and lighter titanium design, industry-leading performance with A17 Pro and our most advanced camera system with the equivalent of 7 Pro lenses and the ability to record spatial video. Features like Emergency SOS and Roadside Assistance via satellite bring peace of mind to users when they travel, and I'm grateful for every note I've received about their life-saving impact.
Turning to Mac. Revenue came in at $7.8 billion, up 1% year-over-year, driven by the strength of our latest M3-powered MacBook Pro models in spite of having 1 less week of sales. Just last week, we got to wish Mac a happy 40th birthday. When it was introduced 40 years ago, Mac changed everything, and through the years, it has done so again and again. Recently, we have been on a tremendous pace of innovation. Since the introduction of Apple Silicon in 2020, we've been proud to offer our users unmatched performance and power along with a remarkable neural engine for artificial intelligence and machine learning.
This past fall, we had an amazing launch of the latest generation of Apple Silicon for Mac: M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max. These chips break new ground in power and performance, empowering users to do more than they ever could before, whether they're making a musical masterpiece using the latest features in Logic Pro or beating their high score in a graphics-intensive game. A favorite among students, business owners, artists and video editors, our MacBook Pro lineup is the world's best Pro notebook family. And iMac, the world's most capable and best-selling all-in-one is now faster than ever, thanks to M3.
In iPad, revenue for the December quarter was $7 billion, down 25% year-over-year due to a difficult compare with the launch of the M2 iPad Pro and the tenth-generation iPad during the December quarter last year and 1 less week of sales. iPad remains the most versatile, capable and elegant tablet on the market today. It continues to be the go-to device for students, creatives and more, with customers loving iPad's incredible combination of portability and performance. Powerful apps like Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro for iPad allow video and music creators to unleash their creativity in new ways that are only possible on iPad. iPad continues to push the boundaries of what's possible on a tablet.
In Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue came in at $12 billion, down 11% from a year ago due to a difficult compare with the launch timing of several products in this category and the impact of the 14th week last year. Across our latest Apple Watch lineup, we're enabling and encouraging our users to live a healthier day while making Apple Watch even more intuitive to use. The new Double Tap gesture on Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 make it easier to answer calls, play and pause music or take a photo with iPhone. I've been deeply moved by the many touching stories about how features like Irregular Rhythm Notification and Fall Detection helped Apple Watch users when they needed it most. And for the first time ever, users can choose a carbon-neutral option of any new Apple Watch.
Meanwhile, our AirPods lineup continued to be a holiday favorite. In Services, we set an all-time revenue record of $23.1 billion, an 11% year-over-year increase. Because we had 1 less week this quarter, this growth represents an acceleration from the September quarter. And we achieved all-time revenue records across advertising, cloud services, payment services and video as well as December quarter records in App Store and AppleCare.
Across our services, we're constantly growing our offerings to give users even more to love. With the redesigned Apple TV app, we've made it easier for subscribers to enjoy all their favorite shows, movies and sports, including Apple TV+ hits like Masters of the Air, Monarch, and Slow Horses. We're proud to be a part of Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, a film that has moved audiences and earned more than 200 accolades, including Best Film of the Year from the New York Film Critics Circle, 9 BAFTA nominations, a Golden Globe win and 10 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. Across all Apple TV+ productions, we've now earned 2,050 award nominations and 450 wins since we've introduced the service.
We're also excited to have a new season of Major League Soccer kicking off this month. We're looking forward to seeing Lionel Messi return to the field and to following all of our favorite teams in what is sure to be an incredible season. And we're counting down to the Apple Music Super Bowl Halftime Show featuring Usher.
Turning to retail. In recent months, we opened 3 stores, including our 100th store in Asia Pacific. Throughout the holidays, our team members pulled out all the stops to help customers find the perfect gift. And I know our U.S. team members are especially excited to begin demoing Apple Vision Pro for our customers tomorrow.
At Apple, we live and breathe innovation. We are driven to pioneer new technology that can enrich our customers' lives, and we're just as intentional about showing up with our values and being a force for good in the world. February is Black History Month, and to honor it, we've launched our new Black Unity collection, which includes the Black Unity Sport Loop band. This year's designs reflect a lasting commitment to working toward a more equitable world. We also continue to do essential work through our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, and we're proud to continue providing grants to organizations that are making a real impact in the world.
In recent months, we've also taken significant strides in our environmental work. We're partnering with suppliers to bring more clean energy online for Apple production. We're using more recycled materials than ever before and more energy-efficient transportation than ever before. And each day, we are taking more and more steps toward becoming 100% carbon-neutral across all of our products by 2030.
Apple is a company that has never shied away from big challenges. That's because we are grounded by a deep sense of purpose and guided by a core belief in the transformative power of innovation. And so we are optimistic about the future, confident in the long term and as excited as we've ever been to deliver for our users like only Apple can. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.",1572
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2024",2024-02-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3386.0,3010150.0,110011277.0,Presenter Speech,Luca Maestri,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the December quarter was $119.6 billion, up 2% from last year. During the December quarter a year ago, 2 unique factors affected our results: first, we had an additional week in the quarter; and second, we had COVID-related factory shutdowns that limited iPhone supply. We estimate that the net impact of these 2 factors resulted in a 2 percentage point headwind to our revenue performance this quarter. We set all-time revenue records in Europe and rest of Asia Pacific and continue to see strong performance across our emerging markets, with double-digit growth in the majority of the emerging markets we track.
Products revenue was $96.5 billion, flat compared to last year, driven by strength in iPhone, offset by challenging compares for iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories and 1 less week of sales this year across the entire portfolio. Thanks to our unparalleled customer loyalty and very strong levels of customer satisfaction, our total installed base of active devices set a new record across all products and all geographic segments and is now over 2.2 billion active devices.
Services revenue set an all-time record of $23.1 billion, up 11% year-over-year. When we take into account the extra week last year, this represents a sequential acceleration of growth from the September quarter. We're very pleased with our Services performance in both developed and emerging markets, with all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia Pacific.
Company gross margin was 45.9%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 39.4%, up 280 basis points sequentially, also driven by leverage and mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 72.8%, up 190 basis points from last quarter due to a more favorable mix. Operating expenses of $14.5 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided and up 1% year-over-year. Net income was $33.9 billion, up $3.9 billion from last year. Diluted EPS was $2.18, up 16% versus last year and an all-time record, and operating cash flow was very strong at $39.9 billion.
Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $69.7 billion, up 6% year-over-year. We set all-time records in several countries and regions, including Latin America, Western Europe, the Middle East and Korea as well as December quarter records in India and Indonesia. Our iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high, and we had an all-time record number of iPhone upgraders during the quarter. Customers are loving the new iPhone 15 family, with the latest reports from 451 Research indicating customer satisfaction of 99% in the U.S. In fact, many iPhone models were among the top-selling smartphones around the world during the quarter. According to a survey from Kantar, iPhones were 4 out of the top 5 models in the U.S. and Japan; 4 out of the top 6 models in urban China and the U.K. and all top 5 models in Australia.
Mac generated revenue of $7.8 billion and returned to growth despite 1 less week of sales this year. This represents a significant acceleration from the September quarter when we faced a challenging compare due to the supply disruptions and subsequent demand recapture we experienced a year ago. Customer response to our latest iMac and MacBook Pro models powered by the M3 chips has been great, and our Mac installed base reached an all-time high, with almost half of Mac buyers during the quarter being new to the product. Also, 451 Research recently reported customer satisfaction of 97% for Mac in the U.S.
iPad was $7 billion in revenue, down 25% year-over-year. iPad faced a difficult compare because during the December quarter last year, we launched the new iPad Pro and iPad 10th generation, and we had an extra week of sales. However, the iPad installed base continues to grow and is an all-time high with over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter being new to the product. And customer satisfaction for iPad was recently measured at 98% in the U.S.
Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $12 billion, down 11% year-over-year due to a challenging launch compare and the extra week a year ago. This time last year, we had the full quarter benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro second generation, the Watch SE and the first Watch Ultra. We continue to attract new customers to Apple Watch. Nearly 2/3 of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product. And the latest report from 451 Research indicates customer satisfaction of 96% in the U.S.
And in Services, we were very pleased with our double-digit growth, which was driven by the strength of our ecosystem. Our installed base is now over 2.2 billion active devices and continues to grow nicely, establishing a solid foundation for the future expansion of our Services business. And we continue to see increased customer engagement with our services. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high with paid accounts growing double digits year-over-year. Also, our paid subscriptions showed strong double-digit growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only 4 years ago.
Finally, we continue to build on the breadth and the quality of our current services. From Oscar-nominated theatrical releases with Apple TV+, to more publications on News+ like The Atlantic and exciting new games on Arcade.
Turning to enterprise, we continue to see many business customers leverage Apple products to improve productivity and drive innovation. Target recently added the latest M3 MacBook Pro to their existing deployment of thousands of Macs, enabling employees across various departments to do their best work. In emerging markets, Zoho, a leading technology company headquartered in India, offers its 15,000-plus global employees a choice of devices, with 80% of their workforce using iPhone for work and nearly 2/3 of them choosing Mac as their primary computer.
With the upcoming launch of Apple Vision Pro, we are seeing strong excitement in enterprise. Leading organizations across many industries such as Walmart, Nike, Vanguard, Stryker, Bloomberg and SAP have started leveraging and investing in Apple Vision Pro as the new platform to bring innovative spatial computing experiences to their customers and employees. From everyday productivity to collaborative product design to immersive training, we cannot wait to see the amazing things our enterprise customers will create in the months and years to come.
Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $173 billion in cash and marketable securities. We decreased commercial paper by $4 billion, leaving us with total debt of $108 billion. As a result, net cash was, $65 billion at the end of the quarter, and our goal of becoming net cash neutral over time remains unchanged. During the quarter, we returned nearly $27 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $20.5 billion through open market repurchases of 112 million Apple shares. We also retired an additional 6 million shares in the final settlement of our 19th ASR. As usual, we will provide an update to our capital return program when we report results at the end of this quarter.
As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. And we expect foreign exchange to be a revenue headwind of about 2 percentage points on a year-over-year basis.
As a reminder, in the December quarter a year ago, we faced significant supply constraints on the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max due to COVID-19 factory shutdowns. And in the March quarter a year ago, we were able to replenish channel inventory and fulfill significant pent-up demand from the constraints. We estimate that this impact added close to $5 billion to the March quarter's total revenue last year. When we remove this impact from last year's revenue, we expect both our March quarter total company revenue and iPhone revenue to be similar to a year ago.
For our Services business, we expect a similar double-digit growth rate to what we reported in the December quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 46% and 47%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.3 billion and $14.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock payable on February 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of February 12, 2024. 
With that, let's open the call to questions.",1509

Luca, maybe if we start with you, can you unpackage some of the Services drivers a bit for us? Obviously, really nice outperformance in the December quarter versus your expectations. A record gross margin implies your higher-margin businesses were likely the sources of outperformance. But can you maybe just clarify a bit how we should think about Services growth for the March quarter? And then speak to some of those underlying drivers in the December quarter and then in the March quarter, what the different puts and takes would be. And then I have a follow-up, please.",107

Let's start with the December quarter. As we said, up 11%, $23.1 billion is an all-time record for us, with all-time records in the Americas, in Europe and the rest of Asia Pac. So it was pretty broad-based geographically and very strong across all the Services categories because we had all-time revenue records for cloud, for payments, for video and for advertising and December quarter records for the App Store and for AppleCare.
Obviously, last year, we had an extra week so the 11% is stronger than -- the underlying performance is stronger than 11% that we have reported. I think the entire ecosystem is doing well because we continue to see growth and new all-time highs in both transacting accounts and paid accounts, which is obviously very important. And paid subscriptions continue to grow strong double digits.
Just as a reference, we have more than 1 billion paid subscriptions across all the services on our platform. This is more than double the number of paid subscriptions that we had only 4 years ago, so obviously very significant growth there. What I said during the prepared remarks around the March quarter, I mentioned that we will continue to grow double digits at a percentage that is similar to what we reported for the December quarter. We don't provide guidance around the different Services category so we will provide more color when we report in 3 months.",241

And then, Tim, really nice to see your installed base reach a record high, again, against all products and geos. I'm wondering if you could share a bit more detail about the new users you were able to onboard over the last 12 months, meaning how might this new cohort look different from past cohorts either in terms of geographic representation or skew to certain products or even how their monetization trends might differ from past cohorts.",78

Erik, I would say emerging markets are -- have been a very key area of strength for us. If you look at it, India grew, in revenue terms, grew strong double digits in the December quarter and hit a quarter revenue record. The other emerging markets like Indonesia also hit a quarterly record, and we had several regions with records from Latin America to the Middle East. And that theme has been pretty consistent across the other quarters of the year as well. And so emerging markets, very, very important, and I feel like we're doing a great job there.",101

First on Services. Just on the outlook for the March quarter for a similar double-digit growth rate as the December quarter, I'm just wondering why not -- why won't it be potentially faster, given that the December quarter obviously had a headwind from the extra week comp, and I also think that some of the pricing uplifts on select Apple One services that were implemented last winter should help in the March quarter. Any additional thoughts there would be great in terms of what some of your assumptions are. And then I have a quick follow-up.",103

We'll see how the quarter develops. I would point to 2 things. One is the fact that we mentioned that we expect a couple of points of negative foreign exchange in the March quarter, and foreign exchange was essentially flat for us in the December quarter. So you've got a bit of a headwind there. And then when you look at the progression of our Services business over the last few quarters, the compares for March are slightly more difficult than the compares for December.",86

We are incredibly excited about the enterprise opportunities with Vision Pro. I've seen several demos from different companies. Luca mentioned several in his opening remarks, but Walmart has a very cool merchandising app. There are firms that are doing collaboration, design collaboration apps. There are field service applications. Really all over the map. There are applications that are for control center, command center kind of things.
SAP has really gotten behind it and, of course, SAP is in so many of companies that I think there will be a great opportunity for us in enterprise, and we couldn't be more excited about where things are right now. We're obviously looking forward to tomorrow. This has been multiple years of efforts from so many people across Apple. And really, it took a whole of company effort to bring it to this far.
In terms of generative AI, which I would guess is your focus, we have a lot of work going on internally as I've alluded to before. Our MO, if you will, has always been to do work and then talk about work and not to get out in front of ourselves. And so we're going to hold that to this as well. But we've got some things that we're incredibly excited about that we'll be talking about later this year.",222

We were up 6% as we mentioned in the opening remarks. We're happy with that performance. Underneath there, we had really strong performance in several parts of the world, with all-time records in Europe and rest of Asia Pacific. As I've mentioned earlier, we did particularly well in several emerging markets from Latin America to the Middle East, and we set December quarter records in India and Indonesia, and so really some spectacular broad-based reactions to iPhone.
We also, importantly, set an all-time record worldwide for iPhone upgraders. And the installed base hit a new all-time high, consistent with the -- our overall devices. And so there's a lot of good things. Luca mentioned in his opening comments that iPhones were 4 out of the top 5 smartphone models in the U.S. and Japan and 4 out of the top 6 in urban China and the U.K. and all top 5 in Australia. And this customer satisfaction level for iPhone 15 hit 99%.
If you look at iPhone 15 since the announcement of it and shipment in September, so this is including some of Q4, and you compare that to iPhone 14 over the same period of time, iPhone 15 is outselling iPhone 14. And so we feel very good about that, and the upgraders hitting a record is particularly exciting for us.",226

And as a follow-up, obviously, you're just launching the Vision Pro and it's an entirely new category. It's a price point that's a much higher starting price point relative to most of your other, probably over the last decade, product introductions. But just wondering, how would you measure the success of Vision Pro over time? And which Apple product's adoption curve would you look at as potentially the most similar? And is there a way in which we could think Vision Pro could eclipse maybe something like the iPad in revenue over time?",94

I would just say we couldn't be more excited internally. We've gotten an incredible amount of excitement from developers and from customers that can't wait until tomorrow to pick up their units. And we're incredibly proud to be able to demo the unit in so many of our stores in the U.S. starting tomorrow for people that are -- that want to check it out.
And so we'll see and report the results of it in the Wearables category that you're familiar with. I think that if you look at it from a price point of view, there's an incredible amount of technology that's packed into the product. There's 5,000 patents in the product. And it's, of course, built on many innovations that Apple has spent multiple years on, from silicon to displays and significant AI and machine learning, all the hand tracking, the room mapping, all of this stuff is driven by AI. And so we're incredibly excited about it. I can't wait to be in the store for tomorrow and see the reaction myself.",195

I guess, first, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what are you seeing in China right now. I think from a geographic basis, one of the few places that was down double digits while everything else was growing. So I'm hoping you'd spend a bit of time discussing what are you seeing there from a competitive perspective and more importantly from a demand perspective in China.",75

If you look at iPhone in China Mainland, which I think has been the focus of a lot of interest and you look at it in constant currency, so more of an operational view, we were down mid-single digits on iPhone. And so it was the other things that drove the larger contraction year-over-year. On the good news side, we had solid growth on upgraders year-over-year in Mainland China, and we had 4 of the top 6 smartphone models in urban China. Also, IDC just put out a note that you may have seen that we were the top brand in -- for the full year and for the December quarter. And so there's some good news along with -- obviously, we'd prefer not to contract.",127

And then as a follow-up, you folks have implemented a fair bit of changes around the App Store in Europe post the DMA implementation there. Can you just touch on what are some of the key updates? And then Luca, net of it all, do you see it having any significant impact financially to your Services or the broader Apple P&L statement?",64

Let me try to answer a little bit of both and then Luca can add some comments to it. We announced a number of changes last week in Europe that would be in effect beginning in March, so the last month of the first calendar quarter, the second fiscal quarter. Those are -- some of the things that we announced include alternate billing opportunities, alternate app stores or marketplaces, if you will. We're also opening NFC for new capabilities for banking and wallet apps. And so these are some of the things that we announced.
If you think about what we've done over the years is we've really majored on privacy, security and usability. And we've tried our best to get as close to the past in terms of the things that are -- that people love about our ecosystem as we can. But we're going to fall short of providing the maximum amount that we could supply because of -- we need to comply with the regulation. And so in terms of predicting the choices that developers and users will make, it's very difficult to do that with precision. And so we'll see what happens in March.",199

I guess the first question I want to just ask and maybe unpack a little bit more, just remarkable trends that we're seeing in your product gross margins specifically. So I'm curious as we look forward, I guess on this last quarter, were there any kind of benefits you're seeing from like just the purchase component obligations that you put in place, let's say, a year ago and that flowing through? And how are you thinking about the component pricing environment as we think about that gross margin into the March quarter and looking forward?",104

On the products side, and then maybe I'll make a comment in total for the company, on the products side, our gross margins increased sequentially 280 basis points, so obviously a very significant increase. I would say the 2 primary components of the increase are a favorable mix. Of course, iPhone did very well. We did very well with our high-end models. And leverage, of course. It's the biggest quarter of the year for us and so we get the leverage effect.
We had a partial offset negative impact from foreign exchange, but net-net, obviously very significant improvement. And we had very similar dynamics on the Services side where we increased sequentially 190 basis points, also in this case, due to a more favorable mix. And so the combined effect of the 2 businesses gave us the 45.9% at the total company level, which is up 70% sequentially. You've heard from my prepared remarks that we are guiding total company gross margin to 46% to 47%, which is an additional expansion of margins compared to the already very strong results of the December quarter.",185

And then the second question I was just going to ask. Tim, you alluded to kind of your excitement around generative AI and some announcements that we should think about maybe later this year. One of the things that stands out for me is that your capital expenditures has actually come down this last year. I'm curious, as you look to lean in more to generative AI, is there something we should consider about the CapEx intensity at Apple to make investments to really set the table for a generative AI kind of platform as we move forward, just given some of the things that we've seen from some other large tech companies?",114

First one for Luca, a clarification and a question. The $5 billion impact in March quarter, is this for product revenue or is that total company revenue? And along the same path, you highlighted the strong gross margins, and I understand last year, some of the commodity costs are deflationary but it looks like it's going to be inflationary right now. And obviously, you've done some of the Mac conversions, silicon conversions. So I'm just trying to figure out how much juice is there more to squeeze on the gross margin side. And then I have a follow-up for Tim.",105
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2024",2024-02-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3386.0,3010150.0,110011308.0,Answer,Luca Maestri,,Executives,34,"Yes. The -- so the first part of the question was around the $5 billion. The $5 billion, as I mentioned, a year ago, we had this disruption of supply on iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max because of the factory shutdown due to the COVID-19 situation. And so essentially, there was pent-up demand. As we exited the December quarter, they got fulfilled. And we also did the channel fill associated with it during the March quarter. So the close to $5 billion that I mentioned is entirely related to iPhone.
On the gross margin side, obviously, we are at very high levels of gross margin. And I'll repeat what I said before, we've had good expansion over the last few quarters, and now we are guiding to 46% to 47%, and that takes into account everything that is going on, which is the commodity environment, which is the foreign exchange situation, and obviously, the product and services mix. And the outcome of this is the guidance, which obviously is very strong and we're very happy with it.",178

Tim, it was very interesting to hear your comments on enterprise. And historically, Apple has been a consumer-centric company. And now with Vision Pro, Macs, et cetera, penetrating more into the enterprise, I'm kind of curious how to think about Apple of the future. Would it still be consumer-centric or do you think it's going to be more enterprise-focused also as we get into the future?",75

And so it sort of took some of the central command from the traditional company and decentralized the decision-making. That is a huge advantage for Apple because there's a lot of people out there that want to use a Mac. They're using a Mac at home. They'd like to use one in the office as well.
iPad has also benefited from that. Vision Pro, it's -- when you look at the ton of use cases, I mean, we're starting with 1 million apps and 600-plus that are -- have been designed particularly for Vision Pro. When I look at what is coming out of enterprise, it's some of the most innovative things I've seen come out of enterprise in a long time. And so I think there's -- like there is for the Mac and iPad, and of course, iPhone has been in enterprise since the early days of iPhone, I think there's a nice opportunity there for Vision Pro as well.",206

So Tim and Luca, I appreciate the strength in the emerging markets like India and the other names that you kind of listed on the call. But can you maybe spend some time on the Americas? Obviously, that was relatively flat. You touched on China. What are you seeing in that market from the carriers here in the States? And is the sales cycle elongating or the replacement cycle elongating? And in your view, what has to change to kind of maybe reaccelerate that business in the Americas, particularly in the iPhone business?
And then on sort of -- I just want to make sure I understand sort of the guide. So when I think about the $5 billion pull-forward last year in the March quarter from a channel fill perspective, even if I backed that out last quarter or I back it up this quarter, the March quarter, this would be sort of the softest quarter since the COVID pandemic. Obviously, I know the Americas, as I just touched on, is a little bit softer and China, which you cleared up earlier. But how do you think about the differences in sort of the macro conditions by region? And again, do you have a sense for, are we nearing a trough from a macro demand perspective? Or how long do you think this particular weakness persists?",233

If you look at the U.S., which is -- obviously drives the vast, vast majority of the revenue in Americas, we grew in the December quarter from an iPhone business point of view. And the installed base hit an all-time high. If you look at the replacement cycle, it's very difficult to measure the replacement cycle at any given point. And so what we focus on internally a lot is the active installed base and the -- obviously, the sales over usually a cycle, and we feel better about those things.
If you look at the -- who's selling what in the U.S., the iPhone is 4 out of the top 5 selling smartphones in the U.S. And of course, the customer satisfaction in the U.S., as we alluded to earlier, is 99%. So we feel very, very good about what our position is in the U.S.",158

On the March quarter guide, I would point to you that, obviously, the COVID years had a lot of, let's say, turmoil in it, a lot of volatility that typically you wouldn't see.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $90.8 billion and an EPS record of $1.53 for the March quarter. We set revenue records in more than a dozen countries and regions. These include, among others, March quarter records in Latin America and the Middle East as well as Canada, India, Spain and Turkey. We also achieved an all-time revenue record in Indonesia, one of the many markets where we continue to see so much potential.
In Services, we set an all-time revenue record, up 14% over the past year. Keep in mind, as we described on the last call, in the March quarter a year ago, we were able to replenish iPhone channel inventory and fulfill significant pent-up demand from the December quarter COVID-related supply disruptions on the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max. We estimate this onetime impact added close to $5 billion to the March quarter revenue last year. If we removed this from last year's results, our March quarter total company revenue this year would have grown. Despite this impact, we were still able to deliver the records I described.
Of course, this past quarter, we were thrilled to launch Apple Vision Pro, and it has been so wonderful to hear from people who now get to experience the magic of spatial computing. They described the impossible becoming possible right before their eyes, and they share their amazement and their emotions about what they can do now, whether it's reliving their most treasured memories or having a movie theater experience right in their living room.
It's also great to see the enthusiasm from the enterprise market. For example, more than half of the Fortune 100 companies have already bought Apple Vision Pro units and are exploring innovative ways to use it to do things that weren't possible before. And this is just the beginning.
Looking ahead, we're getting ready for an exciting product announcement next week that we think our customers will love. And next month, we have our Worldwide Developers Conference, which has generated enormous enthusiasm from our developers. We can't wait to reveal what we have in store.
We continue to feel very bullish about our opportunity in generative AI. We are making significant investments, and we're looking forward to sharing some very exciting things with our customers soon. We believe in the transformative power and promise of AI, and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era, including Apple's unique combination of seamless hardware, software, and services integration, groundbreaking Apple silicon with our industry-leading neural engines, and our unwavering focus on privacy, which underpins everything we create. As we push innovation forward, we continue to manage thoughtfully and deliberately through an uneven macroeconomic environment and remain focused on putting our users at the center of everything we do.
Now let's turn to our results for the March quarter across each product category beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue for the March quarter was $46 billion, down 10% year-over-year. We faced a difficult compare over the previous year due to the $5 billion impact that I mentioned earlier. However, we still saw growth on iPhone in some markets including Mainland China, and according to Kantar, during the quarter, the 2 bestselling smartphones in urban China were the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Max.
I was in China recently where I had the chance to meet with developers and creators who are doing remarkable things with iPhone. And just a couple of weeks ago, I visited Vietnam, Indonesia and Singapore, where it was incredible to see all the ways customers and communities are using our products and services to do amazing things. Everywhere I travel, people have such a great affinity for Apple, and it's one of the many reasons I'm so optimistic about the future.
Turning to Mac. March quarter revenue was $7.5 billion, up 4% from a year ago. We had an amazing launch in early March with the new 13- and 15-inch MacBook Air. The world's most popular laptop is the best consumer laptop for AI with breakthrough performance of the M3 chip and its even more powerful neural engine. Whether it's an entrepreneur starting a new business or a college student finishing their degree, users depend on the power and portability of MacBook Air to take them places they couldn't have gone without it.
In iPad, revenue for the March quarter was $5.6 billion, 17% lower year-over-year due to a difficult compare with the momentum following the launch of M2 iPad Pro and the 10th generation iPad last fiscal year. iPad continues to stand apart for its versatility, power and performance. For video editors, music makers and creatives of all kinds, iPad is empowering users to do more than they ever could with a tablet.
Across Wearables, Home and Accessories, March quarter revenue was $7.9 billion, down 10% from a year ago due to a difficult launch compare on Watch and AirPods. Apple Watch is helping runners go the extra mile on their wellness journeys, keeping hikers on course with the latest navigation capabilities in watchOS 10 and enabling users of all fitness levels to live a healthier day. Across our Watch lineup, we're harnessing AI and machine learning to power life-saving features like irregular rhythm notifications and fall detection. I often hear about how much these features mean to users and their loved ones, and I'm thankful that so many people are able to get help in their time of greatest need.
As I shared earlier, we set an all-time revenue record in Services with $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year. We also achieved all-time revenue records across several categories and geographic segments. Audiences are tuning in on screens large, small and spatial and are enjoying Apple TV+ originals like Palm Royale and Sugar. And we have some incredible theatrical releases coming this year, including Wolves, which reunites George Clooney and Brad Pitt. Apple TV+ productions continue to be celebrated as major awards contenders. Since launch, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,100 award nominations and 480 wins.
Meanwhile, we're enhancing the live sports experience with a new iPhone app, Apple Sports. This free app allows fans to follow their favorite teams and leagues with real-time scores, stats and more. Apple Sports is the perfect companion for MLS Season Pass subscribers. 
Turning to retail. Our stores continue to be vital spaces for connection and innovation. I was delighted to be in Shanghai for the opening of our latest flagship store. The energy and enthusiasm from our customers was truly something to behold. And across the United States, our incredible retail teams have been sharing Vision Pro demos with customers, delighting them with a profound and emotional experience of using it for the very first time.
Everywhere we operate, in everything we do, we're guided by our mission to enrich users' lives and leave the world better than we found it, whether we're making Apple Podcasts more accessible with a new transcripts feature or helping to safeguard iMessage users' privacy with new protections that can defend against advances in quantum computing. 
Our environmental work is another great example of how innovation and our values come together. As we work toward our goal of being carbon neutral across all of our products by 2030, we are proud of how we've been able to innovate and do more for our customers while taking less from the planet. Since 2015, Apple has cut our overall emissions by more than half, while revenue grew nearly 65% during that same time period. And we're now using more recycled materials in our products than ever before.
Earlier this spring, we launched our first-ever product to use 50% recycled materials with the new M3-powered MacBook Air. We're also investing in new solar and wind power in the U.S. and Europe, both to power our growing operations and our users' devices. And we're working with partners in India and the U.S. to replenish 100% of the water we use in places that need it most, with the goal of delivering billions of gallons of water benefits over the next 2 decades.
Through our Restore Fund, Apple has committed $200 million to nature-based carbon removal projects. And last month, we welcomed 2 supplier partners as new investors who will together invest up to an additional $80 million in the fund. Whether we're enriching lives of users across the globe or doing our part to be a force for good in the world, we do everything with a deep sense of purpose at Apple. And I'm proud of the impact we've already made at the halfway point in a year of unprecedented innovation. I couldn't be more excited for the future we have ahead of us, driven by the imagination and innovation of our teams and the enduring importance of our products and services in people's lives.
With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.",1500
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q2 2024 Earnings Call, May 02, 2024",2024-05-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3471.0,3108090.0,112253014.0,Presenter Speech,Luca Maestri,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the March quarter was $90.8 billion, down 4% from last year. Foreign exchange had a negative year-over-year impact of 140 basis points on our results. Products revenue was $66.9 billion, down 10% year-over-year due to the challenging compare on iPhone that Tim described earlier, which was partially offset by strength from Mac. And thanks to our unparalleled customer satisfaction and loyalty and a high number of customers who are new to our products, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and all geographic segments.
Services revenue set an all-time record of $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year with record performance in both developed and emerging markets. Company gross margin was 46.6%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by cost savings and favorable mix to Services partially offset by leverage. Products gross margin was 36.6%, down 280 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by seasonal loss of leverage and mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin was 74.6%, up 180 basis points from last quarter due to a more favorable mix. Operating expenses of $14.4 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided and up 5% year-over-year. Net income was $23.6 billion. Diluted EPS was $1.53 and a March quarter record. And operating cash flow was strong at $22.7 billion.
Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $46 billion, down 10% year-over-year due to the almost $5 billion impact from a year ago that Tim described earlier. Adjusting for this onetime impact, iPhone revenue would be roughly flat to last year. Our iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment. And during the March quarter, we saw many iPhone models as the top-selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, an iPhone was the top-selling model in the U.S., urban China, Australia, the U.K., France, Germany and Japan. And the iPhone 15 family continues to be very popular with customers. 451 Research recently measured customer satisfaction at 99% in the U.S.
Mac revenue was $7.5 billion, up 4% year-over-year, driven by the strength of our new MacBook Air powered by the M3 chip. Customers are loving the incredible AI performance of the latest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models. And our Mac installed base reached an all-time high with half of our MacBook Air buyers during the quarter being new to Mac. Also, customer satisfaction for Mac was recently reported at 96% in the U.S.
iPad generated $5.6 billion in revenue, down 17% year-over-year. iPad continued to face a challenging compare against the launch of the M2 iPad Pro and iPad 10th generation from last year. At the same time, the iPad installed base has continued to grow and is at an all-time high, as over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. In addition, the latest report from 451 Research indicated customer satisfaction of 96% for iPad in the U.S.
Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $7.9 billion, down 10% year-over-year due to a difficult launch compare. Last year, we had the continued benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro second generation, the Watch SE and the first Watch Ultra. Apple Watch continues to attract new customers with almost 2/3 of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product, sending the Apple Watch installed base to a new all-time high. And customer satisfaction was recently measured at 95% in the U.S.
In Services, as I mentioned, total revenue reached an all-time record of $23.9 billion, growing 14% year-over-year with our installed base of active devices continuing to grow at a nice pace. This provides a strong foundation for the future growth of the services business as we continue to see increased customer engagement with our ecosystem.
Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high, with paid accounts growing double digits year-over-year. And paid subscriptions showed strong double-digit growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only 4 years ago. We continue to improve the breadth and quality of our current services from creating new games on Arcade and great new shows on TV+ to launching additional countries and partners for Apple Pay.
Turning to enterprise. Our customers continue to invest in Apple products to drive productivity and innovation. We see more and more enterprise customers embracing the MAC. In health care, Epic Systems, the world's largest electronic medical record provider, recently launched its native app for the Mac, making it easier for health care organizations like Emory Health to transition thousands of PCs to the Mac for clinical use.
And since the launch of Vision Pro last quarter, many leading enterprise customers have been investing in this amazing new product to bring spatial computing apps and experiences to life. We are seeing so many compelling use cases from aircraft engine maintenance training at KLM Airlines to real-time team collaboration for racing a Porsche to immersive kitchen design at Lowe's. We couldn't be more excited about the special computing opportunity in enterprise.
Taking a quick step back. When we look at our performance during the first half of our fiscal year, total company revenue was roughly flat to the prior year in spite of having one less week of sales during the period and some foreign exchange headwinds. We were particularly pleased with our strong momentum in emerging markets. As we said, first half revenue records in several countries and regions, including Latin America, the Middle East, India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Turkey. These results, coupled with double-digit growth in Services and strong levels of gross margin, drove a first half diluted EPS record of $3.71, up 9% from last year.
Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $162 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $3.2 billion in maturing debt, and commercial paper was unchanged sequentially, leaving us with total debt of $105 billion. As a result, net cash was $58 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $27 billion to shareholders, including $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $23.5 billion through open market repurchases of 130 million Apple shares.
Given the continued confidence we have in our business now and into the future, our Board has authorized today an additional $110 billion for share repurchases as we maintain our goal of getting to net cash neutral over time. We're also raising our dividend by 4% to $0.25 per share of common stock, and we continue to plan for annual increases in the dividend going forward as we've done for the last 12 years. This cash dividend will be payable on May 16, 2024, to shareholders of record as of May 13, 2024.
As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect our June quarter total company revenue to grow low single digits year-over-year in spite of a foreign exchange headwind of about 2.5 percentage points. We expect our Services business to grow double digits at a rate similar to the growth we reported for the first half of the fiscal year. And we expect iPad revenue to grow double digits.
We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% and 46.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.3 billion and $14.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark to market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. 
With that, let's open the call to questions.",1345

First, I'll ask about the June quarter guidance, the revenue outlook for low single digits growth.

On the outlook, what we said is we expect to grow low single digits in total for the company. We expect Services to grow double digits at a rate that is similar to what we've done in the first half of our fiscal year. And we also mentioned that iPad should grow double digits. This is the color that we're providing for the June quarter.
In Services, we've seen very strong performance across the board. We've mentioned we've had records in several categories, in several geographic segments. It's very broad-based. Our subscription business is going well. Transacting accounts and paid accounts are growing. Paid accounts are growing double digits. And also, we've seen a really strong performance both in developed and emerging markets, so very pleased with the way the Services business is going.",137

And I wanted to ask about, as Apple leans more into AI and generative AI, should we expect any changes to the historical CapEx cadence that we've seen in the last few years of about $10 billion to $11 billion per year? Or any changes to how we may have historically thought about the split between tooling, data center, and facilities?",62

We are obviously very excited about the opportunity with GenAI. We obviously are pushing very hard on innovation on every front, and we've been doing that for many, many years. Just during the last 5 years, we spent more than $100 billion in research and development.
As you know, on the CapEx front, we have a bit of a hybrid model where we make some of the investments ourselves. In other cases, we share them with our suppliers and partners. On the manufacturing side, we purchase some of the tools and manufacturing equipment. In some of the cases, our suppliers make the investment.
And we do something similar on the data center side. We have our own data center capacity and then we use capacity from third parties. It's a model that has worked well for us historically, and we plan to continue along the same lines going forward.",150

It's primarily the fact that we had a slightly different mix of products than the previous one.

I'm just curious how Apple is thinking about the different ways in which you can monetize this technology because, historically, software upgrades haven't been a big factor in driving product cycles.

And then, Luca, maybe to just follow up on Wamsi's comments or question, there's a broad concern about the headwind that rising commodity costs have on your product gross margins. Wondering if you could just clarify for us, if we take a step back and look at all of the components and commodities that go into your products kind of collectively, are you seeing these costs rising? Are they falling? What tools do you have to try to help mitigate some rising costs if at all -- rising input costs if at all?",96

I mean, during the last quarter, commodity costs and in general, component costs have behaved favorably to us. On the memory front, prices are starting to go up. They've gone up slightly during the March quarter. But in general, I think it's been a period, not only this quarter but the last several quarters, where commodities have behaved well for us.
Commodities go in cycles, and so there's obviously always that possibility. Keep in mind that we are starting from a very high level of gross margins. We reported 46.6%, which is something that we haven't seen in our company in decades. And so we're starting from a good point. As you know, we try to buy ahead when the cycles are favorable to us. So we would try to mitigate if there are headwinds, but in general, we feel, particularly for this cycle, we are in good shape.",150

That's an acceleration from the previous quarter in Q1. And the primary driver of the acceleration was iPhone. And if you then look at iPhone within Mainland China, we grew on a reported basis. That's before any kind of normalization for the supply disruption that we mentioned earlier.
And if you look at the top-selling smartphones, the top 2 in urban China are iPhones. And while I was there, it was a great visit, and we opened a new store in Shanghai and the reception was very warm and highly energetic. And so I left there having a fantastic trip and enjoyed being there. And so I maintain a great view of China in the long term.

And then my follow-up, I want to ask this carefully, though. It's -- there's a fear out there that you may lose some traffic acquisition revenue. And I was wondering if you thought AI, from a big picture -- and it doesn't have to be on a long-term basis, I mean, from a big picture, if AI is an opportunity for you to continue to monetize your mobile real estate, just how you -- how maybe investors can think about that from a big picture just given that's been one of the concerns. That's potentially been an overhang, of course, due to a lot of the news in the media around some of the legal cases.

Very helpful. And then for Luca, I'm kind of curious on -- given the macro environment, on the hardware side, are you seeing a bias towards like standard iPhone versus the Pro model?

But in general, what we are seeing on the product side, we continue to see a lot of interest at the top of the range of our products. And I think it's a combination of consumers wanting to purchase the best product that we offer in the different categories and our ability to make those purchases more affordable over time.
We've introduced several financing solutions from installment plans to trade-in programs that reduce the affordability threshold and therefore, customers tend to buy -- want to buy at the top of the range. That is very valuable for us in developed markets but particularly in emerging markets where the affordability issues are more pronounced. But in general, over the last several years -- and that is also reflected in our gross margins. Over the last several years, we've seen this trend, which we think is pretty sustainable.",155

I guess first off on capital allocation. You folks have about $58 billion of net cash right now. As you think about eventually getting to this net cash neutral target, do you think, at some point, Apple would be open to taking on leverage on the balance sheet and continuing the buyback program? Or is it more like once you get to this neutral position, it's going to be about returning free cash flow back to shareholders? I'm just wondering, how do you think about leverage on your balance sheet over time? And what sort of leverage do you think you'd be comfortable taking on?",110

I would say one step at a time. We have put out this target of getting to net cash neutral several years ago, and we're working very hard to get there. Our free cash flow generation has been very strong over the years, particularly the last few years. And so as you've seen this year, we've increased the amount that we're allocating to the buyback.
For the last couple of years, we were doing $90 billion. Now we're doing $110 billion. So let's get there first. It's going to take a while still. And then when we are there, we're going to reassess and see what is the optimal capital structure for the company at that point in time. Obviously, there's going to be a number of considerations that we will need to look at when we get there.",143

I figured it's worth trying anyway. If I go back to this China discussion a bit, and Tim, I think your comments around growth in iPhones in Mainland China is really notable. Could you step back? I mean these numbers are still declining, at least Greater China, on a year-over-year basis in aggregate. Maybe just talk about what are you seeing from a macro basis in China. And then at least the annual decline -- or year-over-year decline that we're seeing, do you think it's more macro driven or more competitive driven over there? That would be helpful.",100

And so I don't want to present myself as an economist, so I'll steer clear of that. From -- what we saw was an acceleration from Q1, and it was driven by iPhone, and iPhone in Mainland China, before we adjust for this $5 billion impact that we talked about earlier, did grow. That means the other products didn't fare as well, and so we clearly have work there to do.
I think it has been and is, through last quarter, the most competitive market in the world. And I -- so I wouldn't say anything other than that. I've said that before and I believe that it was last quarter as well. And -- but if you step back from the 90-day cycle, what I see is a lot of people moving into the middle class. We try to serve customers very well there and have a lot of happy customers. And you can kind of see that in the latest store opening over there. And so I continue to feel very optimistic.",183

So Luca, obviously, I'm trying to parse through the outlook for the June quarter. And just based on the quick math, it looks like, all things being equal given what you said, the iPhone business is going to be down mid-single digits again in the June quarter. And if that's the case, and maybe this is for Tim, obviously, how are you thinking about the competitive landscape in the context of what you just said maybe outside of China?
And what changes sort of the consumer demand or receptivity to new devices because we've been in this malaise for a while? Is it really this AI initiative that a lot of companies are pursuing? And do you think that changes sort of the demand drivers going forward? Or is it just really more of a timing issue in terms of the replacement cycle is a little bit long in the tooth and we see a bit of an upgrade cycle at some point maybe later this year into next year?",184

And so I think that if you look out, that's not within the next quarter or so, and we don't guide at the product level, but I'm extremely optimistic. And so that's kind of how I view it. In terms of -- I'll let Luca comment on the outlook portion of it. I think if you step back on iPhone, though, and you make this adjustment from the previous year, our Q2 results would be flattish on iPhone. And so that's how we performed in Q2.",111

Maybe for the first one, your Services growth accelerated from 11% growth to 14%. If you can sort of dig into the drivers of where or which parts of services did you really see that acceleration and why is it a bit more sustainable as we think about the next quarter? Because I believe you're guiding more to sort of averaging out the first half of the year for the next quarter. So just curious what were the drivers. And why not have it a bit more sustainably sort of improve as we go through the remainder of the year? I have a quick follow-up.",111

First of all, the overall performance was very strong. As I said earlier, all-time records in both developed and emerging markets, so we see our Services do well across the world. Records in many of our Services categories, there are some categories that are growing very fast also because they are relatively smaller in the scheme of our Services business like cloud, video, payment services. Those all set all-time revenue records. So we feel very good about the progress that we're making in Services. 
As we go forward, I'll just point out that if you look at our growth rates a year ago, they improved during the course of the fiscal year last year. So the comps for the Services business become a bit more challenging as we go through the year. But in general, as I mentioned, we still expect to grow double digits in the June quarter at a rate that is very similar to what we've done in the first half.",171

And for my follow-up, if I can ask you more specifically about the India market. Obviously, you continue to make new records in terms of revenue in that market.

We did grow strong double digit, and so we were very, very pleased with that. It was a new March quarter revenue record for us. As I've said before, I see it as an incredibly exciting market and it's a major focus for us. In terms of the operational side or supply chain side, we are producing there.
From a pragmatic point of view, you need to produce there to be competitive. And so yes, there -- the 2 things are linked from that point of view. But we have both operational things going on, and we have go to market and initiatives going on. We just opened a couple of stores as -- last year, as you know, and we see enormous opportunity there. We're continuing to expand our channels and also working on the developer ecosystem as well. And we've been very pleased that there's a rapidly growing base of developers there. And so we're working all of the entire ecosystem from developer to the market to operations, the whole thing. And I just -- I could not be more excited and enthusiastic about it.",188

We were looking at something similar recently. Obviously, China is by far the largest emerging market that we have. But when we start looking at places like India, like Saudi, like Mexico, Turkey, of course, Brazil and Mexico and Indonesia, the numbers are getting large and we're very happy because these are markets where our market share is low. The populations are large and growing, and our products are really making a lot of progress with -- in those markets.
The level of excitement for the brand is very high. Tim was in Southeast Asia recently, and the level of excitement is incredibly high. So it is very good for us. And then -- and certainly, the numbers are getting larger all the time, and so the gap, as you compare it to the numbers in China, is reducing.

And then as a follow-up maybe for either of you, I mean, you're coming up on 4 years from what was an incredibly popular iPhone 12 cycle. And given you're struggling to reduce your net -- your -- reach your net neutral cash position and your margins are sort of near highs, do you see ways to deploy capital more to spur replacement demand in your installed base, either with greater device financing, more investment in marketing, more promotions?

And what that means, given that our company sells more than 60% of our revenues outside the United States, the demand for our products in those markets is stronger than the results that we report just because of the translation of those local currencies into dollars, right?
And so that is something to keep in mind as you look at our results, right? And so we are making all the investments that are needed, and Tim has talked about innovation.

And so it -- commands control centers.

Today, Apple is reporting a new June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, up 5% from a year ago, and better than we had expected. EPS grew double digits to $1.40 and achieved a record for the June quarter. We also set quarterly revenue records in more than 2 dozen countries and regions, including Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, the U.K., India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand. And we set an all-time revenue record in Services, which grew 14%.
At our Worldwide Developers Conference, we were thrilled to unveil game-changing updates across our platforms, including Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence builds on years of innovation and investment in AI and machine learning. It will transform how users interact with technology from Writing Tools to help you express yourself to Image Playground, which gives you the ability to create fun images and communicate in new ways, to powerful tools for summarizing and prioritizing notifications. Siri also becomes more natural, more useful, and more personal than ever.
Apple Intelligence is built on a foundation of privacy, both through on-device processing that does not collect users' data and through Private Cloud Compute, a groundbreaking new approach to using the cloud while protecting users' information powered by Apple Silicon. We are also integrating ChatGPT into experiences within iPhone, Mac, and iPad, enabling users to draw on a broad base of world knowledge. 
We are very excited about Apple Intelligence, and we remain incredibly optimistic about the extraordinary possibilities of AI and its ability to enrich customers' lives. We will continue to make significant investments in this technology and dedicate ourselves to the innovation that will unlock its full potential.
Recently, we've also been excited to bring Apple Vision Pro to more countries, giving customers the chance to discover the remarkable capabilities of this magical device. Vision Pro users are customizing their own workspaces, watching movies on 100-foot screens, and exploring entire worlds with just a pinch of their fingertips. With more than 2,500 native spatial apps and 1.5 million compatible apps for visionOS, the developer community continues to pioneer stunning spatial experiences that are only possible with Vision Pro.
Last month, we announced that we're bringing some amazing new immersive content to Vision Pro, including new series, concerts, films, and more. And we've seen great interest for Vision Pro in the enterprise, where it can empower companies large and small to pursue their best ideas like never before. With each innovation, we're unlocking new ways of working, new ways of learning, and new ways of tapping into the unlimited promise of human potential. We're doing that across every product and every service.
Now let me share more detail on our June quarter results, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue was $39.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, we grew compared to last year. Customers continue to praise the iPhone 15 lineup for its incredible battery life, exceptional cameras, and unmatched power and performance. And we are excited to bring incredible new features to the iPhone with iOS 18, making it more personal, capable and intelligent than ever before. This update includes the biggest redesign of the Photos app, new customization options for the home screen, messages over satellite, and the introduction of Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence utilizes the power of our most advanced iPhones, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, offering a transformative set of capabilities.
Mac revenue was $7 billion, up 2% from a year ago. Customers are loving the latest M3-powered 13- and 15-inch MacBook Air. With back-to-school season upon us, MacBook Air is the perfect companion for students on campus. And small business owners, developers, and creatives of all kinds depend on Mac to do more than they ever could before. Powered by Apple Silicon with its neural engine and privacy built in at the chip level, Macs are simply the best personal computers for AI. And every Mac we've shipped with Apple Silicon since 2020 is capable of taking advantage of Apple Intelligence with macOS Sequoia. We also know the importance of security for our users and enterprises so we continue to advance protections across our products.
Turning to iPad. Revenue was $7.2 billion, 24% higher year-over-year. During the quarter, we had an incredible launch where we unveiled the all-new 11- and 13-inch iPad Air, the perfect device for education, entertainment, and so much more. And with the new iPad Pro, we pushed the boundaries of power-efficient performance with a remarkable M4 chip, the engine behind this incredibly thin device. By leveraging the latest in Apple Silicon, video editors and musicians can take advantage of the cutting-edge AI features in Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro. And we're very excited that iPad Pro and iPad Air models powered by the M series of Apple Silicon will be able to utilize the powerful capabilities of Apple Intelligence.
In Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue was $8.1 billion, down 2% from a year ago. Apple Watch is empowering users to live a healthier day with a range of tools to take charge of their wellness journeys. At the core of Apple Watch are powerful AI features that are helping users get help when they need it most from irregular heart rhythm notifications to walking steadiness to crash detection and fall detection. I've heard time and again how meaningful these features are for users and their loved ones, and their stories motivate us to keep pushing forward on this vital work.
As I mentioned earlier, in Services, we set an all-time revenue record of $24.2 billion, with paid subscriptions climbing to an all-time high. We achieved revenue records in the majority of the Services categories with all-time revenue records in advertising, cloud, and payment services. 
Apple TV+ productions are delighting audiences on screens, large and small. We're sharing powerful works of imagination with series and movies like Presumed Innocent, the upcoming Disclaimer, and The Instigator starring Matt Damon. And we can't wait for returning fan favorites with new seasons of The Morning Show, Slow Horses, and Severance. Apple TV+ productions also continue to earn accolades with nearly 2,300 nominations and 500 wins today. That includes 72 Emmy Award nominations across 16 programs, our best ever showing for the upcoming awards event. 
During the quarter, we also expanded Tap to Pay on iPhone to more markets, including Japan, Canada, Italy, and Germany, enabling more businesses to use the power of iPhone to accept contactless payments. 
And we announced new updates to our Services coming this fall, including U.S. national park hikes and custom walk routes in Apple Maps, the ability to pay with rewards using Apple Pay, collaborative listening with Apple Music, and a redesigned Apple Fitness+ experience to help users make the most of our library of workouts and meditations.
Turning to retail. We continued to expand in emerging markets with our first ever location in Malaysia. Customers from all over the country came together with our team members to celebrate this special moment. Elsewhere in the world, our teams have been sharing the magic of Apple Vision Pro in demos that delight, inspire, and deeply move customers exploring the wonders of spatial computing for the first time.
At the heart of all of our innovations are the values that guide everything we do. We believe fundamentally that the best technology is technology that works for everyone. And in honor of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, we introduced all new capabilities to give users more ways to take advantage of all our products can do. These include eye tracking for users to control iPhone or iPad visually, music haptics to give those who are deaf or hard of hearing a tangible way to experience music, and vocal shortcuts that tie tasks to a user's voice.
And we are committed as ever to shipping products that offer the highest standards of privacy for our users. With everything we do, whether it's offering a browser like Safari that prevents third-parties from tracking you across the Internet, or providing new features like the ability to lock and hide apps, we are determined to keep our users in control of their own data. And we are just as dedicated to ensuring the security of our users' data. That's why we work to minimize the amount of data we collect and work to maximize how much is processed directly on people's devices, a foundational principle that is at the core of all we build, including Apple Intelligence.
And we continue to make significant progress on the environment. We are proud to say that all of our data centers, including those that will run Private Cloud Compute, operate on 100% renewable energy. 
At Apple, we're constantly accelerating our pace of innovation. We are a company in relentless pursuit of big ideas. Time and again, we've seen how a spark of creativity can reach breakthrough velocity, reach across previously unexplored dimensions, and ultimately take flight in ways that can change the world. It's why we're going to keep investing in the meaningful innovation that enriches the lives of all of our customers. 
We have a busy time ahead of us, and I couldn't be more excited for all the amazing things yet to come. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.",1553

We are very pleased to report a new June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, up 5% year-over-year, despite 230 basis points of negative foreign exchange impact. 
We achieved growth in the vast majority of our markets with June quarter revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia Pacific. 
Products revenue was $61.6 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the launch of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air. Our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and geographic segments, thanks to our unmatched levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and a large number of customers who are new to our products.
Services revenue reached an all-time record of $24.2 billion, up 14% year-over-year, with an all-time record in developed markets and a June quarter record in emerging markets. 
Company gross margin was 46.3%, near the high end of our guidance range and down 30 basis points sequentially, driven by a different mix within products, which was partially offset by a favorable mix shift towards Services and cost savings. 
Products gross margin was 35.3%, down 130 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by mix partially offset by favorable costs. 
Services gross margin was 74%, down 60 basis points from last quarter. 
Operating expenses of $14.3 billion were at the low end of the guidance range we provided and up 7% year-over-year. 
Net income was $21.4 billion. Diluted EPS of $1.40 was up 11% year-over-year and set a June quarter record. And operating cash flow was very strong at $28.9 billion, also a June quarter record.
Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $39.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year, but grew on a constant currency basis. We set June quarter records across several countries, including the U.K., Spain, Poland, Mexico, Indonesia, and the Philippines. And the iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment. 
During the June quarter, many iPhone models were among the top-selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, iPhone was the top-selling model in the U.S., urban China, the U.K., Germany, Australia, and Japan. Customer satisfaction on the iPhone 15 family continues to be extremely high, with 451 Research measuring it at 98% in the U.S. in their latest reports.
Mac generated $7 billion in revenue, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the MacBook Air powered by the M3 chip. We saw particularly strong performance in our emerging markets with June quarter records for Mac in Latin America, India, and South Asia. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high, with half of MacBook Air customers in the quarter being new to Mac. And customer satisfaction for Mac was recently reported at 96% in the U.S.
iPad revenue was $7.2 billion, up 24% year-over-year, driven by the launch of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air. Customers are loving the latest iPad lineup for its new design and display, unparalleled performance, AI capabilities and much more. The iPad installed base has continued to grow and is at an all-time high as half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Also, customer satisfaction was recently measured at 97% in the U.S.
Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $8.1 billion, down 2% year-over-year, a sequential acceleration from the March quarter. Watch and AirPods continue to face a difficult compare against prior year launches of the AirPods Pro second generation, the Watch SE and the first Watch Ultra. Apple Watch continues to attract new customers, with almost 2/3 of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product, sending the Apple Watch installed base to a new all-time high. And the latest reports from 451 Research indicated customer satisfaction of 97% for Watch in the U.S.
In Services, total revenue reached an all-time record of $24.2 billion, growing 14% year-over-year. We continue to have great momentum in Services as the growth of our installed base of active devices sets a strong foundation for the future expansion of our ecosystem. And we see increased customer engagement with our Services offerings. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high, with paid accounts growing double digits year-over-year.
Also, paid subscriptions showed strong double-digit growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the Services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only 4 years ago. And we are constantly focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services from critically acclaimed new content on Apple TV+ to new games on Apple Arcade and the many latest features we previewed during WWDC for iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Cash, Apple Music, and more.
Turning to enterprise. We continue to see businesses leveraging our entire suite of products to drive productivity and creativity for their teams and customers. USAA, a leading insurance and financial services company, recently expanded beyond their existing iPhone and iPad deployments to provide their employees with the latest MacBook Air. And American Express has continued to add to their fleet of over 10,000 Macs to enhance their employees' productivity, security, and collaboration. We're also excited to see leading organizations, such as Boston Children's Hospital and Lufthansa, using Apple Vision Pro to build innovative spatial computing experiences to transform the training of their workforces.
Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $153 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $4.3 billion in maturing debt and increased commercial paper by $1 billion, leaving us with total debt of $101 billion. As a result, net cash was $52 billion at the end of the quarter. 
During the quarter, we returned over $32 billion to shareholders, including $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $26 billion through open market repurchases of 139 million Apple shares.
As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we're providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. 
We expect foreign exchange to continue to be a headwind and to have a negative impact on revenue of about 1.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. We expect our September quarter total company revenue to grow year-over-year at a rate similar to the June quarter. We expect Services revenue to grow double digits at a rate similar to what we reported in the first 3 quarters of this fiscal year. We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% and 46.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.2 billion and $14.4 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16.5%.
Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on August 15, 2024 to shareholders of record as of August 12, 2024. 
With that, let's open the call to questions.",1205

So just with that context, can you maybe help us understand where you see iPhone replacement cycles today, where you think the size of the base of iPhones that have aged and likely to upgrade are? And what that translates to in potential pent-up demand as we enter a new iPhone cycle? And then I have a follow-up.",87
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q3 2024 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2024",2024-08-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3527.0,3209490.0,114277365.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,6,"The installed base hit an all-time high during the quarter, and so we were very happy about that. iPhone, in general, grew in constant currency. And the 15, as you point out, if you look at the same number of weeks of the 15 from launch and compare that to the 14, the 15 is doing better than the 14. And so that's kind of the state of where we currently are. 
In terms of upgrade rates, it's very difficult mid-cycle to call upgrade rates. I would just say that with Apple Intelligence, we are very excited about the level of value that we're going to provide to users. And we believe that, that presents another reason for a compelling upgrade.",122
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q3 2024 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2024",2024-08-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3527.0,3209490.0,114277366.0,Question,Erik Woodring,,Analysts,7,"Okay. That's very helpful. And then second to that, can you maybe dig into the China dynamics a bit? Sales down 6% this quarter, 3% in constant currency, and improvement from last quarter on a tougher compare that came on the back of some iPhone discounting. So can you maybe just share color on the China market as a whole? How much you believe promotions helped in the quarter? How sustainable this improvement is? And if this performance really changes any of your approach to the China market as we look forward?",92
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q3 2024 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2024",2024-08-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3527.0,3209490.0,114277367.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,8,"Yes. Erik, as you point out, we decreased by 6.5% year-over-year for the whole of Greater China. And if you look at it on a constant currency basis, we declined by less than 3%. So over 50% of the decline year-over-year is currency-related. That is an improvement from the first half of the fiscal year and so we're happy to see the acceleration.
If you look at iPhone, in particular, for Greater China, the installed base set a record. We also, in Mainland China, set a June quarter record for upgraders. And so that's a very strong signal. And in fact, the survey from Kantar this quarter showed that iPhones were the top 3 models in urban China. Also, one of the things we look at is the 15 family compared to the 14 family for the same number of weeks from launch, so this goes all the way back to the September of '23. If you look at that, the 15 is outperforming the 14. And so those are some of the color I would provide. 
In addition, one of the things that we're very focused on is the level of new customers buying our products. And so if you look at this on the Mac and iPad, in Mainland China, the majority of customers buying are buying for the first time, buying that product for the first time. And the Watch, the vast, vast majority of people are buying the product for the first time. And during the quarter, I should say also that iPad returned to growth in Greater China as it did around the world. 
And so we continue to be confident in the long-term opportunity in China. I don't know how every chapter of the book reads but we're very confident in the long term.",300

And then Luca, with regard to gross margin, there's been some component price inflation and mix. Do you mind just giving us a little more color on how you're managing that sequentially and how you feel about the current component environment as an impact on margins?",47
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q3 2024 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2024",2024-08-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3527.0,3209490.0,114277372.0,Answer,Luca Maestri,,Executives,13,"Sure, Ben. I think I'll give you a bit of the walk for the June quarter and then get into the outlook that we provided for the September quarter. At the total company level, we've reported 46.3%. It is down 30 basis points sequentially, and it was really driven by a different mix. Within products, of course, we launched very important products like the iPad during the course of the quarter. But we had an offset from a shift in mix towards services, and we got some good cost savings. And so when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, we are up significantly on the margin front. And keep in mind that foreign exchange continues to be a bit of a headwind for us. 
As we go into the September quarter, we are guiding 45.5% to 46.5%, which is kind of within the guidance that we provided last quarter. Again, similar dynamics, we expect a slightly different mix. We expect foreign exchange to have a minimal impact sequentially, although a more significant impact on a year-over-year basis.
On the commodity side, I think that's what you're referring to, yes, we have seen some increases on the memory front, but the rest of the commodities, we see a continuous decline. So in general, we feel we're well positioned. And as you know well, these are very high levels of gross margin for us and we're pleased where we are.",240

There's clearly a lot of excitement from consumers around what Apple Intelligence could mean for them. Can you just touch on do you think the intent is to launch all the Apple Intelligence features at the same time to consumers? Or do you think they end up getting staggered a bit? And if they are staggered, do you think it impacts how consumers come out and buy the next-generation iPhone?",80

We started with some features of Apple Intelligence, not the complete suite. There are other features like languages beyond U.S. English that will happen over the course of the year, and there are other features that will happen over the course of the year.

And then I guess your Services growth rates have been extremely impressive for several quarters and it seems like it's accelerated recently. Can you just talk about, when you look at this double-digit growth, how much of that do you think is coming from the installed base growth versus better ARPU or better monetization of the installed base? And how do you kind of see that mix changing as you go forward?",74
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q3 2024 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2024",2024-08-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3527.0,3209490.0,114277382.0,Answer,Luca Maestri,,Executives,23,"Yes, Amit, it's Luca. It's a combination of a number of factors. The installed base growth is very important, of course, because we have a larger pool of customers that uses the ecosystem and uses our Services. We are seeing, and we've seen this consistently for many, many quarters now, we see continued growth in the level of engagement that our customers have with our ecosystem. We have more transacting accounts every quarter so more people using the ecosystem, both the free elements of the ecosystem and the paid elements. We see paid accounts growing double digits, and we've seen that for many, many quarters now. We look at our paid subscriptions on our platform, and they're growing strong double digits as well. So obviously, the growing level of engagement helps us both from an ARPU standpoint and just a volume standpoint.
Obviously, as you've seen over the last several years, we launched new services over time, and we've launched many new services fairly recently. Obviously, our payments business is relatively new, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Fitness+, so many other services we've added. And so we're providing more and more opportunities for our customers to interact with the ecosystem. And we believe we're doing also a very good job at improving the quality of these services and improving the amount of content that we make available. We continue to make significant investments on TV+, on Apple Arcade. We're launching new shows, new games all the time. And I think you will continue to see that as we go forward. 
We're very, very happy with the 14% growth that we had this quarter because, particularly if you look at the performance that we had in Services a year ago, the compares for us tend to get a bit more challenging in the second half of our fiscal year. But in spite of that, we delivered a level of growth that was better than what we were expecting at the beginning of the quarter.",332

How should investors think about the monetization models around these partnerships where the CapEx investments are clearly being made by these potential partners but obviously, they're leveraging your distribution to your very attractive installed base.

Or do you see these partnerships becoming a larger contributor over time? And I have a follow-up.",95

If I look at calendar '23, you had, on average, 150 basis points increase in product gross margins on a year-on-year basis. In 2024 so far, it had been more flat year-on-year. When we think about that, is the incremental headwind -- I mean there were FX headwinds throughout the last several years. So ex FX, are there other incremental headwinds that are either temporary or structural in nature that are perhaps limiting further upside to what are obviously very strong gross margins?",99

Of course, as you said, foreign exchange continues to be incremental on a year-over-year basis. And it's one of those things that is outside of our control. We try to hedge our exposures. But it is what it is. We know that when the dollar is strong, our gross margins are affected.
The other element that I think is always important to keep in mind is that within the products business, our products have different margin profiles. And depending on the relative success in the marketplace, our products' gross margin tends to move. And so the mix of our products has an impact on gross margins, right? And so we need to pay attention to that. Of course, we just launched an iPad and that is one of the factors. But we want all our products to be very successful in the marketplace, and that's why we always look at gross margin dollars as the first order of priority and gross margin percentage tends to follow from that. 
The other factor that obviously has an impact, a significant impact, is the state of the commodity markets, and they tend to go in cycles. And so we'll see how that plays out over time. But in general, we feel good about the level of gross margins that we have for our products business, and we think we're in a good position there.",232

The first one for Luca or Tim. We keep hearing about these increasing silicon content for AI edge devices. And also, I think, Luca, you spoke about increasing commodity costs.

In terms of the requirements to run Apple Intelligence, there are system requirements and there are silicon requirements. And so from an iPhone point of view, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max will run Apple Intelligence and the successor products, obviously. If you look at the Mac, it starts with the M series of silicon that started in 2020. And the iPad is the same, and so it starts with the M series of silicon. And so there are system requirements and silicon requirements that go with each of those.",106

Very helpful. And then a quick follow-up for Tim. Thanks for the color on China. We also see many other consumer discretionary and luxury brands talk about a weak China. And I think, Tim, you said half the weakness was FX-related. I'm curious, the other half of the weakness, was that more China macro-related? Or do you think it is kind of like specific to Apple with domestic competitors? Any other color you could give would be very helpful.",81

I've said that before and that remains to be the case. The macroeconomic factors have been in the press, too. And I'm not an expert on those. I can only tell you what we're seeing.

Tim, first one for you. I know it's early days, and you talked about the developers just getting their hands on Apple Intelligence. But when you think about the categories that are currently in the App Store and kind of what you think app developers could do with this new technology, what's your instinct say in terms of are these going to be iterative applications to currently available applications? Is there any sort of category that you think lends itself more naturally to Apple Intelligence? Is it games? Is it more creative? I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about it. And then I have a follow-up for Luca.",118

And so we've thought about it from Notes to Mail to Messages and all the rest. And so there's been a deep level of thinking about how it affects those apps. And that's going to surface Apple Intelligence in a way that is natural to the user, in a way that will, I think, get them very excited about it and get usage. Similarly, I think the developers will do that on a broad basis with their apps as well. And so I think it's profound, and we'll see what the developers do. But we're very excited to get the initial seed out there this week and see what they do. I think it will be amazing, yes.",150

I appreciate it. And Luca, I know you didn't give a full rundown of product categories in your prepared remarks. But if I kind of take your comments at face value, I guess what I'm trying to think about is, for the next quarter, it sounds like with Services being relatively strong and FX easing a little bit, you're effectively saying that product revenue in the September quarter is going to basically be flat with the September quarter last year ahead of a product launch. And so I'm just trying to get a sense for what are the puts and takes in that sort of outlook, particularly as you have Apple Intelligence hopefully stoking the fire for demand going forward.",124

We think that we're going to be growing total company revenue at a rate that is similar to what we reported, so the plus 5%, right, in spite of the fact that we're going to have some foreign exchange headwinds, and we said about 150 basis points in the December quarter. And we said that we will grow Services double digits at a rate that is similar to what we've reported for the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year.
We are not going into the other categories, I think. There's a lot of good math that you can do from what we've given you here. Keep in mind on the Mac that we will have a challenging compare from a year ago given the fact that we launched and we had the full quarter impact of the launch of the MacBook Air 15-inch a year ago. And also on the iPad, we reported 24% growth in the June quarter. Clearly, we had the benefit from the launch in the June quarter of the new products, the iPad Air and the iPad Pro. So important to keep that in mind on a sequential basis.",205

I know it's early days. The feedback on Apple Intelligence software features like notification summary and reduced interruption focus from the developers who have tried the iOS 18.1 beta version this week is very positive. My question is, in response to an earlier question, you talked about a staggered launch on some of these software features, so are you expecting most of the features that you announced at WWDC to be part of iOS 18? Or we should be thinking that some of these features could potentially be part of iOS 19 next year?",100

And we are seeing a good level of adoption from developers on those changes. We are, on an ongoing basis, discussing with the European Commission how to ensure full compliance with the DMA. It's obviously early stage, but in general, our results for the Services business and for the App Store have been pretty good until now. Again, to just provide you a frame of reference, the percentage of revenue that we generate from the European Union on the App Store is about 7% of the total.",108

There's a regulatory aspect as well in certain geographies. You mentioned the staggered launch that you're aiming for and the time lines you're thinking.

And a quick one on the Wearables category, Luca. I know you mentioned the acceleration there on a sequential basis. Maybe you can just sort of parse that out in terms of which categories drove the acceleration because that's been a category that has been lagging a bit in terms of revenue trends for the past couple of quarters. So just curious, what is starting to sort of drive it to accelerate on a sequential basis?",79

I think the important thing to remember when you look at the Wearables, Home and Accessories categories is that we have a difficult launch compare. And we've been running that for a few quarters and we still have that because last year had the continued benefit from the AirPods Pro second generation, the Watch SE and the very first Watch Ultra. And so it's important to keep that in mind. If you sort of take a step back, however, and look at the business across the trailing 12 months, it's grown. The Wearables, Home and Accessories business has grown to almost $40 billion, which is double what it was 5 years ago.",117

We've been investing in AI and ML for years. And in addition to investing more, we've also redeployed certain skills onto AI and ML. And so the growth sort of embedded in our numbers that we've shared here, it's increasing year-over-year.
On the CapEx part, it's important to remember that we employ a hybrid kind of approach where we do things internally and we have certain partners that we do business with externally where the CapEx would appear in their respective businesses. But yes, I mean, you can expect that we will continue to invest and increase it year-on-year.",106

And maybe a quick follow-up for Luca. When we look at the free cash flow margins for the first 9 months, they're up materially. And given this year's product mix, can you describe to us what exactly in the Services mix or cost control is driving what seems to be structurally higher free cash flow margins across the business?",60

We are pretty pleased with that fact. And I think you probably also noticed that we've increased our return of capital to shareholders this quarter. This one was a record quarter for us. Well, it's a combination of a number of things. Of course, an improvement in the top line helps. The margin expansion that we've had over the last several years and several quarters obviously has helped. And so that is driving better operating cash flow.
On the CapEx front, as Tim said, we employ a hybrid model. Some of the investments show up on our balance sheet and some other investments show up somewhere else and we pay as we go. But in general, we try to run the company efficiently. We continue to think that capital efficiency is a good thing. And therefore, we're pleased with the fact that our free cash flow is doing well this year.",157
