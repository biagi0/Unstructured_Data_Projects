24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2014",2014-01-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3368.0,571938.0,26009298.0,Presenter Speech,Peter Oppenheimer,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Nancy. We're very pleased to report the results of the first quarter of Apple's fiscal year '14. We established new all-time quarterly records for iPhone and iPad sales and had one of our best Mac quarters ever, driving the highest quarterly revenue and operating profit in Apple's history. We were also very pleased with our results in emerging markets around the world. 
Revenue for the quarter was $57.6 billion, up $3.1 billion or 6% from the year-ago quarter and near the high end of our guidance range. No technology company has ever generated that much revenue in a single quarter, and we're especially pleased to have generated that record despite foreign exchange headwinds, the year-over-year decline in iPod sales and the higher revenue deferral rates from iOS devices and Macs that we discussed last quarter. These 3 factors negatively impacted revenue by about $2.5 billion, and without them, our year-over-year revenue growth would have been about 10%. Gross margin was 37.9%, above the high end of our guidance range, and operating margin was an all-time record of $17.5 billion, representing 30.3% of revenue. Net income was $13.1 billion, translating to diluted earnings per share of $14.50, a new record. 
As for the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with iPhone. Despite supply constraints on iPhone 5s, we sold 51 million iPhones compared to 47.8 million in the year-ago quarter. That's an increase of over 3 million phones, or 7%, and a new quarterly record. iPhone sales growth was very strong year-over-year in Japan, thanks to the addition of NTT DOCOMO in September and our continued partnership with SoftBank and KDDI. In fact, based on the latest data published by Kantar, iPhone accounts for 69% share of the smartphone market in Japan. We also generated strong year-over-year iPhone growth in Greater China, Latin America, the Middle East and Russia. 
In the U.S. market, Apple remains the leading smartphone manufacturer, with iPhone accounting for 41% of smartphone subscribers in the 3-month period ending in November according to comScore. We're very pleased to have reached a multi-year agreement with China Mobile, the largest network in the world with over 750 million customers, and to be selling iPhones through their expansive network of stores beginning on January 17. China is an incredibly important market to Apple, and iOS devices already account for 57% of all mobile web browsing in China. 
iPhone customers are loving their phones and continue to produce the highest loyalty rates in the industry. A December survey of U.S. customers by ChangeWave indicated a 96% customer satisfaction rate for iPhone. And based on the latest data provided by Kantar, iPhone customers have a 90% loyalty rate, significantly higher than the competition. We exited the quarter with about 15.3 million total iPhones in channel inventory, which represented a sequential increase of less than 1 million units from the September quarter and left us within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory. 
The release of new iPhones with iOS 7 introduced powerful new security and management features for business and enterprise customers, and iOS 7 has received FIPS 140-2 certification from the U.S. federal government. These features, coupled with ease of developing custom enterprise apps, continue to make iPhone the device of choice for large organizations. Many companies, including Accenture, Cisco and American Airlines, have tens of thousands of employees using iPhones for work. In fact, some, including Deloitte and GE, have over 50,000 iPhones each on their networks around the world. And based on the latest data published by IDC combining business, government and education institutions, iPhone has a 59% share of the U.S. commercial smartphone market. 
Turning to iPad. Despite supply constraints, we sold over 26 million iPads during the quarter compared to 22.9 million in the year-ago quarter. That's an increase of over 3 million iPads, or 14%, and represents a new all-time quarterly sales record. iPad sales were very robust in mainland China, where sales more than doubled year-over-year. We also experienced strong iPad sales growth in the Middle East, Latin America, Russia and parts of Western Europe. 
Customers are loving the new iPad Air and iPad mini with Retina display introduced in October, and response to the more affordable iPad mini has been very strong. In fact, a November ChangeWave survey of customers planning to buy a tablet within 90 days found that 72% plan to purchase an iPad. And among customers who already owned an iPad, the survey measured a 97% satisfaction rate. 
We exited the quarter with 6.2 million units of iPad channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 2.1 million units, which placed us within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPad channel inventory. Based on the latest data published by IDC, iPad has a 78% share of the U.S. commercial tablet market, and iPad continues to spark innovation for businesses around the world. 
Leveraging custom-developed and App Store apps, progressive IT organizations have embraced mobility, armed employees with iPad and fundamentally changed the way people do their jobs. British Airways has deployed thousands of iPads to their employees across the business, including senior cabin staff, engineers, check-in staff, pilots and ground crew. At Kindred Healthcare, iPads are now being used by the sales team, executive and thousands of therapists nationwide, resulting in millions of dollars in estimated savings and productivity gains for Kindred and their customers. In this football season, nearly every team in the NFL used iPads as playbooks, replacing their traditional 3-ring paper binders. 
In the education market, schools continue to choose iPad and a great content available across apps, books and courses. Today, U.S. education institutions have purchased over 7 million iPads. In fact, we sold over 750,000 iPads to K-12 schools in the state of Texas alone, including 7,000 iPads rolling out to all K-12 students in the Midway Independent School District. 
We have expanded the availability of iBook textbooks from 4 countries to over 50 countries so that students and teachers around the world can experience the power of what a textbook can be. We continue to add new titles from key education publishers like Oxford University Press and Cambridge University Press. In addition, nearly 25,000 books have been created and published by individual educators using iBooks Author, bringing lessons to life in exciting new ways. And over 1,000 institutions are delivering courses and content through iTunes U. At the Ohio State University, where there are over 20,000 iPads on campus, faculty have developed over 70 iTunes U courses in less than 1 school year. 
We remain very focused on providing a great user experience for our iPhone and iPad customers, and we're extremely pleased that the iOS platform continues to lead the industry in user engagement. According to IBM's Digital Analytics benchmark, iOS devices accounted for more than twice the online traffic and more than 5x the online sales compared to Android devices on both Black Friday and Christmas Day. IBM reported that iOS devices represented 32.6% of online traffic on December 25 and more than doubled the 14.8% for Android, while iOS devices drove 23% of online sales that day, 5x the 4.6% for Android. And according to the latest reports by Chitika Insights, iPhone accounted for 54% of North American smartphone web traffic, while iPad accounted for 78% of tablet traffic. These usage percentages are far greater than the share of the smartphone and tablet markets represented by our devices, and they underscore just how engaging and important our iPhones and iPads are to the people who own them. 
We are also very pleased with our customers' adoption of iOS 7. As of this month, 80% of iOS devices are running iOS 7. That dwarfs the single-digit adoption percentage measured for the latest version of the Android operating system and makes iOS 7 the most popular operating system in the world. The rapid transition to the latest version of iOS provides a more advanced and secure experience for our customers and a more streamlined opportunity for our developers. 
Turning to Mac. We sold 4.8 million Macs compared to 4.1 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 19%, making this among our best Mac quarters ever. The growth was driven by significantly increased sales of iMac and MacBook Air, while sales of MacBook Pro also remained strong. Mac sales grew in each of our operating segments, led by Europe and Greater China. We were also very pleased to have generated such strong results from our Mac products, particularly given IDC's most recently published estimate of a 6% year-over-year contraction in worldwide personal computer sales. 
Macs have now gained global market share for 30 of the last 31 quarters. We were happy to begin selling the all-new Mac Pro last month manufactured in the U.S., and we've had great customer response to OS X Mavericks, now available for free and running on millions of Macs around the world. And we're also delighted to be providing our groundbreaking iWork productivity apps for free of charge to our Mac, iPhone and iPad customers. We ended the quarter with Mac channel inventory that was within our 4- to 5-week target range. 
30 years ago this week, Apple launched the Macintosh. Not only was the Macintosh a breakthrough for the personal computer, it was also a promise that the power of technology taken from a few and put in the hands of everyone who changed the world. Over the past 30 years, people have done extraordinary things with the Mac and with the Apple products it inspired. To coincide with the 30-year mark, we've taken a look at what people have accomplished on a special website that showcases their Mac stories. Their achievements are a result of Apple's continued commitment to create and deliver the best technology to people all over the world every day. Happy birthday, Mac. Imagine what we can accomplish in the next 30 years. 
We continue to be very pleased with the growth of iTunes software and services and the strength of the Apple ecosystem. Total revenue from iTunes software and services was $4.4 billion, an increase of 19% year-over-year. Our iTunes Store has generated record billings of $4.7 billion in the December quarter, thanks primarily to strong growth in App Store sales. The quarter's iTunes billings translated to quarterly iTunes revenue of over $2.4 billion, up 14% from the year-ago quarter and a new all-time record. Software and services revenue was about $2 billion, up 26% from the year-ago quarter and also a new record. We achieved these records despite the fact we are now making iPhoto, iMovie, Pages, Numbers and Keynote free with new iOS device purchases, and we are also making Mavericks, iLife and iWork free to our Mac customers. 
As we mentioned last quarter, we are now deferring a greater amount of revenue for each new iOS device and Macs sold as a result of this free software and associated upgrade rights. At the end of the quarter, our total deferred revenue from all sources was $11.4 billion, and we expect to realize $8.4 billion of it in the next 4 quarters. 
The App Store now offers 1 million apps in 24 categories, and cumulative downloads have surpassed 65 billion. Our app developers earned $2 billion from sales through the App Store in the December quarter. That translates to $15 billion in cumulative App Store earnings for our developers, about half of which was generated in the last 4 quarters, and we are thrilled with the success that they have achieved. 
In China, specifically, we have an incredibly vibrant iOS and Mac developer community. Developers in China have created over 130,000 apps on the App Store to date. A recent study by Business Insider Intelligence indicated that iOS has a 5x advantage over Android when it comes to developer revenue per app download, a 4x advantage in revenue from In-App Purchases and a 2x advantage in revenue from paid downloads, plus In-App Purchases. And according to a recent report from Distimo, the App Store has a 63%:37% market share advantage over Google Play in global revenue from apps. 
Top developers continue to launch their apps first or exclusively on the App Store. Examples of highly successful launches from 2013 include Temple Run 2 and Cut the Rope 2, which generated millions of downloads and multi-week periods of App Store exclusivity. NaturalMotion recently launched Clumsy Ninja exclusively on iOS and saw 10 million downloads in the first week. And Plants vs. Zombies 2 resulted in the biggest game title launch ever for Electronic Arts, PopCap, with 16 million downloads from the App Store in the first 5 days alone. 
With the introduction of iOS 7, developers are able to create stunning apps to take advantage of the redesigned user interface and more than 200 new features and APIs. And many of the App Store's biggest recent successes, including Candy Crush Saga, Puzzle & Dragons, Mindcraft, QuizUp and Clumsy Ninja, were created by international developers. The seamless integration of the iOS platform, the global reach of our ecosystem, our thoughtful app review process and our highly engaged customers continue to make the App Store a superior marketplace for our extremely talented developer community. 
I'd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores. Revenue for the quarter was $7 billion, a new quarterly record and an increase of 9% from the year-ago quarter. The growth was fueled by record iPhone and iPad sales through the stores, as well as Mac -- as well as strong Mac sales. We completed the remodel of 6 stores and opened 4 new stores during the quarter, ending with a total of 420 stores, including 166 outside the United States. With an average of 418 stores open during the December quarter, average revenue per store was $16.7 million compared to $16.3 million in the year-ago quarter. Retail segment income was $1.7 billion. We hosted 114 million visitors to our stores during the quarter, which translates to almost 21,000 visitors per store per week. 
We were excited to roll out iBeacon technology at our stores in the U.S. during the quarter, enabling shoppers to receive iPhone notification products and services via the Apple Store app. iBeacon transmitters use Bluetooth wireless technology to sense a shopper's exact location inside an Apple Store and send messages based on the aisle or product a customer is near. For example, customers walking by an iPhone table could receive a message offering to help them check their upgrade eligibility or trade-in value of an existing phone. We expect to see many innovative uses of iBeacon technology from other businesses and developers in the coming months, including retailers and professional sports. 
Total company operating expenses were $4.4 billion and included $572 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $246 million, and the tax rate for the quarter was 26.2%. 
And turning to our cash, we ended the quarter with $158.8 billion in cash, plus short-term and long-term marketable securities, a sequential increase of $12 billion from the September quarter. Our domestic cash was $34.4 billion at the end of the December quarter, a sequential decline of $1.1 billion. $124.4 billion or 78% of our total cash was offshore at the end of the December quarter, and cash flow from operations was $22.7 billion. 
We paid $2.7 billion in dividends in the quarter, and we executed an additional $5 billion in repurchases of 9.6 million shares of Apple stock during the quarter. This brings us to a cumulative total of over $43 billion in payments for dividends and share repurchases over the last 6 quarters, of which share buybacks were $28 billion. This has resulted in cumulative retirement of 56.5 million shares and represents 6% of the total shares outstanding prior to the launch of the repurchase program. Our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $3.05 per common share, payable on February 13, 2014 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 10, 2014. 
Now as we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $42 billion and $44 billion compared to $43.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 37% and 38%, reflecting approximately $110 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be between $4.3 billion and $4.4 billion, including about $590 million related to stock-based compensation. We are continuing to invest heavily in R&D in both current revenue-generating categories, as well as future products and services. We expect OI&E to be about $200 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.2%. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our record iPhone and iPad sales, the strong performance of our Mac products and the growth of iTunes software and services revenues. We are thrilled to have the most satisfied, loyal and engaged customers in our industry, and we're constantly working to make the user experience even better for them. We're continuing to invest heavily in our future and remain very confident in our new product pipeline. 
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.",2885

So can you just talk about what's driving the cautious view on the top line for March?",49
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2014",2014-01-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3368.0,571938.0,26009302.0,Answer,Peter Oppenheimer,,Executives,6,"Sure. Katy, the biggest reason for the larger sequential decline in revenue this year relates to changes in channel inventory between the years, and I'll go through some detail, but let me actually do it on a year-over-year basis. I'd like to go through some things about the guidance, and I think you'll see that the underlying performance of our business is stronger than what the guidance might imply. We expect 4 factors to negatively impact the year-over-year revenue comparison by over $2 billion. These are channel inventory increases in the year-ago quarter that we don't expect to repeat; lower iPod sales; a stronger U.S. dollar against a number of currencies, particularly the yen and the Australian dollar; and the higher per unit deferral for Mac and iOS devices that I talked about in my prepared remarks. Let me go through these a little more, first, beginning with channel inventory. In the March quarter last year, we increased channel inventory for both iPhone and iPad, whereas this year, we increased the channel inventory for both product families in the December quarter and we exited within our target range of channel inventory. For iPhone specifically last year, the supply of iPhone 5 was short for the entire December quarter, and we were not able to achieve supply and demand balance for iPhone 5 until the March quarter. As a result, we increased the iPhone inventory last year by about 1.1 million units. In contrast, this year, we executed the fastest rollout for a new iPhone, and we included China in wave 1 in the launch in September and we were able to exit the quarter in supply and demand balance. For iPad, we introduced the mini in the December quarter last year, and we were not able to meet demand in any week of the quarter. We didn't reach a supply and demand balance for the iPad mini until the March quarter last year, and we increased the inventory in the March quarter by 1.4 million units. In contrast, this year we exited the December quarter near supply and demand balance. So looking past the inventory changes year-to-year, we expect the value of the underlying sell-through to grow year-over-year, and we're very confident in what we're shipping. Turning to iPod, sales declined by 52% year-over-year in the December quarter, and we would expect them to continue to decline year-over-year in the March quarter. And FX is a headwind for us with the strengthening dollars and against a number of currency. So when you consider these factors, we're very pleased with the underlying performance of the business, and the revenue growth is stronger than what the guidance might imply.",447

And Peter, you're guiding OpEx flattish sequentially despite the big revenue downtick. Are there any onetime items in SG&A and R&D in the March quarter or does the run rate reflective of investments for future opportunities?",37

This is largely due to the lower variable expenses that we're going to have in line with a seasonal sequential decline in revenue. But one thing that Peter already mentioned in his remarks is that we continue to invest very heavily in R&D. We're making investments in areas that are visible to all of you today but also in areas that are not visible, which we're very excited about. And for the things that are not visible to you, obviously, we are investing ahead of the revenue that these products and services will generate in the future. So there is nothing that is one-off in nature in our guidance.",130

The ramp of China Mobile would presumably act as a tailwind to the March quarter, yet that's not apparent in the numbers. Can you comment on how you're thinking about demand trends for China Mobile and perhaps how it compares to prior large carrier ramps?",55
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2014",2014-01-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3368.0,571938.0,26009308.0,Answer,Peter Oppenheimer,,Executives,12,"Sure. Bill, this is Peter. Let me start, and Tim may want to add some comments. We're thrilled to be working with China Mobile and DOCOMO also [ph] . We had a great launch with both carriers, DOCOMO in the December quarter and China Mobile just in the last couple of weeks. These carrier additions will have a positive impact on our iPhone sales year-over-year. China Mobile's 4G service is only available in 16 cities today, and they plan to complete the rollout of more than 500,000 4G base stations, which will cover more than 340 cities by year-end. With the addition of DOCOMO last quarter, we were able to achieve a 69% smartphone market share in Japan, which we're thrilled with. However, the benefit of these 2 carrier additions this quarter is being partially offset by a couple of things: first of all, the comparison last year from our late launch of the iPhone 5 and the new iPads in mainland China; achieving supply and demand balance for the mini and the iMac in the March quarter; and the impact of currencies, particularly the yen. And we're also deferring more revenue on the iOS devices and Mac. And so to summarize, we're very, very pleased with what we're seeing from both carriers. We expect to continue to do well, but we've got some things that are offsetting it, that we factored into the guidance.",235

I would add that -- just as a further update, we've been selling with China Mobile now for about a week, and last week was the best week for activations we've ever had in China. So it's been an incredible start. And we're -- at this moment, we're just selling in 16 cities with China Mobile. And as Peter alluded to, this number is projected to be at over 300 cities by the end of the year. And so we've got quite the ramp in front of us, and we're incredibly excited. This comes after a new high-water mark in China for us last quarter. We grew revenues, including our retail stores, at 31%. And we had some very, very, very strong sales on iPad. iPads in Greater China were up 64% year-over-year. Macs were up 28%. This compares to a tablet market in China that's growing at 21% per IDC and a PC market that is contracting by 7%. And so in addition to the great iPhone news with China Mobile and how we're looking there, we really turned in a stellar quarter in Greater China overall, and we are very proud of it.",200

It's incredibly simple and easy and elegant, and it's clear that there's a lot of opportunity there. The mobile payments area, in general, is one that we've been intrigued with, and that was one of the thoughts behind touch ID. And -- but we're not limiting ourselves just to that. And so I don't have anything specific to announce today. But you can tell by looking at the demographics of our customers and the amount of commerce that goes through iOS devices versus a competition that it's a big opportunity on the platform.",135

Tim, I wanted to just step back and talk a little bit about iPhone market share. The market data isn't out for Q1, but if we look at your prior 4 quarters fiscal '13, Apple grew smart -- its iPhone units about 20%. The market grew in the 40s. I think this quarter, even with a new product and having China front-loaded, Apple's -- the iPhone is going to grow at a fraction of, ultimately, what the market is likely to grow at. And I know your belief and philosophy, historically, has been that you want to make the best product, and that's the most important thing. But in Macs, you've actually succeeded in making the best product and being able to gain share. You cited again how you've gained share in 30 out of the last 31 quarters in Mac, but in iPhone, that is not happening. And so my question is, what is different about the smartphone market that is not allowing you to hold or gain unit share despite apparently having the best product? And do you propose to do anything differently going forward? Because I think it's great to have an aspiration to make the best products, but I think that's in the spirit of ultimately growing at least in line or faster than the market and that doesn't appear to be happening.",238

If you look at what we did this year, we announced 2 iPhones for the first time rather than one. And looking at last quarter, if you looked at our sell-throughs, so not sell-in but the sell-through of what I'll just call our entry phone or mid-phone and our top phone of the 5s, all of those grew year-over-year versus the phones that were in those categories previously. If you look at the emerging markets, which is one of the things that I believe is key, that we have to grow in these areas and grow at reasonable amount. In Latin America, we grew at 76% year-over-year. In the Middle East and Africa, we grew at 65%. In Central and Eastern Europe, we grew 115%. In China, we grew at 20%. However, as you know, we just added China Mobile, the largest carrier there, in this quarter and did not have a channel load in China Mobile last quarter. And so we just started selling those in January. Also, in Japan, as we've added DOCOMO, iPhone units were up 40%. Now when you translate that performance into revenue in Japan, and we have the issue with the yen that Peter spoke about earlier, and so the revenue growth looks much less than that because of the strength of the dollar there. In North America, we did not do as well, and this weighed our results. Our North American business contracted somewhat year-over-year. And if you look at the reason for this, one was that as we entered the quarter and forecasted our iPhone sales, where we achieved what we thought, we actually sold more iPhone 5s than we projected. And so the mix was stronger to the 5s, and it took us some amount of time in order to build the mix that customers were demanding. And as a result, we lost some sort of units at the -- for part of the quarter in North America. And relative to the world, it took us the bulk of a quarter, almost all the quarter, to get into the iPhone 5s into proper supply. The other thing that happened in North America specifically was that some carriers changed their upgrade policies, and this affected last quarter and will have some effect on the current quarter. This restricted customers who were used to upgrading earlier than the 24 months they're allowed and sort of stretched the time out to be a hard and fast 24 months. And so that was -- that's a major factor playing into the North American results. So as I backed up and sort of zoom out on this and looked at it, one of the most important things for us in the iPhone business was to do really well in emerging markets, and we had the best quarter ever from that respect. Another was to grow in China because I think you can't be in the business that we're in and not have a reasonable China business. And you can see how we did last quarter, and we've now followed that up with a deal with China Mobile. So I feel great about that. I think part of what's happening in North America is a short-term effect because of these upgrade policy changes, this affects a [ph] period of time, 3 to 6 months, I would say, and then it washes through. So as I look at it, I feel very good about where we are. And I would guess that the market numbers, some of the stuff that you've been seeing, will actually be decreased as the revisions come out, given what you're hearing, what everyone is saying.",636

I'd like to follow that up and just on your comments on China. You've characterized the agreement with China Mobile as huge.

Tim, the midpoint of your guidance obviously implies a decline in revenue in the quarter coming up, and you haven't done that forever. You came pretty close a couple of quarters ago, but you had some growth. And my question is, are you still a growth company? And should we expect the growth rate to accelerate as we go throughout the year, and why, if that's the case?",73

And that is the way we look at it. I know some people just look at the numbers on a piece of paper. But the way I look at the business is our business from a sell-through point of view, less iPod, because I think all of us have known for some time that iPod is a declining business. And when you do that, the numbers from last quarter as -- and the deferral, which we've just increased, as Peter went through. When you look at that and look at the numbers from last quarter, it comes up to a double-digit growth, and we're proud of that. I think that's a pretty good result. We'll see how we do in the March quarter, but I do think it's important in the March quarter to take into consideration sell-through versus just a view of sell-in.",180

Let me start with the quarter. So we were above the guidance range. It was primarily for 2 factors: we had favorable product mix; and we had favorable commodity pricing. And so those were the 2 things that actually helped us come in above the guidance range. For the quarter, for Q2, we're guiding 37% to 38% compared to 37.9% in the December quarter. We're going to have some loss of leverage, as you can imagine, because of the usual seasonal decline in revenue. But we expect that loss of leverage to be largely offset by cost improvements and also by less deferred revenue that we're going to have in Q2.",117

And then regarding overall demand, one thing you did mention, Tim, is maturity of the particularly high-end smartphone market. I know in our surveys, we're finding, relative to a year ago, a lot higher percentage of Apple buyers already have an Apple handset. So I'm curious if you think Western world can show decent unit growth over the next year or 2.

But to your question about the 5s [ph] , in particular, if I look at the sell-through year-over-year, there was growth in that portion of our line, despite adding a new phone -- an entirely new phone underneath it. And so I think that's a good sign, and that's despite it being in short supply for the bulk or virtually all of the quarter. And so I do believe that, that category of product can grow in those markets, if you're thinking about U.S. and Western Europe, for example, and Japan. I mean, in Japan, we grew 40% last quarter.

But are you happy with the pricing umbrellas that you have?

Good afternoon, everyone. We have a lot to share with you over the next hour, and I'd like to start right away with the very strong results we're reporting for the March quarter. We generated $45.6 billion in revenue, which was ahead of our expectations and represents a new March quarter record and is our strongest non-holiday quarter ever. Our underlying business performance was even stronger than our reported results imply when you take into account changes in channel inventory this year versus last year and foreign exchange headwinds that we faced in several of our international markets. 
Setting foreign exchange and inventory changes aside, our underlying growth rate would have been close to double digits. These strong revenue results, combined with our best gross margin percentage since September of 2012, resulted in earnings per share growth of 15%, which is our highest earnings growth rate in the last 6 quarters.
iPhone was key in driving our stronger-than-expected results. We sold almost 44 million iPhones, setting a new March quarter record. These strong results were broad-based, both from a product point of view, with demand for each of our 3 iPhones stronger than its predecessor, and from a geographic standpoint. We gained smartphone share in many developed and emerging markets, including the U.S., the U.K., Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Vietnam and Greater China, just to mention a few. In fact, we established a new all-time record for total iPhone sales in the BRIC countries. 
iTunes software and services revenues continued to grow at a double-digit rate, thanks to an incredible ecosystem and our very large, loyal and engaged customer base. With its strong momentum and growing profitability, iTunes is a very important driver of our business, not only here in the United States but around the world. We now have an almost 800 million iTunes accounts, most of these with credit cards. This is a staggering number. 
We continued to gain share in the personal computer market as well. We defied industry trends again by growing while the market contracted. Our bold decision to make OS X free has resulted in the largest ever percentage of the Mac installed base running on the latest version of the operating system just months after its release. 
iPad sales came in at the high end of our expectations, but we realized they were below analyst estimates, and I would like to proactively address why we think there was a difference. We believe almost all of the difference can be explained by 2 factors: first, in the March quarter last year, we significantly increased iPad channel inventory, while this year, we significantly reduced it. Luca will go into more detail about this later; second, we ended the December quarter last year with a substantial backlog of iPad mini that was subsequently shipped in the March quarter, whereas we ended the December quarter this year near supply-demand balance. We continue to believe that the tablet market will surpass the PC market in size within the next few years, and we believe that Apple will be a major beneficiary of this trend. 
When we look at our company performance on a geographic basis, we're especially proud of our very strong results in Greater China, where we established an all-time quarterly revenue record of almost $10 billion, including the results from our retail stores; and in Japan, where revenue was up 26% in spite of the foreign exchange headwinds and where our smartphone market share reached an incredible 55%. 
We are continuing to invest in our retail stores. And since our last call, we've opened our first stores in Brazil and Turkey, and we now have retail stores in 15 countries around the world. 
And I'm looking forward to welcoming our new retail and online leader, Angela Ahrendts, who will be joining Apple's executive team next week. 
Stepping back, we're now just past the halfway mark for fiscal 2014. Our strong March quarter results brings us to total revenues of over $103 billion for the first 6 months of the year and earnings per share growth close to double digits. We estimate that over the last 6 months, we've added over 60 million new registered users of our 4 product categories. Additionally, over 2/3 of people registering an iPad in the last 6 months were new to iPad, while over half of the people registering iPhones were new to iPhone. It's wonderful to add tens of millions of first-time Apple product users, especially considering the strong halo effect we've seen over and over again in our history. Customers who have a great experience with their first Apple product often become loyal and happy owners of multiple Apple products over time. 
As always, I'd like to thank our talented employees who make these results possible through the creativity and passion they bring to their work every day. And I'd like to thank our hundreds of millions of customers for their loyalty and enthusiasm and for continually inspiring us to surprise and delight them. 
In addition to our quarterly results, we're also announcing an update to our capital return program today, and I'd like to share a few thoughts about our guiding principles for capital allocation and our conclusion on the changes we are making for this year. Apple has created tremendous value for shareholders by developing great products that enrich people's lives, and that will always be our top priority and driving force. 
We'll continue to innovate by investing in research and development and capitalizing on our strengths in hardware, software and services. We'll keep investing in our supply chain to promote scale and efficiencies, expanding our global presence by building retail stores, investing in marketing and distribution and extending our reach into new markets. 
We're expanding Apple's products and services into new categories, and we are not going to under-invest in this business. We're also investing through acquisitions, and we've acquired 24 companies in the past 18 months. To invest organically and to make acquisitions strategically, we need to maintain financial flexibility. 
With this framework in mind, Apple's board and management team review capital allocation regularly, and we solicit input on our program from a broad base of shareholders. We very much appreciate all of the input that so many of our shareholders have provided us on how best to deploy our cash. We'll continue to seek investor input going forward, and we'll update you on our conclusions around this time each year. This regular process allows us to continually evaluate return of capital in light of the most current information available, and it enables us to be thoughtful about the size, mix and pace of the program. 
We continue to be in the fortunate position of being able to return significant capital to shareholders. We started doing so 2 years ago when we announced our first program of $45 billion, and we more than doubled the program last April to $100 billion. Today, we're announcing that we're increasing the size of our program once again with an addition of over $30 billion, for a total program size of over $130 billion. The size and pace of our program is unprecedented, and we still expect to complete it by December of 2015 as we announced last year. 
We think very deliberately about how much and in which way to return cash to our shareholders. We decided to continue to allocate the vast majority of the incremental capital return to share repurchases because we believe our current stock price does not reflect the full value of the company. The size of the share back increase is a signal of the board and the management team's strong confidence in the future of Apple. 
We also understand the importance of the dividend to many of our investors, and we're increasing it for the second time in less than 2 years. We believe this is a meaningful increase for those shareholders who value income, and we are planning for annual dividend increases going forward. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Luca for the details of our quarterly results, as well as more information about our capital return program.",1362
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2014",2014-04-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3566.0,615633.0,27766296.0,Presenter Speech,Luca Maestri,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tim said, revenue for the March quarter was $45.6 billion, up $2 billion or 5% from a year ago and above our guidance range. Sales in each of our major product categories were at the high end of our expectations or better, and the vast majority of the revenue upside came from strong sales of iPhone. Gross margin was 39.3%, also above our guidance range, and operating margin was $13.6 billion, representing 29.8% of revenue. Net income was $10.2 billion, translating to diluted earnings per share of $11.62. 
For details by product, I'd like to start with iPhone. We sold 43.7 million iPhones, which was a March quarter record. That's an increase of 6.3 million iPhones over last year and represents 17% growth. The addition of China Mobile, coupled with great response to our more affordably priced iPhone 4s, led to an all-time quarterly record for iPhone sales in Greater China. We look forward to broadening our relationship with China Mobile as they expand points of sale and continue to build out their 4G network. 
In Japan, iPhone sales were up over 50% year-over-year, resulting in significant market share gains. As Tim mentioned, we also had strong growth and share gains in many other major developed markets based on IDC's latest estimates for the March quarter. 
iPhone also continued to perform exceptionally well in many developing markets. In Greater China, Brazil, Indonesia, Poland and Turkey, iPhone sales grew by strong double digits year-over-year. And in India and Vietnam, sales more than doubled. We exited the quarter with 15.4 million total iPhones in channel inventory, which represents a sequential increase of about 100,000 from the December quarter and left us within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks. 
In the enterprise market, progressive IT organizations are leading the charge to replace legacy devices and systems and are using iPhone and iOS to drive innovation at their companies. Deutsche Bank has nearly 20,000 iPhones running on its network and has created 40 internal apps that extend the capabilities of its mobile workforce. Siemens has 30,000 iPhones on its network and has deployed over 50 internal apps for field service teams, sales associates and corporate executives for solutions that are only possible with iOS and iPhone. 
We're really happy with the continued growth and strength of the Apple ecosystem. Total revenue from iTunes software and services was $4.6 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year and an all-time quarterly record. Our iTunes Stores generated record billings of $5.2 billion in the March quarter, up 24% year-over-year, driven by very strong growth in App Store sales. These iTunes billings translated to quarterly iTunes revenue of over $2.6 billion, up 9% from the year-ago quarter and also a new all-time record. Software and services revenue was over $1.9 billion, up 14% from a year ago. 
App Store momentum is incredibly strong, as cumulative app downloads have topped 70 billion. 87% of iOS devices are now running iOS 7, and our highly engaged users are a great audience for developers. According to App Annie, the App Store generated 85% more global revenue than Google Play in the March quarter despite the differences in unit market share between iOS and Android devices. 
Now I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4.1 million Macs compared to just under 4 million in the year-ago quarter, thanks to strong performance from MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, and Macs have now gained global market share for 31 of the last 32 quarters. Response to Mavericks has been great, and we're very proud of the fact that so many of our Mac customers are taking advantage of the most advanced and secure experience possible. We ended the quarter with Mac channel inventory slightly below our 4- to 5-week target range. 
Turning to iPad. We sold 16.4 million units. As Tim explained earlier, our iPad results and the comparison to the March quarter last year were heavily influenced by channel inventory changes. Specifically, this year, we sold 16.4 million iPads into our channels and sold through almost 17.5 million, reducing our channel inventory by 1.1 million units. Last year, we sold over 19.4 million iPads into our channels and sold through 18 million and, therefore, increased channel inventory by 1.4 million units. As a result, the year-over-year sell-through decline was only 3% compared to the sell-in decline of 16%. We exited the March quarter with 5.1 million units of iPad channel inventory, which left us within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks. 
iPad continues to lead all other tablets by far in terms of user engagement, size of ecosystem, customer satisfaction and e-commerce. A recent study by Chitika Insights found that iPad users in North America generate almost 4x the web traffic of all Android tablet users combined. In a February survey, ChangeWave measured a 98% customer satisfaction rate for both iPad Air and iPad mini with Retina display and also found that among people planning to purchase a tablet within 90 days, 2/3 plan to buy an iPad. 
iPad continues to allow companies around the world to reimagine the way they use technology to drive efficiency and improve employee satisfaction. Thousands of iPads are used at FedEx every day. In an industry where efficiency is critical, FedEx pilots and maintenance crews around the world use iPad to transform operational processes and save the company millions of dollars. Eli Lilly has deployed over 20,000 iPads and 50 internal apps as part of a laptop replacement program that dramatically increased the productivity and capabilities of its employees. 
The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is on its way to deploying iPads to 11,000 providers to transform the way doctors and patients interact. As part of this initiative, a suite of applications is being developed to allow quick access to real-time secure medical information. And in education, according to the latest data published by IDC, iPad has over 95% share of the U.S. education tablet market, as teachers and students increasingly benefit from the growing range of engaging iBooks, textbooks and solutions that are helping to transform the education experience. 
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $150.6 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential decline of $8.3 billion. Our domestic cash was $18.4 billion at the end of the March quarter, a sequential decline of $16 billion and $132.2 billion or 88% of our total cash was offshore. Cash flow from operations was very strong at $13.5 billion for the quarter. 
In total, we executed almost $21 billion worth of capital return activities during the March quarter. First, we launched our third accelerated share repurchase program in late January, to which we will acquire an additional 12 billion of Apple stock. We received an initial delivery of 19.2 million shares, and that is ASR. And we'll receive the balance of shares due when the program concludes by December of this year. 
Second, we paid $2.7 billion in dividends in February. And finally, we spent $6 billion on open-market purchases of 11.4 million shares throughout the March quarter. At the end of March, we also settled our second ASR program, which was launched in April of last year, resulting in the retirement of an additional 1.1 million shares. 
I would like now to go into more detail about the expansion of our capital return program that we're announcing today. Let me start by summarizing the progress that we've made on the program we updated a year ago. By the end of March 2014, we've already taken action of 46 billion of the current 60 billion share repurchase authorization, over 75% of the program, with 7 quarters remaining to its completion. We have acted aggressively and opportunistically and have delivered on our intention to return capital to shareholders at a fast pace. Including dividends and net share settlements, we've taken action on $66 billion of the total $100 billion program announced last year. 
Today, we're taking additional steps that will increase the overall size of the program from $100 billion to over $130 billion within the same timeframe of December 2015 as before. There are 2 elements to the expansion of the program. First, we're increasing the size of our share repurchase authorization from $60 billion to $90 billion. We are very confident in Apple's future, and we believe our current stock price does not reflect the full value of the company. That's why the vast majority of our capital program continues to be allocated to share repurchases. We will also continue to net share settle restricted stock units and expect to utilize about $1 billion of cash annually for that purpose. 
Second, our board declared a dividend of $3.29 per common share payable on May 15, 2014 to shareholders of record as of May 12, 2014. That represents an increase of about 8% in our quarterly dividend. We understand the importance of dividend increases to many of our investors, and we're increasing the dividend for the second time in less than 2 years. We are planning for continued annual increases, and we are very proud that Apple is one of the largest dividend payers in the world with annual payments of $11 billion. 
All our capital return activities must be funded by domestic cash, which, as I mentioned, was about $18 billion as we exited the March quarter and down from $39 billion in the quarter that we paid our first dividend. We will maintain sufficient domestic liquidity to grow the business and execute capital expenditures and acquisitions. Thanks to Apple's strong growth and international expansion in recent years, we've built substantial offshore cash balances. To repatriate our foreign cash under current U.S. tax law, we would incur significant cash tax consequences, and we don't believe this will be in the best interest of our shareholders. 
We continue to advocate for comprehensive corporate tax reform and streamlining the tax code, which we believe would be of great benefit to the U.S. economy. To execute our updated capital return program in a tax-efficient manner and leverage our very strong balance sheet, we intend to access the debt markets again. We plan to be active in both the domestic and international bond markets during 2014, put an amount of term debt financing similar to what we issued in 2013, with the breakdown between markets, currencies and tenors to be determined over the course of the year and subject to prevailing conditions in each market. We have also prepared ourselves to access the commercial paper market, given the substantial short-term liquidity and flexibility that this channel can provide. 
Now as we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $36 billion and $38 billion compared to $35.3 billion in the year-ago quarter. 
We expect gross margins to be between 37% and 38%. We expect OpEx to be between $4.4 billion and $4.5 billion. We are continuing to invest heavily in R&D for current revenue-generating categories, as well as future products and services. We expect OI&E to be about $200 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.1%. 
And now I'd like to turn it back to Tim.",1897

In addition to the changes to our capital return program, today, we're also announcing a 7-for-1 split of Apple common stock, which will occur in June of this year. We're taking this action to make Apple stock more accessible to a larger number of investors. Each shareholder of record at the close of business on June 2, 2014 will receive 6 additional shares for every outstanding share held on the record date, and trading will begin on a split-adjusted basis on June 9, 2014. 
Finally, before we start the Q&A, I'd like to take a minute to talk about my dear friend and colleague, Peter Oppenheimer. As you know, Peter will be transitioning from the CFO role in June. Peter has been Apple's CFO for 10 years, and the list of his accomplishments is immense. Apple is now more than 20x the size it was when Peter became our CFO, and his expertise, leadership and incredibly hard work have been instrumental to the company's success. 
I'd like to thank him very publicly for his contributions to Apple from the very bottom of my heart and wish him all the best in his approaching retirement at the end of September. And I'd also like to recognize him, that he has never missed a -- never missed guidance in the 10 years as CFO, which must be an all-time record for CFOs. 
We're really happy and fortunate to have someone with Luca's talent on board to replace Peter. He has over 25 years of experience building and leading finance teams in global companies and has an exceptionally broad international background, which you might be able to detect from his accent. He's been managing most of Apple's financial functions since coming on board last year and has done an outstanding job. I'm looking forward to working with Luca even closer as Apple's next CFO. 
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.",323

So March quarter was very good. As you said, there were 3 reasons for it. We had obviously better volume, as you've seen from our revenue results. We had better costs than anticipated, and we had some favorable mix of both product and services. As we get into Q3, obviously, as you've seen from our revenue guidance, we are expecting some loss of leverage, which will come from the sequential decline in revenue. It's about 19%, at the midpoint of the range. And we're also expecting less favorable mix. This is something very typical that happens to us as we move further away from the quarter when we launch the new products. To offset that, it's only going to be a partial offset, we will have some cost improvements.",134

This is primarily in the U.S., as I mentioned last time. But if you really look at iPhone, the strength of iPhone was very broad-based. And as I had mentioned, we gained share in a whole host of markets from developing markets like the U.S., U.K., France, Germany to more of emerging markets like China, Vietnam and had the largest total sales of iPhone in the BRIC countries that we've ever seen in the -- in our history.

Luca, on the iPhone ASPs this quarter, they were down a little over $40. I think that was the largest sequential decline that we've seen in history. I was wondering if you could help us understand what drove that. Was it entirely mix? You mentioned good growth in each of the 3 models, but were you seeing particularly strong growth in the 4s? I think you mentioned that in China. And how significant, if any, was selling older generation 4 iPhone 4s?",95

When you look at the $41 of decline, I would say about half of that was driven by the fact that we have continued to do very well in emerging markets with the 4s. I've mentioned that there's a lot of markets where we've grown very strongly, in Latin America, in Asia Pacific, in Eastern Europe. So about half of that decline came from the stronger sales of the 4s. And then the rest was primarily the fact that, again, as we move away from the quarter where we launched the product, we tend to have lower capacity mix in our numbers.",104

Clearly, U.S. carriers have started introducing plans that may ultimately encourage people to keep their phone longer than 2 years because their total price paid is less. And so one could argue, and I'd like your opinion, on whether you think that could push out replacement cycles. I guess the other consideration is the imperative for Apple to continue to introduce really great products to want to have people upgrade at the same frequency. And I guess the dilemma in doing that is -- as we've seen with the 5 and with the 4, is introducing really great products typically puts pressure on your BOM and pressures margins. So perhaps if you could just tell us how you think conceptually about where you think replacement cycles go over time and why. And then secondly, how do you address this dilemma of, well, in order to make a great phone, it typically costs more to do so and managing that potential margin pressure?",185
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2014",2014-04-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3566.0,615633.0,27766313.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,20,"There's a lot there. Let me see if I can address it quickly. Now I want to just add one thing to the point that you asked Luca. Just to be clear on the iPhone 4 question, we sold a very, very low single-digit percentage of those. And so we've had extremely minimal impact of results on the quarter. In terms of the general upgrade or the installed base, some of the programs that the carriers are running may serve to increase the upgrade cycle, because there are some areas where customers can pay a bit more in the beginning and have the ability to essentially upgrade each year. And so I think there's some that work that way. I think there's some that work the way that -- more of the way that you're leaning, and how these balance are very difficult currently to conclude. But regardless of how those balance, what I see is the -- the bigger opportunity for Apple is that the smartphone market is still only 1 billion or so units, and it will eventually take over the entire mobile phone market. We've seen our ability to attract new users to iPhone to be very significant in the emerging markets. I mean, we were seeing new-to-iPhone numbers on the iPhone 4s sales in the 80 percentages and in certain large geos. And so this, to us, gives us a great comfort that we can continue to grow. And we may not be able to attract some of those buyers to our top phone because of price point. But if we can get them in on the entry iPhone, it gives them a great product at a great value and gets them into the ecosystem. And as you know from following us for a while, our ability to keep customers is very good, and our ability to show other products that Apple produces to a family that's buying Apple products is also very good. And so at the macro level, I see the opportunity of the market and getting more people into the Apple ecosystem much larger than any of the noise around the different carrier plans, some of which I think helped and some of which I think worked the opposite way, and it's completely unclear to me how those net. It's probably also important to know that the bulk of the things you're seeing in the U.S. are not occurring in many of the other geos in terms of the upgrade policies and so forth. I mean, each country has its own kind of cadence associated with this. And the U.S. is -- it's in the 30 percentages of our business, not 100, so it's important to weigh it under -- with the proper perspective.",462

And any comments on the latter part of that around sort of the imperative to continue to come out with really great products that ensure people have an incentive to upgrade, yet when we've seen you really revolutionize phones between iterations, we've seen margin pressure?",46

And you can bet that, that's where the vast majority of all of our attention is -- or is on doing those things. In terms of the BOM pressure of any new product, you have seen in the past that exists. I think you've also seen that we have a way of working down the cost curve. That was certainly very key in achieving the 39.3% gross margin for this past quarter. And as I said before, we price things at a level that is fair for the value that we are providing. And so we're certainly not stuck on certain price points. We price values that are fair for the value that we're delivering.",146

What are your thoughts in terms of why that is? And can that accelerate with Office on the iPad going forward?",51
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2014",2014-04-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3566.0,615633.0,27766318.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,25,"It's a good question. Let's talk about iPad a little more than we did in the comments. When I back up from iPad, here's what I see. I see it absolutely has been the fastest-growing product in Apple's history, and it's been the only product that we've ever made that was instantly a hit in 3 of our key markets, from consumer to business, including the enterprise, and education. And so if you really look at it in just 4 years after we launched the very first iPad, we've sold over 210 million, which is more than we or I think anyone thought was possible that period of time. And it's interesting to note that, that's almost twice as many iPhones as we had sold in a comparable period of time and over 7x as many iPods as we have sold in the period of time. So I think it's important to kind of -- to put that in perspective. We've come a long way very, very quickly. Looking at it by market a bit, which I think is important, I think Luca mentioned a little bit of this in his comments. In the education market in the U.S., we have a 95% share. And so the focus in education is on penetration, is on getting more schools to buy. And my belief is the match has been lit, and it's very clear to the educators that have studied this is that student achievement is higher with iPad in the classroom than without it. And so I'm confident we've got a really great start in education far beyond the U.S. Now this is happening in many, many parts of the world. In the enterprise market, we're seeing virtually all, 98% of the Fortune 500, that are using iPad. And we're seeing -- according to Good Technology, who looks at activations of tablets, the latest data we have from them is that 91% of the activations of tablets in enterprise were iPads. And so this is also an astonishing number. And many of those enterprises are writing apps that are key proprietary apps for running that business. And this is great for that company because they're more productive as a result of that. And so once again, our -- just like in education in a way, what we have to do in enterprise is focus on penetration. It has to be deeper and broader. But in terms of having people begin the process, beginning writing apps, we're doing a pretty good job of that. In the retail market, if you look at the U.S. as a proxy, the NPD numbers for March just came out a few days ago, and we had 46% share. And embedded in that 46%, there's a lot of things in there that I personally wouldn't put in the same category as iPad and that are weighing the share down. It's certainly a market we wouldn't play in, in a type of product you would never see an Apple brand on. So we feel like we're doing well there. Office, I believe, does help. It's very unclear to say how much. I believe if it would have been done earlier, it would have been even better for Microsoft, frankly. There's lots of alternatives out there from a productivity point of view, some of which we brought to the market, some of which many, many innovative companies have brought. But I do see that Office is still a very key franchise in the enterprise, in particular, and I think having it on iPad is good. And I wholeheartedly welcome Microsoft to the App Store to sell Office, and our customers are clearly responding in a good way that it's available. So I do think it helps us, particularly in the enterprise area. The other things you look at on iPad that are just blow-away is customer sat is 98%. There's almost nothing in the world with a 98% customer sat. And the intention-to-buy numbers look good, with 2/3 of the people planning to buy a tablet are planning to buy an iPad. The usage numbers are off the charts, far and exceeding Android tablets, 4x the web traffic of all Android tablets combined. And so when I back up from all of these, I feel great. That doesn't mean that every quarter, every 90 days, is going to be a number that everybody's thrilled with. But what it means to me is that the trend over time, over the arc of time, that things look very, very good, that iPad has a great future. And, of course, the thing that drives us more than any of this are the next iPads, if you will, the things that are in the pipeline, the things that we can do to make the product even better. And there's no shortage of work going in on that, nor any shortage of ideas. And so when I back up from all of this, I can't help but still be extremely excited about where we are. And I think we did a reasonable job of explaining what we think the disconnect was between what we had expected, which we hit it at the high end of our expectation, and the Street's view of this. I believe the vast majority of it is that first thing was just channel inventory, that maybe we should have been even clearer on last quarter to take into account. But I am very bullish on iPad.",918

One other question. When you look at Google and Amazon and Facebook, they very much diversify their business over time in a way that one has rarely seen. Apple, sort of the opposite. People say you ought to buy this or that and you will do acquisitions, but you're obviously very focused. Is that because it's just a management philosophy of wanting to be more focused than some of these other companies? Or was there something about Apple's product set, particularly being more hardware-oriented, that kind of prevents you from saying, ""Let's go make TV shows or let's go off and do something else,"" even though you probably have the money and the technical capability to do other things?",122

And so we currently feel comfortable in expanding the number of things we're working on. And so we've been doing that in the background. And we're not ready yet to pull the string on the curtain. But we've got some great things there that we're working on, that I'm very, very proud of and very, very excited about. But for us, we care about every detail. And when you care about every detail and getting it right, it takes a bit longer to do that. And it's -- and that's always been the case. That's not something that just occurred. We -- as you probably know from following us for a long time, we didn't ship the first MP3 player, nor the first smartphone, nor the first tablet. In fact, there were tablets being shipped a decade or so before then. But arguably, we shipped the first successful modern tablet, the first successful modern smartphone and the first successful modern MP3 player. And so it means much more to us to get it right than to be first. And I think you can see so many examples out in the marketplace where it's clear that the objective has been to be first, but customers at the end of the day don't care about that or that's not what they look for from Apple. They want great, insanely great, and that's what we want to deliver. And so that's the way we look at it. And from an acquisition point of view, we have done 24 in 18 months. We're -- that shows that we're on the prowl, I suppose you could say. We look for companies that have great people and great technology and that fit culturally. And we don't have a rule that says we can't spend a lot or whatever. We'll spend what we think is a fair price. What's important to us is that strategically, it makes sense and that it winds up adding value to our shareholders over the long haul. We are not in a race to spend the most or acquire the most. We're in a race to make the world's best products that really enrich people's lives. And so to the tune that acquisitions can help us do that, and they've done that and continue to do that, then we will acquire. And so you can bet that we will -- you will continue to see acquisitions, and some of which we'll try to keep quiet, and some of which seems to be impossible to keep quiet.",462

If you look at some of your competitors seemed to have cut prices fairly quickly in the most recent product cycle, perhaps faster than before. You've got Microsoft about to close on Nokia. Lenovo is buying MOTOROLA. There's a lot going on from a, sort of, competitive standpoint. So I'm curious as to how you're seeing the market.",79

And so -- but at the end of the day, we see it much like we've always seen it as. The part of the market that we're interested in is the market of people that really want the best smartphones, and that doesn't mean that they're all at the high end of the price band. I mean, we have smartphones that go down to a very affordable price for the 4s because we're proud to ship that product. I think that this quarter, if you were unsure, hopefully, this quarter demonstrates to you that we can do well in a number of geographies, from emerging markets to developed markets. Some of the numbers that we've experienced, just to quote some of the more historic prepaid markets, through the first half of '14, Brazil was up 61%; Russia was up 97%; Turkey was up 56%; India was up 55%; Vietnam was up 262%. I could go on. But the point is that there's a number of markets out there where we are beginning to really catch on to a number of customers. And I am particularly proud of the results in these markets because these have not been historic strong points for Apple. We've been working at China for a while and have learned a lot, and I'm very proud of what we've done there. But I think some of these other numbers I just read demonstrates that we're beginning to have really nice success outside of there as well.",275

And then if you can just -- actually, as a follow-up, on the China side, I think it grew at 13% year-over-year, and you mentioned, obviously, China Mobile as being a driver of that. But can you talk about some of the other categories as well and perhaps some of the other carriers in terms of where you're seeing demand out of China?",64
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2014",2014-04-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3566.0,615633.0,27766325.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,32,"Yes. Really great question. We did have an all-time revenue record in Greater China, just under 10 billion, at 9.8 billion. iPhone sales were up 28%. That's versus the IDC's market forecast of 20% growth. So we gained share. Mac units were up double digit. In particular, they were up 13%, and that's far outpacing IDC's PC market forecast of a negative 8%. So we gained share there as well. If you look at the iTunes software and services revenue in China, we more than doubled it. Year-over-year we were in the triple digits percentages. And if you look at iPad and you take out the channel inventory's ins and outs and look at demand instead of sell-in, we grew by 6%, and that compares to IDC's forecast of a flat tablet market in China for last quarter. And so we literally did well in every single area in China. It wasn't a -- it wasn't just because we were able to come to an agreement with the world's largest carrier. That was certainly key. But as you can tell from the rest of these numbers, there are other things going on. Also, I had mentioned this briefly with Steve, and I think it's important to point out, that if you look at some of the numbers we're seeing on first-time iPhone buyers, people that bought the iPhone 4s, 85% were first-time iPhone buyers; and the 5c, 69% first-time iPhone buyers. So these are extraordinary. And as you would expect, these are also heavily Android switchers. 62% of the people that bought the 4s switched from Android. 60% of the people that bought the 5c switched from Android. And so we're incredibly pleased with this. For the first half, including our retail stores, Greater China revenue topped 19 billion. So this is up 21% year-over-year and is our fastest-growing region. And so we're looking at this data and deciding to continue investing in a big way. We plan to triple the number of Apple retail stores over the next 2 years. We're continuing to expand in online. We're continuing to build out channel. We're up to 40,000 points of sale now in iPhone. But we're not nearly where we need to be on the rest of our product line. And even the 40,000 is a low number in considering the broad land mass and the number of folks in China. And so I feel like there's still loads of opportunity there, and I feel really, really good about how we're doing.",421

The reason that I stripped off the hobby label is that when you look at the sales of the Apple TV box itself and you look at a content that was bought directly off of Apple TV, for 2013, that number was over $1 billion. And so it didn't feel right to me to refer to something that's over $1 billion as a hobby. Also, from a investment point of view, we continue to make the product better and better, and so it doesn't feel right from that point of view either. We have HBO GO already on Apple TV, and you have to authenticate in order to use it. But you have to do that with Amazon service as well, from my brief read of their announcement. I think they, in addition to that, got some old -- older content from HBO to put on there. I haven't had a chance to evaluate exactly what it is and don't have a personal point of view on that yet. But if I look broadly at the content on Apple TV, I think it compares extremely favorable to the content that is on the Amazon box. We've sold now, Gene, about 20 million of the Apple TVs. And so we've got a pretty large installed base there, and I'm feeling quite good about that business and where it can go.",233

It's been a very busy and exciting time at Apple, and I'd like to review some of the highlights of our June quarter. We hosted our best-ever Worldwide Developers Conference last month, with over 20 million people from around the world watching our keynote session, which is a new record.
We've had overwhelming response from customers and developers to the new features we previewed in OS X Yosemite and iOS 8. Yosemite has been redesigned with a fresh look and powerful new apps, and iOS 8 is the biggest release since the launch of the App Store.
With powerful continuity features, these upcoming releases will allow Macs and iOS devices to work together in even smarter ways. Customers can start an activity like writing an email on one device and pass it to another, picking up where they left off without missing a beat. They'll even be able to make and receive iPhone calls on their Mac with just a click. These are features that only Apple can deliver.
With iOS 8, we've opened over 4,000 APIs, providing more flexibility and opportunity for developers than ever before. iOS 8 provides developers with amazing new frameworks, enables wider use of Touch ID to securely authenticate users within apps and lets developers further customize the user experience with major extensibility features such as third-party keyboards.
We've also introduced Swift, an innovative new programming language for both iOS and OS X. Swift is the result of the latest research on programming languages combined with decades of experience within building Apple platforms. It makes writing code interactive and fun, eliminates entire classes of unsafe codes and generates apps that run lightning-fast. It's easy to learn, allowing even more people to dream big and create whole new categories of apps.
We believe our new OS releases, combined with Swift, will result in a huge leap forward for the Apple ecosystem, and we can't wait to see what developers will create with Yosemite, iOS 8 and Swift.
When we introduced iOS 7 years ago, it was a revolutionary operating system for iPhone. Over the years, we've extended it to the iPod family with iPod touch and later to a tablet form factor with iPad. An explosion of apps, accessories and services for these devices has created an incredibly vibrant ecosystem.
We're extending iOS in even more dimensions, as customers around the world make iPhones and iPads an essential part of their lives at home, at school, at work and on the go. We're putting a huge effort into delivering the best experience for our customers wherever they use iOS. That includes a safe and intuitive user interface while driving called CarPlay, which is being integrated by 29 major car brands, including Audi, BMW, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes, Toyota and Volvo and aftermarket systems like Pioneer and Alpine.
We've created a new tool for developers called HealthKit, which lets health and fitness apps work together and empowers customers to choose what health data they share. We're taking the first steps in this area in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic, whose new apps can automatically receive data from a blood pressure app, for example, and share it with a physician, or a nutrition app can inform fitness apps how many calories are being consumed each day. Our own health app will provide an easy-to-read dashboard of all health and fitness data.
We're enabling new ways to control lights and doors and thermostats and other connected devices around the house using Siri with the HomeKit feature of iOS 8. And in the enterprise, we're including new security, productivity and device management features in iOS 8. We forged a relationship with IBM to deliver a new class of mobile business solutions to enterprise customers around the world.
We're working together to provide companies access to the power of big data analytics right on every employee's iPhone or iPad. Using Swift, we'll collaborate to bring over 100 mobile-first apps to enterprise clients, each addressing a specific industry need or opportunity. This is a radical step for enterprise and opens up a large market opportunity for Apple.
But more importantly, it's great for productivity and creativity of our enterprise customers. From the pocket to the car to the workplace, home and gym, we have a very large vision of what iOS can be, and we're incredibly excited about our plans.
Turning to our financial results. Today, we're reporting record June quarter revenue, thanks to the very strong performance of iPhone, Mac and the continued growth of revenue from the Apple ecosystem. Our teams executed brilliantly during the quarter, with earnings per share up 20% year-over-year, our highest growth rate in 7 quarters.
We sold over 35 million iPhones, setting a new third quarter record. We generated healthy growth in our entry price, mid-tier and lead iPhone categories. I'm especially happy about our progress in the BRIC countries, where iPhone sales were up a very strong 55% year-over-year.
We also had a record June quarter for Mac sales, with growth of 18% year-over-year and a market that is shrinking by 2% according to IDC's latest estimate. Demand has been very strong for our portables in particular, and we've had a great customer response to the new higher-performance, lower-priced MacBook Air.
It was another strong performance for the App Store and the other services contributing to the thriving Apple ecosystem. In fact, for the first 9 months of this fiscal year, the line item that we call iTunes Software and Services has been the fastest-growing part of our business. iTunes billings grew 25% year-over-year in the June quarter and reached an all-time quarterly high, thanks to the very strong results from the App Store. We're continuing to invest in our incredible ecosystem, which is a huge asset for Apple and a very important differentiator of our customer experience.
iPad sales met our expectations but we realized they didn't meet many of yours. Our sales were gated in part by a reduction in channel inventory and in part by market softness in certain parts of the world. For example, IDC's latest estimate indicates a 5% overall decline in the U.S. tablet market, as well as a decline in the Western European tablet market in the June quarter.
But what's most important to us is that customers are enjoying their iPads and using them heavily. In a survey conducted in May by ChangeWave, iPad Air registered a 98% customer satisfaction rate, while iPad mini with Retina display received an astonishing 100% customer satisfaction rate. The survey also found that among people planning to purchase a tablet within 90 days, 63% plan to buy an iPad, and our own data indicates that more than 1/2 of customers purchasing an iPad are buying their very first iPad.
Another recent study by Custora found that iPad accounts for 80% of all U.S. tablet-based e-commerce purchases. We're very bullish about the future of the tablet market, and we're confident that we can continue to bring significant innovation to this category through hardware, software and services.
We think our partnership with IBM, providing a new generation of mobile enterprise applications, designed with iPad's legendary ease-of-use and backed by IBM's cloud services and data analytics, will be one such catalyst for future iPad growth.
Looking ahead, we are very excited about our agreement to purchase Beats Electronics and Beats Music. Music is part of Apple's DNA, and we think the addition of the Beats team will be great for music lovers. Beats provides Apple with a fantastic subscription music service, access to rare talent and a fast-growing lineup of products that we can build upon.
Not counting Beats, we've completed 29 acquisitions since the beginning of fiscal year 2013, including 5 since the end of the March quarter, and we've brought some incredible technology and more importantly, some incredible talent into Apple in the process.
We're hard at work and investing heavily on exciting opportunities across our business, and we have an incredible pipeline of new products and services that we can't wait to show you. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca to discuss our Q3 results in more detail.",1372
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2014",2014-07-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3202.0,660951.0,29412315.0,Presenter Speech,Luca Maestri,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. We set a new June quarter record for revenue at $37.4 billion, up $2.1 billion or 6% year-over-year. This result was towards the high end of our guidance range despite the reduction in channel inventory for both iPhone and iPad.
The revenue growth was driven by strong sales of iPhones and Macs, as well as the continued great performance of iTunes Software and Services. Gross margin was 39.4%, above our guidance range, and operating margin was $10.3 billion, representing 27.5% of revenue. Net income was $7.7 billion, translating to diluted earnings per share of $1.28, a 20% year-over-year increase.
For details by product, I'd like to start with iPhone. We sold 35.2 million iPhones, an increase of 4 million over last year, representing 13% growth. As Tim mentioned, iPhone sales grew well across all 3 of our entry price, mid-tier and lead product categories.
In the U.S., iPhone accounts for 41.9% of the smartphone subscriber base according to the latest data from comScore, up from 41.3% in the previous measurement period. Also, based on the latest survey by ChangeWave, iPhone earned a 97% customer satisfaction rate. And among respondents planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 50% plan to purchase an iPhone, up from 42% in the March quarter and 44% a year ago.
iPhone sales were at the high end of our expectations despite new product rumors that we believe resulted in purchase delay. In addition, tax increases and the regulatory environment in Japan affected smartphone sales in what has been one of iPhone's fastest-growing markets in recent quarters. Considering these factors, the performance of iPhone was even more impressive in the June quarter, and it boosts our confidence for the future. We reduced iPhone channel inventory by about 150,000 from the end of the March quarter, leaving us within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks.
Apple continues to innovate through hardware, software and services to make iPhone the best smartphone for business. Today, companies have equipped millions of employees with iPhones and have seen tremendous benefits in productivity, employee satisfaction and profitability.
For instance, medical device leader Medtronic has developed over 175 internal iOS apps for over 16,500 iPhones used by its employees to facilitate sales, improve productivity and ensure that essential marketing materials are up to date. Throughout the global offices of Nestlé, the largest food company in the world, over 25,000 iPhones are accessing corporate networks, improving communication and connecting employees to critical internal resources. And at NASA, over 26,000 iPhones are in use by scientists, flight crew members, technicians and researchers.
Turning to iPad, we sold 13.3 million units compared to 14.6 million in the June quarter last year. iPad sales grew overall in the developing markets, with particularly strong year-over-year growth in the Middle East where iPad sales were up 64%, in China where they grew 51% and in India where they were up 45%. This growth was more than offset by lower sales in more mature markets.
We reduced iPad channel inventory by 500,000 from the end of the March quarter, which left us within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks.
In the enterprise, global companies are using iPad to improve customer service, boost worker productivity and enhance critical processes. iPad continues to be the standard for teams across the airline industry.
Qantas Airline has over 15,000 iPads deployed to pilots, as well as cabin, customer service and ground crews, to enhance key processes across their daily operations. And governments are deploying thousands of iPads worldwide. One of the largest examples is Sweden, where over 100,000 iPads are being used by local government offices across the country.
In education, iPad remains the tablet of choice, with 85% share of the U.S. education tablet market according to the latest published estimate from IDC. We've now sold 13 million iPads to education customers globally. We bring in teachers and students great new tools to build and experience educational account into an iPad.
As of this month, teachers using the free iTunes U app can create, edit and manage entire courses directly on iPad for the first time, and students can discover new ways to collaborate, including the ability to start class discussions and ask questions right from their iPad.
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4.4 million Macs compared to under 3.8 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 18% year-over-year and a new June quarter record. The increase was driven by portables, thanks to very strong growth of MacBook Air.
We achieved strong double-digit Mac growth across many countries, including the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Germany, France, Australia, China, India and the Middle East. This growth is particularly impressive, given the contraction of the overall PC market. Macs have now gained global market share for 32 of the last 33 quarters.
Macs performed well in the U.S. education buying season, with double-digit growth in the K-12 market, driven primarily by large deployments of MacBook Air. The Shawnee Mission School District in Kansas chose Apple to provide an entire solution that will equip every teacher with a MacBook Air and an iPad Air, every high school student with a MacBook Air and every middle school and elementary student with an iPad.
The Rowan-Salisbury School System in North Carolina is deploying thousands of MacBook Airs to students and teachers in grades 9 to 12 as part of the district's digital learning initiative. We ended the quarter with Mac channel inventory slightly below our 4- to 5-week target range.
The Apple ecosystem continues to grow and thrive. Total revenue from iTunes Software and Services was $4.5 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year. Our iTunes stores generated all-time record billings of $5.4 billion in the June quarter, up 25% year-over-year, driven by very strong growth in App Store sales. These iTunes billings translated to quarterly iTunes revenue of almost $2.6 billion, up 8% from the year ago quarter. Software and services revenue was $1.9 billion, up 19% from a year ago.
App Store momentum remains very strong, and cumulative app downloads have topped 75 billion. We continue to be amazed by our vibrant and diverse developer community, and we're extremely proud that our developers have now earned over $20 billion for sales of their apps through the App Store, nearly 1/2 of which have been earned in the past 12 months. This number truly stands out among our competition as our developers continue to benefit from the broad reach and thoughtful design of the App Store, coupled with Apple's large, loyal and very engaged customer base.
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $164.5 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $13.9 billion. Our domestic cash was $26.8 billion at the end of the June quarter, a sequential increase of $8.3 billion, and $137.7 billion or 84% of our total cash was offshore. Cash flow from operations was $10.3 billion.
We executed another very successful debt offering in April, issuing a total of $12 billion in notes across 3-, 5-, 7-, 10- and 30-year maturities. In addition, during the quarter, we entered the commercial paper market for the first time, with $2 billion in short-term obligations outstanding as of the end of June.
We also continued to execute our shareholder return program, with $8.3 billion of capital returned to investors during the June quarter. We spent $5 billion to repurchase 59 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We paid almost $2.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and utilized over $400 million to net-share-settle vesting employee RSUs. We've now taken action on over $74 billion of our $130 billion capital return program, including $51 billion in share repurchases, with 6 quarters remaining to its completion. And finally, our board has declared a dividend of $0.47 per common share payable on August 14, 2014, to shareholders of record as of August 11, 2014.
Now as we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $37 billion and $40 billion compared to $37.5 billion in the year ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 37% and 38%. We expect OpEx to be between $4.75 billion and $4.85 billion.
We expect OI&E to be about $250 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.1%. Finally, we expect the Beats transaction to close this quarter, and we expect the acquisition to be accretive to our earnings in our fiscal 2015. 
With that, let me open the call to questions.",1457

It was obviously a surprise also to us. We were expecting, obviously, a loss in leverage from the sequential decline in revenue, which obviously happened. We also expected some unfavorable mix, which also happens, it's typical as we move away from the launch quarter. And we were expecting some cost improvements. These cost improvements came in. They came in stronger than we were anticipating. The commodity markets continue to be favorable. The product quality continues to be excellent. Our teams executed really, really well. And all these things came together at the same time, and it was a very nice surprise for us. As we look forward into Q4, yes, we've guided to 37% to 38%. Again, the mix is the normal mix that we see as we continue to move through the product cycle. And obviously in Q4, we got some transition costs because we're expecting a very busy fall. We're very excited about what we got in the pipeline, and that's the reason why we guide to that range.",173

So we take into account the fact that we've seen some purchase delays already during Q3, but we're seeing in some sales trends in certain geographies that, that continues to happen.

In particular, in the context over usage comments, how are you thinking about the competitive landscape now and how that may evolve? And then I guess, related to that, what do you think could be the next driver of renewed growth for the category?",70
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2014",2014-07-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3202.0,660951.0,29412324.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,12,"Bill, it's Tim. The -- if you sort of back up from this, the category that we created, which has just been a little over 4 years, we've now sold 225 million iPads, which is, I think, probably a larger number than anyone would have predicted at the time, including ourselves quite frankly. We still feel the category as a whole is in its early days, and that there's also significant innovation that can be brought to the iPad, and we plan on doing that. When I look at the top-level numbers, I get really excited when I see that more than 50% of the iPads that we're selling are going to someone who is a first-time tablet buyer. I get excited when I see that the retail share, according to NPD, in the month of June was 59% of units and over 70% in terms of dollars. And of course, Luca mentioned in his preamble that our education share is 85%. We also are in the -- virtually all Fortune 500 companies, we're in 99% of them to be exact, and 93% of the Global 500. However, when we dig into the business market deeper, though our market share in the U.S. in the commercial sector is good at 76%, this is according to IDC, the penetration in business is low. It's only 20%. And to put that in some kind of context, if you looked at penetration of notebooks in business, it would be over 60%. And so we think that there's a substantial upside in business. And this was one of the thinkings behind the partnership with IBM that we announced last week. We think that the core thing that unleashes this is a better go-to-market, which IBM clearly brings to the table, but even more importantly, apps that are written with mobile first in mind. Many of the -- not all, but many of the enterprise apps that have been written for iPad have been essentially ports from a desktop arrangement and haven't taken full advantage of mobile. And so we're excited about bringing that to business along with partnering with IBM, which we think is a first-class company, and seeing what that can do to sales in business, which I honestly believe the opportunity is huge. The market is still predicted in 2018, I think these are Gartner numbers, to be about 350 million in size. And to put that in some context, I think the PC market right now is about 315 million. And so I think our theory that has been there honestly since the first time that we shipped iPad, that the tablet market would eventually surpass the PC market, that theory is still intact. I just think we have to do some more things to get the business side of it moving in a faster trajectory. And I think we're now onto something that can really do that. So as I look at it and sort of back up from the 90-day clock kind of thing, I'm incredibly excited, I mean, excited about the plans that we have on the product side and also on the go-to-market side and the -- in particular, the IBM announcement. One other point I might add on this, because I think this is interesting, I don't think it came out in our commentary so far, is the market's very bifurcated on iPad. The -- in the BRIC countries, iPad did extremely well. The growth was very high. Like in the China, it was in the 50s; in the Middle East, it was in the 60s. Luca may have mentioned these numbers. In the developed countries like the U.S., the market is clearly weaker there. It's interesting to note, however, that those -- that the U.S. as an example, we had a very, very strong Macintosh market in the U.S. And so there's probably a bit of higher ed kind of stuff beginning to play out too, where higher ed is clearly still very much notebook-oriented. K-12, on the other hand, we sell 2.5 iPads for every Mac into K-12. And so we're headed -- we're clearly headed into that season now. And it typically starts in graduation time frame, in fiscal Q3 for us. And so I think that's probably another thing that we're seeing.",720

One more question if I could. You had obviously great performance in the BRIC countries, and you touched on China for a few categories. Can you talk about the overall demand environment you saw for China in the quarter? Obviously, there’re some seasonal factors to consider, but how should we think about your performance versus your expectations and how you're thinking about it the rest of the calendar year?",72

We came in at 26% of revenue growth including at retail. And if you look at the units, the unit growth was really off the charts across the board. iPhone, 48% up. That compares to a market estimate of 24%, so growing at 2x the market. iPad was up as well, as I'd mentioned before. Mac was up 39%, and that's versus a market in China that's also contracting along with markets in most parts of the world. And in China, it's projected to contract by 5%. And so we're seeing some substantial strength there. And the thing that's actually growing the most is the iTunes Software and Services category, which has the App Store in it, et cetera. And that area is almost doubling year-over-year. And so it's very, very exciting what we're seeing there. We are still in the process of rolling out, along with our partner, China Mobile, the TD-LTE into more cities and so that -- we're still in the early going on that. That just started in January, as you know. And my understanding is that later this year, there will be a license for the other operators to begin shifting FDD-LTE, which I think is another big opportunity in China.",231

Luca, I wanted to revisit the gross margin question. You talked about guidance for next quarter, the drivers of the sequential decline being a normal mix through the cycle and transition costs. Your guidance to the midpoint is down 190 basis points in gross margin. Last year, in Q4, gross margins were up 10 basis points sequentially in fiscal Q4. And the product transition issues or cycle issues that you allude to seem essentially identical. So I'd like to try and understand what might make this Q4 different, let's say, than last Q4.",103

Also, when you look at it in terms of absolute levels of gross margin, last year, it was 37%. So our range is above that level. There's obviously many, many things that affect us in different ways from one year to the other. Foreign exchange is a case where a lot of the emerging market currencies and the yen and the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar, they've been weaker against the U.S. dollar, that has an impact on margin.

Tim, I wanted to get your input on the impact of trade-in programs for the iPhone, particularly in mature markets where they're most prevalent. As best I can tell, if I look at the last 4 quarters, so not hyper-focused on 90 days, it looks like the iPhone's been about flat in unit terms in the Americas and up low-single digits in Europe. And I think Europe includes India, which is obviously very fast-growing, so perhaps low-single digits in Europe. So if we look at those Western geographies, we've seen relatively flattish iPhone unit sales over the last year. I know you don't report it, but just sort of based on overall revenue reporting. I'm wondering if you can comment on what you're seeing in terms of iPhone trade-in programs. And this is 4 quarters, so over a complete cycle. Whether you think they're elongating or shrinking, and what impact these very prevalent, increasingly prevalent trade-in programs might be having on them? And what impact your pricing of older-generation devices might be having on them?",176

Like if I look at Europe, the operating segments of Europe for the quarter -- or year-to-date for 2014 versus the same period last year, iPhone units were actually up 10%. Your more macro question or what I understand to be your more macro question, do I think there's some sort of cannibalization going on of trade-in programs on new products sales. What I think is happening in the aggregate, if you look across the world, is that trade-ins are actually hugely beneficial for our ecosystem because people wind up -- we have more people that are able to join the party when we have a trade-in, because, in essence, it winds up being used by -- in the -- probably the prime example, someone else within the family or in the example that has become more common in the last year, someone trades it in and then that goes to either somebody else in that country that is very price-sensitive or somebody in a different country. And I see all of this as good. In looking at how much of it cannibalizes, it is very hard to answer that question with any degree of preciseness. But my gut is that the cannibalization factor is low, because you wind up having -- you wind up attracting people that are much more price-sensitive than there. I think the great thing is our products command a much higher resale value than others do. And so that leads to a larger trade-in. And from my perspective, that means a larger ecosystem, more people that wind up getting on iPhone. And as you know, from following us for quite some time, if we get somebody to try an Apple product and then buy an Apple product, the likelihood that they begin buying other Apple products that may be in different categories or upgrading to one in that category in the future is very high. And so net-net, I view it to be positive. It's very difficult to quantify with certainty.",347

Could you elaborate on that? And what kind of comparisons perhaps you see going forward?",28

VAT was increased from 5% to 8% at close to the beginning of the quarter; I think it was actually April 1 or so. That was the first planned VAT increase. There are other or at least one additional planned VAT increase in the future. This was a part of the overall tax reform package in Japan. Secondly, the carriers received some guidance from the regulators to essentially stop incenting people to transfer from another carrier at a higher amount than they were incenting their -- retaining their own customers. And so it appears that the combination of these 2 things dampened the whole market for smartphones in Japan. We haven't been able to get very detailed data on share, but my expectation is we're not going to see very much of a share change. And we're beginning to see some coming back of that market as we stepped into this quarter, maybe not back to the level that it was previously. But you can begin to see the market growing again, which we view is very positive. In the past when we've seen these type of things, tax changes, et cetera, there's usually a rush to buy before the tax increase, a pause that happens thereafter and then the market eventually goes back to some kind of steady state that may not be exactly where it was but it mirrors it. And so I think that's likely our guts or that's what happens on the VAT side. The other piece is a little harder to conclude what will happen in terms of that guidance and how long that might be in place. I don't know that part.",289

For Luca, on -- you mentioned that commodity pricing, I guess the environment was good for you. Is it your working assumption in your guidance that, that continues to be favorable and a tailwind for you? And then my question for Tim is that with the installment plans that are being introduced in the U.S., I imagine that given the increased flexibility for people to upgrade faster, would you expect that to happen for iPhone -- are you seeing any evidence of that as these contracts come up because we've had them out now for several months? And how do you see that impacting your business? Because obviously, the U.S. iPhone part of your business is still very significant, and it could be quite a big catalyst for your iPhone business going forward, I would imagine. Or would you be more tempered? And how would you see that playing out?",161
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2014",2014-07-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3202.0,660951.0,29412343.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,31,"I'll take both of these, this is Tim. On the component question, what we saw in the June quarter was that NAND, mobile DRAM and LCD, the pricing on all of those declined, while PC DRAM increased despite the market for PCs contracting. In the September quarter, what is factored in our guidance is that LCDs and mobile DRAM continued to decline, that NAND pricing remains essentially flat from last quarter. And that PC DRAM has a slight price increase. And in terms of other commodities that I didn't talk about, we've assumed that they would decline at historical rates. And so that's factored into the gross margin guidance that Luca gave you. In terms of the installment plans that you mention in the U.S. relative to iPhone, there's a lot of different models that are being tried in the U.S. and throughout the world. And actually last quarter, as we estimated, and this is subject to an estimating error, but we're estimating that less than 1 out of 4 iPhones were sold on a traditional subsidy plan. And so that number is markedly different than it would have been 2 years ago. The installment plans that you're speaking about, which gives a customer the right to upgrade fast or faster than our usual 2-year cycle, we think that, that plays to our customer base in a large way. And so that makes us incredibly bullish that customers on those plans would be very likely to upgrade when we announce a new product.",254

I guess, during the quarter, you did 2 very big things, in our opinion, obviously buying Beats, biggest acquisition in your history. And you also did this IBM deal, which obviously was this quarter, but since the last call, and that was very interesting obviously, really collaborating with another huge company to get further into the enterprise. And I was just wondering what are you seeing in Apple that's changing? These seem like big deals that change your direction a bit, something that you wouldn't have done in the past. And do you see a lot more partnerships and larger acquisitions on the horizon to grow your TAM in various markets?",117

As I've said before, I think we have the capability to acquire a sizable company and manage it. And relative to IBM, I feel the same way. I think you can only do so many partnerships well. And so it's unusual that we enter into a partnership. But in this particular case, I think arguably, the companies are so complementary. And I've gotten to know Ginni fairly well over the last couple of years, and I think we see the importance of the customer a lot of the same way, and both feel that mobile and enterprise is just an enormous opportunity. And we're not competing with each other. And so I think a partnership in that case is particularly great. Would we do more of either of the things we did? We're always looking in the acquisition space, but we don't let the – let our money burn a hole in our pocket, and we don't do things that aren't strategic. And so with Beats, we felt we were getting a incredible subscription service, a very rare set of talent that we think can do great things in Apple and access to a very fast-growing business in their headphone and earphone space. And so -- and culturally, we felt there was a match, and music has been deeply embedded in Apple's DNA for many, many years. And so it was a great marriage, and I think the partnership with IBM is a great marriage as well. If more like that presented themselves or -- then I think we can manage more things. I think we have a very, very strong executive team and can do that. But it's not my goal to acquire a certain number of companies or spend a certain amount of money. We want to do things that help us make great products and are great for our customers and so forth. And so that's how...",339

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Since we spoke in July, it's been an exciting and very busy time so we have lots of great things to talk about today.
Just last month, we launched the biggest advancements in iPhone history with iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. These iPhones are the best we have ever created and customers absolutely love them. Our operational team has done an extraordinary job executing a manufacturing ramp throughout the entire supply chain. To date, we've launched in 32 countries including China, and our new iPhones will be shipping in 69 countries and territories by the end of this month, making this our fastest and most successful iPhone launch ever.
Demand for the new iPhones has been staggering and geographically broad-based, markedly higher in every single country where we've launched compared to the iPhone 5s a year ago. We're working hard to fill orders as fast as possible, and we're on track to be in more than 115 countries by the end of December.
Last month, we introduced 2 new categories. The first is Apple Pay, an entirely new way to pay for things in stores and in apps. It makes mobile payments easier, more secure and more private. Apple Pay went live today. And now, making purchases in participating stores happens with just a touch of a finger.
Paying within apps is as easy as selecting Apple Pay and placing your finger on Touch ID. Today, Apple Pay supports credit and debit cards from the 3 major payment networks and the top U.S. banks, and over 500 additional banks have signed on and will be supporting Apple Pay beginning this year and early next year. Apple Pay is being supported by many of the nation's top retailers and we continue to sign more retailers.
The second new category is Apple Watch, our most personal device ever and one that has already captured the world's imagination. We can't wait to get Apple Watch to customers beginning in early calendar 2015. We'll be providing more details on Apple Watch as we get closer to the shipment date.
Last week, we launched the new iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3, with innovations that make them dramatically better than previous generations, and the stunning new iMac with a Retina 5K display. We released iOS 8 last month, and our customers are enjoying new ways to use their iPhone, iPad or iPod touch with intuitive new features and groundbreaking security.
Last week, we also released OS X Yosemite with an all-new design and Continuity features that deliver an even more fluid experience across all of our iOS devices and Macs. These introductions reflect years of innovation and hard work by teams all across Apple, and they demonstrate the seamless integration of hardware, software and services that provide unparalleled user experiences for our customers. These are things that only Apple can do.
We've also communicated and demonstrated our commitment to respecting and protecting user's privacy with strong encryption and strict policies that govern how our data is handled.
Today, we're also reporting very strong results for Apple's fourth fiscal quarter. We generated our strongest revenue growth rate in 7 quarters, far surpassing our expectations we communicated in July and establishing a new record for Apple's September quarter revenue. We're also reporting gross margin of 38% compared to 37% last year, leading to a very strong EPS growth of 20%.
Fueled by the launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus and strong demand for our previous iPhone models, we set a new September quarter record for iPhone, with revenue growth of 21% year-over-year. Demand for iPhone was strong across all geographies, with global unit sell-through growth of 26%, and we exited the quarter with significant backlog for both iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.
We established an all-time quarterly record for Mac sales, with revenue growing 18% year-over-year, thanks in particular to the very strong performance of our portables. We're especially proud of our Mac results considering the overall contraction of the global PC market this year, and we achieved our highest quarterly market share since 1995.
We also set an all-time record for the App Store revenue, thanks to the tremendous momentum and ongoing success of our developer community. App Store revenue grew 36% over last year and cumulative app downloads have now topped 85 billion.
These results bring to a close a record-breaking fiscal 2014. Over the last 4 quarters, our products and services have generated $183 billion in revenues, an increase of $12 billion over last year. We sold 243 million iOS devices and 19 million Macs, both all-time highs. Our revenue from iTunes software and services reached $18 billion, which is more than the annual sales of 2/3 of the companies in the Fortune 500. And we generated $6.45 in earnings per share, which is 14% higher than last year and also set a new record.
We've made big investments in our business and have continued to expand our global footprint. Today, we have 437 Apple Retail Stores in 15 countries, and our partners are selling Apple products in hundreds of thousands of locations around the world. We're continuing to invest in developing markets where revenues approached $50 billion in fiscal year '14, up 16% over last year and twice the rate of growth of the company overall.
We forged a landmark partnership with IBM to provide a new generation of mobile enterprise applications designed with our products' legendary ease-of-use and backed by IBM's cloud services and data analytics. Our partnership aims to redefine the way work gets done, address key industry mobility challenges and spark true mobile-led business change.
Developer teams have been working closely to develop the first wave of mobile-first solutions, and these solutions will be ready for customers beginning next month across 6 sectors: banking, government, insurance, retail, travel and transportation and telecommunications.
We brought tremendous new talent and technology into Apple through 20 acquisitions in fiscal '14, including 7 alone in the September quarter. We closed the Beats transition in July and we're off to a great start with some wonderful plans we'll share with you in the future. Our strong results continue to generate significant cash, and we're extremely happy that this has enabled us to make substantial investments in Apple's future, while retaining -- while returning cash to our shareholders. We've executed aggressively against our share repurchase programs, spending $17 billion in the September quarter alone and $45 billion in the last year.
In addition to Apple's strong business performance over the past 4 quarters, I am incredibly proud of all of our work to protect the environment, to advance human rights, to improve working conditions in the supply chain and to change the way teachers teach and students learn.
I'd like to thank all of our customers, employees, developers and business partners for making fiscal 2014 Apple's best year yet. And I'd like to thank all of our shareholders for their continued support. I could not be more excited about the road ahead in fiscal 2015.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca to discuss our September quarter results in more detail.",1202

During the September quarter, we generated record revenue of $42.1 billion, an increase of $4.7 billion or 12% year-over-year. This result exceeded our guidance range due to better-than-expected sales of iPhones and Macs for which customer demand grew strongly year-over-year in all our segments.
Gross margin was 38%, at the high end of the guidance range. Operating margin was $11.2 billion, representing 26.5% of revenue. Net income was $8.5 billion, a new September quarter record, translating to diluted earnings per share of $1.42, a 20% year-over-year increase. Cash flow from operations was very strong at $13.3 billion, also a new Q4 record.
For details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 39.3 million iPhones, an increase of 5.5 million over last year or 16% growth. Underlying demand was even stronger with sell-through growth of 26%. iPhone sales grew across both developed and emerging markets. Unit sales in the U.S. grew 17% year-over-year, and in Western Europe, they were up 20%.
We saw even stronger growth in Latin America and the Middle East, with sales up more than 50%, and in Central and Eastern Europe, where sales more than doubled. We increased iPhone channel inventory by just under 1 million units during the September quarter this year, significantly less than the 3.3 million unit increase in the September quarter a year ago. Based on the very strong demand for our new iPhones, this left us below our target range of 4 to 6 weeks for channel inventory on a look-forward basis.
iPhone momentum in enterprise markets remains very strong. The latest data published by IDC indicates that iPhone has a 69% share of the U.S. commercial smartphone market. Also, an August ChangeWave survey of U.S. corporate IT buyers found that among those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 75% plan to purchase iPhones.
And iPhone continues to fuel innovation of companies around the world. Schindler, a leading global escalator and elevator manufacturer, has deployed over 20,000 iPhones and 20 customer apps to improve customer engagements for safe teams and to allow service technicians to access vital documentation, repair and safety functions when they're in the field.
Baidu, China's top search provider, currently has over 20,000 employees using iPhones. And the company has developed over 30 in-house iOS apps to help its employees work more efficiently, track sales leads and manage internal IT infrastructure and processes.
Next, I would like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.5 million Macs, an increase of almost 1 million over last year. That represents 21% growth year-over-year and an all-time quarterly record. We saw great demand in the back-to-school season for both desktops and portables, with especially strong growth for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air.
We achieved double-digit Mac growth across most markets around the world, with particularly impressive performance in emerging markets, where Mac sales were up 46%. These results are truly remarkable given the contraction in the global PC market. And we now gained market share for 33 of the last 34 quarters. We ended the quarter with Mac channel inventory slightly below our 4 to 5-week target range.
Turning to iPad. We sold 12.3 million units compared to 14.1 million in the September quarter last year. In anticipation of our October new product announcement, we reduced iPad channel inventory by 500,000 from the end of the June quarter, which left us within our target range of channel inventory on a look-back basis.
iPad sales were consistent with our expectations. And we experienced very strong results in Japan, where iPad sales were up 46% year-over-year.
Customers continue to love their iPads. In an August survey by ChangeWave, iPad mini with Retina display earned an incredible 100% satisfaction rate. And among consumers planning to purchase a tablet within 90 days, the survey indicated that 55% plan to buy an iPad.
We continue to see strong momentum in enterprise for iPad. Progressive IT organizations around the world continue to deploy, manage and develop amazing in-house apps for iPad. Health care leader Sanofi has over 25,000 iPads and over 450 in-house apps for safe teams and corporate employees to get their products and information into the hands of doctors and other health care providers.
Premium eyewear designer Luxottica has deployed over 10,000 iPads to improve how customers experience the size, fit and overall look of eyewear in a retail environment. Importantly, since the announcement of the partnership with IBM, hundreds of corporations around the world have expressed interest in mobile-first solutions. And we are actively working with over 50 of them to become foundation clients for mobile first solutions in their industries.
iPad continues to lead the U.S. education tablet market with 90% share based on the latest data from IDC. In the September quarter, the Saint Paul Public Schools in Minnesota purchased over 22,000 iPad Airs and over 5,000 iPad minis in the first phase of the district's Personalized Learning Through Technology plan that will ultimately equip every student with an iPad.
The Apple ecosystem continues to thrive. Our iTunes store generated all-time record billings of $5.4 billion in the September quarter, up 22% year-over-year, thanks to the tremendous momentum of the App Store. Developers around the world have embraced the iOS platform and keep broadening the appeal of our thoughtfully designed App Store to our large, loyal and engaged customer base.
Across all of our programs, the number of registered app developers has grown by 22% in the last year, and we are rapidly approaching 10 million. We are seeing especially strong interest in the enterprise, where the number of registered developers is up 39% over a year ago.
Our retail stores also generated strong results. Revenue for the quarter was $5.1 billion, up 15% from a year ago and a new September quarter record. We opened 10 new stores and completed the remodels of 3 stores during the quarter, ending with a total of 437 stores, 41% of which are outside the United States. We are projecting a total of approximately 25 new store openings in fiscal '15, about 3/4 of which will be outside the U.S. We also plan to remodel about 5 stores over the course of the year.
With an average of 432 stores opened in the September quarter, average revenue per store was $11.9 million compared to $10.9 million in the year-ago quarter. We hosted 102 million visitors to our stores during the quarter, which translates to over 18,000 visitors per store per week.
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $155.2 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential decline of $9.3 billion. We are continuing to execute our capital return program aggressively, with a total spend of over $20 billion in just the September quarter.
We launched our fourth accelerated share repurchase program at the end of August, spending $9 billion. We also spent $8 billion to repurchase 81 million Apple shares through open market transactions, paid $2.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and utilized over $300 million to net-share-sell vesting employee RSUs.
So we've already taken action on over $94 billion of our $130 billion capital return program, including $68 billion in share repurchases, with 5 quarters remaining to its completion. We remain firmly committed to our objective of delivering attractive returns to shareholders through both business performance and return of capital. As we said before, we review our capital allocation regularly. We have solicited feedback on our capital return program from shareholders in the past and we will continue to do so. We plan to report on our conclusions in a time frame similar to last year.
Now as we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $63.5 billion and $66.5 billion compared to $57.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. This represents a double-digit revenue increase despite significant foreign exchange headwinds from the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $5.4 billion and $5.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $325 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.5%.
Also today, our board has declared a dividend of $0.47 per common share, payable on November 13, 2014, to shareholders of record as of November 10, 2014. With that, I will hand it over to Nancy for some final remarks.",1431
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2014",2014-10-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3744.0,705521.0,31151563.0,Presenter Speech,Nancy Paxton,,Executives,4,"Thanks, Luca. We'd like to let you know about some reporting changes that we'll be making, beginning with the release of our Q1 '15 results. First, to better serve our customers and optimize our results around the world, we are collaborating like never before across our direct and indirect channels. Accordingly, beginning in Q1 '15, we'll be including the results of our retail stores in the geographic segments where the stores are located, providing a consolidated view of regional performance that is consistent with the way our executive team measures the business.
This means that going forward, our reportable segments will be: the Americas; Europe; Greater China; Japan and the rest of Asia Pacific, with retail no longer classified as a segment.
Second, to better reflect our evolving products and services, we'll be making some changes to our product summary reporting. We will continue to report iPhone, iPad and Mac as separate line items. And we'll also have a category that we refer to as Services. And this will encompass everything we report under the heading of iTunes software and services today, including content, apps, licensing and other services. And beginning this month, it will also include Apple Pay.
We'll be creating a new reporting category called Other Products. This will encompass everything we report in the Accessories category today, including Beats headphones and speakers, Apple TV and peripherals and accessories for iPhone, iPad, Mac and iPod. In addition, we'll begin to include iPod sales in the Other Products category, and we will also reflect sales of Apple Watch in this line item once it begins shipping in early calendar 2015.
So to recap, beginning in Q1 '15, our product reporting categories will be iPhone, iPad, Mac, Services and Other Products. We wanted to give analysts and investors a heads-up on this plan so you can reflect them in your models accordingly.
We'll also reclassify historical results to be consistent with these new groupings, and we'll provide that information on our Investor Relations website when we release Q1 results.
And finally, our distribution channels have evolved and expanded significantly in the last couple of years, including traditional resellers, consumer electronic stores, mass retailers, distributors and carriers, and each of these channels has a different distribution model. Today, iPhone is sold in over 200,000 locations around the world and iPad is sold in more than 100,000.
In addition, revenue from emerging markets has increased considerably over the last few years and now accounts for over 1/4 of our sales. And channel inventory requirements in those markets tend to be much longer. So due to the size, complexity and differing needs of our channels around the world, we've determined that a 5 to 7-week average range for both iPhone and iPad channel inventory is more appropriate, and that will be our target range going forward. However, given the backlog for our new products, we expect to exit the December quarter with our old 4 to 6-week target range.
So with that, let's open the call to questions. [Operator Instructions]",507

And where it was rolled out, it actually worked pretty well, which is nice. But could you provide some more color, Tim and Luca, on how you see the business model for Apple? And maybe from a high-level perspective, if you see this more sort of over time becoming a stand-alone business sort of like you look at iTunes? Or is this more just a way to sell incremental product?",85
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2014",2014-10-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3744.0,705521.0,31151566.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,7,"Shannon, it's Tim. The -- what we wanted to achieve with Apple Pay was, first and foremost, to have an incredible consumer experience. And so we focused very much on making it elegant and simple and hopefully your trials have proven that. I know I used it over the weekend and it worked fantastically. We also wanted to focus on security and privacy. And so we see huge issues with the security of the traditional credit card system. And many people that have entered mobile payments are doing so in a way that they want to monetize the data that they collect from the customers. And we think customers, in general, do not want this, that they'd like to keep their data private. And so we wanted to have ease-of-use, security and privacy, and maximize all 3. By doing so, we think we will sell more devices because we think it's a killer feature. It's far better than reaching in your pocketbook and trying to find the card that you're looking for and half of the time it not working. There -- we do not charge the customer for the benefit. We do not charge the merchant for the benefit. However, there are commercial terms between Apple and the issuing banks but we're not disclosing what they are. Like any other contractual arrangement, those are private sort of things. And so as Nancy was saying in her closing comments, we'll be reporting Apple Pay in the Services line item on the data sheet. And so we see it as an incredible service that is the most customer-centric mobile payment system that there is. And we're very proud of it and can't wait to sign up more retailers and also extend it around the world.",294

I mean, in IBM's results this morning, they talked substantially about potential pressure going forward from currency. So could you sort of walk us through how your hedges work? How we should think about currency? And how you sort of reflected it in at least the current quarter guidance?",64
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2014",2014-10-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3744.0,705521.0,31151568.0,Answer,Luca Maestri,,Executives,9,"Yes, definitely, Shannon. As you know, the U.S. dollar has strengthened quite significantly against most currencies in recent weeks. When we looked at our Q4 results, actually the impact was fairly limited. Combination of the hedging program and the fact that the dollar really strengthened towards the very end of the quarter, not much impact in Q4. It is becoming a significant headwind in Q1, both on a year-over-year basis and on a sequential basis. As I said before, we have reflected the new FX situation at current levels into our guidance that we provided for both revenue and gross margins. And it's a fact of life, if the U.S. dollar strengthens, that creates a headwind for us, both in revenue and margins for our business outside the United States. As you know, we have a comprehensive hedging program in place that mitigates the impact of foreign exchange. Over time, of course, these hedges roll off and get replaced by new hedges at new spot levels. And so the protection that you get from a hedging program is temporary. But again, the guidance that we provided fully reflects the current situation in the FX markets.",195

And more broadly, I know it's still early, but how should we think about the gross margin path as the iPhone 6 family ramps versus what we saw with the 5s and 5c cycle? I guess you can't answer that specifically. I'm trying to figure out if you'd characterize this as a fairly normal cycle in terms of expected cost improvements over the life of the product.",97

I would say that on the positive, we are so pleased with the launch of the new phone, demand has been phenomenal. So we think we're going to be getting favorable impact from iPhone mix. Of course, we're also going to be getting some leverage, positive leverage, from the higher revenues that we guided to. And we continue to see a fairly favorable commodity environment. So these are the things that are on the positive side. 
On the negative side, I talked about FX. Obviously, we have launched a lot of new products during the last 6 weeks. And we've got transition costs as we move from current products to new products, and that tends to be a headwind. And every time we launch new products, we make them better. And what that means is that our cost structures tend to go up when we introduce new products. We have a very good track record of taking those cost structures down over time. So when you take the positives and negatives that I've just mentioned, that is what gives us the guidance that we just provided.",200

Then my second question is looking at the current supply constraints for the iPhone, could you confirm that your guidance is assuming you'll reach supply-demand balance before the end of the quarter? I think that's what was implied by your commentary around channel inventory. And related to that, could you give us some more color on what you see as the key bottlenecks at this point for supply on the iPhone side?",74
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2014",2014-10-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3744.0,705521.0,31151573.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,14,"Bill, it's Tim. The ramp itself is going great. It's the fastest ever in our history. So I'm -- I couldn't be happier with it. That said, today, demand is far outstripping supply. It's unclear, looking at the data, when supply will catch up with demand. And so I don't want to leave you with a view that we know that we're going to get to a supply-demand balance on both of the new products this quarter because I don't know that at this point. It's very difficult to gauge demand without first achieving -- without first finding the balance. And it's clear that as of today, and certainly as of the end of the quarter where you're looking at the data, the -- we're not nearly balanced, we're not close. We're not on the same planet. And so -- but that said, I'm really confident the supply is going to be great, and that's the reason you see incredibly strong guidance that we're giving from $63.5 billion to $66.5 billion. And -- but at this point, it's just very difficult to gauge what the true demand is. When you see -- it's very unusual to see every country having a marked improvement over the previous year, and that's what we're seeing on iPhone. And so I couldn't be happier with the way the demand looks. Nancy's comment at the end was meant to tell you that we do not envision, as of today, being able to achieve the extra inventory in the channel that we believe is needed when you think about the long food chains in these -- in some of the emerging markets where the distribution channels are not as efficient. So that's the purpose of that comment.",291

Luca, the question for you is a bit of a follow-up from the last one, which is that we saw a pretty robust sequential increase in ASPs this quarter in the iPhone. And I was wondering if you could qualitatively help us understand whether that was a higher mix of new phones than you typically see in the September quarter? Or was it really a function of the new phones having a richer ASP? And if we look forward to calendar -- fiscal Q1, last year, you had a very substantial ASP increase. Should we be thinking about a similar kind of ASP increase this quarter, given, I think, a widespread belief that availability in the 6 Plus has been even more constrained, and that we could see a much higher percentage of 6 Plus as a percentage of total iPhones shipped in the quarter next quarter?",157

So on a sequential basis, our ASPs for iPhone were up $42. And as you said correctly, the reason for the increase was a higher mix of the new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. There was a partial offset in the quarter from the transition costs that we incurred typically when we move to a new product. Going forward, obviously, the percentage of new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus will increase sequentially so we're going to have the full quarter available to us. And that is correct that iPhone 6 Plus is supply-constrained right now.",97

And then Tim, for you, I was wondering again qualitatively if you could help us understand what you think the mix of repeat buyers is for iPhone 6, let's say, over the next year versus first-time iPhone customers. And the question in that is do you believe that because the iPhone 6 is so compelling, that, that traditional replacement cycle might be accelerated over the next several quarters? And if that's ultimately the case, do you, in the future, run reversion back towards an elongating of that replacement cycle in future generations?",93
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2014",2014-10-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3744.0,705521.0,31151585.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,26,"It's difficult to answer exactly, but let me sort of back up and give you some data, maybe that will help frame the topic. If you look at some of our top countries and how they did in mid-year of selling a customer the first iPhone they'd ever bought, what you would see is that in countries like China, over 80% of people that we were selling the 4s to were buying the first iPhone ever. In the U.S., it was over 60%. And so those kind of give you some goalposts of large countries in terms of first-time ownership at our entry level. As you step across and look at the 5s, which was, at that time, the top-end phone, in China, still almost half the people were buying their first iPhone ever buying a 5s. And about 1/4 of the U.S. population buying a 5s were buying their first one. And so that kind of gives you some goalposts. And so the way I look at those numbers are that on a forward basis, what I would expect, obviously, we don't give guidance on this kind of stuff, is that I still see a fairly large opportunity in people buying their first iPhone ever. And I think with these products that we just announced, with 6 and 6 Plus, that opportunity increases, not decreases. I also believe that the upgrade market for people that were waiting for 6 -- for iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, as we can see from our order backlog, that number is huge. And so I would expect that to go on for some period of time because you have people that time out of contracts at different times. Not everybody does that at launch time. And so I see both the first-time buyer being a great opportunity, and the upgrader -- some of the first-time buyers are people that have never owned a smartphone before, and some of them are switchers from Android. And so right now, everything -- all of those look very good to us, but we're in the early going and we're selling everything we're making. And so the -- it's going to take some period of time before we have a better handle on what those numbers will look like in steady state. But I'd never felt so great after a launch before. Maybe that's the best way to summarize it of all.",405

Our work suggests it's maybe 2.5:1, 6 to 6 Plus in the U.S. But maybe that geographically, it's quite different. Asia maybe going for the bigger screen. Is there any color you can give us?",62

And so the -- essentially, what our current sell-through looks like is our current supply. And so in the long arc of time, once there's enough supply to meet demand, that mix might look differently. It is clear, or at least I think, that we will see a difference by geography in terms of preference, and we felt that going into the launch. And there's no data that we perceive to date that would suggest that, that's not the case. And so that's about all I can say at this point.",118

And then regarding the strength in Mac and the weakness in iPad, I guess what's the message from the market that you take away from that? And does that perhaps at all affect your view of doing a convertible type product, which in the past is not kind of been Apple's approach. You tend to like to do very focused products, but it might be that there's something in between that could be quite successful.",76
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2014",2014-10-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3744.0,705521.0,31151590.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,31,"Let me comment on both the Mac and the iPad. On the Mac, it was just an absolutely blow-away quarter, our best ever -- it will result in our highest market share since 1995. It's just absolutely stunning. The back-to-school season voted and the Mac won and carried the day, and we're really proud of that. I'm proud of the Mac team. It's clear that the -- all the work that we've put into our notebooks, on the hardware and the software side, is resonating with our customers. And I think if you went out to college campuses about now, you would see a lot of Mac -- a lot of new Mac notebooks there based on the sales. And so that feels fantastic. Being up 21% in a market that's shrinking, it just -- it doesn't get better than that. 
For iPad, the -- if I take a step back on iPad, and I know that there's a lot of negative commentary in the markets on this, but I have a little different perspective on it. Here's sort of my simple perspective. If you look at -- instead of looking at this thing each 90 days, if you back up and look at it, we've sold 237 million in just over 4 years. That's about twice the number of iPhones that we sold over the first 4 years of iPhone. If you look at the last 12 months of iPad, we sold 68 million, in '13 -- in fiscal year '13, we sold 71 million, so we were down but we were down 4% on sell-in, and the sell-through was a bit better than the negative 4% because we took down channel inventory some. And so it's -- to me, I view it as a speed bump, not a huge issue. That said, we want to grow. We don't like negative numbers on these things. And so looking further in the data, I know that there's a popular view that the market is saturated but we don't see that. I can't speak to the -- to other people, but I do look at our data deeply. And the last market research data we have is in the June quarter, and let me give you some of those real data that we've got. It said if you look at the top -- our top 6 revenue countries, in the country that sold the lowest percentage of iPads to people who had never bought an iPad before, that number is 50%. And the range goes from 50% to over 70%. And so when I look at first-time buyer rates in that area, saturated -- that's not a saturated market. You never have first-time buyer rates at 50% and 70%. What you do see is that people hold on to their iPad longer than they do a phone. And because we've only been in this business 4 years, we don't really know what the upgrade cycle will be for people. And so that's a difficult thing to call. What we do know is that people always respond to do -- for us doing great products, and we feel really great about what we introduced last week. We also know that the deeper the apps go in the enterprise, the more it opens up avenues in enterprise. And that's a key part of the IBM partnership and what I think customers will get out of that, which is more important than us selling is changing the way people work. And so I see catalysts going forward. There are obvious cannibalization, things that are occurring. I'm sure that some people looked at a Mac and an iPad and decided on a Mac. I don't have research to demonstrate that but I'm sure of that just looking at the numbers. And I'm fine with that, by the way. I'm sure that some people will look at an iPad and an iPhone and decide just to get an iPhone, and I'm fine with that as well. But over the long arc of time, my own judgment is that iPad has a great future. How the individual 90-day clicks work out, I don't know. But I'm very bullish on where we can take iPad over time. And so we're continuing to invest in the product pipeline. We're continuing to invest in distribution. If you look at how we did in emerging markets like BRIC countries, as an example, we were up 20% for the full year '14. And so these numbers are impressive, and obviously, the BRIC countries are growing as a percentage of our total as the developing markets is. And so the -- it looks a bit different geography to geography. And so that's a long answer to your question but I thought it was important for you to at least hear my perspective and you can judge it as you will.",817

We were just a little surprised to hear that because it seems like such a substantial new category and you could sell maybe even tens of millions of units. So by putting it lumped in the other with iPods and a lot of other things, does that say something about your expectations for that product? Or do you think that you'll just break it out after a little while?",92

We didn't form those categories based on expectations. We looked at current revenue, today revenue, and decided that we would lump everything that wasn't a Mac, an iPad or an iPhone or a service in one kind of category. In the future, we might decide something different. But for now, in Q1, we're not shipping any iPhone -- or excuse me, Apple Watches. And so it seems appropriate to start it that way. And also, to be also straight is, I'm not very anxious in reporting a lot of numbers on Apple Watch because of the -- and giving a lot of detail on it because our competitors are looking for it. And so aggregating it is helpful from that point of view as well.",134

And then with regard to -- my next question is you put out a lot of products, and we obviously -- everybody gives you a lot of credit for the great new product lineup that we have. But everybody talks about what's next. You said in an interview recently on TV that you were working on products that people didn't even speculate on yet. And that's pretty hard with Apple, considering how many people watch your company and write about it. So I was just wondering if you could elaborate on that, maybe in terms of your excitement around new products? And what did you mean by that comment? And just how do you feel about the future in light of that comment you made?",128

And maybe more importantly than all the stuff that you see is to look at the skills within this company. And the fact that I think it's the only company on the planet that has the ability to integrate hardware and software and services at a world-class level. And that in itself allows Apple to play in so many different areas. And so the challenge becomes one of deciding which ones to say no to and which ones to say yes to and want to focus, not ones that -- do we have any great ideas? We always have more ideas than we have resources to deal with. And so I would look at that. I would look at what we talked about last week. Things like Continuity. And if you use your imagination and think about where that goes, there's no other company that can do this. Apple is the only one. And I think this becomes so incredibly important moving forward for customers living in an environment where they're using multiple devices. And so I would look at the skills, the capabilities, the passion of the company, and -- the creative engine has never been stronger. And I think you can see that from the Apple Watch. You can see that with Apple Pay. Apple Pay is classic Apple, taking something that is incredibly old, outdated, kludgy. Everybody's focused on everything except for the customer and putting the customer at the center of the experience and making something very elegant. And so I would look at those things. And when I look at those things, I would -- as an investor, I feel great. As a personal investor, I feel great.",316

The numbers, I understand, weren't as good as the rest of the company this quarter, but presumably, that was all the delay of the iPhone. So I'm really asking if you'd talk about are the last few weeks more important as you look at December quarter. In particular, related to some of the political backdrop, including the carriers have been mandated not to spend the same level of subsidies. Do you see that -- any of that impacting your opportunities for Apple broadly speaking but more specifically for iPhones as it relates to subsidy levels?",107
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2014",2014-10-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3744.0,705521.0,31151603.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,44,"That's a good question. If you -- Keith, as you said, if you look at greater China, Q4 '14 compared to Q4 '13, the obvious difference is that we launched the 5s in Q4 '13, and in this year, we didn't have a new product launch. We're launching in this quarter, in Q1 of '15. The second thing that's not as apparent probably but is somewhat related to that is that last year, we increased our channel inventory by 1.3 million. This year, we actually decreased it slightly. And so you have a compounded effect of no launch and a huge change in channel inventory on a year-over-year basis. So the way that I assess the strength of the market is I look at unit sell-through. And to share with you what it was in greater China, iPhone unit sell-through, despite no launch in Q4, was up 32% year-over-year. The market was projected by IDC to only grow 13%. So we feel incredibly great about that. Macs were up 54% year-over-year. And that's against the IDC's estimate of a market contraction in China of 7%. And so those are our 2 sort of stalwarts that were really driving results. And so the underlying results look totally different than the reported results because of the channel inventory kind of differences. The App Store in China is also doing great. The growth there is phenomenal. iPad contracted some during the quarter. But for the full year, we did grow. We were up 9% year-over-year for the full year. And so I see lots of positives. As you know, China's on the early stages of their huge 4G rollout. And this weekend -- this past weekend, we launched it with China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom. This was the first time we've launched a new iPhone with all 3 carriers, and we've done it at the early stages of the 4G rollout. And so I'm incredibly bullish over it. 
In terms of subsidies, there are regulatory pressures on subsidies. We have -- we've seen that. However, only 20% of the iPhones that we've been selling in China have had a traditional subsidy applied to it. And so the vast majority don't. And so will it make a difference with that 20%? I don't know yet. Intuitively, you would think it would, but it's at least a percentage of a 20% instead of a percentage of 100%. And so when I look at China, I see an enormous market where there are more people graduating into the middle class than any nation on Earth in history and just an incredible market where people want the latest technology and products that we're providing. And so we're investing like crazy in the market. We've -- we're more than doubling our stores. We've got 15 in greater China today. We're going to be close to 40 in the next couple of years. We've expanded our online store to cover now 315 cities in China. The revenue results for Q4 were more than double the previous year. The App Store is growing. Chinese developers have now created 150,000 apps on -- apps on the App Store. And so I see lots of very, very, very positive vectors there. And I couldn't be more excited.",548

And then as my follow-up, if I could, Tim. You mentioned before in a previous comment on iPad where you saw, I think, 50% to 70% in the top 6 countries were new buyers. And related to a previous question, I wondered if you could give that same range. I understand it's probably a pretty wide range for iPhones and that was to the June quarter, I think.

And as I had mentioned before, sort of the highest percentage is the 4s buyer in China, over 80% of the people were buying their first iPhone. And for 5s in China, 50% were.
