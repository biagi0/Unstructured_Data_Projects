And good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are incredibly pleased to report an extraordinary quarter, with $54.5 billion in revenue and new records for iPhone and iPad sales. No technology company has ever reported these kind of results. 
Apple is in one of the most prolific periods of innovation in new products in its history. Just in the last few months, we've introduced new products in every category that we made. Each one of these reflects our dedication to making the very best products in the world. At Apple, we think about the smallest details, and we're unwilling to cut corners in delivering the best customer experience in the world. This relentless commitment to innovation and excellence is the reason our customers choose to buy our products, and this will always be the driving force behind Apple. 
Apple today is over 80,000 people strong, and we are one team working together to surprise and delight our customers. Part of my job is to preserve our culture and drive it forward so we remain the world's most innovative company. People join Apple to do the very best work of their lives, and there's no greater reward than seeing how customers love to use our products. We continue to believe that our fundamentals, our remarkable people, our clear and focused strategy, our new product pipeline, our booming ecosystem and more than 400 Apple Retail Stores, will serve us well in the coming months and years ahead. 
Tomorrow marks the anniversary of a revolution. On January 24, 1984, Steve introduced the first Macintosh right here at a shareholder meeting in Cupertino. On the evening news that night, they said it was supposed to be one of the easiest computers to use. And thanks to the new mouse, you hardly had to touch the keyboard. 
We've come a long way since 1984, but we rely on the same spirit and drive that brought the original Mac and other revolutionary products like the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad into the world. 
You're going to hear a lot of impressive numbers during this call, but they're not the only way that we measure success at Apple.
The most important thing to us is that our customers 
love our products: not just buy them, but love them. Everyone here is laser-focused on creating an unprecedented customer experience. 
We've now sold well over 0.5 billion iOS devices, including a staggering 10 per second last quarter alone. We couldn't have achieved these milestones without the very best products in the world, and unmatched execution by our engineering, operations and sales teams to deliver so many innovative and beautifully designed products. It's simply phenomenal. 
Everyone at Apple has their eyes on the future, a future driven by the incredible hard work and dedication by the most talented and creative team on earth who all share a common purpose of continuing to create the world's best products and, in doing so, enrich the lives of our customers. Today, we are proud to share with you our latest results. Peter will review the highlights of our Q1 earnings, and I'll be back for the Q&A. Peter?",531
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2013",2013-01-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3788.0,404588.0,19090143.0,Presenter Speech,Peter Oppenheimer,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Tim. We're very pleased to report the results of Apple's first fiscal quarter. We established new all-time quarterly records for iPhone and iPad sales, significantly broadened our ecosystem and generated Apple's highest quarterly revenue and net income ever.
Revenue for the quarter was $54.5 billion compared to $46.3 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of $8.2 billion year-over-year. As a reminder, our first quarter this fiscal year spanned  13 weeks, whereas the first quarter last year included a 14th week. As such, average weekly revenue was $4.2 billion in the current year quarter compared to $3.3 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 27%. The strong year-over-year growth was fueled by record iPhone, iPad, and iTunes sales.
Operating margin was $17.2 billion, representing 31.6% of revenue. Net income was a record $13.1 billion, just ahead of the amount generated in last year's 14-week quarter and translated to diluted earnings per share of $13.81.
Beginning this fiscal year, we are reorganizing the presentation of our results to provide greater transparency. First, we have established a new operating segment of Greater China given the very significant contribution of that region to our overall business. We define Greater China to include Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.
Second, for segment reporting purposes, we are allocating certain manufacturing cost and variances, including costs related to product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, to our operating segments, instead of including these expenditures in corporate expenses as we've done in the past.
We've recast our operating income for each quarter in fiscal 2011 and 2012 to reflect this change and have provided a reconciliation on apple.com/investor. These changes had no impact on overall reported operating income.
And third, we have realigned the presentation of product information in our summary data schedule to provide greater visibility to revenue by product category. Under this new format, revenue from iPhone, iPad, Mac and iPod sales is presented exclusive of related service and accessory revenue. All revenue from iTunes, stand-alone Apple and third-party software and services is presented as a single line item, and revenue from all Apple and third-party accessory sales is presented as a single line item. We believe this presentation provides a logical grouping of revenue sources and also provides greater transparency into our results. 
As for the details of this quarter, I'd like to begin with iPhone. We were very pleased to sell 47.8 million iPhones compared to 37 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of over 10 million iPhones. This represents a rate of almost 3.7 million iPhones per week in the current year quarter compared to 2.6 million per week in the year-ago quarter. That's an average increase of 39% per week, consistent with IDC's latest published forecast for the global smartphone market in the December quarter. And on a sequential basis, iPhone sales grew 78% in the September -- over the September quarter's results. That's over 3.5x IDC's latest published projection for sequential growth of the overall market, resulting in iPhone market share growth. 
We experienced strong iPhone growth in each of our geographic segments, most notably Greater China, where iPhone sales more than doubled year-over-year. 
In the U.S., Kantar Worldpanel ComTech estimates that iPhone's share of smartphone sales increased from 45% in the year-ago quarter to over 51% in the current year quarter. iPhone sales were driven by the tremendous popularity of iPhone 5, which we're extremely proud to have launched in 100 countries by the end of December, resulting in the fastest iPhone rollout ever. We ended the quarter with about 10.6 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 1.5 million iPhones, and ended the quarter within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory on a look-forward basis. 
While other mobile devices and operating systems face increasing security risks and fragmented inconsistent user experiences, iPhone and iOS continue to deliver an exceptional experience that people love. They also provide a secure and trusted ecosystem that IT departments require. iPhone continues to be embraced by government agencies and businesses across the globe. Many U.S. government agencies are issuing iPhones by the thousands as part of their new mobile strategies. Some examples include NASA, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Association, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Transportation Security Administration. We are also seeing continued iPhone growth in business across the board from companies replacing existing smartphone deployments to businesses adding first-time smartphone users. Companies around the world like Neiman Marcus, Skanska and Volvo are issuing iPhones to their employees to improve interactions with customers and give workers access to essential corporate data. 
Turning to iPad. We were thrilled to sell 22.9 million iPads during the quarter compared to 15.4 million in the year-ago quarter. That translates to over 1.7 million iPads per week in the current year quarter compared to 1.1 million per week in the year-ago quarter, an average increase of 60% per week, ahead of IDC's latest published estimate of 56% growth for the tablet market. Customers are loving the fourth generation iPad with its faster performance and spectacular Retina display. And the iPad mini has been a tremendous hit, offering the full iPad experience in an incredible design that you can hold in one hand. 
In addition to the tremendous response from consumers, iPad continues to be the tablet of choice for businesses and government agencies, transforming the way their employees work. Financial institutions like Barclays, Nomura Securities and Bank of Beijing are deploying iPad to enable employees to better service customers and work securely with financial portfolios and products. In particular, Barclays' rollout of over 8,000 iPads has generated tremendous employee engagement and feedback, making it the most successful IT deployment in Barclays' history. 
State and local governments in the United States are also rapidly adopting iPad. Court systems, county inspectors and law enforcement agencies use iPad to streamline processes and replace huge amounts of paper. And state legislatures in Virginia, Texas and West Virginia are all using iPads to give lawmakers instant access to government documents and information. 
Outside the U.S., 10,000 iPads are being deployed as part of broad adoption of a local government workflow solution in Sweden, and over 5,000 iPads have been purchased by the government in the Netherlands for the Dutch tax authority and the Dutch court system. 
We began and ended the quarter with about 3.4 million iPads in channel inventory. That left us below our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPad channel inventory on a look-forward basis. 
Turning to Mac. We sold 4.1 million units in the quarter compared to 5.2 million in the year-ago quarter. That's an average of about 312,000 Macs per week in the current year quarter compared to 371,000 per week in the year-ago quarter, a decline of 16%. IDC estimates the global personal computer market contracted by 6% during the December quarter. 
We introduced the new 13-inch MacBook Pro Retina display, as well as our stunning new iMacs in October. As we projected a quarter ago, we were significantly constrained with respect to the new iMacs and were only able to ship them for the final month of the December quarter. We believe our Mac sales would have been much higher absent those constraints. We began and ended the quarter with between 3 and 4 weeks of Mac channel inventory on a look-forward basis, which is below our target range of 4 to 5 weeks. 
Moving to iPod. We sold 12.7 million iPods compared to 15.4 million in the year-ago quarter. iPod touch was a popular item in the holiday season and continued to account for over half of all iPods sold during the December quarter. iPod's share of the U.S. market for MP3 players was over 70% in the December quarter based on the latest data published by MPD. And iPod continued to be the top-selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GFK. 
iTunes generated record results, with revenue of $2.1 billion in the quarter. We established new all-time quarterly records for revenue from music, from movies and from apps. We significantly expanded the footprint of our ecosystem during the quarter, adding iTunes Music Stores in 56 countries, including Russia, Turkey, India and South Africa. That brings us to a total of 119 countries where customers can choose from over 20 million songs to purchase and download. 
The App Store had a record-breaking December quarter with over 2 billion downloads in the month of December alone. The App Store now offers more than 775,000 apps to over 0.5 billion account holders in 155 countries, including over 300,000 native iPad apps. Cumulative app downloads have now surpassed 40 billion, and we are delighted to have paid our app developers over $7 billion for sales of their incredible work.
iCloud continues to grow at an amazing rate, now with 250 million accounts. And our customers love our on iMessage service, sending a staggering 2 billion-plus iMessages per day. 
I'd now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores. Revenue was an all-time high of over $6.4 billion, with growth fueled primarily by record iPhone and iPad sales. We opened a total of 11 new stores during the quarter, including 4 new stores in Greater China. We exited the quarter with 401 stores, 150 of which are outside the United States. We also relocated or expanded 14 stores that had outgrown their former space during the quarter. With an average of 396 stores open, average revenue per store was $16.3 million or $1.25 million per store per week compared to $1.22 million per store per week in the year-ago quarter. Retail segment income was $1.6 billion. 
We hosted a record 121 million visitors to our stores during the quarter compared to 110 million in the year-ago quarter. That translates to 23,000 visitors per store per week, a 7% increase year-over-year. 
Total company gross margin was 38.6%, which was about 260 basis points higher than our guidance. About half this difference was driven by lower product and transitory costs that we reflected in our guidance, while the remainder resulted from a higher mix of iPhones, a weaker U.S. dollar and leverage on the higher revenue. 
Operating expenses were $3.9 billion and included $416 million [ph] in stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $462 million, and the tax rate for the quarter was 26%. 
Turning to cash. Our cash for short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $137.1 billion at the end of the December quarter compared to $121 billion at the end of the September quarter, a sequential increase of almost $16 billion. The increase in cash was net of $2.5 billion in dividends paid and $2 billion in an upfront payment in conjunction with our accelerated share repurchase program. Over $94 billion of our total cash was offshore at the end of the December quarter. Cash flow from operations was a record $23.4 billion, growing by almost $6 billion year-over-year, a 33% increase.
Our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $2.65 per common share payable on February 14, 2013, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 11, 2013. 
As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. In addition to the reporting changes that have already mentioned, to further increase transparency into our business, we are changing our approach to how we provide guidance. In recent years, our guidance reflected a conservative point estimate of results every quarter that we had reasonable confidence in achieving. Going forward, we plan to provide a range of guidance that reflects our belief of what we are likely to achieve. While we cannot forecast with complete accuracy, we believe we are likely to report within the range of guidance we provide. 
Therefore, for the March quarter, we are providing revenue guidance of between $41 billion and $43 billion compared to $39.2 billion in the year-ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5%, reflecting approximately $90 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be between $3.8 billion and $3.9 billion, including about $480 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $350 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%. 
In closing, we're thrilled to have generated over $54 billion of revenue in a 13-week period while executing multiple major product transitions. We sold over 75 million iOS devices during the quarter, which is a staggering number. We're producing our best products ever, and the execution by our engineering, operations and sales teams to deliver tens of millions of such innovative, beautifully designed products in such a short time frame is phenomenal. We're very pleased with our record iPhone and iPad sales, our record music, movie and apps sales and the continued expansion of a robust ecosystem. And finally, we remain very confident in our new product pipeline. 
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.",2185

Many of your smartphone competitors are now focusing on differentiating themselves with larger screen sizes than that of the iPhone 5 and your predecessor products. I mean, how do you think about the competitive dynamics of the market right now in that respect? Do you think that's a valid point of differentiation?

The iPhone 5 offers, as you know, a new 4-inch Retina display, which is the most advanced display in the industry. And no one comes close to matching the level of quality as the Retina display.

Obviously, you saw a healthy growth in the key categories this quarter. In the context of your guidance, can you give us some color about how you're viewing in-demand trends for the iPhone coming out of the December quarter, and how that compares to what you consider to be normal seasonality at this point in the product cycle?

If you look at the iPhone sales across the quarter, we were very constrained for much of the quarter on iPhone 5. As we begin to produce more and ship more, sales went up with the production. iPhone 4 was actually in constraint for the entire quarter, and sales remained strong. And so that's how sales progressed across the quarter. I'll let Peter talk about the guidance.",88

I know there's been lots of rumors about order cuts and so forth. And so let me just take a moment to make a comment on this. I don't want to comment on any particular rumor because I would -- spend my life doing that. But I would suggest it's good to question the accuracy of any kind of rumor about build plans, and also stress that even if a particular data point were factual, it would be impossible to accurately interpret the data point as to what it meant for our overall business because the supply chain is very complex and we obviously have multiple sources for things. Yields might vary, supplier performance can vary, the beginning inventory positions can vary.

And then if I could follow up, Tim, you started the call talking about Apple's philosophy of really ensuring that you satisfy your customers and making great products. Against that backdrop, how important is market share preservation? This quarter, you held share, maybe increased it fractionally on a year-over-year basis in the global smartphone market. But clearly, you had an exciting new product. Is holding share in the smartphone market in 2013 a priority for Apple? Yes or no, and why? And realistically, how does Apple hold share given that the market segment that -- and price point that you play in is expected to grow a lot slower and you have pretty predominant share in that high end?",120

That's our high order bit. That means that we aren't interested in revenue for revenue's sake. We could put the Apple brand on a lot of things and sell a lot more stuff. But that's not we're here for. We want to make only the best product. And so what does that mean for market share? We've been able to do that, and I think we've had a great track record here on iPod doing different products at different price points and getting a reasonable share for doing that. And so one doesn't -- I wouldn't view the things as mutually exclusive as some might. But the high order bit is making a great product that enriches customers' lives. And so that's what we're focused on.",146

Could you talk a little bit more about what happened? And it would seem that the shortfall there is well over $1 billion in the quarter, maybe even as much as $1.5 billion. And how much of that was pushed into the March quarter within that new March guidance?",56
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2013",2013-01-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3788.0,404588.0,19090166.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,26,"Yes. Ben, it's Tim. Thanks for asking that question. I wanted to talk about this. If you look -- I think the best way to answer this is if you look at the previous year, our Mac sales were about 5.2 million. This year, there were 4.1 million, and so the difference is 1.1 million. And so let me try to bridge that. iMacs were down by 700,000 units year-over-year. As you remember, we announced the new iMacs late in October. And when we announced those, we announced that they would ship, the first one, the 21.5-inch would ship in November, and we did ship it at the end of November. We announced that the 27-inch would ship in December, and we did ship that in mid-December. And so there were limited weeks of ramping on these products during the quarter. We left the quarter with significant constraints on the iMac. And we believe, we know that our sales would have been materially higher if those constraints would not have exist. We tried to tell people this on the conference call in October. I think I'd said that we would have significant constraints on iMac. And so -- but I recognize to some folks, this may be a surprise. Number two, if you look at last year, as Peter went through in his opening comments, we had 14 weeks in the quarter. We have 13 weeks in the quarter this year. Last year in the average week, we sold 370,000 Macs. The third part of the bridge here would be that our channel inventory was down from the beginning of the quarter by over 100,000 units, and that's because obviously we didn't have the iMacs in channel inventory. It was in significant constraint. So if you just take these 3 factors, they bridge more than the difference of between this year's sales and last year's sales. Now in addition to these 3 points, I would point out 2 other things. And these are lesser things than these other -- than the total of these other 3, obviously. One, the market for PCs is weak. IDC's last estimate, I believe, was around negative 6%. Two, we sold 23 million iPads, and we obviously could have sold more than this because we could not build enough iPad minis to come into a demand balance. And so there was -- we've always said there's some cannibalization there. I'm sure there were some cannibalization of Macs there. But the 3 large factors of the aggregated total of the 3 large, the iMac, the difference in 7 days of the previous year having 7 extra days and the channel inventory, I think more than explains the difference between this year and the previous year. As a side note, our -- if you looked at our portables alone, they were in line with IDC's projections of market growth.",482

And then just my follow-up is with regard to web services, online services, there's been a lot of publicity around Maps, and can you give us an update there?

We're working on some incredible stuff. The pipeline is chock full. I don't want to comment about a specific product, but we feel great about what we've got in store. In terms of Maps, we've made a number of improvements to Maps since the introduction of iOS 6 back in September, and we'll roll out even more improvements across the rest of the year. And we're going to keep working on this, as I've said before, until it lives up to our incredibly high standards. Users can already see many of these improvements because they include things like improved satellite and flyover [ph] imagery, [indiscernible], improved local information for thousands of businesses and so forth. The usage in Maps is significantly higher than it was prior to iOS 6. In terms of other services, we feel fantastic about how we're doing. In Notification Center, we've now sent over 4 trillion notifications, and this is mind-blowing. As Peter mentioned in the -- his opening comments, for iMessage, we've now sent over 450 billion and are currently sending notes over 2 [ph] billion per day. With Game Center, we've got over 200 million registered users. We have 800,000 apps on the App Store with over 40 billion downloads. And so I feel really, really great about it. There's obviously more stuff we can do, and you can bet we're thinking about all of it.",242

And also any comments on mix within the iPhone line in terms of 5 versus 4S amount of storage? And then also on the iPad. Last quarter, you said you really didn't know what the proportion of minis would be. Can you make any comments in terms of the demand for mini relative to what you expected?",96

I'll start. I'll make a comment on mini, go through gross margin, and maybe Tim can pick up on some of your iPhone questions. With the iPad mini, it's hard to know. We could not make enough in the quarter. We were constrained every week. Customers love the mini, and we wish that we could have made more and we ended the quarter with significant backlog. For the gross margin in the December quarter, we were about 260 basis points ahead of our guidance. About half this difference was driven by lower product and transitory costs, and we had reflected in our guidance. And the rest came from a higher mix of iPhones, a weaker dollar and leverage on the higher revenue. As we look forward, we think the gross margin will be somewhere between about 10 basis points and 110 basis points lower sequentially. We believe that there are 2 primary factors that will benefit gross margins sequentially: First and the largest of the 2, our teams have made meaningful progress in reductions in product and transitory costs from the actions that they've been working on to get down the cost curve, so we expect to benefit in the March quarter beyond what we saw in the December quarter. And second, we expect a more typical level of deferred revenue from device sales. We expect these factors to be more than offset by 10 to 120 basis points by the loss of leverage coming out of the December quarter, which is very typical for us, and a different mix of our current products. And regarding mix as an example, as we indicated last quarter, the iPad mini gross margin is significantly below the corporate average. And we expect to be able to meet demand for this product in the March quarter, which again we could not in the December quarter.",315

If you look -- your question on iPhone mix, let me bring up 3 points: One, the ASP per iPhone was essentially the same year-over-year in the quarter that we just finished. Underneath that, if you looked at the mix of iPhone 5 to total iPhone, and then in the previous year, you look at 4S to total iPhone, which it was [ph] the top iPhone, those mixes are similar. And then thirdly, I think you asked about capacities. In Q1, we saw similar results as we saw in Q1 of the previous year. So does that answer your question on mix?",110

So this is incredibly high. It's up over 60% year-on-year, and again, that's comparing 13 to 14 weeks. And so it's really -- the underlying growth is higher than that. We saw exceptional growth in iPhones into the triple digits. iPad, we shipped iPad very late in the quarter in December and, despite that, saw a very nice growth. We are expanding in Apple Retail there. In the year-ago quarter, we had 6 stores. We now have 11. We obviously have many more to open there. In our premium resellers, we went over 400, up from a little over 200 in the previous year. And we increased iPhone point of sales from 7,000 to over 17,000 there. And now, this isn't nearly what we need and it's not the final, by any means. We're not even close to that. But we're making -- I feel that we're making great progress. I was just over there recently and talking to a lot of different people. I'm very happy with how things are going.

And then secondly, typically, each quarter, you sort of talk about some of the component constraints? And you certainly talked about iPhone 4 being constrained and the iPad mini, et cetera.

24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2013",2013-01-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3788.0,404588.0,19090198.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,58,"Sure. Let me take the second part of that first. I think overall, our team did just a fantastic job ramping a record number of new products during the quarter. We did have significant shortages due to robust demand on both iPad mini and both models of the iMac that persisted the entire quarter. And we are still short of both of those today, as a matter of fact. Additionally, supply of iPhone 5 was short to demand until late in the quarter, and iPhone 4 was short for the entire quarter. We believe that we can achieve a supply-demand balance on iPad mini during this quarter and on iPhone 4 during this quarter. On iMac, we are confident that we're going to significantly increase the supply. But the demand here is very strong, and we are not certain that we'll achieve a supply-demand balance during the quarter. In terms of cannibalization and how we think about this, I think cannibalization is a huge opportunity for us. One, our base philosophy is to never fear cannibalization. If we do, somebody else will just cannibalize it. And so we never fear it. We know that iPhone has cannibalized some iPod business. It doesn't worry us that it's done that. We know that iPad will cannibalize some Mac; that doesn't worry us. On iPad in particular, we have the mother of all opportunities here because the Windows market is much, much larger than the Mac market is. And I think it is clear that it's already cannibalizing some, and I think there's a tremendous amount, more opportunity there. And as you know, I've said for 2 or 3 -- actually 3 years now, I believe, that I believe the tablet market would be larger than the PC market at some point. I still believe that. And you can see by the growth in tablets and the pressure on PCs that those lines are beginning to converge. And I think the other thing for us, maybe not for others but for us, is if somebody will -- buys an iPad mini or an iPad and it's their first Apple product, we have great experience through the years of knowing that when somebody buys their first Apple product, that a percentage of these people wind up buying another type of Apple product. And so if you remember what we had termed the halo effect for some time with the iPod, with the Mac, we're very confident that, that will happen. And we've -- we're seeing some evidence of that on the iPad as well. And so I see cannibalization as a huge opportunity.",439

Peter gave some transparency around the qualitative sequential and year-over-year potential increases in the iPad for the March quarter. How should we think about the iPhone family against that in terms of year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter potential increases or decreases? And are there any sort of dynamics around a slower pace of LTE rollouts by the network carriers having an impact?",65

And so the underlying sell-through from the year-ago quarter was 32.5 million. The sell-in was 35 million, as you can probably see on the sheet in front of you. And so in thinking through the number of iPhones to predict, we looked at the 32.5 million number as a baseline. And we clearly believe that we're going to grow year-over-year. But I don't want to be more specific than that because Peter has already given you some top level guidance. And that's how we -- we guide in the aggregate instead of at the product level.",141

And then my follow-up is just around the pace of LTE buildouts across the globe, either in Europe or parts of Asia, have those slower-than-excepted rollouts from the networks' perspective, has that had any sort of impact, do you think, on your iPhone sales velocity? And could that change over the next 12 months as you see LTE capacity become more available elsewhere?",64

Today, we have 24 carriers around the world that provide LTE support for iPhone 5. And those are in countries like the U.S., Korea, the U.K., Germany, Canada, Japan, Australia and a few others. Next week, we're adding 36 more carriers for LTE support. And these carriers will be in countries that we're currently not supporting LTE. So the LTE coverage now in -- or as of next week in Italy, Denmark, Finland, Switzerland, Philippines, also several Middle Eastern countries. And so if you look at the total of all of these and the incremental subscribers that are in those countries, it's over 300 million. And so that's the next range of LTE rollouts that I'm pleased to tell you about today. Also, as you know, iPhone 5 also supports other ultrafast networks like HSPA+ and with download up to 42 mbs, which is 3x the speed of the iPhone 4S. And so we're -- we feel very good about the situation that we're in, particularly with these adds next week.",176

Just assuming there's some benefit from the Mac carryover effect and the iPad release, et cetera, and adjusting for the inventory, it seems you're guiding to kind of mid- to high-single-digit year-on-year unit growth for the iPhone business from a sell-through standpoint. Is that the right ballpark we should be thinking about? And why the big deceleration from the 25% plus kind of weekly sales rate you quoted in your intro comments?",85
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2013",2013-01-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3788.0,404588.0,19090206.0,Answer,Peter Oppenheimer,,Executives,66,"Sure. Chris. It's Peter. We're not going to talk about guidance at a specific product level. But let me give you some things we thought about in coming up with the range of $41 billion to $43 billion. It is -- that range is a 5% to 10% year-over-year increase. And there are a few factors that are impacting the year-over-year results, making the strong performance of the business a little bit harder to see, so let me point a few of these out. As we've -- first of all, as we talked about several times on the call, last year in the March quarter, we built 2.6 million units of iPhone channel inventory, which allowed us to get into our 4- to 6-week range. That increased the revenue in the year-ago quarter by $1.6 billion. And as Tim talked about, that was sell-in, that was not sell-through. We're thinking about the business on a sell-through basis. So don't lose sight of the $1.6 billion. Second, the iPhone 5 rollout this year has been our fastest ever. We're selling in 100 countries by the end of December. Last year, we did not achieve this country distribution until the March quarter, which included China that we launched in January. Third, we made a very good strategic decision to introduce the iPad mini, which customers love, and to keep the price-reduced iPad 2 in the line. As a result of this, we saw a reduction in our iPad ASPs of about $101 year-over-year in the December quarter. And you can see that our iPad units grew faster than our iPad revenue in the December quarter. We would expect iPad ASPs to be down quite a bit in the March quarter on a year-over-year basis for the same reasons. And then finally, the PC market grew 4% last year in the March quarter. And this year, IDC is projecting that to decline by 3%. So considering these factors, the underlying performance of the business is much stronger than the 5% to 10% year-over-year growth implies, and we remain very confident in our business and our new product pipeline.",355

I wanted to ask in context of your iPhone business, given the strength you're seeing at the low end of your product line, the iPhone 4 being stocked out during the quarter, there seems to be a lot of demand at lower price points for the iPhone. Why not get more aggressive at lower price bands and move down market in the iPhone business?",83

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We have a lot of news to share with you today about the details of our March quarter, as well as a significant increase to our capital return program. 
First, I'd like to talk about our business and the road ahead. We're now halfway through our fiscal 2013, and we've accomplished a tremendous amount. We've introduced and ramped production of an unprecedented number of new products, and we've set many new sales records. Our revenue for the first half was over $98 billion, and our net income was over $22 billion. During that time, we sold 85 million iPhones and 42 million iPads. These are very, very large numbers, unimaginable even to us just a few years ago. 
Despite producing results that met or beat our guidance as we have done consistently, we know they didn't meet everyone's expectations. And though we've achieved incredible scale and financial success, we acknowledge that our growth rate has slowed and our margins have decreased from the exceptionally high level we experienced in 2012. Our revenues grew about $13 billion in the first half of the fiscal year. Even though that's like adding the total first half revenue of 5 Fortune 500 companies, our average weekly growth slowed to 19%, and our gross margins are closer to the levels of a few years ago. 
Our fiscal 2012 results were incredibly strong, and that's making comparisons very difficult this year. Last year, our business benefited from both high growth and demand for our product and a corresponding growth in channel inventories, along with the richer mix of higher gross margin products, a more favorable foreign currency environment and historically low costs. These compares are made further challenging until we anniversary the launch of the iPad mini, which, as you know, we strategically priced at a lower margin. As Peter will discuss, we are guiding to flat revenues year-over-year for the June quarter along with a slight sequential decline in gross margins. 
The decline in Apple's stock price over the last couple of quarters has been very frustrating to all of us. But Apple remains very strong, and we will continue to do what we do best. We can't control items such as exchange rates and world economies and even certain cost pressures. But the most important objective for Apple will always be creating innovative products, and that is directly within our control. We will continue to focus on the long term, and we remain very optimistic about our future. We're participating in large and growing markets. We see great opportunities in front of us, particularly, given the long-term prospects of the smartphone and tablet markets; the strength of our incredible ecosystem, which we plan to continue to augment with new services; our plans for expanded distribution; and the potential of exciting new product categories. 
Take the smartphone market for example. IDC estimates that this market will double between 2012 and 2016 to an incredible 1.4 billion units annually. And Gartner estimates that the tablet market is growing at an even faster rate from 125 million units in 2012 to a projected 375 million by 2016. Our teams are hard at work on some amazing new hardware, software and services that we can't wait to introduce this fall and throughout 2014. We continue to be very confident in our future product plans. Apple has many distinct and unique advantages as the only company in the industry with world-class skills in hardware, software and services. We have the strongest ecosystem in the industry with App Stores in 155 countries, iTunes Music Stores in 119 countries, hundreds of millions of iCloud users around the world and most importantly, the highest loyalty and customer satisfaction rates in the business. And of course, we have a tremendous culture of innovation with a relentless focus on making the world's best products that change people's lives. This is the same culture and company that brought the world the iPhone and the iPad, and we've got a lot more surprises in the works. 
A little over a year ago, we announced a plan to return $45 billion to shareholders over 3 years. Since we began paying dividends last August and began share buybacks last October, we've already returned $10 billion under that program. But we continue to generate cash in excess of our needs to operate the business, invest in our future and maintain flexibility to take advantage of strategic opportunities. We remain firmly committed to our objective of delivering attractive returns to shareholders through both our business performance and the return of capital. So today, we are announcing an aggressive plan that more than doubles the size of the capital return program we announced last year to a total of $100 billion by the end of calendar year 2015. The vast majority of our incremental cash return will be in the form of share repurchases. As the board and management team deliberated among the various alternatives to returning cash, we concluded that investing in Apple was the best. 
In addition to share repurchases, we are increasing our current dividend by 15% to further appeal to investors seeking yield. And as part of our updated program, we will access the debt markets. Peter will provide more details about all of this in a moment. We appreciate the input that so many of our shareholders have provided us on how best to deploy our cash. We will review our cash allocation strategy each year. And we will continue to invest confidently in the business to bring great new products to market; strategically deploy capital in our supply chain, our retail stores and our infrastructure; and make acquisitions to expand our capabilities. We will be disciplined in what we do, but we will not under-invest. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Peter to discuss the details of the March quarter. Peter?",989
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2013",2013-04-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3581.0,446488.0,20887078.0,Presenter Speech,Peter Oppenheimer,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Tim. We are pleased to report the results of our second fiscal quarter. We established new March quarter records for iPhone and iPad sales and new all-time record for iTunes sales, leading to Apple's strongest March quarter revenue ever. 
Revenue for the quarter was $43.6 billion compared to $39.2 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of $4.4 billion or 11% and $600 million over the high end of our guidance range. The year-over-year revenue increase was fueled primarily by strong growth in iPad and iTunes sales, as well as continued strong revenue from iPhone and Mac. Operating margin was $12.6 billion, representing 28.8% of revenue. Net income was $9.5 billion, translated to diluted earnings per share of $10.09. 
As for the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with iPhone. We sold 37.4 million iPhones compared to 35.1 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of over 2.3 million or 7%. We ended the quarter with about 11.6 million total iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 1 million iPhones. And we ended the quarter within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory. Based on research published earlier this month by comScore, iPhone garnered the #1 spot in the U.S. smartphone market for the 3-month period ended in February with 39% share, up from 35% in the previous survey period. 
And in Japan, IDC Japan announced that iPhone gained the #1 position for all of calendar year 2012, as well as for calendar Q4 2012 in both handsets and smartphones. This is also the first time a non-Japanese company has achieved the #1 spot for an entire year. In addition, Apple was ranked #1 in Nikkei's 2013 Japan brand survey, achieving the top spot for the second year in a row, which is unprecedented for a non-Japanese company. Around the world, based on its latest published estimates, IDC ranked the iPhone #1 or 2 in smartphone sales in over half the countries' IDC tracks. 
A recent study by Kantar measured a 95% loyalty rate among iPhone owners, substantially higher than the competition, and iPhone remains top in customer experience. Last month, were very pleased to receive the #1 ranking in smartphone customer satisfaction from J.D. Power and Associates for the ninth consecutive time. 
Businesses around the world continue to scale iPhone across their workforces. Globally, nearly 30,000 companies are developing and distributing iOS apps for corporate use by their employees. Cisco's Bring Your Own Device program across 80 countries has resulted in a 50% increase in the number of iPhones connecting to its corporate network in the past year. GlaxoSmithKline has developed more than 50 in-house iOS apps to support the thousands of iPhones and iPads connecting to its corporate network. Other companies such as AAXA [ph], Nordstrom's, Eaton [ph] Corporation and Takeda Pharmaceuticals are supporting thousands of iPhones and are continually adding new in-house apps to better serve customers and help employees work more efficiently. 
Turning to iPad. We were thrilled to sell 19.5 million iPads during the quarter compared to 11.8 million in the year-ago quarter. That's an increase of 7.7 million units or 65%. iPad experienced very strong year-over-year growth in every operating segment, particularly in Greater China and Japan, where sales more than doubled year-over-year. Both iPad and iPad mini continue to be extremely popular, and we were pleased with sales of both. We were able to sell significantly more iPad minis in the March quarter than in the December launch quarter and to expand availability to China. Customers love the combination of experience, performance and size that iPad mini offers, and our early market research indicates that the overwhelming majority of iPad mini purchasers are first-time iPad customers. We ended the quarter with about 4.8 million iPads in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 1.4 million. All of the sequential increase was attributable to iPad mini. As we discussed previously, we were not able to meet demand for iPad mini in the December quarter and entered the March quarter below our target range of channel inventory. This sequential increase places us within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of total iPad channel inventory. 
The most recent survey published by ChangeWave indicated a 96% satisfaction rate among iPad customers. Not only is iPad a huge hit among consumers, but it also continues to be widely adopted by business customers as well. iPad and the iOS ecosystem are driving innovation across industries and in companies large and small. We are delighted by the number of companies that are choosing iPad for their most important business tasks, as well as the rapid adoption of iPad in emerging countries around the world. Doctors at the Colombia Cardiovascular Foundation in South America are using an in-house app to perform remote diagnostics for patients in inaccessible parts of the country. First National Bank, the oldest bank in South Africa, has issued iPads to wealth managers to help enhance customer relationships and interactions. And in the education market, Grupo Santillana has developed Uno Internacional, an integrated educational system that uses iPads to create digital learning environments in more than 700 private K-12 schools in Latin America. Uno Internacional has deployed more than 60,000 iPads to schools in Mexico, Colombia and Brazil; including 17,000 iPads for teachers and students in Brazil in the March quarter alone. 
Turning to Mac. We sold just under 4 million Macs, which is a 2% decline from the year-ago quarter. IDC estimates that the global personal computer market contracted by 14% during the March quarter. We experienced strong year-over-year growth in desktop sales following the December quarter launch of our stunning new iMacs, offset by decline in portable sales, given the weaker personal computer market overall. We ended the quarter within our 4- to 5-week target range of Mac channel inventory. 
Moving to iPod. We sold 5.6 million iPods compared to 7.7 million in the year-ago quarter. iPod touch continued to account for over half of all iPods sold during the March quarter. iPod's share of the U.S. market for MP3 players was over 70% in the March quarter based on the latest data published by MPD, and iPod continue to be the top-selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GFK. 
The Apple ecosystem contributes -- continues to grow and thrive, and we believe it's a very important driver of our incredibly strong customer satisfaction and retention as well as developer interest and success. This Sunday marks the 10th anniversary of the introduction of the iTunes Music Store, which revolutionized the distribution of digital content. Today, our iTunes stores offer the broadest combination of geographic reach and content depth in the industry. And they surpassed quarterly billings of $4 billion for the first time ever in the March quarter. That's $16 billion annual run rate, making our digital content stores the largest in the world. 
The quarter's iTunes billings translated to record quarterly iTunes revenue of $2.4 billion, up 28% from the year-ago March quarter with new quarterly revenue records for music, movies and apps. The strong iTunes sales, in addition to other service revenue, helped us achieve for the first time more than $4 billion in combined quarterly revenue from iTunes, software and services. We are thrilled with the growth of these revenue streams. Today, we have music stores in 119 countries offering a combined catalog of 35 million songs; we sell movies in 109 countries, offering 60,000 titles; and we have iBooks stores in 155 countries, offering 1.75 million iBooks for sale. And with App Stores in 155 countries that encompass almost 90% of the world's population, our developers have created more than 850,000 iOS apps, including 350,000 apps made for iPad. 
Cumulative app downloads have surpassed 45 billion, and app developers have made over $9 billion for their sales through the App Store, including $4.5 billion in the most recent 4 quarters alone. KAnalysis estimates the sales from our App Store accounted for 74% of all apps sales worldwide in the March quarter. We believe this is, in large part, due to the great development environment, broad distribution, large and active user base and seamless integration that the iOS platform offers. 
Developers, such as Backflip Studios, have seen explosive growth in their business, thanks to the success of their apps on the iOS platform. With 70 people, this company maintains a growing suite of titles that have seen over 275 million downloads, according to nearly 5 million daily active users and 34 million monthly active users. With annual App Store sales approaching $100 million, Backflip's iOS sales comprise approximately 95% of the company's revenues in 2012. 
Another tremendous success story is Supercell, founded in 2010. Based in Finland, Supercell's Hay Day and Clash of Clans titles, available only on iOS, have been their top-grossing iPad games in over 60 countries, helping the company generate $8.5 million in revenue per employee in 2012. 
And in the enterprise, iOS devices had a strong lead over Android. In its most recently published quarterly enterprise device activations report, Good Technology has found that iOS devices accounted for 77% of all activations by its corporate customers. And thanks to careful App Store curation for the quality of apps, the iOS platform offers a much more secure environment. Recent research by McAfee Labs found that 97% of identified mobile malware was on the Android platform, with the remainder primarily on the Symbian and Java ME platforms. 
But perhaps the most important measure of the success of our ecosystem is how engaged our customers are with our products and services. In its most recently published update, Chitika found that iPad accounted for 82% of all North American tablet web traffic in March. Interest in apps remained very strong in the March quarter with over 800 apps downloaded per second, and year-over-year iOS app revenue more than doubling in the quarter.  And since launching iCloud just 18 months ago, we now have 300 million people using it every day. We will continue to invest in the ecosystem and have some great new features and capabilities in the pipeline. 
I'd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores. Revenue for the quarter was $5.2 billion compared to $4.4 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 19%. This growth was fueled primarily by strong sales of iPhone and iPad. We ended the quarter with a total of 402 stores, including 151 outside the United States. We expect to open about 30 new stores in total in fiscal 2013 and to complete at least 20 store remodels. With an average of 401 stores opened in the March quarter, average revenue per store was $13.1 million compared to $12.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Retail segment income was $1.1 billion. We hosted 91 million visitors to our stores during the quarter compared to 85 million in the year-ago quarter. That translates to 17,500 visitors per store per week. 
Total company gross margin was 37.5%, which was at the low end of our guidance range of 37.5% to 38.5%. Operating expenses were $3.8 billion and included $488 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $347 million, and the tax rate for the quarter was 26%. 
And turning to our cash, we ended the quarter with $144.7 billion in cash plus short-term and long-term marketable securities compared to $137.1 billion at the end of the December quarter, a sequential increase of $7.6 billion. Over $102 billion of our total cash was offshore at the end of the March quarter, and cash flow from operations was $12.5 billion. We paid $2.5 billion in dividends in the March quarter. And earlier this month, we concluded the $1.95 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we initiated in the December quarter, resulting in cumulative retirement of over 4 million shares of Apple stock. 
As Tim discussed, we are pleased to announce that we are more than doubling our return of capital program to $100 billion by the end of calendar year 2015, which translates to an average of about $30 billion per year. We will continue to return capital to shareholders through dividends, share repurchases and cash use to net-share-settle vesting RSUs. To facilitate our program, we will access the debt markets. 
Let me provide more details regarding the 3 key elements of our plans. First, our board has increased the share buyback authorization to $60 billion from the original $10 billion announced last year. That's a $50 billion increase. This is the largest share buyback authorization of any company in history. We are very confident in Apple's future and believe so strongly that repurchasing our shares represents an attractive use of our capital, that we have dedicated the vast majority of the increase in our capital return program to share repurchases. We will buy shares under the stock authorization beginning this month. We will also continue to net share settle employee RSUs that they vest and expect to use about $1 billion of cash annually to do this. 
Second, we are increasing our quarterly dividend from $2.65 to $3.05 per share, a 15% increase. We plan to review our quarterly dividend payment annually. Our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $3.05 per common share payable on May 16, 2013, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 13, 2013. We are very proud that Apple is among the largest dividend payers in the world with annual payments of about $11 billion. 
Third, we will access the U.S. debt markets over time and have recently secured credit ratings from S&P and Moody's. We are continuing to generate significant cash offshore, and repatriating this cash would result in significant tax consequences under current U.S. tax law. Incorporating debt into our capital structure will provide several benefits, including access to attractively priced capital, a reduction in our overall cost of capital and an efficient leverage of our very strong balance sheet. We expect to fund the capital return program from existing domestic cash, future cash generated in the U.S. and from borrowing in the U.S. We will maintain sufficient domestic liquidity to grow the business and execute capital expenditures and acquisitions. 
The program announced today will result in returning an average of $30 billion annually to shareholders. To put this in perspective, the $30 billion would have represented substantially all of our fiscal year 2012 only tax-free cash flow had repatriated our foreign earnings. Between now and the end of calendar year 2015, we would expect both our foreign cash and our domestic borrowing to grow. We will continue to review each element of our capital return program on an annual basis.  In conclusion, our capital return program is designed to facilitate our objective of delivering attractive returns to our shareholders on an efficient basis, while maintaining the flexibility to invest in the incredible opportunities that we continue to see for our business. 
Now as we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $33.5 billion and $35.5 billion compared to $35 billion in the year-ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 36% and 37%, reflecting approximately $90 billion related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be between $3.85 billion and $3.95 billion, including about $500 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $300 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%. 
In closing, we're pleased with our record March quarter revenue and March -- and record March quarter iPhone and iPad sales. We are very proud of the breadth and depth of our tremendous ecosystem and our all -- and our new all-time record for iTunes sales. We are also in the fortunate position to be able to more than double our return of capital program to $100 billion with the largest share repurchase authorization in history and to be one of the largest dividend payers in the world, with annual payments of about $11 billion. We remain very confident in our product pipeline. 
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.",2718

In the March quarter, our gross margin was 37.5%, was at the low end of our range. We had a few items that, on balance, resulted in us reporting at the low end. They included mix, in particular, selling more iPads than we had planned; including getting iPad mini into our 4- to 6-week channel inventory range; some changes in our service policies that required us to make provisions for prior quarter sales; and we had some unfavorable adjustments. As I look forward to the June quarter, we're guiding gross margin to be down between 50 and 150 basis points sequentially. We see 2 factors impacting gross margins sequentially. First, and the largest of the 2, is a loss of leverage on sequentially lower revenue; and second, a different product mix. We expect both of these headwinds to be partially offset by better costs in the quarter.",148

We actually had our best quarter ever in Greater China, so it was a record for us. The revenue came in at $8.8 billion. That includes our retail stores that are in that region. That's up 11% year-on-year. Again, that includes the retail stores that are in that region, which is the same as our -- which is the same as the Apple is growing. The highlights for the quarter in China were that iPads grew 138% year-on-year, and we set new records for sell-through for iPhone and iPad during the quarter. There were some significant year-over-year timing differences with regard to channel inventory relative to iPhone that affected the compares year-over-year. In particular, in the year-ago quarter, we increased iPhone channel inventories globally by 2.6 million. As you probably recall, 1.6 million of the 2.6 million occurred in Greater China to support the launches that were in the March quarter of last year. And so if you look at revenue on a sell-through basis, Greater China revenue was actually up 18 -- up approximately 18%. And so it's a bit better than at first look. As I've said in the year-ago quarter, we launched the iPhone 4S with China Unicom in January, and we launched China Telecom in March. This year, the iPhone 5 launched in December. And so it's a very different set of dynamics on a year-on-year basis. Going forward, we still see a significant opportunity in China. It's a great market. We have 11 stores there. We expect to double those in less than 2 years. We have added about 8,000 iPhone point of sales in the indirect channel to about 19,000 today. And we obviously have a plan to add more and further grow our distribution. This number is obviously too low currently. We're also innovating in our online -- with our online store there and adding different functionality to the store. China has a unusually large number of potential first-time smartphone buyers, and that's not lost on us. We've seen a significant interest in iPhone 4 there and have recently made it even more affordable to make it even more attractive to those first-time buyers. And so we're hopeful that, that will help iPhone sales in the future.",379

But we feel that we have the best products by far, and we are continuing to invest in innovative products and feel really, really confident about our product pipeline in both hardware, software and also services.

I'll take your first 2. We are very pleased with the progress that we're making on getting down cost curves. And this will help to partially offset the loss of leverage and the different product mix that we expect to see in the June quarter. And we have factored these cost improvements into the guidance we're providing for the quarter. The iPhone ASPs were down sequentially about $28 as you noted, and this was driven primarily by mix. The largest factors were an increase in the iPhone 4 mix, which resulted from our making the iPhone 4 more affordable in many markets, and also mix within the iPhone 5 as it was in its second full quarter.",121

You talked earlier about how you're excited about the large addressable markets that you have, particularly the smartphone and tablet marketplaces. And you talked about how strongly and confidently you feel about competitive advantages in your products and ecosystems. If I step back and look at the data for this quarter on the phone side, if I adjust for inventory, the iPhone was up very low- to mid-single digits. I think most third-party market data would say that the smartphone market probably grew about 30%. And if I look broadly, incorporating your guidance for next quarter and thinking about fiscal Q1, it appears very unlikely that Apple will grow at that market rate of 30% or more. So I'm wondering if you could comment on, a, whether that ostensible loss in market share is something that Apple is focused on or cares about as a principal financial objective. And if so, why do you think there is this disconnect between the very attractive products that you are offering and the market data that I just cited?",193
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2013",2013-04-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3581.0,446488.0,20887102.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,27,"So Toni, let me try to address. You mentioned both smartphones and tablets, and so let me try to address both of those. First, let me start with the tablet side. The numbers that we've seen from IDC would indicate that they believe the market in March declined by 30% from December, December being obviously a seasonally high quarter with the holiday. As you can see from our numbers, we declined 15%. And so if that holds, we did much better than the market and had a very nice pickup in market share. And obviously, on iPad, we continue to have an ecosystem story that is unparalleled. We have 350,000 apps that are optimized for iPad versus a few hundred for our competition. And the overall experience and the fit and finish of the product, I think you would agree, is substantially better than the options there. On the phone side, the numbers that you talked about, the sell-in comparisons year-over-year, you really have to convert that to sell-through to look at the underlying demand. And as I've gone through before, we did grow channel inventory in the year-ago quarter because we were catching up on the rollout of the iPhone 4S. In fact, we grew 2.6 million. And so you have to factor in to get it to real sell-through. However, I take your point, if the market did grow up by 30%, we still, after that normalization, we grew less than that. And so I think the question -- or the point is not lost, and we do want to grow faster. We don't view it, however, as the only measure of our health. The things that are very important to us, in addition to market share and unit volumes, include things like customer set, which were the highest by far, with winning J.D. Powers 9 times consecutively; the customer loyalty and repurchase rates, which were the highest by far, the -- 95% according to Kantar. And the ecosystem commerce, which attracts developers, is incredible. KAnalysis says that we have 74%. So basically, $3 out of $4 that are spent on apps, they're spent in our ecosystem. And if you then look to usage statistics, they're staggering at the usage of iOS versus other operating systems. And so I -- market share is important, and unit volumes are important. But these other things for us are extremely important because we're all about customer experience and enriching lives. Now that said, we see an enormous number of first-time smartphone buyers coming to market, particularly in certain countries around the world. And so what we've done with that is, and we started last quarter, is we've made the iPhone 4 even more affordable and -- which has made it more attractive to first-time buyers. And we caught up on the -- our caught -- supply caught demand toward the -- late in the quarter last quarter. And we're continuing to do that in other markets. And we believe that the phone for the price point that we're offering is an incredible value for people that allows them to get into the ecosystem with a really, really phenomenal product.",528

Maybe what does it say about long-term gross margins if 36% to 37% is the margin that you're calling for when your highest margin product, let's hope, is at a trough for the year? And I think you're implying that when you say all these new products are coming in the fall. So is there an implied margin philosophy here with this 2Q guide that 36% is as low as you want it to get, and that maybe it gets better from there? Or is there nothing that we should imply in terms of how the company views gross margins?",112

I'll start on that one. It's been our long-term practice. We're not providing specific gross margin guidance beyond the June quarter. We don't do this because there are many factors that can influence gross margins in a specific quarter and cause them to vary widely over time, including product cycles commodity markets, product mix and currencies. So while we don't want to make a forecast beyond June, let me tell you how we think about gross margin and hopefully, this will help. We're managing the business for the long term and are willing to trade off short-term profits where we see long-term potential. The iPod is a great example of this. When we launched it in 2001, its margins were significantly below the margins of Apple at that time. 4 years later, the iPod and the iTunes Music Store comprised half of Apple's revenues and inspired us to build the iPhone. The iPad mini is another great example. We have priced it aggressively, and its margins are significantly below the corporate average. However, we believe deeply in the long-term potential of the tablet market and think that we've made a great strategic decision. We'll only make great products, and this precludes us from making cheap products that don't deliver a great experience. We believe deeply that there are people in every part of the world that want great products. Looking back over the last several years, we've made very good business decisions, balancing units, revenues and the bottom line. We think about all 3. And as I said, we're willing to make short-term trade-offs in profits where we see long-term potential, and we're managing Apple with a very long-term horizon. Some of our revenues and profits occur after we ship our products. We were thrilled to exceed, this quarter, $4 billion in revenue for our services for the first time. And as Tim mentioned, we will augment our very strong ecosystem with new services and make current ones even better. So we remain very confident in our strategy, and we will use our world-class skills in engineering and operations to manage our business well in the future.",360

We have App Stores in 155 countries and iTunes Stores in over 110 countries. We have hundreds of millions of users. We've just crossed a $16 billion run rate on the iTunes Stores in terms of billings and just achieved, for the first time, $4 billion in revenue for our services. So we're really thrilled with what we've just reported this quarter. But we see opportunity that we're going to invest in tremendously to delight our customers and continue to grow our business in those areas.",105

We've made that very elegant and very easy. Also because the usage for iOS is so much higher -- when we integrate things well, people use them a lot more.

Because obviously, you outperformed substantially the competition but were still down about 2%. So I'm curious as to whether or not you think elasticity of demand would lower prices? Or what you're hearing from your customers in terms of their reluctance to buy a new Mac? And then also how you're thinking about the  cannibalization potential coming out of the iPads?",85

IDC said that the market for the March quarter was down 14% year-on-year, which is the largest decline that I remember from being in this industry for a long time. At the same time, we sold almost 20 million iPads, and I -- it's certainly true that some of those iPads cannibalized some Macs. I personally don't think it was a huge number, but I do think it's some. And I think probably the larger thing, at least for the -- maybe not so much on the Mac side but on the PC side, is people are probably extending their upgrade cycles. That said, I don't think this market is a dead market or a bad market by any means. I think it has a lot of life to it. We're going to continue to innovate in it. We believe that, if anything, the huge growth in tablets may wind up benefiting the Mac because it pushes people to think about the product they're buying in a different manner. And people may be even more willing to buy a Mac where today, they may be buying a PC. And so we're going to continue making the best personal computers. Our strategy is not changing, and we feel really good about it. We delivered some incredible innovation last year with the Retina display, with the MacBook Pro and in an incredible thin and light package. And we've got some more great stuff planned. So this is an area we're continuing to invest in.",283

And then just as a follow-up question with regards to the tablet market. We've met with some of your competitors recently and are starting to talk about wins in the enterprise and touting the benefits of Microsoft and some of the other OSs that are out there in terms of security and interoperability in some of the enterprise companies. So I'm curious what you've heard from your customers. Have you seen much displacement? And what are sort of the discussions that you have with the enterprise customers with regard to iPads and fitting into their systems?,97

And Peter had referenced earlier the Good Technology's data that says that iOS accounted for 77% of all their activations by their corporate customers. Now that would not include BlackBerry, but it would include all the other guys. And so we seem to be doing really well. And honestly, I don't see the recent announcements changing that at all. I see more and more people developing more and more custom apps for their businesses on iOS to be used on iPad, and we're very, very bullish on it. As a matter of fact, just to quote you some numbers, iPad now is being used in 95% of the Fortune 500. And what's even more impressive probably is on the Global 500 companies, it's -- we're now in 89%.",135

Where the iPad mini was in shortage in that month of -- or in the quarter, in the December quarter, I would not have done that differently because we were able to get the iPad mini out to many millions of customers who really wanted that for -- wanted that product for their holiday.

But in retrospect, that one, yes, I sort of wish it were after the turn of the year because our customers would not have had to wait as long as they did.",156

24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q3 2013 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2013",2013-07-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3270.0,486759.0,22484764.0,Presenter Speech,Peter Oppenheimer,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Nancy. We're pleased to report the results of our third fiscal quarter. We established a new June quarter record for iPhone sales, driving Apple's strongest June quarter revenue ever. Revenue for the quarter was $35.3 billion, up $300 million or 1% from the year-ago quarter and at the high end of our guidance range. Gross margin was 36.9%, also at the high end of our guidance range. And operating margin was $9.2 billion, representing 26% of revenue. Net income was $6.9 billion, translating to diluted earnings per share of $7.47.
Channel inventories declined sequentially by $1 billion during the June quarter this year, meaning that sell-through was $36.3 billion. In contrast, channel inventory increased $700 million from the beginning to the end of the June quarter last year, meaning that sell-through was $34.3 billion in that quarter. As such, our June quarter sell-through increased by $2 billion or 6% year-over-year, ahead of our 1% sell-in revenue growth.
As for the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with iPhone. We sold 31.2 million iPhones compared to 26 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 5.2 million or 20%. We had a sequential decrease of about 600,000 iPhones in channel inventory in the June quarter, translating to iPhone sell-through of about 31.8 million units. iPhone sales were ahead of our expectations, and we were particularly pleased with very strong year-over-year growth in iPhone sales in a number of both developed and emerging markets, including the U.S., U.K., Japan, Brazil, Russia, India, Thailand and Singapore. iPhone 5 remains, by far, the most popular iPhone, but we were also very happy with sales of iPhone 4 and 4S. We exited the quarter with about 11 million units of total iPhones in channel inventory and ended within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory. iPhone unit sales in the U.S. increased 51% compared to the year-ago quarter. And based on research recently published by comScore, iPhone once again achieved the #1 spot in the U.S. smartphone market for the 3-month period ending in May, with over 39% share.
iPhone sales were also very strong in Japan, growing 66% year-over-year. iPhone is the top-selling smartphone in Japan based on the latest published quarterly data from IDC. And Apple is the #1 or #2 selling smartphone manufacturer in most markets IDC tracks, including North America, Western Europe, Russia, Turkey, Australia, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore. The most recently published study by Kantar measured a 93% loyalty rate among iPhone owners, significantly higher than our competitors. And iPhone continues to lead in terms of customer experience. Not only has iPhone earned the top spot in customer satisfaction from J.D. Power and Associates an unprecedented 9 nonconsecutive times, it has also received the top customer satisfaction ranking in a number of surveys, including the recent Quality Insights survey of smartphone customers in South Korea.
iPhone also continues to be the smartphone of choice for business. Given the security and stability of iOS, enterprise and government customers around the world continue to deploy iPhone on their networks in ways that go far beyond personal productivity. Companies have built tens of thousands of custom apps to improve every aspect of their business. Global companies, including American Airlines, Cisco, General Electric, Roche and SAP, have deployed more than 25,000 iPhones each across their organizations. U.S. government organizations, such as NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, the ATF, and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, are supporting and managing thousands of iPhones on their networks, and continue to create both customer-facing and internal iOS apps. And just this past quarter, iOS 6 was granted FIPS 140-2 validation by the U.S. federal government and approval by the U.S. Department of Defense to contact -- to connect to their networks. Combining sales to business, government and education customers, iPhone holds a 62.5% share of the U.S. commercial market, based on the latest quarterly data published by IDC.
Turning to iPad. We sold 14.6 million iPads during the quarter compared to 17 million in the year-ago quarter. The tough year-over-year comparison was driven by both the significant channel inventory increase and the first full quarter of the availability of the third-generation iPad in the year-ago quarter. We built 1.2 million units of iPad channel inventory in the June quarter last year, whereas we reduced channel inventory by 700,000 units in the June quarter this year. Factoring in this 1.9-million-unit channel inventory swing, iPad unit sell-through was down 3% year-over-year. We exited the quarter with about 4.1 million units of iPad channel inventory, within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks.
Customers continue to love their iPads. For the second consecutive time in the 2-year history of the survey, iPad ranked #1 in the 2013 U.S. Tablet Satisfaction survey by J.D. Power and Associates. And again, in its latest study published today, Chitika reported that iPad accounted for 84.3% share of tablet web usage by customers in the U.S. and Canada, its highest level this year.
In every major industry around the world, companies are developing, deploying and supporting apps for iPad. Government organizations, as well as global enterprise companies across diverse fields, including automotive, insurance, energy services and health care, are using iPad and custom apps to create unique, meaningful experiences for their employees, partners and customers. The USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service has deployed thousands of iPads to in-person interviewers, resulting in higher response rates and decreased costs. And companies including Eli Lilly, Novartis, Cafe Life, Roche and SAP have developed over 20,000 -- have deployed over 20,000 iPads each across their organizations.
Turning to Mac. We are pleased with sales of 3.8 million Macs, which is a 7% decline from the year-ago quarter, but higher than our expectations. IDC estimates that the global personal computer market contracted by 11% during the June quarter, indicating that Macs gained share. In June, we introduced 2 new versions of MacBook Air, and customer response has been great. Wired Magazine described the new 13-inch MacBook Air as ""nearly flawless"", citing its phenomenal battery life, processing performance, featherlight chassis and superfast WiFi. Additionally, last month, we provided a sneak peek at our next-generation Mac Pro, engineered around workstation graphics with dual GPUs, PCI Express-based flash storage, high-performance Thunderbolt 2, next-generation Xeon processors, ultrafast memory and support for 4k video. The new state-of-the-art Mac Pro will be assembled in the U.S. and will be available later this year.
We were excited to release the developer preview of OS X Mavericks last month. More than 200 new features, OS -- with more than 200 new features, OS X Mavericks brings Maps and iBooks to the Mac, introduces Finder Tags and Tabs, enhances multi-display support for power users, delivers new dual-core technologies for breakthrough power efficiency and performance, and includes an all-new version of Safari. OS X Mavericks will be available to customers in the fall. We ended the quarter with just below our 4- to 5-week target range of Mac channel inventory.
Our U.S. education institution business had a great quarter, generating its highest quarterly revenue ever. The results were fueled by all-time record quarterly iPad sales of 1.1 million units, in addition to strong June quarter Mac sales. The State of Maine's Learning Technology Initiative, which provides the state's middle school and high school students and teachers with personal computing solutions, allowed individual school districts to choose which products to purchase rather than standardize on a single statewide solution. We are very proud that an estimated 94% of the 69,000 total units selected this year were Apple products.
And we're extremely pleased to have received the Los Angeles School Board of Education's unanimous approval to begin the first phase of a massive rollout of iPads to students across the district, starting this fall. The district is the second-largest in the United States and plans to equip every one of its 660,000 students with a tablet by 2014.
We continue to be very pleased with the growth and strength of the Apple ecosystem. With the broadest geographic reach and depth of content in the industry, our iTunes Store generated record billings of $4.3 billion in the June quarter, culminating in our best month and best week ever for App Store billings at the very end of the quarter. The quarter's iTunes billings translated to quarterly revenue of $2.4 billion, up 29% from the year-ago quarter, with strong growth in revenue from both content and apps. The continued strong iTunes sales, combined with other software and service revenue, resulted in total quarterly revenue of $4 billion from iTunes software and services.
We added some great new video content to iTunes and Apple TV. Last month, we announced HBO GO and WatchESPN are now available directly on Apple TV, joining programming from Hulu Plus, Netflix's streaming catalog, live sports from MLB, NBA and NHL, as well as Internet content from Vimeo, YouTube and Flickr. Sky News, Crunchyroll and Qello are offering live news, sports and current TV programming. Apple TV users can now choose from a broad selection of programming, including over 60,000 movies and over 230,000 TV episodes, as well as the world's largest collection of music on the iTunes Store.
iTunes users have downloaded more than 1 billion TV episodes and 390 million movies from iTunes to date, and they are purchasing over 800,000 TV episodes and over 350,000 movies per day. We recently celebrated the 5-year anniversary of our amazing App Store. Our developers have now created more than 900,000 iOS apps, including 375,000 apps made for iPad. The popularity of these apps remains incredibly strong. Cumulative app downloads have surpassed 50 billion, and app developers have made over $11 billion for their sales through the App Store, half of which was earned in the last 4 quarters.
Our vibrant ecosystem continues to drive tremendous user engagement with our devices and services. We now have over 320 million iCloud accounts and 240 million Game Center accounts. And our customers have sent almost 900 billion iMessages, uploaded over 125 billion photos and received over 8 trillion push notifications. And thanks to the stability and security and popularity of the iOS platform, the iOS devices continue to have a strong lead over Android in the enterprise. In its most recently published quarterly enterprise Device Activations Report, Good Technologies found that among its corporate clients, iPhone 5 was by far the most frequently activated device of any kind, and iPads represented 88% of all tablet activations.
We're continuing to invest in software and services to make the ecosystem and user experience even richer. This fall, we released a beta version of iWork for iCloud, bringing Pages, Numbers and Keynotes to the web. With iWork for iCloud, users will be able to create great-looking letters, reports and flyers, generate complex yet beautiful spreadsheets, and develop and deliver beautiful presentations with powerful graphics and special effects, all from within a web browser. And we're extremely excited about the fall launch of iOS 7, with its stunning new user interface and many great new features, including Control Center, AirDrop and iTunes Radio, smarter multitasking and enhancements to Notification Center, photos, Safari and Siri.
I'd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores. Revenue for the quarter was $4.1 billion, approximately equal to the year-ago quarter. The stores experienced strong growth in iPhone sales and had their more successful MacBook Air launch to date. We opened 6 new stores across 5 countries during the quarter and ended the quarter with a total of 408 stores, including 156 outside the United States. We expect to open 9 new stores in the September quarter, bringing us to a total of 27 new store openings in fiscal '13. We also relocated 4 stores in the June quarter that had outgrown their former space, and we expect to complete a total of 23 such relocations in fiscal '13.
With an average of 405 stores open in the June quarter, average revenue per store was $10.1 million compared to $11.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Retail segment income was $667 million. We hosted 84 million visitors to our stores during the quarter, which translates to 16,000 visitors per store per week.
Operating expenses were $3.8 billion and included $488 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $234 million, and the tax rate for the quarter was 26.9%.
And turning to our cash, we ended the quarter with $146.6 billion in cash plus short-term and long-term marketable securities, compared to $144.7 billion at the end of the March quarter, a sequential increase of $1.9 billion. $106 billion of our total cash was offshore at the end of the June quarter, and cash flow from operations was $7.8 billion.
In early April, we concluded the $1.95 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we initiated in the December quarter, resulting in cumulative retirement of over 4 million shares of Apple stock under that program. In late April, we executed a very successful debt offering, issuing $17 billion of debt across 3-, 5-, 10- and 30-year maturities. We paid $2.8 billion in dividends in the quarter, and we also utilized a total of $16 billion in cash on share repurchase activity through a combination of a new accelerated share repurchase program and open market purchases. $12 billion of the $16 billion was utilized under a new ASR program initiated with 2 financial institutions in April. An initial delivery of 23.5 million shares was made under this program, with the final number of shares delivered and average price per share to be determined at the conclusion of the program based on the volume weighted average purchase price of Apple stock over the program period, which will conclude in fiscal '14. In addition to the new ASR, we executed $4 billion of open market share repurchases, resulting in the retirement of 9 million additional shares.
Our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $3.05 per common share payable on August 15, 2013, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 12, 2013.
Now as we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $34 billion and $37 billion compared to $36 billion in the year-ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 36% and 37%, reflecting approximately $90 million related to stock-based compensation expense.

We expect OI&E to be about $200 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.5%.
In closing, we're pleased with our record June quarter iPhone sales, the strong growth in revenue from iTunes software and services, and the continued enhancement and popularity of our tremendously vibrant ecosystem.

The inventory on the balance sheet was really up for 2 reasons. First, we've got more stores this year than we had last, so our finished good inventory was a part of the inventory increase. And then our components inventory was up as well.",61

From an iPad point of view, or iPad and iPhone, we reduced inventory and reduced it fairly significantly. iPad was down over 700,000 units from the beginning of the quarter and iPhone was down over 600,000. As you know from working with us over several quarters, we typically don't like to have any more inventory than we need. And so if we can find a way to reduce, we do so. And we've done that in both of these cases. We also had slight decreases in the Macintosh area and on iPods.",95

In addition to this, we have opportunities in distribution, from carrier relationships to expanding our retail stores, expanding our online store and continuing to expand the indirect channel. And we also have a market expansion opportunity. Peter mentioned enterprise in his comments and the share positions that we have there, over 60% in both iPad and iPhone. And I think we're at the very front end of that. And so, I think, we have lots of growth opportunities. I don't subscribe to the common view that the sort of higher end, if you will, of the smartphone market is -- has hit its peak. I don't believe that. But we'll see, and we'll report our results as we go along.",156

And then on the iPad side of the equation, looking at the sell-through decline this quarter, obviously x the channel inventory dynamics, should we think of this as more of a pause within your customer base ahead of your next refresh, as we've seen in the past? Or is there a broader industry dynamic at play within tablets that could contribute to that?",65
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q3 2013 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2013",2013-07-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3270.0,486759.0,22484776.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,14,"For us, if you look year-over-year, we had a 2.4-million-unit decline. But 80% of that, or 1.9 million units, were just due to changes in channel inventory. As I think Peter referenced earlier, we reduced by over 700,000 in the current quarter, and the year-ago quarter had an increase of 1.2 million. And so the underlying sell-through declined by just 3%. If you look at the situation that we're in, in the year-ago quarter, we had just announced the third-generation iPad, which was our first iPad with a Retina display. We had announced in March, and so that was our first full quarter. And so from what Peter and I expected 90 days ago, we hit within the midpoint of the range that we expected to hit in on iPad unit sales. And so it was not a surprise to us. In terms of how other people are doing, I don't know. What I can tell you is the most recent data I've gotten, which actually just came out, I believe, this morning, is that the iPad web share data shows that, through the quarter, we accelerated further and are now -- iPad accounts for 84% of the web traffic from tablets, which is absolutely incredible. And so if there are lots of other tablets selling, I don't know what they're being used for, because that's a pretty basic function is web browsing. We feel really good about where we are. We had, as Peter had mentioned earlier, we had an incredible quarter in U.S. education, setting a new record for iPad. We're really happy to be selected for the first phase of the 660,000-unit rollout at L.A. Unified and a really bold move that they're making to change teaching and learning. And we had double-digit unit growth in China for iPad, in Japan, in Canada, in Latin America, in Russia, in the Middle East and in India. And so we're really happy with what we saw.",327

I think the last quarter, you had about a 90-basis-point onetime impact from the China warranty accrual. So if we adjust for that, gross margins were down about 150 basis points sequentially. And the mix of products was relatively similar to last quarter. Given that you're also riding the experience curve in these products, I was surprised, given the mix, that gross margins were as down as much sequentially as they were. Can you provide a bridge on a sequential basis on what happened with gross margins?",101

First of all let me say, we're very pleased with gross margin in the quarter at 36.9%. It was at the -- really the high end of the range that we provided of 36% to 37%. And the sequential decline was not a surprise to us. We understood the warranty effects in March. And as I said on last quarter's call, we expected our margins to be down sequentially, primarily for 2 reasons. The first is a lower sequential revenue, so we lost leverage going from March to June, and we expected a different product mix. And as you can see, we reported very near the top end of it and feel good.",114

But Peter, the mix ultimately was not that different. I think iPhones were 52.5%. Last quarter, they were 51.5%. So it actually seems like your mix was perhaps better than you had anticipated.

The second one I was wondering whether you could comment on was just iPhone ASPs. They were down about 5% sequentially. They were down about 10% over the last 2 quarters. I presume that's principally due to a higher mix of 4s and 4Ss. But I was wondering if you could comment on what's driving that change in ASP, and whether it's more pronounced in certain geographies versus others.",70

As we anticipated, iPhone 4 sales accelerated as we offered more affordable pricing in emerging and other markets, so that on a year-over-year basis. And then sequentially, it was down about $32. And again, that was driven by mix as well, in part iPhone 4. Tim, do you want to make comments about what we may have seen in the regions?",89

From an iPhone point of view, Toni, with the moves that we made on 4 and with iPhone 5 continuing to be the most popular model, we saw very strong sales in several of the emerging markets, our prepaid markets. India was up over 400%. Turkey and Poland were both up over 60%. The Philippines were up about 140%. And these were -- in addition, we saw very strong iPhone sales in several of the developed markets. For example, the U.S. was up over 50%; Japan, up over 60%; the U.K., about 50%. And so we had several regions where iPhone growth actually accelerated from the previous quarter, which is an unusual pattern for us. We were very, very happy with this.",124

If you look at sell-through, as we had mentioned earlier, with the inventory changes, it's important to do that. And so our sell-through in China was only down 4% from the year-ago quarter when you normalize for channel inventory. Hong Kong was actually down more significantly than that. Mainland China was actually up year-over-year. It was up 5%. But that is a lower growth rate than we have been seeing. And I attribute it to many things, including the economy there clearly doesn't help us or -- nor others. In Hong Kong, Hong Kong is an international shopping haven, as you know, for not only tourists, but also some resellers. And we saw a more dramatic downturn there, and it's not totally clear exactly why that occurred. But it was down on a sell-through basis by about 20%, and so that weighed Greater China down, as you can see on your data sheet.",175

So what you've seen is rumor-oriented. There are a number of channels that do trade-in programs now, not only in the U.S., but in different regions. And the reason that it's so attractive around iPhones is that the residual value of an iPhone stays so high and there's so much demand for it, and so that makes the trade-in programs more lucrative to -- or a win-win from many points of view. But we haven't announced anything that we're about...",90

If you combine the results that we have in Greater China, our revenues there were $4.9 billion for the quarter. And so that's about 14% of the company, which is very significant. And a few years ago, that was in the hundreds of millions. And so we've grown our business there significantly. We have a very strong market there. And in the last 12 months, we've done $27 billion on a trailing basis. And so it's a huge, huge business for us. Under the -- underlying the results are, if you look at iPad, sell-through in Greater China was up 8%, but sell-through in Mainland China was up 37%. And so iPad's doing remarkably well. The latest share numbers we've seen on -- for iPad for the tablet market is over 50%. And year-to-date, iPad units are up 48% year-over-year, and so there being great growth there. From an ecosystem point of view, we continue to attract a lot of developers from China. We now have about 0.5 million developers in China that are working on iOS apps, and that's up almost 70% year-over-year. And so I think that's fantastic not only for China, but for outside of China, as many offer their apps through -- in different stores around the world. We're obviously paying developers quite a bit, and so that's furthering the advancement of the ecosystem of developers. We're continuing to invest in distribution. We're going to double the number of retail stores there over the next 2 years. And we're continuing to lift iPhone point of sales and iPad sales, both of which are currently lower than where we would like them or need them to be. But we're doing that very cautiously because we want to do it with great quality. And so I continue to believe that in the arc of time here, China is a huge opportunity for Apple. And I don't get discouraged over a 90-day kind of cycle that can have economic factors and other things in it.",346

And we did that on a wider-spread basis, offered the more affordable pricing on a wider-scale basis this quarter, and continue to be very happy with what we saw.

The press I've seen on Russia probably needs some color. The articles I've seen suggested that we are not selling iPhone through carrier-owned stores. If that's the one that you're referencing, if you look at the Russian market, over 80% of smartphones are sold in retail there, outside of carrier-owned stores. And we sell through a number of national chains there. And in fact, our activations in Russia for iPhone were -- set a record last quarter. It was our highest quarter in Russia ever. And so we're really happy with how we're doing there. We do continue to sell through some carrier-owned stores as well. But obviously, the contribution is much less than the retail organizations and so forth. And so I think that's probably not well understood there.

In terms of where we see pricing headed, and this would have been factored into the gross margin guidance that Peter gave earlier, despite the very, very weak PC market, DRAM pricing has actually increased, and we see continued upward pressure in this area. NAND pricing is fairly stable and is following seasonal trends, as we would expect. Both LCDs and HDDs have -- the prices have fallen, and we would expect further reductions in these areas. And if you look at other commodities, they appear to be in a supply-demand balance. And so we would expect the pricing to decline on these at sort of historical levels.",116

And then Tim, kind of a philosophical question. But whenever you talk about what's important to the company, it always comes back to great products, better, being more important than more. Wall Street's kind of in the more business. So I just wonder, kind of talk about your philosophy and if you can come up with a couple really great products, maybe they provide enough growth, maybe they don't. But you don't seem as focused on kind of financial metrics and growth projections as a lot of companies are. Maybe tie that a little bit into your functional organization.

The way I think about it is, we're here to make great products. And we think that if we focus on that and do that really, really well, that the financial metrics will also come.

Tim, I'm going to start with you, if I can. To Bill's earlier question, Bill Shope's, on you don't think the high end is saturated, and yet ASPs have come down quite a bit on iPhones. I was wondering if you could speak philosophically. Is the current mix what we should be thinking about for iPhones? And more specifically, would you anticipate that ASPs would continue to trend lower in iPhones or stay where they are, at least directionally?",83
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q3 2013 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2013",2013-07-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3270.0,486759.0,22484815.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,53,"Keith, in terms of -- we don't project ASPs. We do give guidance. So we have an assumption on the ASP for the current quarter in our guidance, obviously, to come up with the numbers that Peter talked about earlier. If you look underneath the iPhone numbers as I think Peter alluded to earlier, we saw significant growth, clearly, in the lower price point year-over-year, which for us is iPhone 4. It's still a great product. And that was one of the things, and the iPhone 5 doing well, that allowed us to significantly beat what I think was probably the vast majority of expectations out there for iPhone sales. And so obviously, if we do a lot better at the low end, and we sell more of those and the mix changed, it has changed across the last year. If you look at 3GS last year, which was in a comparable position as our entry product, we're selling a lot more 4s than 3GSs. I think we both understand the market much better and have our fingers on the pulse of distribution in different countries and so forth this year. And I'm sure that we'll get better and better at that over time. And how that will change mix, I don't know. Typically for us, a product has the highest mix during its initial few months of sales. And so you'd have a natural kind of seasonal decline over time of the product cycle. That generally happens on iPhone. It generally happens on iPad. And we've seen it happen on the Mac over many years. And so I don't see anything that fundamentally would change that. But again, we're going to look at this thing quarter-by-quarter and tell you how we look at the quarter and give you guidance for it as we go.",305

So you've got the ending, basic and diluted. But let me give you a couple of points that I think could be helpful for you. During the June quarter, we concluded the first $4 billion -- I'm sorry, $2 billion ASR program that we started in December. And then we -- so we got the final shares in on those. And we did our second ASR program of $12 billion. That started at the end of April, and we received 23.5 million shares in initially on that. And as I went through in my prepared remarks, at some point during fiscal '14, that program will close and we'll get the final number of shares. We also bought back $4 billion of stock in the open market during the June quarter and received about 9 million shares. So the impact of those in the June quarter lowered our diluted share count in the quarter by about 22.9 million shares. And as you look forward into the September quarter, before any further buybacks or any issuance to employees, we would expect to see an additional approximate 11 million share benefit from the things that occurred during the June quarter.",211

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you very much for joining us. We're eager to share with you the results of the final quarter of Apple's fiscal 2013. We had a strong finish to an amazing year, and Peter will provide details about the September quarter shortly. But first, I'm happy to tell you that Apple's business is stronger than ever. We're in the unique position of having world-class hardware, software and service skills under one roof, which enables us to provide an unparalleled user experience to hundreds of millions of customers. And working with our vibrant developer community, we've built a large and thriving ecosystem.
We're winning with our products in all the ways that are most important to us: in customer satisfaction, in product usage and in customer loyalty. Our relentless focus on providing innovation that enhances our customers' lives is evident in the extraordinary list of products that we've launched in just the last couple of months. From the colorful iPhone 5c and forward-thinking iPhone 5s, to the powerful new iMac, MacBook Pro and Mac Pro, to the stunning iPad mini with Retina display and the dramatically thinner, lighter and more powerful iPad Air. 
Thanks to a deep collaboration between our design and engineering teams, we've also launched iOS 7 with a stunning new redesign, powerful new features and a great new service called iTunes Radio. We introduced OS X Mavericks, bringing new core technologies for breakthrough power efficiency and performance to our Mac, and we introduced next-generation iLife and iWork apps for IOS and OS X. And we're making all of this incredible software free, because we want our customers to have access to the greatest new features. All of these are products that only Apple could have delivered, and most companies would be proud to just have one of them.
Looking back, we're very pleased with Apple's many accomplishments during fiscal 2013. Our customers had an incredible response to our product lineup, buying 150 million iPhones, 71 million iPads and 16 million Macs across the fiscal year. We expanded the breadth and depth of our ecosystem, and we generated over $16 billion in revenue from iTunes software and services. We also welcomed almost 400 million visitors to our retail stores and opened or remodeled 49 new stores. And for the second year in a row, we produced over $50 million in revenue per store. We generated record total company revenue of $171 billion, earnings of $37 billion and operating cash flow of $54 million. We paid over $8 billion in capital expenditures to bolster our supply chain, expand our infrastructure and increase our retail footprint. We also completed 15 strategic acquisitions. That's an average of 1 acquisition every 3 to 4 weeks. We more than doubled the size of our capital return program to $100 billion, including the largest share repurchase authorization in history, and we've become one of the largest dividend payers in the world. In fact, we've returned over $36 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the last 5 quarters alone. We remain firmly committed to our objective of delivering attractive returns to shareholders through both our business performance and return on capital. We review our capital program regularly, and our board is engaged in the discussion of capital allocation on an ongoing basis. We have solicited feedback on our capital return program from shareholders in the past. We've greatly appreciated their suggestions, and we will actively seek their input again this year. As we have in the past, the board and the management team will consider a wide range of issues and be thoughtful and deliberate and we will announce any changes to our current program in the first part of the new calendar year. 
We're off to a great start in fiscal year '14. We continue to be very confident in Apple's future, and we see significant opportunities ahead of us in both current product categories and new ones.
We're participating in large and growing markets. Today, smartphone penetration in the global handset market is only a little over 50%. The smartphone category is expected to grow significantly the next few years from about 1 billion units per year this year to over 1.7 billion in 2017. And the tablet market is growing at an even faster rate, from about 225 million units this year to over 400 million in 2017. We're continuing to invest in R&D and distribution. We're expanding our geographic coverage, and we are building upon a phenomenal but still very young retail store presence. We're also proud to be a force for good in the world beyond our product. Whether it's improving working conditions or the environment, standing up for human rights, helping eliminate AIDS or reinventing education, Apple is making substantial contributions to society. I'd like to thank all of our customers and our long-term shareholders for their loyalty, and I'd also like to thank Apple's many talented employees who have worked tirelessly to bring us this far, and who are passionately focused on making great products that enrich people's lives. I'd now turn the call over to Peter to discuss the details of the most recent quarter. Peter?",867
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2013",2013-10-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3642.0,535195.0,24518096.0,Presenter Speech,Peter Oppenheimer,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Tim. We're pleased to report the results of the final quarter of Apple's fiscal year '13, with record fourth quarter iPhone sales, driving our highest September quarter revenue ever. Revenue for the quarter was $37.5 billion, up $1.5 billion, or 4% from the year-ago quarter, and slightly above the high end of our guidance range. Gross margin was 37%, at the high end of our guidance range, and operating margin was $10 billion, representing 26.8% of revenue. Net income was $7.5 billion, translating to diluted earnings per share of $8.26.
As for the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with iPhone. We sold 33.8 million iPhones compared to 26.9 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 6.9 million, or 26%, and a new September quarter record. iPhone sales were ahead of our expectations and grew strongly year-over-year in each of our geographic segments. We were particularly pleased with growth in a number of developing markets, with unit sales up sharply year-over-year in Latin America, the Middle East, Russia and India. We were also very happy to add NTT DOCOMO to our carrier lineup in Japan, a country where demand for iPhone has been especially strong. iPhone sales remain very robust in the U.S. with comScore estimating that Apple was the leading smartphone manufacturer, with a 40.7% smartphone subscriber share for the 3 months ending in August. And among North American customers polled by ChangeWave late last month who plan to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 63% indicated they plan to purchase an iPhone. We exited the quarter with about 14.3 million total iPhones in channel inventory, which represented a sequential increase of 3.3 million from the June quarter and placed us at the low end of our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory on a look-forward basis.
Customers are loving their iPhones. Based on the most recently published research, ChangeWave measured a 96% customer satisfaction rate among iPhone users, and Kantar measured a 92% customer loyalty rate, significantly higher than the competition. And we believe that a great customer experience translates to much higher usage. In fact, Experian reported that iPhone users spend an average of 53% more time each day on their phones than Android phone users. iPhone continues to be a key productivity tool for organizations around the world, aided by apps from the App Store, as well as those custom-built for internal use. In fact, nearly 35,000 companies representing millions of employees worldwide are building custom apps that address specific workflow improvements for their iPhone and iPad users. In the U.S., over 14,000 employees of Johnson Controls are using iPhones for work. The company has created in-house apps that have enhanced field technician service delivery and customer communications. And China's AVIC International, a unit of Aviation Industry Corporation of China, has equipped 27,00 employees with iPhones to access internally developed apps for office administrative documentation, approval processes and key business intelligence systems.
Turning to iPad, we sold 14.1 million iPads during the quarter compared to 14 million in the year-ago quarter. iPad sales exceeded our expectations in the September quarter as we approached our new product introductions. We experienced robust year-over-year sales growth in Japan, Russia, the Middle East, and we were pleased with strong back-to-school demand for iPad in the U.S. and Canada. iPad sell-through was roughly equal to sell-in, so we exited the quarter with about 4.1 million units of iPad channel inventory, within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks on a look-back basis. Interest in iPad remains incredibly strong.
In an August survey by ChangeWave of consumers who intend to purchase tablets within 90 days, 55% indicated they plan to purchase iPads, more than 4x the rate of the next most popular alternative. And of those who already own iPads, the survey measured a 99% customer satisfaction rate. The momentum of iOS devices in enterprise also remains incredibly strong. In its latest mobility index report, Good Technology indicated that the iOS platform accounted for 95% of enterprise mobile app activations and 72% of all mobile device activations in the September quarter, while iPad accounted for 90% of total tablet activations. 
Companies around the world are using iPads with custom apps to reinvent their legacy business processes, improving efficiencies across organizations and job functions. For example, direct store delivery reps at Dr Pepper Snapple Group uses iPads to facilitate communication and streamline the product delivery process. East Japan Railway personnel use iPad minis to stay informed about schedule changes and access conductor manuals. And Swedish manufacturer, SKF, uses a custom iPad app to calculate the life of their ball bearing products, saving 10 to 15 minutes per calculation for every engineer several times per day.
Schools around the world continue to adopt iPad to transform teaching and learning in the classroom. In the U.K., the number of iPads sold to K-12 schools has more than doubled year-over-year. And in Latin America, over 70,000 iPads are being used by Sistema UNO students across 800 schools to improve their learning experience. Here in the U.S., school districts continue to roll out large iPad initiatives to students. The Coachella Valley School District in California is currently distributing over 19,000 iPads to its entire student body. And in South Carolina, every one of the Horry [ph] County school districts' 10,000 middle school students will receive an iPad this year.
These broad deployments are, in part, driven by the great educational content available on iPad, and we're pleased to report that iBooks textbooks are now available across the U.S., U.K. and Australian national high school curricula. Last week, we were thrilled to introduce new iPads featuring the A7 chip with 64-bit desktop-class architecture, ultrafast wireless and expanded LTE connectivity. The new iPad Air features a beautiful Retina display and an elegant unibody design that is 20% thinner and 28% lighter than the fourth generation iPad. And the iPad mini with Retina display packs all the pixels of the iPad Air into its stunning 7.9-inch display and runs over 475,000 iPad apps available from the App Store. 
Turning to Mac. Sales of 4.6 million Macs were above our expectations, which is a 7% decline from the year-ago quarter. IDC estimates the global personal computer market contracted by 10% during the September quarter, indicating that Macs continue to gain share, just as they have for 29 of the last 30 quarters. We were especially pleased with strong year-over-year growth in sales of MacBook Air, which we updated in June. And in late September, we updated iMac with fourth generation Intel Quad Core processors, new graphics, next-generation WiFi and faster PCIe flash storage options. Last week, we launched new versions of MacBook Pro with Retina display, featuring fourth generation Intel Core processors, faster graphics, longer battery life and a more affordable price.
Also last week, we launched Mavericks, the 10th major release of OS X, with more than 200 new features. Mavericks brings iBooks and Maps to the Mac, includes a new version of Safari, enhances multi-display support, introduces Finder Tabs and Tags and delivers core technologies for breakthrough power efficiency and performance and is now free. We ended the quarter with Mac channel inventory that was just below our 4- to 5-week target range.
We continue to be very pleased with the growth of iTunes software and services and the strength of the Apple ecosystem. Our iTunes Stores generated record billings of 4.4 billion in the September quarter, thanks to continuos strong growth in sales of apps. The quarter's iTunes billings translated to quarterly iTunes revenue of 2.4 billion, up 15% from the year-ago quarter. The strong iTunes sales, combined with other software and service revenue, resulted in total quarterly revenue of $4.3 billion from iTunes software and services, an increase of 22% year-over-year. Cumulative app downloads have reached 60 billion, and our app developers have now earned $13 billion from sales through the App Store, half of which they've earned in the last year.
We had a tremendously successful launch of iOS 7 last month, with hundreds of millions of downloads in the first few days alone, making it the fastest software upgrade ever. Last week, we reported that nearly 2/3 of iOS devices were already running iOS 7. That's significantly higher than the percentage of users running the latest versions of other mobile operating systems. This rapid transition to the latest version of iOS not only means that more customers are having the most advanced experience possible, but it also enables developers to offer their latest app innovations to hundreds of millions of users in a single software release. iOS offers something now for everyone with its great new design and features, such as Control Center, AirDrop and iTunes Radio. In fact, the number of unique listeners who have tried iTunes Radio is now 20 million and growing.
iOS 7 also include significant features that make iPhones and iPads more secure and easier to manage in corporate environments, offering new ways to configure and deploy devices at scale. New device management capabilities include controlled sharing of documents and attachments, App Store license management, wireless managed apps setup and streamlined mobile device management enrollment. And in terms of security, iOS 7 offers enterprise single sign-on, default third-party app data protection and per-app VPN to automatically connect storage, corporate apps to the network without the need for users to change complicated settings.
I'd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores. Revenue for the quarter was $4.5 billion, up 6% from the year-ago quarter. The stores produced very strong iPhone sales with unit growth of 36% per store per week compared to the September quarter last year. We completed the remodels of 2 stores and opened 8 new stores during the quarter, ending with a total of 416 stores, including 162 outside the United States. We are projecting a total of approximately 30 new store openings in fiscal year '14, about 2/3 of which will be outside the U.S. We also plan to remodel about 20 stores over the course of fiscal year '14. With an average of 411 stores open in the September quarter, average revenue per store was $10.9 million compared to $11.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Retail segment income was $709 million. We hosted 99 million visitors to stores during the quarter, which translates to 18,500 visitors per store per week. Operating expenses were $3.8 billion and included $467 million of stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $113 million, and the tax rate for the quarter was 25.9%.
And turning to our cash, we ended the quarter with $146.8 billion in cash plus short-term and long-term marketable securities, a sequential increase of $100 million from the June quarter. Our domestic cash was $35.5 billion at the end of the September quarter, a sequential decline of $5.2 billion, largely attributable to our share repurchase activity. $111.3 billion, or 76% of our total cash was offshore at the end of the September quarter, and cash flow from operations was $9.9 billion. We paid $2.8 billion in dividends in the quarter, and we executed an additional $5 billion in repurchases of 10.4 million shares of Apple stock during the quarter. This brings us to a cumulative total of $36 billion in payments for dividends and share repurchases over the last 5 quarters, of which share buybacks were $23 billion. This has resulted in cumulative retirement of almost 47 million shares and represents 5% of the total shares outstanding prior to the launch of our repurchase program. More than 44 million of these shares have been retired in the past 2 quarters alone.
Finally, given that our capital return program must be funded from domestic cash and, as a result of our payments to date, the cash that we can invest domestically and return to shareholders to stop accumulating. In fact, we have returned to shareholders, or invested essentially all of the increase in available net cash generated since the beginning of our capital return program in 2012. Our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $3.05 per common share payable on November 14, 2013, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 11, 2013.
Now as we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to in the beginning of the call. First, I want to explain a bit about revenue deferrals. We believe that our software and services play a tremendous role in delivering the overall experience that our customers have come to know and love. Over the last few years, we have added significantly to the offerings that we provide our customers at no incremental charge, from operating system upgrade rights to non-software services such as Siri and iCloud. The iLife and iWork apps have become as essential to the user experience as mail, messages and calendar, so we're now making iPhoto, iMovie, Pages, Numbers and Keynote available as free downloads to customers who've purchased new iOS devices. And we're also making Mavericks and future OS X upgrades, as well as iLife and iWork, free to our Mac customers. As a result of these additional rights and features, we are deferring a greater portion of the sale of each iOS device and Macs sold. We anticipate that the additional deferral per device sold, coupled with our sequentially greater unit volume expectation in the December quarter, will result in about a $900-million sequential increase in the net amount of revenue deferred for software upgrade rights and non-software services. In total, we expect revenue to be between $55 billion and $58 billion compared to $54.5 billion in the year-ago quarter. We expect gross margins to be between 36.5% and 37.5%, reflecting approximately $105 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be between $4.4 billion and $4.5 billion, including about $585 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OI&E to be about $200 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.25%.
In closing, we're very pleased with the results of the final quarter of our fiscal year '13. We enter fiscal year '14 with an incredible lineup of products, including our amazing new iPhones and iPads. We remain committed to delivering great innovative products and services that delight our customers to enhance their lives, and we are very confident in our new product pipeline. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.",2421

We expect, as I said in my prepared remarks, our gross margins to be between 36.5% and 37.5%, so essentially in line with the September quarter. We're pleased to be guiding gross margin about flat sequentially, given all the new products that we have launched in the last few weeks. During the quarter, we expect gross margin to benefit from the leverage on the substantial sequential increase in revenue. Offsetting these benefits, we see a few factors, including the higher deferred revenue relating to the software that I talked about in my prepared remarks. And as I said, we expect the sequential increase in our deferral, which is not only revenue but affects margins as well to be $900 million; second, a richer mix of new iPads with higher cost structures and lower pricing; third, FX headwinds primarily from the yen; and fourth, the new lower priced MacBook Pro and iMac, which have higher cost structures than their predecessors. So those are 4 things that I would point out, Katy.",171

Tim, the press and even some of your competitors are quite complimentary of the innovation in iPhone 5s, but it seems like investors are looking or glancing over the 64-bit ARM processor, the fingerprint sensors, the M7 processor, and part of this is that they're not exactly sure what those technologies enable, i.e. why do you need a 64-bit ARM processor in a phone? So just hoping you could enlighten us a little bit on that question.",80

And so we have the first 64-bit smartphone, as you mentioned, and this is our first use of the fingerprint sensor. And if you've used it so far, you know that it's pretty profound to both use it from a security point of view and use it also to purchase apps or music or movies, et cetera. And so both of these, I think, are -- the most important person here, obviously, is what our customers think. And these new innovations on the 5s and the 5c combined led us to have our best iPhone launch ever, with -- selling about 9 million units through the weekend. So it was a -- we're off to a great start.",137

Now that you've had the device out there for a while, a few weeks, what type of response are you seeing from the more cost-sensitive regions? And can you remind us of some of the things you are doing to make the products increasingly affordable for the emerging regions in particular?",84

If you look at what we've done with our iPhone line, we're selling the iPhone 4S as our entry offer. We're selling the iPhone 5c as sort of a mid-tier offer and then of course, the iPhone 5s. And our goal is to, overall, have growth for total iPhone. But also within that, we want to have each of those categories grow as compared to the -- what we were doing previously. And so if you take a -- if you look at the total offers that we're making in the low-end space and mid-tier and high-end, the sum of all the price points we offer there, we'd like to grow in each one of those, and we're really pleased that we did that. And so that's how we measure -- partly measure success. Of course, the most important thing for us is to make a great product. But we do need growth, and we're happy that we've seen that. I realize that some people were reading rumors about -- that the entry phone would be the 5c, but that was never our intent, obviously. Our entry iPhone is the iPhone 4S. And as you know, from comments that I made previously, we were selling the iPhone 4 in very good volumes. And as we begin to experiment in different regions at somewhat lower price points, we saw a fair amount of price elasticity. And so we're hoping and thinking that, that will continue with the 4s.",252

And then related to that somewhat, looking at the iPhone ASPs overall, last quarter, you reminded us that the iPhone ASP and mix tends to be at its highest levels in the first few months of a product cycle and then tends to trend downward throughout the product cycle.

I think this was also something you were explicit about in your April quarterly conference call, where you said that consumers and investors should expect new products, including new product categories in the second half of this year and first half of 2014. So can you reiterate that we should have that expectation? And when you talk about new product categories, I presume that since you made the statement in April, there have been none? I just want to make sure I understand the semantics of what you referred to as a new category.",105

But what I have said is that you'll see -- I've said that you would see some exciting new products from us in the fall of this year and across 2014. And I obviously stand by that, and you've seen a lot of things over the last couple of months. In terms of new product categories, specifically, if you look at the skills that Apple has from hardware, software and services and an incredible app ecosystem, these set of things are very, very unique. I think no one has a set of skills like this. And we obviously believe that we can use our skills in building other great products that are in categories that represent areas where we do not participate today. And so we're pretty confident about that.",158

Last quarter, you spoke vary ebulliently about elasticity that you experienced on the iPhone 4, and you had lowered the price in many emerging markets to about $400. And yet, when the new products came out, the 4S was actually at a notably higher price than the 4 had been the previous quarter, and the 5c was obviously in line with what we had seen before with the 4S. And the 5s was in line with the 5. So if anything, one of the common themes that came out of the last earnings call was a desire to embrace the elasticity of the iPhone. But as best I can tell, price points across the board seem to be a little bit higher than they were 3 months ago despite the significant success you had there. So I'm wondering how we should think about what lessons you learned from the 4 pricing changes, why you didn't choose to keep the 4, given that it was an extraordinarily strong seller as best we could tell last quarter and how you proceed -- how you expect to try and continue to address lower-priced segments in the smartphone market.",210

Toni, the $400 number, just to clarify, is your number, not mine. What we did with our lineup this time was the 4S is replacing the 4. And so if you look at the U.S. as an example, the 4S is now free. The 4 previously was free. When you translate that out of the U.S., it depends on the market as to what specifically is happening. As you know, currency changes and the strength of the dollar doesn't play in our favor in some geos from that perspective. But generally, we see the 4S as our entry iPhone offer that gives somebody the ability to access the entire ecosystem with a fantastic product. And we clearly understand that there is elasticity in that market, and we'll move accordingly.",131

Tim, congrats on being, I think, the only company in my sector that grew in China this quarter. I'd have to check that, but got to be one of them.

And how can you expand distribution?",71

Ben, we had a pretty good quarter in China with -- we obviously want to do better. But if you look at the quarter, we did grow by 6%. Underneath that, iPhone units were up 25% year-over-year despite significant constraints on iPhone 5s that affected the whole company. However, we were able to launch in our first round this time in China, and that was a big change in the result of our close work relationship with the carriers in China and the government. And so we feel really good about that. We were able to do that on the iPad as well, as we announced last week. For the full year, the Greater China region generated over $27 billion in sales for us, up 14% year-over-year. And so we have a reasonable-sized business there. In the year-ago quarter iPad launched, it launched late in China. And so that pressured the 6% down some, otherwise it would have been, I think, even a stronger quarter, given the strength of iPhone. And so we are continuing to invest in stores. We opened one additional store in Greater China in the last few weeks. We're investing in indirect distribution. Our point of sales are up by about 50% year-over-year on the iPhone, and we're continuing to go out to more cities. Initially, we were very focused on just the large cities. And so we're working on both coverage, on launching earlier and execution and in continuing to build on our retail practice there.",252

And I guess nothing to announce on more, but my second question is for Peter. There is some confusion around the revenue deferral, and I was just hoping you could clarify it for gross margins. The $900 million is about, I don't know -- I guess 160 basis points, if I have that right, on gross margins. How much of that is -- should we say is pressuring gross margin down in your guidance? I mean, do we take about -- what your gross margin guidance had been about half the difference there higher if it weren't for this revenue deferral? And then when do recoup the margin? How many quarters does it take to recoup? And how will that flow back to the model?",126

We have been deferring revenues for the sale of each iOS device and Mac, given that we have been providing updates to software. Given the announcements that we made last week and that I went through in my prepared remarks, we have actually increased those deferrals. iPhone and iPad, we're deferring between $15 and $25. That's up by as much as $5 per device. And Mac has gone from $20 to $40, so up an additional $20. On a sequential basis, given the increased deferral rates that we have as a result of increasing the software that we are providing to customers for free, coupled with our sequential unit increases, we will defer, we think, about $900 million more in revenue in the December quarter than we deferred in the September quarter. So you can calculate the impact to gross margin on that. We will also -- and that goes straight through to margin, as revenue and a dollar-for-dollar reduction in gross margin. We will then record that revenue that we've deferred for iOS devices across a 2-year period of time ratably; and for Macs, over a 4-year period of time. So, Ben, just to summarize, we have been deferring revenue on both iOS devices and Macs for a number of years, given the software that we have been giving away for free. We have increased those rates beginning in September for the iOS devices and in October, for the Macs, and it will come back into those products over 2 and 4 years as I said",259

And I'm not giving guidance beyond the December quarter, but just a couple of things to think about. We're benefiting this quarter, as I've talked about in answering Katy's question, from the benefits of leverage, given the very big sequential increase in revenue. Leverage cuts both ways. So presumably, that would go against us in the March quarter. However, we would expect to defer less for these software deferrals in the March quarter as well. And as I noted at the end of the Ben's question, we will endeavor to work very hard to get down cost curves as we have in the past. No change.",122

As I said many times, we're focused on usage and customer sat and loyalty and other things that are very important to us. We do believe that this has been -- or the announcement last week was our largest iPad announcement ever. And we're confident we're going to grow year-over-year. And if you look back, we had a very, very strong quarter a year-ago. We get off to a great start this weekend with iPad Air. And then later in the month, we'll begin shipping the new mini. We did feel that we wanted to reduce the price of the iPad mini, and so we did that and are now coming in at $299, which is an incredible value to get access to the whole of the ecosystem and so forth. And iPad Air is just an absolutely incredible product, the best iPad we've ever done. And so I think all of these are -- most of these products are going to do really well. I think it's going to be an iPad Christmas and -- but we'll see. We will report the numbers back to you in January, how we did. But we're pretty confident.",224

How are you thinking about it vis-à-vis some of the competition?",37

We saw iWork had become the best-selling productivity app on a mobile device. We wanted all of our customers to have access to our very latest software so they would have access to our best features, and so we decided to make the bold move of making it free. And from -- I know some other folks charge $199 or so for each of these, actually, for the OS and the productivity apps, but we really wanted to make it a part of the experience. And so we're making it free, and we're going back all the way to Snow Leopard on the OS side. And iWork is free for all new Macs. And so I think it's a very strong offer. I think it's just another reason that everyone should buy Mac, and we think it was a great decision to do so. But most importantly, we think it's great for customers.",189

And then I just had a question on education, which somewhat ties into this. And iWork and iLife, I think -- or some of these operating systems run through them. I'm curious, with the -- what your thoughts are with regard to Chromebooks, Google Apps. Any kind of foothold that we're seeing, with Google taking share in education? Because as we've seen, some of the price points for the devices are pretty low. But clearly, you guys are able to sell into education as well. So I'm kind of curious as to how you view the competition, and how you position your products, vis-a-vis some of the things that are fairly low priced?",114

We had our best education quarter ever. We went over $1 billion in revenues for the first time ever. We were up strongly year-over-year, up 8%. iPad was up 22% year-over-year, and the Mac was up 8%. And as you know, the PC market was down 10% in the aggregate and likely down even more in education. And so we feel like we're doing great on both fronts, both in the iPad space and in the Mac space for people wanting to buy Mac. And we do see Chromebooks in some places, but the vast majority of people are buying PC/Mac or an iPad. Our share of tablets in education is 94%. I mean, it's sort of unheard of. I've never seen the market share that high before. So we feel like we're doing really well here, and are great to be making -- feel great to be making a contribution to education.",158

There's been some thought that the fingerprint technology has been a little bit hard to manufacture, and you indicated that the Retina mini would be out later in November. So kind of curious if you're going to be able to meet the demand for the holidays with the mini that you would like to. And maybe some general supply comments and also comments on component costs.",76

In terms of supply, iPhone 5s ended the quarter with a very significant backlog. We are still -- we still have a significant backlog. However, our supply is building each week, and we're very confident about our ability to keep ramping. And so we rolled out 30 more countries with the iPhone 5s and 5c as of last Friday, and we'll roll out another 16 this week. And so we're right on where we would like to be in terms of achieving 100 countries by the end of the calendar year. In terms of the Retina or the iPad mini with a Retina display, we'll start shipping later in November. It's unclear whether we will have enough for the quarter or not. We know how many we will have, but you really don't know the demand until you start shipping. And so we'll see how that goes. But I think we'll do fairly well with iPad, as I had mentioned before. We feel like it's going to be a really great holiday season. On terms of component cost, both DRAM and NAND were up last quarter from the previous quarter. DRAM, we believe, will continue to be up in this quarter. We think NAND will be flat, and other commodities will fall sequentially.",217

And then, Peter, about a year ago, you indicated that the December quarter would benefit by about 200 basis points in gross margin due to a combination of mix shift towards phones and higher volume.

Is there some sort of message there in terms of you not having much broader coverage, in terms of incremental coverage? Or is there a much bigger incremental upgrade cycle from your installed base or both?",61
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2013",2013-10-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3642.0,535195.0,24518138.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,45,"I think the way -- the #1 thing to know on the channel inventory is that our range, as you know, for iPhone, is 4 to 6 weeks, and we were at the low end of our range. And so that to me is the most -- or that's the most important thing I look at, anyway, I should say. You can choose to look at the thing that's most important to you. In terms of changing from where it's been in the past, the things that you should consider are the -- China was in wave 1 this year, so that's -- there was a lot more point of sales there. We added DOCOMO in Japan, and so that's a large carrier to add. And what -- probably were not in the opening comments was that of the 14 million, 1.8 million of those were iPhones that were in transit and, therefore, not available to sale in the channel. And we always count those in channel inventory because they're in our sales line. And so those -- that's how I look at the iPhone inventory.",186

And then just as a follow-up, if I could. A year ago, you had a very ambitious multiproduct ramp in terms of new products coming out at the same time. You did have some impacts related to supply constraints. Just kind of following up on Steve's question, do you feel that 12 months later, fast forward to the future now, that you're in a much better shape to kind of avert or navigate some of these big supply constraints that seems like some problems on you last year? Or could we see a similar situation for the quarter?",99
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2013",2013-10-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3642.0,535195.0,24518140.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,47,"Well, as I mentioned, on the iPhone 5s, I feel like we're doing really well on supply. The demand is very robust. And so we are in backlog right now. But I feel confident about us continuing to ramp and do quite well for the quarter. On the iPad mini, we'll start shipping later this month, and it's very difficult to forecast exactly when supply and demand will balance there. And we'll also see about the iPad Air as we go out this week. I think we'll have a really good weekend, but it may be that not everyone can find one that wants one. I think -- versus last year, I think one key difference is we announced one of our key Macs, the iMac, but we didn't begin shipping it till the end of December. And so we went for more than 2 months with minimal iMac sales and therefore, from a Mac point of view, year-over-year last year, we had our only down quarter, down versus the market that is, in the last 30 quarters. And so I don't envision that happening this year. I feel really good about the way that the MacBook Pros had gotten off last week. They've gotten off to a huge start. I feel great about Mac growing year-over-year this quarter. I feel great about iPad growing year-over-year this quarter as well. And so -- and you can tell that from the strong guidance numbers that Peter gave earlier.",247

Sequentially, we're relatively flat, so I'll comment on a year-over-year basis. They were down 7% as you indicated, and this was primarily due to a significant increase in the sales of our entry SKUs, where we have made them more affordable, to attract more first-time smart buyers. We've also incurred some FX headwinds from the yen, the Australian dollar and a number of the emerging markets, which impacted us as well. I don't want to forecast ASPs for the December quarter. We'll report to you in January what they were. But the FX headwinds likely continue, given where exchange rates are today.",105

And so any kind of 5s that was in the channel was a transitionary kind of move, maybe perhaps in transit and so forth.

And I don't really see that changing. I think the big carriers have come up with some different -- or some carriers have come up with different sales programs that might appeal to someone who wants to upgrade their phone annually instead of every other year. I think those programs in general probably reduce the subsidy somewhat in the aggregate for people that take these up, but customers may view that, that's a fair exchange for getting to upgrade more often. So there's a customer proposition for it. Other than that, I think we have great relationships with the carriers, and I think they were, as we were, very happy with the iPhone roll out.",152
