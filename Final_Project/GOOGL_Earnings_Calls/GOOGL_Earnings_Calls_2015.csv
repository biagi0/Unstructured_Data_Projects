This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website later today.
Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward looking, including statements regarding Google's future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results.
Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this call, such as operating income and operating margin, are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation and, as applicable, other the special items. We have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Patrick.",305
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3391.0,752102.0,32964870.0,Presenter Speech,Patrick Pichette,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Ellen, and welcome to 2015, everyone. Before we get into the numbers, I'm going to give a brief overview of our performance this quarter as the data is actually quite noisy through the P&L.
So to start, let's say that we saw a continued strength in our core advertising business. This was really driven by a strong holiday and the mobile performance from our sites line. We saw great momentum in our programmatic business, highlighted by our mobile display and our ads platform products. 
But we also faced a few real challenges as well. On the revenue side, clearly, as you've heard out, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar resulted in a gross negative currency impact of $616 million just into Q4. But thanks to our hedging program, the net impact was actually attenuated with a net revenue impact of $468 million.
Also, on the other revenue line, not only did we see that negative currency impact really impact the Play growth, particularly in Japan, but also, while the Nexus 7 was very well received as a new phone, we had real issues and unable to secure sufficient inventory to meet the demand that we had forecasted. So for both these factors, in fact, we see lower other revenue growth this quarter.
On the expense side, we had a number of unusual charges to our operating expenses hit this quarter. I'll provide you more details in a few minutes as we go through the conversation. But together, these items added up to slightly over $300 million in expenses to our P&L. 
Lastly, if you go to the CapEx line, you'll note that we've made real estate purchases in Q4, which helped us relieve both pressure on our workspace for current employees, but also to accommodate our future growth. And this also resulted in a large sequential increase in our real estate capital expenditures this quarter. 
So now that you have the basics, why don't we dive into the details. Our gross total consolidated revenue grew 15% year-over-year to $18.1 billion, and it was up 10% quarter-over-quarter. Without currency fluctuations, our gross consolidated revenue growth would have, in fact, been 18% year-over-year. And despite all the FX pressure, our Google site revenue was up a healthy 18% year-over-year to $12.4 billion. It was up 10% quarter over quarter, in part driven by the strength in our mobile search.
Network revenue was up 6% year-over-year at $3.7 billion and was up 8% quarter-over-quarter. As a reminder, our network business includes really 2 types of businesses with different growth profiles. Our legacy AdSense business, particularly AdSense for Search, where we've continued to make policy changes for the benefit of our user experience but which has negatively impacted the growth in clicks specifically. Our cleanup efforts have resulted in fewer clicks but also higher CPCs, as I'll discuss in a minute. The other business in the network line are newer display and programmatic businesses, including AdMob, Ad Exchange, DoubleClick Bid Manager. And these continue to grow at a strong rate. 
Finally, Google's other revenue grew 19% year-over-year to $2 billion. It was up 6% quarter-over-quarter, driven by year-over-year growth in our Play Store but offset by the FX impact and the challenges in our hardware business I mentioned earlier.
Our global aggregate paid clicks were up 14% year-over-year and up 11% quarter-over-quarter. Aggregate CPCs were down 3% year-over-year and also down 3% quarter-over-quarter. And if we go on our monetization by property, the Google site paid clicks were up 25% year-over-year and up 18% quarter-over-quarter. With Google sites, CPCs were down 8% year-over-year and down 8% quarter-over-quarter. On the network side, network paid clicks were down 11% year-over-year and down 7% quarter-over-quarter. But our network CPCs were up year-over-year 6% and 10% quarter-over-quarter for the reasons I mentioned.
Our monetization metrics continue to be impacted by a number of factors. They include geographic mix, device mix, property mix, FX, as well as ongoing product and policy changes. 
Turning to geographic performance. If you go through our earnings slides, which you'll find on our Investor Relation website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenues by U.S., U.K. and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits of our hedging program. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.
So despite large currency headwinds, we saw solid performance from our core advertising business around the world. The U.S. revenue was up 14% year-over-year to $7.9 billion. The U.K. was up 10% year-over-year to $1.7 billion. And in fixed FX term, it actually grew to 11% year-over-year. Non-U.S. revenue, excluding the U.K., was up 18% year-over-year to $8.6 billion, accounting for 47% of total revenue. And in fixed FX terms, in fact, the rest of the world grew at a healthy 24% year-over-year. 
So let me turn now to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.6 billion or 22% of advertising revenue. Our non-GAAP other cost of revenue was $3.1 billion in Q4, which excludes SBC as well. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $5.8 billion, again, excluding stock-based compensation. And as a result, our non-GAAP operating profit was $5.6 billion and non-GAAP operating margins were 31% in Q4.
As I mentioned at the beginning, we had a number of unusual operating expenses that impacted us this quarter. We typically review our estimates, accounting policies and balance sheet on an ongoing basis and make adjustments when we think and see it necessary. Normally, I wouldn't call out these. But because they totaled slightly over $300 million this quarter, I wanted to give you some sense of these adjustments, although I won't be providing a lot of detailed breakout.
So first, we took approximately half that amount in compensation charges resulting from the onetime payment and reclassification between SBC and bonus expense. The other half came from a review of our real estate portfolio, where we decided to take a write-down on a small number of assets and also onetime payment to buy out a number of leases in a couple of markets when we face acute space pressure.
Headcount was up but just over 2,000 in Q4. In total, we ended the quarter with approximately 53,600 full-time employees. 
You'll notice also that our effective tax rate was 16%, again, another discrepancy for Q4, which was really primarily impacted by the extension of the R&D tax credits for 2014 with the entire credit being taken in Q4, as well as continued mixed shift from earnings between our domestic and international subsidiaries.
Let me now turn to cash management. Other income and expenses was $128 million. Interest income and realized gains on investments offset the continued impact of expenses from our FX hedging programs. For more detail on OI&E, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website.
We are pleased with our strong operating cash flow at $6.4 billion. Our CapEx for the quarter was $3.6 billion. And this quarter, most of the CapEx was spent on -- related to facilities, production equipment and data center construction, in that order. So as I mentioned a few minutes ago, we have been opportunistic about acquiring space in real estate where we need to relieve pressure and accommodate for future growth. To that end, our facilities expenditure included just over $900 million of real estate investments during the quarter, of which $585 million was related to the acquisition of our property in Redwood City that we disclosed in our 10-Q for the third quarter.
Our free cash flow was $2.8 billion. And I also want to note that we completed in Q4 the sale of Motorola Mobile to Lenovo in October 29. We recognized a gain on disposition of $740 million net of tax, which is included in our net income from discontinued operations. 
So there you have it. Despite a noisy quarter from a P&L perspective, we can say that we had strong results in our core business, as evidenced by our 18% fixed FX growth this quarter and are well positioned for the year ahead in the long-term. 
As Larry says, although the vast majority of our resources and time continue to be invested in our core products, we also have an enthusiasm to invest in new promising ideas like self-driving cars or Loon. We use the same disciplined approach to these new areas that we use for investing in our earlier bets like Android or Chrome or Display. Our projects start with small, dedicated teams that are given clear milestones to hit before they can get further investments. 
In cases where we achieved success against our milestones, we expand our investments. And you saw this as an example earlier this week with our Fiber teams. We green-lighted 18 cities in 4 metropolitan areas in the U.S. out of the 34 cities and 9 metros that we had reviewed in 2014, and they're off to the races. In other cases, when the teams aren't able to hit hurdles but we think there's still a lot of promise, we might ask them to take a pause and take the time to reset their strategy, as we recently did in the case of Glass. And in those situations where project don't have the impact we had hoped for, we do take the tough calls. We make the decision to cancel them. And you've seen us do this time and time again. 
So before I turn it over to Omid, I'd like also to note that in many ways, 2014 was a year of significant investment growth, both in CapEx and OpEx at Google. From an investment perspective, we'll continue to seek a healthy balance between growth and discipline and the willingness to throttle back when we reach the limits of what we believe we can manageably absorb. 
So with that in mind, I'll take it over to Omid now to provide more specifics on the successful performance of our core and new businesses. Omid is joining us by phone from another location today. So I'll hop it over to you, Omid.",1681
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3391.0,752102.0,32964871.0,Presenter Speech,Omid Kordestani,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Patrick. Hi, everyone, Happy New Year and thanks for joining us today. This is Omid. It's my pleasure to join you from London tonight. I'm glad to be here to reflect on the last quarter and look ahead to 2015. 
2014 ended with healthy momentum, enabling us to achieve $66 billion in revenue for the year. In Q4, we launched Lollipop, our newest version of Android, refreshed our line of Nexus devices and introduced Inbox by Gmail, a new inbox that enables users to focus on the messages that matter most to them. Meanwhile, our sales teams worked diligently with our advertising partners to deliver a strong holiday season. 
Today, I'll do a quick walk-through of the business highlights from Q4. First, I'll give an overview of the different sectors of our ads business, performance and brand advertising and our advertising platforms. Then I'll cover progress in our emerging non-ad businesses.
Let's begin with the performance advertising. We continue to evolve the foundation of Google's advertising business to reflect the multiscreen, constantly connected world. Mobile is now a behavior, not a device, and it has a variety of unique characteristics. 
First, let's talk about local advertising. On mobile, consumers want to know about the stores and goods near them. We launched some exciting updates last quarter. In October, we announced local availability for Product Listing Ads and local storefront, products that give customers real-time information about goods that are in stock close to where they are. Major retailers like Macy's and REI took advantage of these local inventory ads during the holidays. Overall, we saw strong engagement and results from big-box retailers during the holiday season.
A second priority has been the creation of new measurement tools. We recently added estimated store visits to our Estimated Total Conversions measurement suite. Now advertisers can see a reliable estimate of the number of times a search ad click drives a store visit. During the holidays, ULTA Beauty reported that 12% of clicks on search ads led to a store visit with significant gains in ROI from the Adwords search marketing spend. These mobile-specific metrics help advertisers measure the full impact of their mobile marketing.
A third area of progress is apps. We have driven hundreds of millions of app downloads on Google Search, AdMob and YouTube, and this business continues to grow at a healthy clip. During the holiday season, Office Depot used Google Search ads to promote their Elf Yourself app that helps shoppers create videos of people reimagined as dancing elves. By using Google Search ads, they saw a 65% conversion rate. We have recently enabled users to more seamlessly navigate between apps and the web and find what they're looking for in apps more quickly.
In organic search, 15% of signed-in users' searches on Android now return deep links to apps. We also offer app deep linking in search ads. Booking.com uses Google Search ads to drive installs and reengagement via deep linking for their mobile app.
Last quarter, we continued to see great traction with our established mobile advertising products as well, particularly Google Shopping. Online growth remained strong, with Google Shopping traffic on mobile devices up nearly 100% compared to Q4 2013. For much of the holiday season, mobile shopping clicks exceeded those on desktop as users increasingly made purchase decisions on the go.
Now I would like to turn to YouTube, where we continue to deliver great results for brand advertisers. YouTube now has more than 1 billion users. Every day, people watch hundreds of millions of hours of video on YouTube, generating billions of views. Watch time is up 50% year-over-year. We continue to invest in our YouTube partners, and partner revenue has increased by more than 50% year-over-year. We're seeing great momentum in mobile advertising on YouTube. Mobile revenue on YouTube is up more than 100% year-over-year.
TrueView, where advertisers pay only if someone watches their ad, also continued to do very well. Walmart U.S.'s holiday performance is one of many success stories. During the week of Black Friday, they used YouTube's TrueView format to drive a 300% week-over-week increase in views of their channel and more than 28 million views on the week. This was a 600% increase in YouTube channel views over the same week in 2013. 
And while we're all anticipating a certain football game in Arizona this weekend, the action has already begun for its advertisers on YouTube. Nearly 70 ads or teasers related to the big game have been posted to YouTube this year, up 55% from the same time last year. People have been -- people have already watched them more than 44 million times, up 25% from last year, and for more than 70 million minutes on YouTube, nearly tripled the watch time compared to the same point last year.
On average, people watched each ad for more than 1.5 minutes. We continue to develop the tools that make digital work for brand marketers, their agencies and premium publishers.
There were 2 particular areas of focus on Q4 that I would like to highlight: programmatic and measurement. Let's start with programmatic. Automated ad buying has benefited performance-driven advertisers for years. We're now extremely well positioned as brand advertising shifts to programmatic as well.
We're seeing great traction overall from our advertising and agency partners. Today, all the top 10 global agencies use at least one product in our DoubleClick suite. Specific products within the DoubleClick suite have shown exceptional momentum. DoubleClick Bid Manager, our primary front end for programmatic buying, has doubled in volume over the past year. During the recent U.S. midterm election, programmatic represented nearly 1/3 of advertisers' Google Ad budgets. 
We're seeing that video, the ultimate brand medium, is starting to move to programmatic as well. After launching in June of 2014, Google Partner Select, our premium programmatic video marketplace, now has more than 50 publisher partners, including Hearst Television and Food Network and includes brands like BMW.
Next, we continue to invest in measurement tools that enable advertisers, agencies and publishers to better understand the results of their digital marketing. It starts with addressing the question of viewability. Nothing else matters if a human did not see our ad. This is a top question for the industry, and at Google, we're doing our part to address it. Since July, we've been rolling out viewability report across our ad platforms so that brands will know whether their video ads on digital channels were actually seen or not. We recently extended this Active View reporting to video ads.
Large advertisers are finding technology like this to be very useful. For example, Kellogg's use DoubleClick Digital Marketing to buy their inventory programmatically and increase their ad viewability by 70%.
Once the brand knows that their ads have been viewed, they need to determine if the right people saw those ads and if they made an impact. That's where our tools to measure Brand Lift come in. We have run more than 6,000 Brand Lift surveys to help determine brand recall and purchase intent. For example, Mondelez wanted to measure the effectiveness of a recent digital campaign for the launch of a gum brand. With Brand Lift, they found a 36% lift in brand awareness versus a control group and a 97% lift in ad recall versus a control group. Getting this type of feedback in real time is impossible with offline media. This sets digital apart. 
Let's move now to our emerging non-ads businesses. Google for Work had a great quarter. We started working with PwC to help them and the companies they advise use Google for Work to move their businesses to the cloud. Cloud Platform continues to make good progress. We hosted our second Google Cloud Platform Live event in November, where we announced several new products such as Google Container Engine. 
Our digital content businesses are strong. I'm excited about Google Play's development. Movies are now available in more than 102 countries, Music in 58 and Books in 65. It's growing internationally at unprecedented speed. 
In December, we partnered with Sony to digitally release The Interview. It has been publicly reported that the film generated over $50 million in its first weekend and that Google Play and YouTube drove the majority of those sales. We launched YouTube Music Key Beta, a monthly music subscription service that provides ad-free music, background play and offline viewing. This will also include a subscription to Google Play Music with more than 30 million songs, expert-curated playlist and more.
Our hardware efforts demonstrated momentum. Just in time for the holidays, we launched the Nexus 6, Nexus 9 and Nexus Player devices. Chromecast continues to be a hit. Just last week, we saw our 1 billionth tap of the Cast button. Chromecast usage per device has increased by 60% since launch due to a growing roster of new apps and features. According to NPD retail tracking service, in 2014, Chromecast was the #1 selling streaming media device in the U.S. Chromebooks are now available in 33 different markets and enjoying strong success in K-12 education market in the U.S.
I continue to be impressed by the work of our marketing teams that they've done around the world. The Year in Search has become an instant classic, and YouTube Rewind is fast becoming one. From the ""Android: Be Together. Not the Same."" campaign to Nest's ""First TV Ads"" and much more, our marketing team contributed to our success in the all-important Q4 through a wide variety of efforts.
There's the wrap for 2014, and we're excited for what lies ahead in 2015. In closing, I want to thank our great partners, customers and users. Without them, we wouldn't be successful. Thank you, all, so much. 
Now let's get back to Patrick for Q&A.",1634

I wanted to see if you're willing to talk about the nugget here in terms of what your gross billings currently may be, recognizing that you may be seeing gross and net revenue contribution depending on different products. And also, it looks like the U.K. revenue saw a modest bit of acceleration on an FX-neutral basis. I mean, granted comps were probably modestly easier. But anything you can call out that helped there?",98

So on both topics. On the U.K., we did see a good performance this quarter on the U.K. versus last quarter, and as you said, mentioned, 11% year-over-year. So the note of the U.K. is the core business there is doing well. If you go back to last -- the deceleration, we have -- it's a big portion. It's like 10% of our revenue. We -- over 10%. The -- you'll remember that in our mix of products that are in the U.K., clearly our core products are there. But also, AFS, like the network business, is actually prominent in U.K. as well as in the U.S., less so in the rest of the world. And so that has an issue on the mix. And then also, think of it as a promising item, which is there's areas of new products such as Play that are actually stronger in international than they would be in the U.K. or the U.S. So there lies some of the differences between the growth rates. But in many ways, a lot of opportunities there. So that's what's going on in the U.K. Quite pleased with the programs there in Q4. And then on the issue of Display, we haven't updated the numbers to the Street. And so we have to continue to kind of give you the updates that we do. And if we actually have a chance in the future, then we'll let you know when it's time to do so. So thanks for your questions, Stephen.",259

You hired 2,000 people this quarter versus 1,700 in the same quarter last year, which is a 22% increase. But Google management talks a lot about the opportunity in front of the business. If that's the case, why aren't you hiring more people and spending more in R&D? Can you tell us what are the specific constraints that you guys have or you pose in your sales that prevent you from hiring 3,000 people this quarter instead of 2,000? That's the first one. The second is the following. A few quarters ago, I seem to recall you saying that you did not manage the business for margins but you manage it for profit growth, yet your operating income is down year-on-year. And even if you add the $200 million, it is growing very slowly. You could see how investors would look at that and say, ""Well, how do you reconcile these things?"" How do you think investors should think about this trajectory of operating income growth?",172
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3391.0,752102.0,32964878.0,Answer,Patrick Pichette,,Executives,10,"Okay. So let's take them each in step. On the issue of hiring, you'll notice that relative to last quarter also, which is -- our third quarter is typically a big quarter because we get the influx of the hires we do at colleges and otherwise, we actually decelerated from the third quarter as well. What we are managing for is we just have a very high bar for hiring. If you can pass the bar, then we hire you. We also have capacity constraints on leadership. Like there's a natural kind of number that you can kind of absorb within the culture of Google. It's really important not to lose that culture and to have velocity, to have traction. So there's no sense bringing 5,000 people that we couldn't kind of bring into the teams and really make them perform. So what we manage on the hiring is we have our plans, and so we have a rate of targets, of hires per each of the pals in the areas in the company. And then from there, the next hurdle is really about can we find these people, and then finally, just making sure that we keep this kind of balance of bringing at a reasonable rate so that we can actually absorb them in the company without losing the velocity and the culture of the place. So it's actually a pretty complex puzzle, but we're managing it. It's never perfect, but we're managing it the best we can. So that's the first question. On the issue of margins, look, we have different -- if you think of the businesses in Google, we're looking for growth. We're looking for growth in revenue. We're looking for growth in operating profits, absolute dollars. And we're looking for great returns on investments. That's the puzzle we solve for. So you have an advertising business that may have higher margins, lower capital intensity in, say, another business, which may be Play, which has much lower margins, great prospect for growth with very large pools of revenue and margins available. And we'd go after them for sure. You have Fiber, right? And in the Access, which is a completely different kind of capital intensity. But again, the question is, does it promise -- or does it have a case for large dollars, operating profit delivery and high revenue and then a decent return on capital? That's how we manage it. And to kind of say, okay, well, we have what we have today. But if Play could grow it, just to take the case, 10x faster than it is doing right now, right, it would impact margin because on the weighted average basis, it would drag it down but we'd love it. We'd love to be able to grow to Play 10x faster than we are today. So that's how we think of the puzzle. We manage them each individually for their potential, their returns. We all look for these big margin pools and these big revenue pools, and then we just allocate our capital to make sure that it's balanced across these initiatives for maximum velocity. That's the way we think about it, Carlos. Thank you very much for your question.",538

Patrick, given the importance of Google's stock price as a motivator for existing employees, for recruitment of new employees, I think many investors out there wonder if we're getting closer to a point where it might be a wise use of resources to return capital to shareholders. Other large tech companies do it. Nearly all the media companies do. At what point would you -- at what point would the board of Google consider capital returns? And then second question is I was just wondering on the switch of the default browser on Mozilla from Google to Yahoo in the quarter and going forward. Is there any way you could quantify the impact of that? And investors are also wondering is it possible that could happen for your Safari agreement with Apple?",135

The last question is you've all heard the announcements about Mozilla. And so when we -- we don't comment on the details of any of our partnerships that we have. Having said that, we continue to do 2 things that really matter. One is our users continue to actually go in -- if they love Google, they'll continue to find Google, whichever platform, whichever browser. And that's really what we're focused on doing. And then the second piece is the way to win in this in the long term, right, is very simple. You just make wonderful products. And when you make wonderful products that are magical, people will find them. And so that's the strategy that we're using. And we just don't comment on any of our -- we've never commented on any of our deals, so we won't comment on Mozilla, either. And then for your first question, Anthony, I mean, again, I can't -- I just can reiterate the same message that I give on a regular basis, which is share price does matter. It matters to our board. It matters to all of us. We're all shareholders in the company. And we do review this issue on a regular basis. We reviewed it again responsibly with the Audit Committee, with the board. And I just have nothing to announce today. Thank you so much for your question.",246

Is there any sense you can give us on whether some of the pricing per ad unit is starting to close from the device mix? So even though you're getting more volumes from mobile, whether it be smartphone or tablet, we're starting to see any impact that pricing continues to move up versus desktop pricing we're seeing across your ad portfolio? I would love any commentary around that. And then second, Patrick, you called out the FX impact in the Q4. Any help you can give us on how we should be thinking about the FX impact going forward on either a gross or a net basis to the business as you see it versus spot today?",126

Thanks, Eric, for the question. The way we look at this, as I said, we look at mobile and -- as a behavior today, really, as a -- versus as a specific device. And people are using screens interchangeably simultaneously throughout the day. And we really think about the user and the context rather than a particular form factor or device. And similarly, in terms of the pricing model here. What we are focused on really building this ecosystem just the way desktop took a long time to develop and have the right ad formats that we took advantage that the platform had to offer, we're looking at this the same way. We are developing different kind of formats, working with marketers on mobile, estimated store visits, app install, app reengagement ads and cross-device conversions. And we really feel good about the traction we're having. And our sales team and advertiser agencies, partners are working with us, making rapid progress here. So unfortunately, Eric, I can't disclose any specific breakdowns, but I can just say that we are very focused on all aspects of this just as we evolve to desktop. We're doing the same in this world. On to you, Patrick.",203

On the issue of FX, I think that the most important point to think about in Q4 is, I mean, it was material. As I said, it was like, on a gross basis, over $600 million. You've all seen the deterioration of the euro, the GDP, the yen. I mean, it's -- versus the U.S. dollar. The one thing I would just note from our results in Q4, I mentioned this in the past, that our FX rates are set at Google a month in arrears. So in last week of November, we would have set our FX rates for December. So interestingly, the December rates -- we'll set January, and you've seen already in December a continued kind of nosedive in certain areas, especially the euro and the yen. So all I can say is for all the information we have right now, that's not going away. And I think that everybody should be considering it. On the flipside of that, I just want to kind of reinforce the fact that our FX hedging program continues to do exactly what it's supposed to do, which is in a low-volatility environment, we buy insurance. And in moments where we have such shocks like we're having right now, we did get a lot of benefit out of this hedging program. And just as a reminder, we hedge profits, right? We don't hedge revenue. It just happens that we've booked the profits to revenue because of the accounting rules. And so we see -- we've seen in Q4 approximately $150 million of hedge benefits, which is actually quite a substantial amount on the total $600 million. And we'll continue to have hedge benefits through the course of the year to a certain extent. So I think that from that perspective, right, real hit in December, additional, but in a good position from our hedge FX program. Thank you for those questions.",321

Patrick, towards the end of the prepared remarks, you said that Google will show a balance of growth and discipline and a willingness to throw a little back. Can you just elaborate on that comment? What do you mean when you say that? Are you referring to the pace of expense growth or throwing something back in terms of capital allocation? Just a little clarity on that one. And then, Omid, the question on app indexing. I think you guys said in November that logged-in searches have about 15% coverage in terms of app content. Where is that percentage today? And when do you guys think it'll be closer to 100%?",115
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3391.0,752102.0,32964889.0,Answer,Patrick Pichette,,Executives,21,"Ross, let me -- it's Patrick. Let me jump in on the first question. Then I'll let Omid answer the second. On the first one, all I wanted to highlight to our investors, shareholders and the community at large is, as I said, 2014 was a year of significant investment growth. I mean, we see real potential in so many areas that are exciting to us and where we see great momentum. That -- what I wanted to make sure is that our investors continue to understand that we will push for growth but in a disciplined matter. And if things don't materialize in the way that you don't hit your hurdles, you don't hit your timing, right, we are actually disciplined to make sure that we don't have expenses ahead of the curve and we continue to monitor it quite closely. So in that sense, if we see conditions change, it's really important that you have the confidence that when we manage these investments, we do it in a prudent manner, right, optimistic but with -- there's always a dose of circumspection to make sure that you get the best bang for your buck in these rollouts. And that's what I really want to kind of communicate and signal to the Street, which is it's a balance. It's always about a balance. But given our situation, given all of the results that we've had, I mean, 18% year-over-year growth in our sites, if you just look at the sites, which is the core of the business, growing 18% year-over-year despite all of the FX headwinds, right, it just tells you, look, this is a license to continue to invest smartly in the way we do. But I just want to kind of reaffirm to you that we do it in a smart way and in a disciplined manner. We're driving for to make sure we don't waste our shareholders' money. So with that, I'll turn it over to Omid to answer the first question, please.",336

So as I said in my opening remarks, that 15% of signed-in users' searches on Android now return deep links to apps. The way we are focused on this is that we have opened up app indexing to all Android developers so that their apps can appear in searches also linking directly to the right content in the app. And it really becomes the job between the developers trying to understand intent and how obviously our search works and determining the best results to provide including the deep links. We offer this deep linking in search ads as well. Booking.com use Google Search ads to drive installs and reengagement via deep linking for their mobile app, and we're seeing more and more adoption like display advertisers. So obviously, it's an area we're going to continue making progress on. We're very pleased through the traction we're having and how mobile monetization is performing. Thank you.",157

I'm wondering, would that impact how you and the board think about return of capital? Or is that sort of a completely irrelevant and separate point? And then second for me, for either of you, any color you can share with us on your wireless ambitions? I think both on the MVNO side and 3.5 gigahertz, there's been a lot of discussion in the press about what Google's up to. Any update you can give us on that would be great.",114

And on the second question that you've asked, right, there's a lot of speculation out there. And if we had to answer every speculation on Google's part, what's going on, I mean, we'd just -- it'd be -- my PR team would be really busy. So we just won't comment on any speculative news. On the first question, on return on capital, absolutely, I mean, we have, right now, a mix of kind of roughly 60-40 between our U.S. -- U.S., 40; international, 60 of our cash. We have good use for our cash in both places. But if, in fact, we have a lot more flexibility about repatriating cash, that would make a big difference in the way that we think about it and -- or at least we'd take it in consideration for sure in our dialogue with the board. And so it's clearly one element that's part of the puzzle that we would take in consideration. So if there's anything you can do to get that thing through Congress, Ben, we'd really love it.

I was hoping you could give us an update on Google Wallet and how strategic that is to your business overall and kind of closing the loop payments in general.

So on the first one, look, it's -- I want to come back on the sites issue because 25% and then the minus 8% in terms of click growth and CPCs. And I want to start with that because that's always the case when people kind of just focus on one, they would kind of tend to forget the big picture, which is it's a mix of these 2 things that give you this revenue that's been very strong in sites this quarter. So never look at them in isolation. Having said that, as I said in my prepared remarks, the monetization metrics for our sites has all of the factors that I usually discuss, which is geographic, device property, the FX and all the things I talk about. So I think it'll be misguided again this quarter to pin it down to just one trend. I think people have a tendency to say, okay, well, it's mobile, right, or it's FX. And -- but I'd like to point out 3 things specifically this quarter. As we know, as I already mentioned, right, FX has been a big impact this quarter. I also noted the strength of mobile performance in our sites earlier. And I'd remind you that our sites line also includes YouTube, where we continue to see impressive growth both in developed countries and emerging markets. So there's the rest of it. There's all these pieces, but these are the kind of like some of the pieces that we should take note during this quarter, if that makes sense. I would turn it over to Omid to answer the first question on what's going on with Google Shopping, et cetera.",303

Really, our focus is building products that turn consumers' shopping intents into actions quickly easily and enabling businesses to connect and retain these customers. On payments, the goal is really to remove all the friction that one encounters now in the shopping experience. And what we're really working on here is move beyond just tap and pay and have a full functional payment system. Today, users can send money to friends through Gmail using the Wallet app. And we also just made this functionality available in the U.K. Loyalty gift cards can be stored on the Wallet app. The Buy with Google button makes it possible for users to purchase with 2 clicks. So we really are focused on building a rich offering here to make it easier to shop and pay and remove the friction. Thank you, Doug.",152

So in terms of product listing as PLAs, it's a very successful product and we're really pleased with its performance. Advertisers are very pleased with it. And we also have local inventory ads that enable merchants to show customers information in the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Japan and Australia, and obviously, we're going to continue to expand that. As I said in my remarks, we added estimated store visits in December, and it's been 1 year since we launched Estimated Total Conversions. And just to give you some anecdotes with customers, PetSmart saw 10% to 18% of clicks on search ads led to store visits, and they're now investing more in ads to each customers across multiple screens. Famous Footwear nationwide chain have 1,100 stores. They found that 15% to 17% of the clicks on ads resulted in store visits, and they were able to mix up the products that they promote in their in-store merchandising strategies by region. So for us, it's early to think about the impact to revenue, but we really expect these suite of products to continue to help the advertisers measure the full value of their online spending and work with us to enhance those. In terms of specific search numbers, we don't really break that down and provide any more data on that. Thank you for your question.",242

I think it'd be great if you broke out the nonperformance advertising at some point in the future. That data point will be very helpful. The CPC trends on sites, they kind of inflected back down after showing a positive trend. It's kind of hard to think that that's nothing but FX. I know you have this mix of other factors. So could you just clarify that? Or could you quantify what CPCs, sites' CPCs, would have been year-over-year x FX? And then finally, Omid, could you just talk broadly about YouTube? And you've come back. You're more engaged with the company. I think there's a bit of a change in management's approach, I think, to YouTube and how you want to position it. I know it's a broad question, but could you just talk about what you want to do differently with YouTube going forward to the next few years?",158

So on the first question, why don't I jump in, and then I'll let Omid talk about YouTube. Look, as I mentioned just a minute ago, if you look at the sites' CPCs, we purposefully actually don't point to one item. Like I think it'd be tempting to just say, okay, it's all FX this quarter because geography has a big impact, as I mentioned, right, the different properties on our sites. So YouTube has an impact as well in the sense that it's growing and it's growing in emerging markets, as well as in its core, more developed markets. I purposely made the case that it's really important to note that on the mobile side, I think that we see continued strength in mobile. And so from that perspective, it's always trying to catch up to the desktop, which itself is always improving, but we see positive trend there. So it is a mix of all these factors, and we don't give down all of the details on a quarter-by-quarter basis because they just move all over the place. So that's the answer for that one, Mark -- sorry, that's not Mark. And then I'll let Omid answer the question on YouTube.",205

So first of all, in general, just to give you a sense of this, as you said, I've come back and I just spent a lot of time in CES here in Europe, spending time with customers as well. And there's just tremendous excitement about YouTube. And the -- over 1 billion people come to the service every month, and YouTube mobile revenue is up more than 100% year-to-year. And what we're really after here is finding the click for brand, GRP, Brand Lift, other metrics. And advertisers are already running Brand Lift studies. About 6,000 of them have done this already with us. And what's really unique about this service is the velocity that the creators enjoy to create and deliver content to a worldwide audience. And our investment in the service, in the creators just continues to pay back for us. So I know, based on my meetings, I spent a lot of time with consumer goods companies at CES with major agencies there. Everybody just wants to do more. There are a lot of success stories the way they engage with us. And for us, the challenge, frankly, is to structure our sales organization, hire the right people to go deeper with these customers, with our agencies. And so you'll just see a lot of success and emphasis from us as we go after the branding dollars.",231

So I'll take the second question, and then I'll flip it over to Omid to answer the Wallet one. So on the issue of partnerships, Google has a lot of partnerships, right? It's got -- it's an anchor of our strategy because it actually gives us distribution. Distribution is good. And so we always look for partnerships in many spaces. Partnerships have to be win-wins. And in that sense, right, we'll always look for those combinations. But also at the end of the day, there's a second piece of the strategy, which is, as I said earlier, building amazing product because if you build amazing products, then people want to distribute your products. And so that's why we have Omid and the whole Search team that actually do this amazing job through the Knowledge Graph and all of the other elements of Search. And no matter what the device, no matter the location, no matter the time of day, if we give you the answers you're looking for in 10 clicks less than it was before and even faster and better all the time, that's what wins. And that's the core of what we're focused on. And then people will find a way to get to Google. So yes, partnerships matter. But at the core of it, you need partnerships because you have a phenomenal product. And that's what we're going to continue to build in this amazing company. So I'll let, with that, Omid talk about our developments for digital payments.",258

One is really building a full functional payment system that just is beyond tap and pay. So I mentioned it earlier, using Gmail and the Wallet app to send money to friends, loyalty and gift cards and Buying with Google button with a press of 2 clicks. So -- and we just -- the NFC devices are available, and we are really getting closer and closer to broader merchant adoption. And so you'll see us emphasizing that through the devices that we're supporting out there, as well as the payment services and commerce services that we provide. So I think you'll see a lot of progress here as we, as I said, try to remove the friction here.",166

Hello, everyone. I want to say at the outset that this quarter Google turned a strong performance, and this, despite substantial currency headwinds. As we've all seen, the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen, which resulted in a gross negative currency impact on our revenues of $1.1 billion for the quarter. Even after the significant benefits of our hedging program, that impact to our gross revenue was still $795 million. If these currency trends persist, FX headwinds would obviously continue to impact our results in 2015.
So for our results now. Our gross total consolidated revenue was $17.3 billion, growing 12% year-over-year and declining 5% quarter-over-quarter. Without currency fluctuations, our gross total consolidated revenue growth is, in fact, a healthy 17% year-over-year. Despite significant FX pressure, Google site revenue was up a healthy 14% year-over-year to $11.9 billion and was down 4% quarter-over-quarter. Once again, strengthened mobile search was the key driver of growth here.
Network revenue was up 1% year-over-year at $3.6 billion and down 8% quarter-over-quarter. As I mentioned last quarter, our network business includes 2 businesses with different growth profiles: our legacy AdSense business and our newer display and programmatic business, where the latter continues to perform quite well.
This quarter, we reclassified some revenues primarily related to DoubleClick ad serving software from the other revenue to network revenue line. This reclassification increased network revenue by approximately $130 million in Q1 and decreased other revenue by about the same amount or the same amount. The display and programmatic business I mentioned earlier continued as always, to be reflected in the network line. To see the impact of this reclass on historical periods, please see the earnings slides on our IR website.
Finally, Google's other revenue grew 23% year-over-year to $1.8 billion and was down 2% quarter-over-quarter. This was driven really by year-over-year growth from the Play Store offset by a decline at Nexus and what I've mentioned, the FX impact.
Our global aggregate paid clicks were up 13% year-over-year, down 1% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate CPCs were down 7% year-over-year and down 5% quarter-over-quarter. And on our monetization by property. Google sites paid clicks were up 25% year-over-year and down 3% quarter-over-quarter. Google sites CPCs were down 13% year-over-year and down 3% quarter-over-quarter. Network paid clicks were down 12% year-over-year and up 4% quarter-over-quarter. And network CPCs were up 2% year-over-year and down 11% quarter-over-quarter.
As you know, we don't usually break down the impact of the individual factors on the quarterly changes in our clicks and CPCs, but this quarter, I want to provide more color on what's happening within our sites, clicks and CPC metrics so that you can better understand the dynamics of the underlying businesses that drive them. So many commentators are incorrectly assuming that the growth trends in our sites, clicks and CPCs are primarily due to difficulties monetizing search on mobile, but that's, in fact, not the case. Remember that sites metrics include clicks and revenues related to ads served on Google's owned and operated properties, most notably, obviously, google.com, but as well as YouTube engagement ads like TrueView, where a user's choice not to skip an ad is counted as a click.  While over the past year, we've seen YouTube viewership climb dramatically both in established markets but also due to rapid expansion in emerging markets. And quality improvements in the TrueView ads mean that more users are, in fact, choosing not to skip them, increasing the overall ad view. So this means that there is much higher volume of TrueView ads being seen, which has been a significant driver of year-over-year growth in numbers that you've seen in sites clicks. TrueView ads currently monetize at lower rates than ad clicks on google.com. But as you know, video ads generally reach people earlier in the purchase funnel, and so across the industry, they tend to have a very different pricing profile than they would have on a typical performance search ad.
Excluding the impact of YouTube TrueView ads, growth in site clicks would be lower but still positive, and our CPCs would be healthy and growing year-over-year. So really, we have 2 positive stories to tell here today. First, as I mentioned earlier, we're experiencing real strength in mobile search, and the CPCs in our core search business is continuing to grow year-over-year. So it's doing very well. Second, viewership in YouTube videos and TrueView ads are growing significantly, and YouTube's contribution to our advertising revenue continues to grow at a strong rate year-over-year. And we're really pleased with how the YouTube business is progressing. So that's the story.
Turning to geographic performance. You'll see in our earnings slides, which you can find on our Investor Relations website, you'll see that we have broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and the rest of world and show the impact of FX and the benefits from our hedging programs. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.
So despite large currency headwinds I mentioned, we saw solid performance for our core advertising business all around the world. The U.S. was up 11% year-over-year to $7.4 billion. The U.K. was up 6% year-over-year to $1.7 billion. And in fixed FX terms, the U.K. actually grew 12% year-over-year. Our non-U.S. revenue, which excluding the U.K., was up 14% year-over-year to $8.2 billion, accounting for 47% of our total revenue. And in fixed FX terms, the rest of the world grew a solid 24% year-over-year.
Now let me turn to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.3 billion for the quarter or 22% of total advertising revenue. Our non-GAAP other cost of revenue was $2.9 billion in Q1, which excludes SBC. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $5.4 billion, again, excluding stock-based compensation. As a result, our non-GAAP operating profit was a healthy $5.7 billion, and non-GAAP operating margins, 33% in Q1.
Headcount was up just over 1,800 people in Q1. In total, we ended the quarter with approximately 55,400 full-time employees at Google.
Our effective tax rate was 22% for Q1.
Let me now turn to cash management. Other income and expenses was $157 million. Interest income and realized gains on investments offset the continued impact of expenses from our FX hedging programs. For more details on OI&E please do refer to the slides that accompany this call on the IR website.
We're pleased with our strong operating cash flow at $6.6 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $2.9 billion. This quarter, most CapEx spend was related to first product, production equipment, data center construction and facilities, in that order.
Clearly, our computing capacity is a strategic asset for us, and that's why we're investing in it. But we innovate there just like we do everywhere else. To give you an example, compared to 5 years ago, we can now deliver more than 3x as much compute power for the same amount of power or money.
Our free cash flow for the quarter was $3.7 billion, so once again, strong results in the core business as evidenced by our 17% fixed FX revenue growth this quarter and solid margin.
Now I'd like to turn it to Omid to provide you more specifics on our successful performance of our core and new businesses, and then we'll turn it over to questions. Omid?",1220
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3191.0,794783.0,34626881.0,Presenter Speech,Omid Kordestani,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Patrick. Our teams turned in a great performance across our business this quarter. I thought I would switch up our typical format a bit this time around. So I'll quickly share some highlights, and then I want to talk more about growth areas that we are really focused on: mobile and branding.
Let's start with the rise of programmatic ad buying. It's an extraordinary change for the ads industry, and I want to point out that our investments in the DoubleClick platform continue to be a big positive for us. We recently made TrueView, our skippable ad format on YouTube, available through our DoubleClick suite, and we brought Internet-delivered TV content to our Ad Exchange through mDialog, a company we acquired last year.
Google Play is also growing fast, connecting developers and content providers with more than 1 billion people on Android devices around the world. Developers are building thriving businesses on our platform, and in February, we announced that over the past 12 months we paid more than $7 billion to developers. We're honored to be partnering with them.
Our partner hardware ecosystem is also doing great. LG Watch Urbane and Huawei Watch recently announced new Android Wear devices, and Pioneer launched in-dash car units compatible with Android Auto. Also, 10 top computer OEMs are now making more than 35 Chrome devices available in 38 countries, which is a great momentum for us. Google for Work continues to grow at an impressive pace thanks to the addition of customers like G4S, 1 of the world's largest private sector employers, who moved 70,000 of their employees to Drive for Work. Working with our partners, we also recently launched Android for Work to accelerate the adoption of Android devices in the workplace. Business is going great in these areas, and we continue to invest to capture the potential we see for growth.
Now I want to talk more about the 2 areas where I see a lot of opportunity for us: first, the shift to mobile and then the trend of TV budgets shifting to digital. Mobile devices are driving a huge shift in the way people consume media. You've heard about the trends many times. Here is our point of view. As we all know, consumers reach for their phones a lot, and some of these moments matter more than others, like when people are looking for answers or making a decision about what to buy or do. For example, more than 8 in 10 smartphones -- smartphone users use their phone to research a product decision they're about make in-store. These moments include small things like looking for a movie review and really big decisions like researching a new home purchase or figuring out what car you want to buy next. So people expect to get exactly what they want when they want it.
As a company built on intent and immediacy, that's good news for Google. Our job has always been to connect people with what they are looking for in the exact moment they are looking. Our ads products are a critical way we deliver the right answers in the right moment, and it's something we do really well. It's often more valuable to know someone is shopping for a new SUV than it is to know basic demographic information about them. We have great opportunities in mobile with some of the most popular mobile apps, including the Google App, YouTube, Gmail and Maps and our great Android platform.
Search is also important to the mobile experience. We have retooled our search engine for mobile, providing direct answers and enabling voice queries. It's really a delightful experience. Try opening the Google App and asking what's the plot of The Godfather movie or flip a coin. You'll be pleasantly surprised.
Chrome for Mobile is also a popular app with more than 400 million users, and of course, a large number of people use it as a primary way to search the web. We continue to invest in improving the mobile web for both users and developers. In our recent Chrome release, we made it easier for users to add their favorite sites to their phones' home screens and get helpful opt-in notifications from sites they visit often.
We've also been working to index apps just as effectively as we index web content. We now have 30 billion links within apps indexed, and if you're looking for information that lives within an app that you don't have, we'll now begin showing links to install the app right on the search results page. The Google app on Android can also give you up-to-date -- can also keep you up-to-date by surfacing information from more than 40 different apps when it's relevant, like Pandora music recommendations on your commute or a car to request a lift when you arrive at the airport.
We're also working very hard to make our products more accessible to the next billion people who are coming online. The first computing experience for these users won't be on a desktop machine or a laptop. They'll be on a mobile phone from day 1. In fact, many of them will use a mobile device as their only computer. We launched Android One, a new family of high-quality, low-cost smartphones, in Indonesia and the Philippines this quarter, making it available in a total of 6 emerging markets.
We're also working to eliminate the barriers to access from connectivity issues. For instance, in countries like India, where a user might have a slow wireless connection, we can deliver a fast-loading light version of Search, so they can get their answers quickly and pay less for data. And with the Chrome app for Android and iOS, our data compression features help reduce data usage by up to 50% while browsing the web. There's tremendous upside to these efforts, and we're in a great position.
I'm also very excited about how we're helping marketers succeed in this mobile world. As I noted earlier, we're connecting brands with the right people at the precise moment when it actually matters because of our strong, intense signals. Mobile also enables us to help drive the 90% of commerce that still takes place offline, which is a massive opportunity that our partners are really excited about. People are searching on Google for things like near me, closest and nearby twice as much as they did last year. Our local inventory ads are a great way for businesses to drive purchases in stores right when people are looking for local options.
We also help advertisers better measure the store visits that their digital ads drive, and we recently expanded the capabilities to advertisers in new countries. Our ads are also driving people to download apps precisely when they're looking for them. Our AdMob mobile ad network offers great targeting and reach and is the foundation of our app install offerings. Last month, we also introduced app promotion video ads and extended app install ads to our mobile Google Display Network, which increased install volumes for early testers by an average of 28% without impacting cost per install. we also recently began testing sponsored search results in Google Play with a small set of users and developers helping app developers reach valuable users directly within the store.
So I'm very excited about the mobile future, and marketers are, too. Our pivot to mobile has great momentum and is delivering strong benefits to users and advertisers.
I also feel very excited about the trend of video content and TV budgets shifting to digital. YouTube is the world's most popular video service on all screens with hundreds of millions of hours watched on YouTube every day. A place where a billion people come to watch video is a natural home for video advertising budgets. When people come to YouTube, they come with the intent of watching video, so it's the perfect time to reach them with a video ad, not when they're distracted by something else. More and more brands are seeing the value of reaching audiences on YouTube, too, with the number of TrueView advertises growing by 45% in 2014.
YouTube drives great results, and we can measure the impact. We have run over 6,000 Brand Lift studies to date across some of the largest brand advertisers. And in studies we have run for Google Preferred campaigns, we found that 94% of the campaigns we studied drove a significant lift, an average of 80% in ad recall. That's why we're bringing it back this year and expanding it to more than 10 new markets.
Google Preferred is also attracting some of the biggest TV advertisers to YouTube. More than 30 major brands that had never advertised on YouTube before signed on with Google Preferred and saw such great results that they have continued to advertise with YouTube afterwards. YouTube is home to great content and engaged audiences, and we're seeing the natural shift of TV budgets.
So those are some of my observation on the trends affecting our business, what I'm hearing from partners and why I'm upbeat on the opportunities ahead. You will see a lot more at our Brandcast upfront event in Europe next week, at the AdWords Performance Summit in early May and our I/O developer conference in late May. We look forward to seeing you there.
Before I go, I want to thank all the Googlers worldwide for a great quarter, and I want  to say a special thank you to Patrick who's been our fearless CFO for almost 7 years and who wrote 1 of the most heartfelt and awesome retirement notes I've ever seen. If you've read it, you'll know that he almost -- he was inspired to move on after climbing Mount Kilimanjaro. I've since banned travel to Kilimanjaro for all Googlers, recommending local hills near their homes. Patrick, you'll be dearly missed, and we wish you and your wife all the best on your next adventure. Thank you.
And Ruth, if you're out there listening, we can't wait to begin working with you soon. Thank you.",1687

First, our research has suggested that many or maybe most mobile websites and mobile apps are still in pretty bad shape when it comes to user experience and conversion. I think one can expect this to improve over time. And the question is, is an improvement in conversion rate and experiences within mobile apps where users transact, good or bad for Google. One could argue that people are going to spend more time in apps, transact in apps and not search. Now how should we think about that? Secondly, it's been more than 2 years when we've seen capital intensity very high. It continues to be quite high with $2.9 billion of CapEx. Is this the new normal? I mean, is that what we should expect going forward?",132

We're working with developers, webmasters, publishers to help them really surface their content to users in a format they feel best, and we also recently introduced this install app, install Carousel, which is the evidence of that effort. So it's really about delivering the right results to the users, and the less friction you have there and the more targeted you are, we'll see the benefits in monetization.",119

Part of our plan, we are shifting, as you know, we've been building a lot of data centers over the last 18 months, and so that is actually giving us the opportunity to put in new equipment in. And we're jumping on the opportunity, thinking to the total cost of ownership of these things and the much more higher efficiency of these new machines. Having said that, I won't kind of comment about the future, but I just want to reemphasize that we were not surprised by these numbers. To us, actually they make sense given our strategy, and they really fuel all the innovation that we have going for us. So it's an important part of our strategy. It's a strategic asset.",140

Is your point -- is your assertion that these real, major shifts that we've seen over the last 2 or 3 years in CPC pressure has really largely been driven by YouTube TrueViews and the adoption of that? Is that kind of what the point you're making? And if you -- and if you would -- in the past, you always listed the factors that would cause these shifts in paid clicks and CPCs.

I'm just talking about the situation as we have it now. I'm not looking back to the prior years, and I'm just saying what we have seen in this quarter, in the last quarter. We've just seen a real acceleration at YouTube, and that's why we thought it was important because we saw this change from the fundamental kind of strong performance of YouTube, both in terms of its coverage, in terms of the performance, like even the TrueView ads, right? We've tuned these ads to make sure that people want to watch them so that they're very effective. And when they do, then people watch a lot more of them. And so over the last quarter, over the last couple of quarters, we've seen a real takeoff, and then the geographic expansion is kind of giving us a lot more coverage. So it's a real positive story for YouTube. Because we see it now we're reporting it now. So it's not a view back to the last 5 years at all. Just wanted to kind of clarify that.",200

And it's important to note that this is just 1 of over 200 signals we use to evaluate the best results. Non-mobile-friendly sites won't disappear from the mobile search results. They'll still rank high if they have -- still, they hold great content that the user wants. But a lack of mobile friendliness is a problem for web publishers. Visitors abandon the websites, and that's a real issue. So it's really early to speculate exactly how the monetization impact of these organic algorithm changes will be, but we always start with the user to deliver the right answer, the best answer be it on the mobile web or the app and that we think that, ultimately, that's good for publishers, advertisers and our users. And the monetization success will follow.",179

And so Douglas, on my side, if you look at it, I mean, we're really pleased with Q1. If you look at the operating profit of the company, right? Despite Q4 to Q1, revenue trends that are always seasonal, we delivered essentially the same $5.7 billion of non-GAAP operating profits for the quarter. So we really focused on our sequential performance rather than what happened a year ago. And there was no real specific onetime items for this quarter. This was just a pretty clean quarter. We were very happy with it.",93

You mentioned paid click growth would be lower, excluding YouTube. Would you be willing to just help us understand that growth rate, what it looks like now and what it looked like a year ago? Now on the CPCs, you mentioned the search CPCs continue to grow. Is that true even including the migration to emerging markets where CPCs are lower and even the shift toward mobile?",84

You've seen in my notes and my comments that the impact of TrueView ads and site CPCs, site CPCs would be growing, right, if you kind of take out the TrueView ad impact. So -- and I've also noted that mobile search is continuing on a path of strength. So from that perspective, what I wanted to make sure is that you get the color that if you just exclude the great growth of YouTube but has very different kind of fundamental dynamics, that the core of what is typically search performance both on mobile and desktop, the combined, is doing really good. So -- and the CPCs would be growing if you take the other effect out. So that's really what I want to make sure that -- so that people don't continue to hound on this issue of it's all about mobile that has terrible monetization.

I just wanted to follow up on your YouTube comments earlier. You talked about the growth you've been seeing, in particular, over the last couple of quarters. I'm just wondering when you are talking to advertisers, kind of what's changed over the last year or so that you really think has caused this acceleration in kind of click volume that you're seeing. And how do you think about that gap and the potential for that gap to close over time with what you see in just traditional site CPCs if you will?",94

On -- related to the question and the answer I gave you, the comments I gave you today, it's really about -- if you think about it, about coverage, rather than what's the new product because we've done a lot of geographic expansion of YouTube, and that in itself gives you a lot more volume out there in terms of eyeballs. And then in addition to that, we've -- through the great work of the team and the Adwords team and the YouTube team, the monetization team, making sure that TrueView is a more efficient product where people, basically, they actually do watch the entire ad. And so they don't skip before the 5 seconds. And all you need is a bit -- given the scale of YouTube today, right, all you need is to have a product  that people want more, and it actually delivers a lot more value, so in terms of advertising total revenue. The fact that it's at the top of the funnel clearly has very different dynamics than when you have a very specific performance-based ad that is tied to a very specific high-margin query. But that doesn't mean that it's not incredibly useful for advertisers because that's where they stops, is at -- start, is at the top of the funnel. So these are all the pieces of the puzzle that we have going for us. And for what's really exciting about YouTube, I'll let Omid kind of give you more color comment on this.",280

I'll be there in New York, and you'll get a sense of the momentum in YouTube. But really, the way we look at it is as usual, first, look at the users. 1/3 of all people on the Internet are everyday watching hundreds of millions of hours on YouTube, and this is generating billions of views. And then when we look at our advertisers, they want to be there, so we're seeing strong growth in TrueView with new advertisers. The number grew 45% in 2014. And all of the top 100 global brands have run TrueView ads over the past year. And as they're experiencing success, for example, with Google Preferred, I think I shared this data earlier, but 95% of the Preferred campaigns we studied drove a significant lift, an average of 80%. And then more than 30 brands that were new to advertising on YouTube used Google Preferred and then came back and continued to advertise with us afterwards, so just having great success.",179

My question's more around mobile. I appreciated all the color around the clicks and the CPC.

Let me just give you some thoughts, and again, thank you for this. We're very excited about this pivot to mobile. And it's really, obviously, a shift that started gradually, and it's been very dramatic for us. So if you talk to every product manager at Google and leader at Google, they have at the forefronts of their thoughts on how to delight the users, how to improve the experience. Same thing on our advertising front. And I think -- so one is obviously the efforts we're doing to -- for the discovery, the search for information be it in the apps or be it on mobile web. The other aspect of this that is really going to help us obviously with the monetization front is the improvements in measurements, measuring across devices, measuring in-store sales. And as you know, the shopping experience becomes more powerful because users can find this information. They can find it with local products. It doesn't become just about driving leads to online retailers. It's about driving traffic to offline stores via mobile. And we're seeing great adoption from retailers, from Macy's, REI, Sears. So what should really -- the way we're going to talk about this and you're going to hear us talk more about this is this intent and immediacy that we are so good at given our heritage in search. And we're just applying all of that knowledge and all of the experience we have in ads and search to improving these mobile experiences and how we monetize.",257

Let me just -- this is Omid. Thank you, Anthony, for the question. On the Maps, we absolutely agree with you, very strategic, very popular and that there are more than 1 billion monthly active users of the Google Map services. We've mapped the world, as you know, 200 countries and territories, including North Korea. 1 billion times the app has been downloaded on Android and lots and lots of stats that I can go through. And I think one of the things that we're doing is not only to improve that experience and integrate it as much as it makes sense throughout the services and whenever users are -- can take advantage of those signals and the proper response from Google, but the other side of this is also partnering. One of the things we're really actively doing is partnering, getting our Map service in native formats with as many partners out there that can take advantage of it. So it's an area we're really investing in. We're very excited about it having great traction, and we're also happy to offer it to our partners. And you'll see us both in terms of Maps and Waze, you will see it getting integrated in other popular web services out there.",212

On my side, look, there's quite a different rationale, if you think of Fi versus kind of Access, which is really asset based. We've just -- as a reminder to some of our -- if you may have not heard, we just announced Fi yesterday, so it's still very early days. It's focused on innovating in connectivity and communications but in close partnerships with carriers in the U.S., hardware makers. And we're trying to see, again, from a user perspective and from a service [ph] perspective, with or without assets, what should be -- what should look like the next wave of innovation. So we've always -- if you're always looking to make the web faster, cheaper, more available, and we wanted to try this new vision, this new idea of fast and easy wireless service and then work with the ecosystem of our carriers, so that's why we have T-Mobile and Sprint as launch carriers and manufacturers and developers to develop this kind of new product, new and innovative service. So different in the sense that, Anthony, in the case of Fiber or in the case of Loon, it's really asset based. This one is really about services and how can we use today's platforms to actually just drive for more innovation. So that's really the difference. But we're pretty excited. It'll be interesting to see the take rate, and it'll be interesting to see how the market response is to it. But again, very much, as usual, kind of focused on innovation, focusing on pushing the envelope.",260

So I'm trying to get some sense of the direction of costs involved in running YouTube. Granted there is the revenue share component to the content owners, but then there's the everyday operating costs involved in just running the business, like engineers, bandwidth, et cetera. So I'm wondering, at this point, what part of YouTube's cost base is variable and what part is fixed because it seems like your revenue is now large enough to cover the cost to serve your users, and the cost in the aggregate is probably not growing as rapidly as revenue. And additionally, even as we adjust for the reclassification, I guess, of a DoubleClick to network, the LNL [ph] line decelerated a bit more than we thought. So I'm just wondering if this is just due to Play indexing higher against those countries that saw the highest amount of FX headwinds. Or did you have some sort of hardware shortage issue this quarter also?",169
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3191.0,794783.0,34626918.0,Answer,Patrick Pichette,,Executives,40,"Okay. So let's start with last one first, and then I'll come back to YouTube. On other revenues, what you have in there is, yes, you're right that we have the reclass. And then on the 2 other factors, clearly, Play is going really well, but it is also hit by quite strong headwinds. So that's been -- so we're very pleased with the performance of Play. But given that it's -- has a quite large international SKU, it also kind of gets hit by headwinds of FX as well. And then on the hardware side, no shortage this quarter, so no shortage issues versus -- for the 6, so that's been performing quite well. But if you -- again, when you look at year-over-year comparisons for hardware, then last year, we had the new Nexus 7 tablet that was very popular, so then you have this kind of a bit of noise on the comparisons year-over-year. And that's really -- so you have the combination of these 3 things that are flowing through the line, so that's why you end up with that kind of performance. But what's most important is FX adjusted. We continue to be very, very pleased with the Play growth. On YouTube, I would -- interestingly -- I mean, obviously, we don't divulge any of the details of what's fixed and what's variable and any of this, but what I can tell you is we actually monitor the performance of YouTube for its profitability to make sure that it continues to grow profitably. And we basically kind of manage with Susan to reinvest at the right pace, if you wish, so fueling the growth where it is showing up and keeping tight in areas where we need more efficiencies. So that's how we manage the -- again, I mean, I've said this in the past. I'll say it again. I mean, if you just want to make YouTube profitable tomorrow morning, it's very easy, right? You put on the brakes on growth, and then it just turns into a profitable business. We continue to work with the attention where Susan has the carrot of, hey, as much profitability I can generate, I can reinvest at a certain pace. So it creates the great incentive for this growth and disciplined behavior that we have there. So we're pretty pleased by it.",395

So Patrick, on the operating margin question, so given the increased discipline you talked about last call, do you think this flat margin is sustainable in '15? And if not, like what would cause it to drop back down year-on-year? And then from the prior question, so this new other revenue line was up like 23% in the quarter. I think it was 19% or 20% last quarter, so surprising that the acceleration's in there given the FX trends. Can you just talk about is that Google Play? Or is that hardware between those 2? And then Nikesh, there's been some talk of Google introducing custom audience products for AdWords. Is that something you're willing to talk about? And how big of a targeting feature like that could be in terms of improving ROIs and increasing spend in Search?",155

So Ross, on my side, 2 points. One is on the issue of margin, you know we don't give guidance, so I can't pronounce myself for the rest of '15. But I think that in Q1 you see a good example of what we talked about when we had our comments in Q4, which is we drive for that right balance, that right balance of you want to fuel as much as possible responsibly the growth that we have in the areas we want to invest. And in other areas, right, we may decide that, actually, we really need to work for efficiencies all the time. And you see that in our Q1 results. In fact, I didn't mention it, but just a note on the headcount, the vast majority of headcount for Q1 is, in fact, engineers and product managers. It's not G&A. It's not sales. It's really focused on engineering because that's where we wanted to put the emphasis. So I'm using this as an example of even though the numbers are large in a number of areas, there is actually a lot of science applied to every one of these numbers to make sure that we continue to drive for high efficiencies as much as we can. You may have heard that in Q1 we've canceled another program that we had, which was the Helpouts. So this program did not prove the promises that we had for it, and so we actually repurposed the team and kind of shut down the entire initiative. So again, I'm just giving you the signal that this is a disciplined organization that looks at the facts, that actually, when it's not working, people can sense it, and then we have a good conversation about it. And then on the other side, when we see something really kind of going well, we want to make sure that we push hard for it. In the case of the second piece that you've asked, which was the growth in other revenue, I think Play is doing very well. We're very happy about that. And yes, we're having good results on the Nexus 6, but year-over-year, it wasn't as strong as it would have had given the strength of the Nexus 7 last year. So that's really been the big driver. And as for Nikesh, Nikesh, I heard, is on his way to India right now. He was on a plane, but I have Omid here who'll be delighted to answer your question.",419

I'm just wondering are you seeing that from your users as they shift from desktop to mobile devices. I guess, in essence, is the growth in mobile search activity offsetting the weakness that you may be seeing in desktop search? And then second question is just on verticals by advertiser verticals. We had heard some data points during the quarter around potentially some weakness in the e-commerce category. Just wondering if you could comment a little bit on maybe some verticals that -- where you saw particular strength and weakness.",114

Thank you, Mark, for the question. So let me just take the vertical one first. In terms of performance, we definitely saw automotive and travel were stronger verticals this quarter. India was a strong performer as far as the geo goes for us, and those are really some of the areas that I could highlight. And I think in terms of this behavior change, we are really, really focused on studying it every day. I mean, the shift is very, very dramatic and that we're laser focused on being as good and relevant and fast and monetize well all the things that we did on the desktop and continue to do on the desktop to do that on mobile. So I think all I can say on that is you're right. The behaviors are different. There -- this immediacy, having this device always with you, using it as your assistant, using your voice to make commands and getting results, using the maps and being in a moment of purchase decision and relying on this information source to help you, so all of those things are really, really powerful, and we're very excited about it. So it's a journey that we're all on and looking forward to doing a better job and to monetizing well. So thank you, Mark, for your question.
Before I close, allow me just kind of 10 seconds. First, Ruth will join us in about a month. We're really excited to have her. I will be here to help her in transition, but you'll hear a much better voice in Q2 on the earnings call. So we really look forward to having her as part of the team.
It obviously has been a delight to work at Google for the last 7 years. I have kind of, obviously, 3 thanks -- 3 huge thanks for that. First one is to the Google community. As Omid mentioned, all of these Googlers kind of are simply extraordinary individuals and people, these men and women. I mean, they just continue to develop the stream of innovation that is really changing the world and making it a better place, so it's been a real joy to work with every one of them. My colleagues, having around this table, the IR team, and as well as the executive group that I've kind of spent many, many hours over the years and they're mostly friends now so thank you for your friendship and all of you warmth over the last few years. And finally, you, I mean, the financial community, our shareholders. I mean, you've been kind of supportive. You've been probing. You've had the insights. You've been really with us, I mean, for the last 7 years through kind of thick and thin, as we've seen a lot of stuff come and go and really strong supporters for this a bit crazy, unconventional company. So I just need to thank you as well for all the great times together. With that, yes, I am going to grab my backpack and take off for the world. So you may see me somewhere in the world, and if you do, just please do stop and say hi. I'd be delighted to see you.
So with that, I'll let Candace close the call. Thank you so much, and we'll see you or Ruth will see you in Q2. Cheers.",565

We had strong performance in the second quarter, notwithstanding the continuation of substantial currency headwinds. Key highlights this quarter include ongoing momentum in our core Search business, particularly mobile, complemented by significant growth in YouTube revenues.
In addition, we are increasingly benefiting from the shift toward programmatic advertising, particularly among brand advertisers. These strong top line results were complemented by ongoing operating expense discipline in the quarter, as reflected in 13% year-over-year growth in GAAP operating income and 16% year-over-year growth in non-GAAP operating income.
I will first go over a summary of the quarter, followed by specific financial details and conclude with themes for the near term. Omid will then cover the business and product highlights of the quarter, after which, we will take your questions.
Beginning with the summary of our financial performance. Total revenue was $17.7 billion, up 11% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. As a result of the ongoing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we realized a negative currency impact on our revenues of $1.6 billion or $1.1 billion after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 18% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. 
On a GAAP basis, operating profit was $4.8 billion and the operating margin was 27%. On a non-GAAP basis, that is excluding stock-based compensation, operating profit was $6 billion and the operating margin was 34%. 
GAAP net income was $3.9 billion, up 17% year-over-year and up 12% versus Q1. Non-GAAP net income was $4.8 billion, up 18% year-over-year and up 8% versus Q1. 
GAAP earnings per diluted share for Class A and B shares were $4.93 and for Class C were $6.43. Higher EPS for Class C reflects the impact of the adjustment payment made in Q2. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $6.99.
As detailed in the earnings slides on our IR website, stock-based compensation totaled $1.1 billion, up 29% year-over-year and down 6% sequentially.
Let me now turn to key elements of our financial statements. Starting with our primary revenue sources. Google sites revenue was $12.4 billion, up 13% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially, notwithstanding currency headwinds. Year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter growth reflect continued strength in search, particularly mobile search.
We continue to close the gap between mobile and desktop search monetization. Specifically on mobile, we're pleased with our ongoing progress resulting from our focus on user experience, ads quality and online to off-line commerce initiatives. The combination of these efforts improves the effectiveness and value of mobile for users and marketers alike.
Desktop search delivered solid revenue growth again this quarter. YouTube again delivered substantial growth in user engagement globally, particularly on mobile, which translated into the strong adoption of our TrueView ad format. Growth in watch time on YouTube has accelerated and is now up over 60% year-over-year, the fastest growth rate we've seen in 2 years. Mobile watch time has more than doubled from a year ago.
Network revenue was $3.6 billion, up 2% year-on-year and up 1% sequentially, continuing to reflect the divergent performance of programmatic on the one hand and our legacy network businesses on the other. Our programmatic business, including Ad Exchange and DoubleClick Bid Manager, continued to deliver strong year-over-year and sequential performance that more than offset lower results in AdSense for search. We remain committed to policy changes that improve the user experience, notwithstanding the fact that these policies have a negative impact on AdSense for search revenue. Other revenue was $1.7 billion, up 17% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. 
Given the geographic mix of our Play business, FX also had an impact on other revenue. Year-over-year and sequential movements were driven by substantial growth in Play, offset by a decline in hardware sales.
Next, revenues by geography. U.S. revenue was up 16% year-over-year to $8 billion and up 4% versus Q1. U.K. revenue was up 4% year-over-year to $1.7 billion and flat sequentially. In fixed FX terms, the U.K. grew 11% year-over-year and was flat quarter-over-quarter.
Rest of World revenue was up 8% versus last year to $8 billion and up 2% versus Q1. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 22% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially, highlighting both the strength of our global business as well as the impact of FX.
Finally, revenue monetization. As a reminder, these metrics similarly reflect currency movements. Aggregate paid clicks grew 18% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Aggregate CPCs were down 11% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. 
In terms of the drivers. Within Google sites, paid clicks were up 30% year-over-year and up 10% sequentially, in particular, reflecting growth in YouTube TrueView as well as in mobile. Google sites CPCs were down 16% year-over-year and down 5% sequentially. Mobile CPCs continue to strengthen and the gap to desktop continues to grow, as I previously noted. The decline in CPCs reflects the impact of YouTube TrueView, which is a growing percentage of overall site's click mix and where CPCs remain lower than on our other platforms.
Network paid clicks were down 9% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially, reflecting the impact of our ongoing policy changes designed to reduce lower quality inventory on AdSense for search consistent with our focus on improving user experience. Network CPCs were down 3% both year-over-year and sequentially. Let me turn now to expenses.
Traffic acquisition costs were $3.4 billion or 21% of total advertising revenue, which was down slightly sequentially. Trends within sites and network TAC remained flat due to mix shifts in partners, products and devices. As a reminder, the site's TAC line includes the TAC that we pay to search distribution partners for distributing Google Search as distinct from their own branded search.
Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $3 billion in Q2, up 12% year-over-year and up 7% versus Q1. Year-on-year and sequential growth were driven by costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation as well as content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube and Play. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $5.4 billion or 30% of revenue, up 11% year-over-year and down 1% versus Q1. The increase in operating expense versus 2Q '14 primarily reflects R&D expense attributable to increased hiring of engineers and product managers. Headcount increased 18% versus last year and 3% versus 1Q '15, with total headcount at quarter end of approximately 57,100.
The deceleration and year-over-year growth and decline in quarter-over-quarter operating expenses reflects, in part, discipline and expense management and in part, lower legal expenses than in comparable periods. A breakout of individual operating expense lines is available on our earnings slides.
Other income and expense was $131 million, with interest income offset by higher expenses from our FX hedging program. The effective tax rate was 21% for the second quarter.
As noted in our press release, in Q2, we identified an incorrect classification of certain revenues between legal entities. We revised our income tax expense for the relevant periods beginning in 2008 through the first quarter of 2015 in the cumulative amount of $711 million. The income tax adjustments were not material to the affected periods. More detail is available on our earnings slides.
Turning now to CapEx and cash. CapEx for the quarter was $2.5 billion, primarily for production equipment and data center construction. CapEx spend was lower versus last year and last quarter, reflecting a bit of a digestion period after an extended period of investment in both data centers and the requisite machine deployment. We continue to view our computing infrastructure as one of our most strategic assets. Operating cash flow was $7 billion with free cash flow of $4.5 billion, resulting in a cash balance of approximately $70 billion at the end of the quarter, of which approximately $40 billion or 58% is held overseas.
Let me close with 5 topics of focus for the near term. First, on revenue growth and drivers. Our strong revenue growth in the second quarter, notwithstanding the adverse effects of the strong U.S. dollar, evidences the health of our core Search business, most notably mobile, complemented by growth in YouTube and programmatic advertising. Our earlier stage products, such as Fiber, Google Life Sciences and Nest, serve as longer-term sources of revenue. Regarding these areas, we are focused on tight governance to ensure that the resourcing for them is appropriate. And we'll talk more about these products in greater detail as I get settled in.
Second, the sequential deceleration and expense growth achieved in the second quarter reflects in part the benefit of expense discipline discussed in prior calls. A key focus is on the levers within our control to manage the pace of expenses while still ensuring and supporting our growth. We will do this while we continue to invest in engineering talent to keep us preeminent in innovation globally.
Third, the pace of growth in capital expenditures over the last several years has been significant. Although the vast majority of CapEx to date has been to support our core business, growing requirements for newer products underscore the increasing importance of optimization across the many opportunities ahead of us.
Fourth, our cash balance grew again this quarter, which, of course, gives us more strategic flexibility. We remain focused on judiciously capitalizing on the strategic opportunities that we have, which are many, and a key issue is how we prioritize our capital allocation, given the breadth of opportunities.
Finally, as Larry has frequently noted, Google's goal is to develop great new services that significantly improve the lives of as many people as possible. Solving problems for users at scale ultimately results in monetization opportunities. How we prioritize and focus on these opportunities remains paramount, both for our employees, who remain inspired by the opportunity to work on the most cutting-edge developments with maximum global impact, and for our shareholders. 
I look forward to working with you. I will now turn the call over to Omid, who will cover the business details of the quarter.",1647

It's great to be here to talk with everyone again. Since we last spoke, Google has been very busy hosting our customers and developers from across the globe at events ranging from I/O to the DoubleClick Leadership Summit to Brandcast. We're seeing great momentum and results across the company. 
As you all saw at I/O, we continue to invest in innovation across our core products. To call out just one, the new Photos app is a great example of how we're combining the power of machine learning, search and beautiful design, something that Google is proud to bring together in such a great package for our users. 
Our investments in machine learning have applications across the company and have real potential to improve our business. For instance, machine learning helps us to improve and adds visual design to maximize its performance. There's enormous opportunity here. 
I want to quickly share a few highlights of the past quarter and then spend more time talking about our progress in what continues to be our 2 biggest focus areas and growth drivers: mobile and video.
First, our core products continue to do well and users love them. In fact, Google Search, YouTube, Android, Chrome and Google Maps each have over 1 billion users. We also continue to see great partner momentum across the Android platform. The Android phone ecosystem started with 1 device, 1 carrier and 1 OEM, the T-Mobile G1 in 2008, and has grown now to over 400 OEMs and over 500 carriers who make over 4,000 distinct devices. This is a testament to our great progress on both the tech and partnering fronts.
Google Play continues to grow at an impressive clip. Google Play Games has added more than 180 million new users in the past 6 months and continues to be one of the fastest-growing mobile gaming platforms in history. In addition, we're seeing strong momentum around Google Cloud Platform with a range of great new features, new major customer announcements like HTC and JDA Software and our collaboration with Broad Institute.
And on the advertising side, as the trend towards programmatic ad buying continues, we're helping clients succeed in a multiscreen world with our DoubleClick platform. We recently expanded cross device measurement to all of our DoubleClick advertiser products so marketers can measure these conversions for all of their campaigns. And to help publishers, we recently announced full DoubleClick support for native ad formats. Now I'll spend a few minutes diving more into the big areas of opportunity for us, the shift to mobile and the continued growth of online video.
I talked last quarter about the shifts we see in consumer behavior as people turn to their phones throughout the day to decide what to buy or do. Google's role has always been to meet people's needs in the exact moment they are looking, and those moments are increasingly happening on mobile devices.
More Google searches now take place on mobile devices than on computers in 10 countries, including the U.S. and Japan, 2 of our largest markets. And we know that when people search on their mobile phones, they're looking for immediacy and action. In fact, 30% of mobile queries are related to location, and our efforts around local search are helping consumers find relevant information fast.
We're investing in creating great mobile experiences for people across Google products. As Sundar and his team showed at I/O this year, there is a lot to be excited about from Now on Tap to Android Pay and much more. As I mentioned, one of my favorites is a new Photos app, where you can keep and organize all of your memories and easily share and save what matters to you. If you're like me and have an overwhelming number of photos on your phone, the Photos app makes taking, organizing and finding pictures much more manageable and enjoyable, and it's getting better every day. 
In addition, our teams have been -- have made great strides to help users find what they need within third-party apps through indexing. We now have 50 billion links within apps indexed and 25% of signed in Google searches on Android now return deep links, taking users right to content within an app or to a link so they can install it.
We also recently started showing such links in search results on iOS. Developers like Etsy are already seeing a boost in traffic as a result of deep linking. We also added Now cards for more than 100 apps, like OpenTable and Spotify, and we have extended Google Voice actions to third-party developers so you can say things like ""Okay, Google, listen to NPR.""
Alongside our efforts to make mobile better for users, we are continuing to help marketers succeed in today's mobile world. For instance, at I/O, we recently announced Universal App Campaigns, which will let developers easily reach users across Google Search, the AdMob Network, mobile sites, YouTube and Google Play. Marketers just tell us what their ad will say, the audience they want to reach and how much they want to spend and our ad systems will do the rest to help them maximize performance.
We introduced new mobile ad formats, like automobile ads, which take you directly to a carousel of vehicle images, important details, like estimated MPG and links to nearby dealer listings. And just yesterday, we announced purchases on Google, which makes it easier for people searching on Google to buy things right from their mobile phones. 
I want to turn now to YouTube, which is showing strong momentum with users and advertisers as we reinvent the television experience for the digital age.
On mobile alone, YouTube reaches more 18- to 49-year-olds in the U.S. than any U.S. cable network. And the number of users coming to YouTube who start at the YouTube home page similar to the way they might turn on their TV is up over 3x year-on-year. Plus, once users are on YouTube, they are spending more time per session watching videos. On mobile, the average viewing session is now more than 40 minutes, up more than 50% year-over-year.
As consumers continue to shift their content consumption from television to digital, brand dollars are flowing -- are following, which we are seeing in upfront buying through our Google Preferred model. Compared to the same period after Brandcast as last year, Google Preferred commitments in the U.S. were 3x higher. 
We're also seeing great adoption of our video ad formats, like TrueView, and continued help marketers engage and connect with consumers in new ways. The number of advertisers running video ads on YouTube is up more than 40% year-over-year. And for our top 100 advertisers, the average spend per advertiser is up over 60% year-over-year.
We recently introduced a new feature for TrueView that allows brands to automatically insert product information, images and pricing into their video ads. And as advertising increasingly shifts towards programmatic buying, brands can now easily buy TrueView ads programmatically through DoubleClick Bid Manager. All this is helping our content creators build the next generation of media companies doing what they love, making great videos. The number of channels earning 6 figures per year on YouTube is up 50% year-over-year.
One of the key reasons for this success is our content ID initiative, which is used by more than 8,000 partners who have claimed over 400 million videos, helping them control their content on YouTube and make money on videos containing copyrighted material. 
So as you can see, it's been a very busy and successful quarter. We're super focused on our key goals of delivering amazing mobile and video experiences, and there's a lot more coming in the next few months, including the Android M release, Now on Tap, Android Pay and YouTube Gaming. 
Thank you to all the Googlers around the world for their great work every day. Now back to Ruth.",1324

First, I do want to clarify one thing. In my comments on CPCs, I meant to note that the gap between mobile and desktop continues to narrow, obviously, an important trend. I wanted to clarify that. So look, in terms of headcount and data center capabilities and what that does for us, as I've said, in our view, our infrastructure is one of the most strategic assets that we have. And as we talk about what happened in the second quarter, it reflects the fact that there can be some variability in the cadence of spend. And so while overall capital intensity was lower in Q2 than in prior year and prior quarter, it's more an issue of how spend has phased during the year. But the main point is we view computing capacity as a strategic asset. It provides us with the flexibility necessary for growth. And as I tried to convey as well, obviously, it's a priority to achieve efficiencies where possible, in particular, given some of the newer opportunities that we have. And so we're just beginning the 2016 budgeting process. Core to that is prioritization. But it really has been about strategic flexibility and the underlying strength of all that we do.",211

Our performance really reflects the fact that we have a diverse set of products that are doing well. We have strength in core search, obviously, and, in particular, in mobile. YouTube and programmatic, we're seeing a lot of strength. We saw a nice pickup in a number of verticals in Q2 coming off weather-related weakness in Q1. And this quarter, we're seeing retail and travel being stronger verticals in search. As to the second part of the question, I'll have Ruth address that.",86

And I think it's fair to say proper resource allocation stretches across OpEx and CapEx, and it's about prioritizing our investments and ensuring that we're being efficient and effective with our spend. To be clear, the priority is revenue growth, and we have a breadth of opportunity. But pursuing revenue growth is obviously not inconsistent with expense management. And so as I noted, we're just starting the 2016 budgeting process. In my experience, the best way to slow the rate of growth in expenses is to work closely with business leaders really anchored in data, so together, we can identify ways to prioritize resources and really continue to extend the discipline that we've talked about. And given my early conversations with our business leaders, I look forward to this exercise over the next couple of months, and we're very engaged with it.",167

Ruth, can you help us understand Google's position vis-à-vis debt? It's probably not controversial that your debt level is much below your capacity. Are there any reasons why Google would not want to raise debt if it had to finance a large acquisition? And if yes, could you help us understand what these reasons are? And secondly, how do we reconcile the strength in mobile search with the fact that distribution TAC grew only 6% year-on-year?",80
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 16, 2015",2015-07-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3296.0,834463.0,36042695.0,Answer,Ruth Porat,,Executives,15,"So starting with your question about cash, which -- and whether we would issue debt, I think the way I look at that is you're talking about overall efficiency of balance sheet and how are we using the balance sheet. And I've slightly broadened the question more than what you did. But at the end of the today, our focus, my focus, is maximizing shareholder value over the medium to long term, and that is about how effectively are we using our balance sheet, where are we investing. And debt could theoretically be a part of that. But if you step back, as I've looked at it, and the key issue is what do we need for working capital; what do we need for CapEx; what do we need for M&A; what do we need potentially for capital return; how does one think about financing the various opportunities that we have. And I would say it's early days. It would be premature to be more specific than that. But given this profitability of our business, we have many opportunities. Given the growing mix of our business, we have opportunities. I'd say allocation decisions aren't mutually exclusive. Allocation can obviously change as opportunities evolve. But as we look at it, we have a breadth of opportunities. And again, I think it's premature to be more specific on debt at this point.",230

And obviously, you know this well, but that's a good thing because with those TAC dollars comes revenue. As a reminder, TAC includes payments made to search distribution partners as distinct from YouTube and Play content acquisition costs, which are in other cost of revenue. So looking at this on a percentage of revenue basis, what you're seeing is the impact of YouTube revenue growth. Sites revenue was up, but the associated content acquisition costs are reflected in higher other cost of revenue, not in sites TAC.",116

And in fact, that's one of the areas that I really focus on after I came back. And it is a suite of products that we're very proud of and working well for advertisers. And what we like to say internally is we like to have one Google represented to the customer so that in these conversations with them, we really understand their objectives. And really, in the classic sense of the funnel, we can start from the brand journey from the beginning to purchase across search display video. And then, as you know, we recently brought cross-device measurement to DoubleClick. So the focus is really on all aspects of this journey. Online to store, we're showing how mobile ads are driving actual store visits for advertisers. And Brand Lift studies, we're showing brands in real-time, how their ads are performing, done over 10,000 Brand Lift studies on YouTube campaigns alone. So it's -- we're really just excited about having this full suite now and being able to have the full coverage of this customer acquisition journey from branding, all the way to conclusion of a transaction.",192

Do you think it's part of a broader industry trend, the weakness in the upfronts, offline is now coming online? Or is -- what else specifically -- what specifically is YouTube doing to kind of better capture those dollars? And then, Ruth, I know somebody asked you about debt. The logical follow-on question is other cash returns and share repurchases and dividends.

So it's -- I think it's really a combination of all of the strengths of YouTube coming together. It starts with having over 1 billion users, really almost 1/3 of all people on the Internet every day watching hundreds of millions of hours on the service, and that creates billions of views. And as Ruth mentioned, the growth in watch time in YouTube accelerated and is now up over 60% year-over-year, the fastest we've seen in a couple of years. And I think we're doing also a much better job with our products and our sales force to not only deliver for the creators on YouTube and do a better job of helping them monetize their content and, at the same time, then highlighting that success through programs like Brandcast, where advertisers, agencies see that dynamic audience and service. And then with advertising products, be able to then show them the real benefits of advertising and the ways that they can measure its effectiveness. So it's really all the pieces coming together for us. And obviously, we have a lot of work to do, and we see still a lot of opportunity to enhance the service. So I think you'll see a lot of innovation coming from us, both on the service front as well as on the advertising products.",228

But the way I view any assessment of a return on capital or my prior answer regarding balance sheet efficiency is really in the context of maximizing stakeholder value over the medium to long term. And with return of capital, it gets into the context of, well, how do you prioritize and allocate cash after an appropriate reserve for working capital amongst CapEx, M&A and then, potentially, that capital return. And as I said, the allocation decisions aren't mutually exclusive. The profitability of our business gives us many opportunities. But the main point is, to date, the biggest return on investment here has been in our core search business, including mobile search, as a result of both smart M&A and CapEx. And through M&A, we built a lot of the growth engines today. YouTube and DoubleClick are great examples. Again, this underscores the power of smart, targeted acquisitions. We also have a strong track record of investment in new products, as you know well, and the infrastructure to support explosive growth. Our tech infrastructure, as I've already commented on, is really unparalleled, and we do view it as a great strategic asset. And we've invested in it substantially over many years. So trying to gauge whether or how capital return fits in. It's premature to do that, and it's really looking across these various potential uses.",234

Thanks, Eric, for the question. We're really focused on connecting retailers to consumers across screens and also reducing this friction involved in finding and purchasing products, including local products in stores. So that entire journey and that all the aspects of commerce is a great area of focus for us. And as users begin to -- as they start their searches on mobile phones, we're continuously trying to find ways to improve the mobile shopping experience. And as the shopping experiences on these smartphones become easier and we focus on improving mobile conversions for advertisers, we're seeing great benefits from that. We just announced the purchases on Google, for example, is a smart-only -- smartphone-only feature of the Product Listing Ads as an example. And again, all of these are really, for us, the building blocks to help in reduction of that friction and bring the expertise we have in that understanding the immediacy, the local nature of these searches and understanding conversion and how to kind of put it all together for our users and for advertisers and merchants.",181

Omid, can you talk more specifically about the cross-platform efforts and estimated conversions, in particular, and whether you're seeing that prove more of the value across the platform? And then, secondly, you commented several times that the gap is tightening on pricing between mobile and desktop. Can you quantify that by any chance? And can you just talk about what you think drives that to tighten further going forward?",80

Maybe I'll have Ruth take that second part. On the first part on this online to offline conversion efforts, we obviously know that mobile activities are influencing offline behavior, and we're very busy investing in new dynamic products that help bring mobile users to stores. We're seeing strong results from clients using our tools to bridge this digital and physical world and great adoption of local inventory ads, which help advertisers promote their store items to nearby shoppers. So again, that's how the whole cycle of usage of smartphones and the immediacy come together. And then we've created a way for advertisers to measure the impact of these ads on store visits. So just to give you a couple of examples. Target, one of our advertisers found that mobile search ads greatly influence in-store sales. And using our store visits data, they found that 1/3 of their paid search ads resulted in a user visiting a Target store during 2014 holiday season. So we love to continue working with them and other advertisers to show the results and then build on that. A Florida department store working with us found that 63% of their mobile influence sales take place offline. And so more and more we're doing these studies, we're putting tools together for the advertisers and our partners, the merchants, and finding ways for them to really quantify these benefits and just scale these programs for everyone.",239

Mobile CPCs up and desktop CPCs not declining. So the gap is narrowing. On the mobile side, as Larry said before with respect to desktop, it took time to fully develop the pricing model. And we remain focused on building the mobile ecosystem to have the right ad formats and measurement tools to take advantage of all the platform has to offer. Features like estimated store visits, app install, reengagement ads, cross-device conversions are all part of this strategy. And then on desktop, the business continues to grow. It remains a good contributor to overall results. As we announced at the AdWords Performance Summit in May, ongoing developments in rich and useful ads that work across all screens, including desktop, enable us to deliver the right answers for our users in the right moment, in other words, ad formats that accelerate time to conversion on both mobile and desktop, and that's what's really narrowing this gap here.",181

The first one, Ruth, going back to your comments on some of the earlier-stage projects, Fiber, Life Science, et cetera, and being focused on tight governance. Is there any way you can kind of help us think about OpEx or CapEx related to those projects at this point and how we should think about maintenance versus investment, OpEx and CapEx going forward? And then the second one, just going back to the accelerating U.S. revenue growth. It sounds like mobile and YouTube are both doing pretty well. Can you just help us understand, are you seeing both decelerate? Is U.S. search accelerating at this point? Or is it more so being driven by YouTube?",117
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 16, 2015",2015-07-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3296.0,834463.0,36042717.0,Answer,Ruth Porat,,Executives,37,"Sure. So let me take your first question, first part of your question first. In terms of overall kind of the framework for thinking about our businesses broadly, I think a valuable framework to use is one that Eric and Larry have referred to for many years, namely the 70% 2010, 70% resources on the core, 20% on adjacent areas. At one point, that included Chrome and Android, and they are now in the core. But it would include things like cloud, and then 10% in additional new exciting opportunities and really sizable markets, like Fiber or what we're doing with Google Life Sciences. And so in discussing this with Larry, it's clear his objective has been to instill within the culture this mission to drive not just important innovation associated with our core business but also to look for -- he's called them revolutionary ideas, big solutions that can meaningfully contribute both to making people's lives better and to the next big revenue and earnings growth opportunity for Google. And my take is that Larry views the 70% 2010 as an instructive framework. He's also noted how hard it is to reach that 10% on these big, new revolutionary ideas because it's tough to get people to tackle big, difficult, new problems instead of pursuing incremental change. So human nature sort of provides a limit on how big that final bucket would be, the new opportunities. And I think the other point to consider is that Google's core business continues to deliver strong growth. So to achieve 10% in the big new areas means continually trying to reach 10% of an even larger number. And the framework keeps us focused on being ambitious across the company. But given the success of the core business, I think it's fair to say the 10% is a stretch goal for now and it's a way to think about resources, which hopefully helps you fill in a bit there. And then the second part of your question, if you could repeat that?",339

I was just wondering, you've talked a lot about desktop and mobile CPCs. I was wondering if you could share with us if the narrowing of the gap between the two is actually starting to accelerate. And then the other thing I wanted to ask is, just thinking about the CapEx spending waves that companies go through, and clearly, Google has been on one, on an accelerating spending wave for the last few years, should we then suggest -- get from your comments, where you're in a digestion period, that the digestion period could also be a multi-year trend as well? If there's any thoughts you could share there.",115

And to give a sense of some of the mix issues within CPCs, so mobile CPCs strengthening, desktop not declining. YouTube remains lower, but we're seeing real strong growth in TrueView. And so it's just really to try and dimension it as you think about what's going on with the mix change. And then as it relates to expenses, what I was trying to convey there is that we, in the second quarter, had a bit of a digestion period here on the back of the substantial investment spend that we've had. And I would say in terms of if you kind of think about the second quarter in that context, there can be some variability in the cadence of spend. And so part of it, as we're talking about CapEx here, is really how spend has phased during the year. I wouldn't suggest that we're talking about, as the way you frame the question, this multi-period, given just a sheer scope of opportunities that we have. So as I said, at the front-end, with respect to both CapEx and OpEx, we're just beginning the 2016 budgeting process. We're very focused on prioritization. But I was trying to give some context for what was going on in the second quarter. And then as it relates to OpEx, in terms of the back half of the year, there are seasonal fluctuations that do typically impact operating expense as well. For example, headcount usually picks up in the third quarter with new grad hires starting. And our marketing expense also tends to be weighted toward the second half of the year. So again, I was just trying to give you a sense of what's the cadence as you're thinking about the year.",315

So Yahoo! is currently testing search results and ads from a number of partners, including Google, as one of their options. And they have options to use search services and search ads across their properties. And you may see our ads. And this is a standard agreement. And many other publishers use our web search and AdSense for search. We look forward to working with them and hopefully having a good performance for them.",80

I'm committed to being direct with you. I won't give you competitively sensitive information, but my goal is to help you understand the business as well as possible. And my view, it's our obligation to pursue activities that maximize value over the long term and doing it in a disciplined fashion. And the point I'm really trying to drive here is I aim to create a framework that helps you understand where we're going. So you're asking, what do we think about breaking out any particular business, I'm trying to understand how best to provide more insight into the drivers of the business and beyond what is currently provided, and it's really too early to be more specific than that.",175

29096.0,"Google Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 16, 2015",2015-07-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3296.0,834463.0,36042728.0,Question,Paul Vogel,,Analysts,48,"Two questions on YouTube. One, there's been a lot of speculation in the past about the profitability of YouTube. So I'm just sort of curious how you think about the revenue growth versus kind of the forward spend on forward demand. And is YouTube in a position where it's starting to see leverage on the upside with the strong revenue growth? And then on the revenue side, in particular, you talked about how YouTube has been sort of a -- it's one of the things that sort of drags the optics of CPC down. When mobile was doing that, I think the company believed that over time, mobile would be additive and we're starting to see it but it took some time. How do you think about YouTube in the context of is there a point in time where you think YouTube will actually be additive to sort of the optics of CPC versus where it is right now?",159
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 16, 2015",2015-07-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3296.0,834463.0,36042729.0,Answer,Ruth Porat,,Executives,49,"So I think there were 3 parts to that question. In terms of the revenue growth in YouTube, Omid hit a number of them, but we continue to have strong growth there and it really does reflect, as he said, the sheer volume of users. We have over 1 billion users, and those users are spending more time watching. Watch time growth continues to accelerate, now up over 60% year-over-year, the fastest rate we've seen in 2 years. And we do view watch time as the most valuable measure of engagement. And it does reflect the ongoing improvement in ads quality, with more users also choosing to watch more TrueView ads. Not only do we have a huge user base that's highly engaged, but data points like the fact there are more 18 to 49 year olds on mobile YouTube than watching cable TV today really underscores the opportunity here. And our focus is the opportunity to get larger budgets move to YouTube. And then in terms of the profitability question, as you know, we don't break out profit by product, and we view our technical infrastructure as a core strategic asset that supports products across the company. I've already said that on this call that it's an important point. It's fair to say that much of the network expense is supporting YouTube. It's a large user of capacity. And our ability to serve high-quality HD video on demand around the world is unparalleled. From the user's perspective, YouTube is a great example of a multi-device platform, with high usage on both desktop and mobile. We have 1 ad team that works across our various products. And when we work with the largest ad partners globally, we're selling a total package. Omid has commented on some of that. Not surprisingly, if you take our top advertisers, they all advertise across all our products, not necessarily at the same rate. But we have a single team working with them to close the differential. We do view that as a great opportunity. And the goal, to give just a bit more color on how some of our assets, some technical infrastructure and ad sales team benefit a number of our different products across the company. And then I think you slipped a third part in there on the status of kind of CPC trends and YouTube TrueView pricing. So I'll just close out on that. CPC pricing on YouTube for TrueView ads, ads that users choose not to skip is lower than on CPC pricing on desktop and mobile. But YouTube TrueView ads represented a larger percentage of our overall clicks, so had a greater impact on CPCs. And this is really about the tremendous growth in YouTube views. And not, again, when we see the real uptake here and the extent to which users are choosing to watch more ads given our effort around ad relevance and quality, advertisers want to reach these audiences. And our focus is on the opportunity to get larger budgets move to YouTube.",507

We turned in a strong performance in the third quarter, notwithstanding continued meaningful currency headwinds. The key highlight this quarter was the substantial growth of our mobile search revenue, complemented by ongoing strong contributions from YouTube and our programmatic business. I will first give you a summary of the quarter, followed by specific financial details and conclude with comments regarding our upcoming move to segment reporting. Sundar will then review the business and product highlights of the quarter. After which, we will take your questions.
Beginning with a summary of our financial performance. Total revenue was $18.7 billion, up 13% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. As a result of the ongoing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we realized a negative currency impact on our revenues of $1.6 billion or $1.3 billion after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 21% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. On a GAAP basis, operating profit was $4.7 billion, and the operating margin was 25%. On a non-GAAP basis, operating profit was $6.1 billion, and the operating margin was 33%. GAAP operating income was up 26% versus last year, and GAAP net income from continuing operations was up 36% year-over-year.
As a reminder, the year-on-year increases reflect a non-cash impairment charge of $378 million in the third quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP operating income was up 15% year-over-year, and non-GAAP net income was up 19% year-over-year.
GAAP earnings per diluted share were $5.73. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $7.35. As detailed in the earnings slides on our IR website, stock-based compensation totaled $1.4 billion, up 14% year-over-year and up 27% sequentially.
With respect to stock-based compensation, the increase reflects the fact that our annual equity refresh grants were made in the third quarter as well as headcount growth. Headcount increased 16% versus last year and 5% versus 2Q '15. Sequential growth reflects typical seasonality with new grads starting, the vast majority of whom are engineers and product managers.
Let me now turn to key elements of our financial statements. Starting with our primary revenue sources. Google sites revenue was $13.1 billion, up 16% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially, notwithstanding currency headwinds. Year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter growth reflects substantial strength in mobile search due to ongoing improvement in ad formats and delivery to better address how consumers use their mobile devices.
YouTube revenue continues to grow at a significant rate, with growth driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView and Google Preferred. Network revenue was $3.7 billion, up 4% year-on-year and up 2% sequentially, continuing to reflect the significant growth of programmatic, offset by the traditional network businesses.
Other revenue was $1.9 billion, up 11% year-over-year and up 11% sequentially. Given the geographic mix of our Play business, FX also had an impact on other revenue. Year-over-year growth was driven by Google for Work, including cloud, as well as continued strong growth in Play. Both were offset by the absence of revenues included in 3Q '14 from a licensing agreement and lower hardware sales as we reached the end of life cycles for certain Chromecast and Nexus devices.
Next, let me discuss revenues by geography, which will highlight the impact currency headwinds continue to have on our non-U.S. business. U.S. revenue was up 19% year-over-year to $8.8 billion and up 9% versus Q2. U.K. revenue was up 10% year-over-year to $1.8 billion and up 7% sequentially. In fixed FX terms, the U.K. grew 18% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter. Rest of World revenue was up 7% versus last year to $8.1 billion and up 2% versus Q2. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 23% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. The acceleration in U.S. and U.K. growth in particular reflect the growth in mobile search.
Finally, on monetization. As a reminder, these metrics similarly are affected by currency movements. Aggregate paid clicks grew 23% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Aggregate CPCs were down 11% year-over-year and 1% sequentially.
In terms of the drivers within Google sites, paid clicks were up 35% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially. Google site CPCs were down 16% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. The movement in Google sites paid clicks and CPCs primarily reflects the continued growth in YouTube TrueView.
Network paid clicks were down 5% year-over-year and flat sequentially, reflecting the impact of our ongoing policy changes designed to reduce lower quality inventory on AdSense for search, consistent with our focus on improving the user experience. Network CPCs were down 4% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially.
Let me now turn to expenses. Total traffic acquisition costs were $3.6 billion or 21% of total advertising revenue, essentially flat as a percentage of revenue sequentially and down slightly year-over-year. As a reminder, the site's TAC line includes the TAC that we pay to search distribution partners for distributing Google Search as distinct from their own branded search.
Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $3.2 billion in Q3, up 16% year-over-year, primarily driven by costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation as well as content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube and Play.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $5.7 billion or 31% of revenue, up 14% year-over-year and up 7% versus Q2. The increase in operating expense versus comparable periods was primarily driven by R&D expense. A breakout of individual operating expense lines is available on our earnings slides. Other income and expense was $183 million. The effective tax rate was 19% for the third quarter.
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. CapEx for the quarter was $2.4 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, data center construction and facilities. Operating cash flow was $6 billion, with free cash flow of $3.6 billion.
Finally, turning to cash. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $73 billion, of which approximately $42 billion or 58% is held overseas. As we announced today, our board has authorized us to commence a repurchase of our Class C capital stock of up to $5,099,019,513.59. This decision is consistent with our overall capital management framework and complements a disciplined capital allocation program. Our primary uses of capital will, of course, remain CapEx and M&A across the breadth of our businesses.
So now let me conclude. Starting in the fourth quarter with our move to segment reporting, we intend to provide additional detail for Google on the one hand and all the other Alphabet businesses on the other hand. We refer to those other Alphabet businesses as Other Bets. We expect Other Bets to include, among others, access in energy, Nest, life sciences, our investment arms and X, which is where driverless cars and certain other incubation efforts reside. Specifically, we intend to disclose for both Google and Other Bets revenues, profitability and CapEx. By doing this, we expect that you will be better able to understand how we manage the businesses, including the pace and allocation of our investments. As Larry said in his CEO letter announcing Alphabet, we are focused on rigorously managing capital allocation and working to make sure each business is executing well.
With that preface, let me turn to 4 key themes. First, in terms of revenues, our strong revenue growth in Q3 reflects the ongoing momentum in Google, with acceleration in mobile search complemented by the strength of YouTube and programmatic. The Other Bets are earlier-stage businesses, which we believe have significant longer-term revenue potential. In the near term, the focus there is on optimizing our investments.
Second, with respect to profitability, we remain focused on managing expenses within our control while investing to support the growth areas we have in Google and Other Bets. Segment reporting by definition provides greater insight into the profit dynamics within Alphabet.
Third, as to CapEx, the vast majority to date, of course, has been to support Google, where we continue to invest given our exciting opportunities globally. At the same time, CapEx in Other Bets is expected to increase through next year as we continue to execute on the growth agenda there. In particular, in access and energy, which contains our Fiber business among other efforts.
Fourth, our growing cash balance remains a powerful tool, giving us the flexibility to invest in the breadth of opportunities we have within Google and Other Bets as well as to selectively pursue compelling new bets.
I will now turn the call over to Sundar, who will go into more detail regarding our business trends and products.",1406
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2015",2015-10-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3270.0,881195.0,37790632.0,Presenter Speech,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Ruth.
I'm glad to be here with you all today to talk about the areas we are focused on now and in the future at Google. There is a real sense of energy and focus throughout the company, and we are seeing momentum across our businesses. Products like Search, Android, Maps, Chrome and YouTube each have over 1 billion users already, and Google Play crossed that milestone this quarter as well. But what's most exciting is that we are just beginning to scratch the surface.
We know that computing transforms people's lives. We have gone from the PC revolution to the Internet revolution to the mobile revolution. And 10 years from now, everything will be different again in ways no one can predict.
Our vision is for Google to remain a place of incredible creativity and innovation that uses our unique technical expertise to tackle big problems and create that future. We do this arm in arm with our partners around the world.
Today, I want to touch on 3 key areas that are important for us. First, making information accessible and useful. Then, how we are building computing platforms used by billions of people. And lastly, how we are driving growth in our core advertising business as well as new emerging businesses.
Let's start with the first area. Google's core mission has always been to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. Search continues to be at the center of this, with people turning to Search on mobile every day to find quick answers. In fact, Search traffic on mobile phones have now surpassed desktop traffic worldwide.
We're also seeing strong mobile momentum in many emerging markets like India, which is the #2 country for mobile search queries behind the U.S. This is the result of our laser focus on helping users quickly find the right information. People just want to be able to find the information they are looking for on mobile without having to worry about whether it lives on the mobile web or within apps. Mobile app usage as well as web usage is accelerating significantly.
We have now indexed more than 100 billion-deep links within third-party apps. So if you're looking for information that lives within an app, we'll surface it as a result and even give you an install link if you don't already have it.
The teams have made great progress, and 40% of searches now return app indexed results in the top 5 results. These investments have gone well, and you'll continue to see us push in this area.
We also continue to improve the Google app. For instance, app developers can now build conversational voice experiences that work within the Google app. So if you ask Google to play NPR, NPR will respond by asking if you want to pick up where you left off or catch up on the latest news. It's also very important that we help to make the mobile web better and faster for users, both through our own products and by partnering with others.
Working with over 30 publication and technology partners, we recently announced an open source initiative called Accelerated Mobile Pages to make it easy for publishers and content creators to build superfast web pages for their content. This will help make the mobile web a better, more enjoyable experience for users.
I also want to point out that our investments in machine learning and artificial intelligence are a priority for us. Machine learning has long-powered things like voice search, translation and much more. And our machine learning is hard at work in mobile services like Now on Tap, which quickly assists you by providing additional useful information for whatever you're doing, right in the moment, anywhere on your phone. If you're an Android user that runs Marshmallow, try it out by long pressing the home button when you're in an app. It's very cool.
Another example is the Google Photos app, which leverages powerful machine learning technology to help people discover, organize and share their photos. It's a great product that people love. In fact, in just a few months since we launched it at Google I/O, Photos is now used by over 100 million users, who have collectively uploaded more than 50 billion photos and videos.
Now I want to talk about how we are building computing platforms that are used by billions of people. We'll continue to invest in large open ecosystems that we build with partners to reach great scale. Android is a prime example of this, and we are seeing exciting momentum on our platform. There are more than 1.4 billion 30-day active Android users around the world, and we are beginning to roll out Android Marshmallow, which is our best performing release yet. Working with partners Huawei and LG, we announced the newest devices joining our Nexus family, the Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X. They're beautiful and powerful devices that show off the latest and greatest that Android has to offer, and they've garnered tremendous reviews so far. We also announced the Pixel C, which is the first Android tablet built end to end by Google that brings together the benefits of a full-sized keyboard with the portability of a tablet.
We're also creating platforms for newer areas of computing, such as Android Wear, which now works with iOS as well; Android Auto, the Internet of Things platform that we unveiled at I/O; Brillo and of course, Chrome. Chrome also powers Chromecast and our recent Chromecast update gave it a refreshed look and faster performance. We also introduced Chromecast Audio, which lets you stream your favorite music from your phone to any set of speakers.
To date, we have sold over 20 million Chromecast devices and have seen over 1.5 billion taps of the cast button since we launched.
We're also seeing great momentum in our ads business. Our value proposition to marketers of all sizes is simple. Google can help you show the right ads to the right people at the right moment. As you've heard on these calls before, we are seeing a major shift in consumer behavior to its micro moments. These are moments of high intent and consumers are looking to find, buy or do something. They happen throughout the day, most often on mobile devices.
The single biggest theme throughout our advertising business is to help small businesses, large marketers, agencies and content creators to take advantage of this mobile opportunity. In search advertising, there's a huge amount going on. Advertisers like Dunkin' Donuts and Airbnb are turning to mobile search to capitalize on these key moments, reach customers and create engaging local experiences. We also recently made search ads and Google Play available to all developers, letting app developers find new customers for their app at a great price where it matters. Many smart developers are already taking advantage of this. At Ad Week, we introduced Customer Match, which lets marketers reach their existing customers with customized search ads on google.com as well as ads on YouTube and Gmail. Of course, these are really valuable for reaching key customers at moments of high intent on mobile devices. With the holiday season coming up, we are investing in providing great shopping experiences on mobile. We are also helping marketers understand how search ads are driving in-store sales with products like store visits, which uses our unique mobile location capabilities, and is easy for any business to implement.
Moving to YouTube. Every day, people watch hundreds of millions of hours on YouTube. You know from the last quarterly call about the amazing momentum that YouTube has in mobile, and it's largely coming from the YouTube app. The growth in mobile watch time also extends to videos featuring product reviews and information. People turn to YouTube, and they want to research, buy or fix a product. For example, mobile watch time for apparel videos has doubled this year, and videos about toys have also doubled. We see the same growth in advertising on the platform, too. And we continue to invest in building ways for marketers to reach consumers effectively like our recently announced shopping ads for YouTube, which lets people shop directly from a video, turning any relevant video into your digital store front.
And in programmatic video on display, the strong momentum continues. The number of advertisers using our programmatic solutions has nearly doubled in the last 1.5 years and now includes over 80% of Ad Age's top 100 advertisers. Additionally, both mobile and video impressions served on DoubleClick Bid Manager have grown more than 3.5x since last year. This is an area that's on fire for us right now, and you'll see us to continue to invest in creating the best programmatic solutions for advertisers and agencies.
Before I close, I want to touch on a few of our emerging businesses where we see enormous opportunities. First, digital content. Google Play continues to be a thriving hub for our digital content business, now with over 1 billion users. And just yesterday, I was really pleased that we announced YouTube Red, our YouTube subscription service for just $9.99 a month. It enables you to see videos on YouTube without ads, watch them off-line or keep playing videos when you lock your screen or start using another application.
Additionally, our Google for Work business is seeing tremendous growth. In the third quarter, we crossed 1 million paying active customers using Google Drive at work. Cloud is also a growing area where we see great opportunity, and we are building a fantastic service that we'll keep investing in. Our momentum in the education space continues as well, with more than 50 million Google apps for education uses worldwide and over 10 million teachers and students using Google Classroom since it launched a year ago. There are also 30,000 new Chrome books activated in schools in the U.S. every school day. That's more than all other devices combined.
So to wrap up, we have tremendous new opportunities in our new and existing businesses. We are really excited by the products and platforms that we are building for people everywhere in the world. And we are passionate about the transformative power of computing to improve people's lives in the years ahead.
Thank you to everyone for your keen interest in our business, and thank you to all of the Googlers around the world for another great quarter.
And with that, I will hand it back to Ruth.",1755

Could you talk about the sustainability of the mobile search revenue growth that you see there? Is that just really being driven by finally the gapping up of kind of mobile search pricing versus desktop pricing? Or is there something else going on? And then Ruth, I was just trying to figure out how you came up with that, that your repurchase number, and I've been googling that number a couple of times. I can see it's 26 to the E18th of the square root of that. But outside of that, how did you come up with that particular amount of share buyback? Why not more? Why not less?",111
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2015",2015-10-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3270.0,881195.0,37790636.0,Answer,Ruth Porat,,Executives,7,"Thanks, Mark. So starting on the sustainability of mobile revenue growth. As I said in my opening comments, revenue growth really reflects continued improvement in ad formats and delivery. And that's on top of what's a really strong industry-wide global growth in mobile usage, as you know well. And then we regularly adjust the way we present ads. So we expanded ad space in some queries with particularly high commercial intent to display more relevant mobile-friendly ads. And our view is just as we saw consumer behavior change on desktop, we're seeing the same on mobile. And as Sundar said, we continue to believe we're in very early innings here. And then in terms of sizing, so this is the way we approached it. If I take you back to the capital framework that I laid out last quarter, it's defined primarily by CapEx and M&A, but also includes working capital and a buffer as well as a potential return of capital. And we remain focused on solving the biggest problems and solving them at scale, and that presents sizable potential revenue opportunities with a key catalyst for creating Alphabet. But these all -- opportunities also require investment. And so the focus of our team is on prioritizing these opportunities over a multiyear period. We look out -- kind of as we're modeling it out a number of years. And then working with the board, we reviewed our outlook, we reviewed the opportunity set, and we concluded that layering in this action at this time complements what we view as a very disciplined budgeting process while still, very importantly, providing ample capacity to pursue the growth agenda. And then applying this framework,  once we had come up with a size that we believe fits and consistent with the way we do things around here, we decided to come up with some fun math similar to the way we approached sizing the IPO. It sounds like you've fit -- backed right into what that was. We do view it as the right action at the right time, and it really is anchored in the framework.",354

Ruth, so back to the mobile search question, the bare [ph] case on Google has been the company's ability or lack thereof to port the search business model from PC over to mobile. And you called out mobile search as the key driver of acceleration in both the U.S. and the U.K. So can you just give us a little bit of more color around the volume trends that you're seeing between desktop and mobile as you cross that 50% threshold that you talked about last quarter? And then Sundar, on the platform side, it seems like every few years, new companies crop up as the next big Android OEM. Looks like it's Huawei now. It's been other companies in the past. How do you plan on getting Android to a point where all these OEMs can build successful businesses on the back of it? And any update on when Google plans to roll out the Play Store in China would be helpful.",172

Clearly, as I said, mobile search revenue was up significantly, and it was an important catalyst in the quarter. But the very important thing to note, as we discussed also last quarter, is that desktop remains a solid contributor. And so we continue to have a healthy growth there. And when we look -- if you step back overall sites revenue, we're firing on all cylinders, really strong growth in mobile, desktop's healthy and continuing to grow, and then you layer on top of it YouTube and some of the color that Sundar added there. But that's really a continuation of what we talked about last quarter as well.",117

In just over a year, we've gone from 1 billion to 1.4 billion users. So obviously, that translates into huge opportunities for OEMs, and that's what we are seeing. Especially, there are whole new markets opening up. There's the next billion users coming online in emerging markets. And businesses, I mean [ph] enterprises, a whole opportunity for OEMs as well.

Sundar, in 2 parts, if you take a 3-year view, what are the 3 main milestones you think you need to reach to be successful as Google's CEO? And what do you think would be the externally observable consequences of achieving these milestones? And Ruth, in the last call, you talked about the 70%, 20%, 10% framework. Can you help us understand what this 70%, 20%, 10% applies to? Is it related to operating expenses, all expenses and costs in the P&L, CapEx, R&D, management time?

In terms of how I think about it, I think we are fortunate to have an incredibly broad mission statement. Organizing the world's information turns out to be something that -- there's a lot of room ahead. We are still in the early days, especially with mobile. I think you have a computing platform that's going to reach -- it's already reached half the world's population or on its way to reach the entirety of the human population in about 5 to 10 years. So we want to stay focused on that, both from an information standpoint and a computing standpoint. I think of them as 2 sides of the same coin and making sure we are building the right user experience for that, and so that's what I'm focused on.",133

And for me, one of the many very important statements from the founders that explains this framework is when they said in their -- in the letters years ago and repeated since: Incrementalism in technology leads to irrelevance and thus innovation is critical. And so this mantra is really about pushing people to look at new areas, invest in newer areas, look for things that are adjacent, the 20%, and even the unrelated big bets, the 10%. It's not intended to be a specific guide to financial modeling. I think with our move to segment reporting, we look forward to giving you more information next quarter, which should be helpful there but directionally to talk about philosophically how do we think about our approach to the business.",163

This question is for Ruth. I was just wondering, given you're likely in the midst of 2016 business planning right now, can you share with us the way in which you're approaching budgeting versus maybe how it was done last year?

There's been a very strong foundation here on budgeting and the approach and setting an envelope and working very closely with business leaders on what that envelope should be, and we are in the midst of it as I said last quarter. But emphasize our priority remains revenue growth and that doesn't give us a pass on a rigorous approach to expense growth. And that's where we're focused. So I think really what was very encouraging for me is there is a framework, a very strong approach to financial planning and analysis and really building on that to make sure we have reasonable-but-tight envelopes so that we can have the right conversations collectively, collaboratively with our business leaders to assess how we can look at optimizing all of our resources, and that's what it really comes down to is looking at how to manage the rate of growth of expenses while still supporting our growth initiatives.

I guess, could you just talk to some of the qualitative drivers that are really bringing more advertising dollars onto YouTube? And then I think last quarter, you'd mentioned the top 100 advertiser spend was up 60% year-on-year on YouTube. I wondered if you could update us on that? And the second one on Search, it sounds like mobile is accelerating. Where are you now in the mobile-versus-desktop monetization gap? And Sundar, how do you think about that long term? Do you see mobile being higher? Reaching equilibrium? How do you see that trending?",100

Obviously, users are following that. You're seeing it in YouTube as well as elsewhere in mobile. And so advertisers are being increasingly conscious. They are being very, very responsive, and so we are seeing great traction there, and we'll continue to see that. They are moving more of their traditional budgets to YouTube, and that's where we are getting traction. On mobile search, to me, increasingly, we see -- we already announced that over 50% of our searches are on mobile. Mobile gives us very unique opportunities in terms of better understanding users. And over time, as we use things like machine learning, I think we can make great strides. So my long-term view on this is it is as compelling or, in fact, even better than desktop, but it will take us time to get there. And we're going to be focused till we get there.",170

I'm sort of curious about the various business models you've now put in front of consumers, subscription versus advertising versus pay per unit like on Google Play.

To me, we wanna stay focused on the user experience, and we wanna follow what users want, right? So if you take something like YouTube, we expect most users to consume YouTube the way it has been, and advertising has been a strong part of providing that content for free to those users. And it's growing very, very well. But we also see a need for certain uses and certain scenarios, be it music or gaming or for premium content, to experience it in a different way, and we want to make sure we do that. So we don't have a prescriptive opinion on this as much as we will provide the right user experience and follow where it goes, and that applies to Google Play as well.",129

Ruth, it really does seem like there's been a change in the management philosophy this year as far as kind of expense discipline in 2Q also have seen the disclosures and now you've got the buyback announcement. Can you talk about the change there, if there has been one? And how you think about that? And then the second thing, we are pretty focused on the cloud over here. Google -- we don't have a number. It's in your other revenues, but Amazon's probably $8 billion plus run rate; Microsoft, over $1.5 billion. Just wondering if you can give us any thoughts on your cloud strategy and how you're thinking about using those really strong data center assets?",120

On expenses and expense management and clearly a lot of the foundation here has -- was laid some time ago. I think after a period of big expense buildup, there was an appreciation that we needed to manage the cadence of spend, and that's what we're doing. And collectively, we're locked arm in arm to make sure that there is resource prioritization. I think that's an important part of it. We have an extraordinary set of opportunities, not just within Google but across the Alphabet businesses. And we need to ensure that prioritization is a key part of all that we do. I would note that when you're looking at some of the expenses, operating expenses as an example, when we look forward to the fourth quarter, in particular given the hardware launches that we've done here with the Nexus, Chromecast and Pixel launches, consistent with prior device launches, we would expect higher sales and marketing. And I realized I'm getting a little more specific than your question, but I think it's very important to note that there are also certain patterns to some of these, similarly with CapEx. CapEx is -- it's been a bit more muted here. And I indicated last quarter that we're in a bit of a digestion period. But when you look forward to 2016, we do see accelerated investment given the nature of the businesses that we're building up here. So I want also just keep -- make sure we keep things in perspective. And I think it's just -- it's been an extraordinary experience joining this team. I think that with the move to Alphabet, it gives us the opportunity to then provide some greater insight into the extraordinary operating performance within Google and breakout so you can see the investments that we're doing. And we're working very tightly as a senior team here as we make that next step into this new environment in Alphabet.",333

I think it just reflects as a secular shift. Every business in the world is going to run on cloud eventually, and so we view that as an amazing opportunity. We are uniquely qualified to do so. As you pointed out, we have tremendous experiences in running large scale cloud services. And it's been only in the past 2 years, in earnest, we've been taking those assets and serving customers outside. For me, what's exciting is as I look at new customer adoption, we are seeing tremendous momentum.

So overall, it's a shift in a computing Paradigm. So it's not just form factors. And so over time, we see all of this as together. What matters to us is as people evolve their computing paradigm, search transitions to that world, and we are the best source to provide that information.

On the ad block stuff, it's not a new phenomenon. I think it's important to understand that ads today fund almost all the services which people use, including products like Google Search, Google Maps, many, many third-party products. For publishers, it represents the majority of their revenues. And I think users are okay with the contract, and we need to make sure it works well. It's also clear that there are areas where the ad experience is getting in the way. It affects performance, and so we as an industry need to collectively do all that better. And so we are going to work hard to do that, and so we want to make sure we transition areas like the mobile web to have better ad experiences. But overall, I think we are used to this.

And as I said, that's primarily defined by, obviously, the opportunity, but how do we support the growth? That's about capital expenditure and about M&A. And those are really the anchor pillars in our capital framework. And then beyond that, there's working capital and a buffer and then the potential return of capital. We've talked about the fact that we have 6 products that have over 1 billion users. 3 of those were through acquisitions, YouTube, Android and Maps. That is not lost on us. And then you layer on top of that DoubleClick, that was also through acquisition. So we have viewed -- and at that time, it wasn't clear. I'd say to everybody that those would end up being the incredibly powerful businesses, effective businesses for users that they are today. And so it remains a part of what we consider.

And I wouldn't assume that, that's the plan. What we're really looking at is how do we continue to broaden the nature of issues that we're able to address. What we want with Alphabet is to be an extraordinary magnet, the best magnet for entrepreneurs and to be an accelerant for their development and to give them that -- the kind of environment where we can continue to thrive and therefore, build great businesses that generate tremendous returns as well for our stakeholders on top of solving big problems.

So as this is your first conference call with investors, where do you think you are on that initiative today? Are you still on the same path? Or do you plan to take that in a different direction in your new role? And now Ruth, despite the high growth of YouTube and Play presumably, your cost of goods sold where the content costs for these 2 businesses live is not growing as rapidly? So will you give some color on where you might be driving [ph] the leverage?",125

To me, the way I think about it is mobile is a good forcing function in some ways. It's a good constraint for us to focus and deliver against that vision. So what I'm doing is internally, all our objectives are primarily focused on mobile and how, within the context of mobile, we get to a better, simpler and a consistent experience for consumers and advertisers. And so that framework is how we are thinking about it, and I think we are making solid progress.",105

That's in there as well as well as content acquisition costs, as you said, primarily YouTube and Play. One thing to note, as we look forward to the fourth quarter with the launch of Nexus, Chromecast and Pixel, it's worth noting that we do book the hardware costs in this line.",78

When you talk about the strength in mobile search, are you including also searches that are done on some of your mobile apps like a search done on the Maps app or on the mobile YouTube app? And then kind of somewhat related, I guess, is you have, I think, it's 6 apps that have over 1 billion users globally but have some -- some of these you're not really monetizing today or very nascent stages. Can you talk about kind of your efforts maybe to monetize some of these large and actively used apps? And maybe identify 1 or 2 where you're -- I guess this is for Sundar, where you're particularly sort of excited about the opportunities?",131

On the first one, I mean, we are -- you're specifically talking about the mobile search experience on google.com or the Google App, but we are seeing the same traction within Maps or YouTube. We are seeing mobile usage dramatically grow, and in that context, people are searching as well. So it's across the board we are seeing strength. In terms of our apps which have scaled and obviously we take a very long-term view, and several of those apps today already play huge roles. So for example, take Google Maps, it already plays a huge important role in making mobile search better, and so these are interrelated. YouTube is obviously a big opportunity, Google Play is one. And even things like Gmail are playing a critical role in Google for Work and how we are driving big business opportunities as well. And by the way, because we are scaling all these apps over 1 billion users, we are building the infrastructure, which is what will power our cloud platform externally as well. So in many ways, these are all working for us.",185

One is machine learning, and it's just coming up a lot more frequently as a topic. And I wonder if you could mention more specifically the vision that you have for some of the core applications and how machine learning can make them more useful. And then and just as a follow-up to the question on the Google cloud and specifically, the Infrastructure-as-a-Service layer, I wonder there if your strategy is more focused on price? Or if there are other ways that you can differentiate the service from the competition?",104

We've been investing in this area for a while. We believe we are state-of-the-art here. And the progress, particularly in the last 2 years, has been pretty dramatic. And so we are thoughtfully applying it across all our products, be it search, be it ads, be it YouTube and Play. It's a trend. We are in early days, but you will see us in a systematic manner think about how we can apply machine learning to all these areas. On cloud, I think the right way to think about it over time, for a company or for a developer to build stuff on cloud, they need not just basic things like compute and storage. They need a whole set of services on top of it. So there is a lot in the stack, and so I think the way we will differentiate over time is because we have built large services on top of our infrastructure. We understand all the layers which you need to build great applications. So you will see us increasingly provide value-added services on top of compute and storage. And that's the way I think we'll play this.",208
