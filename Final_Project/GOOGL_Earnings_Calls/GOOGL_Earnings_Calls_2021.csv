We are proud that people continue to choose Google's products to stay informed, connected and comforted during uncertain times. Being helpful to people in moments big and small is the foundation of everything we do.
The past year also accelerated the shift to cloud and adoption of online services. This has profound implications for all companies and consumers, and we are pleased that so many trust us to help them make this transition. In particular, Google's products and support have been a lifeline for millions of small and medium businesses hit hard by the pandemic.
Today, I'll review some of the important work we have done this quarter across Google and Alphabet with a particular focus on our growing cloud business, which we are breaking out as a separate segment for the first time. Then I'll welcome to the call Google's Chief Business Officer, Philipp Schindler, who many of you know from investor conferences and events. Philipp will speak about partnerships, business and advertising trends in the Google Services segment. We have heard that you appreciate more texture and detail there. Then Ruth will go through the quarter in more detail.
First, some highlights at Google. Since the pandemic began, our teams have built new features and products to help people and businesses. Now we are helping with the complex challenge of getting vaccines to billions of people around the world. Vaccination locations have started to roll out in Google Search and Maps. Google Cloud's Intelligent Vaccine Impact platform is helping authorities improve vaccine distribution and forecasting. We are providing substantial new ad grants to the CDC, the World Health Organization and others to promote vaccine education. We're also making direct grants to organizations addressing racial and geographic disparities in vaccination access, plus opening up Google's facilities as vaccination clinics as needed.
Elsewhere, in Maps, we added a new community feed in the Explore tab, and now you can track takeout and delivery orders when you book or order from Google Maps. At YouTube, we are building products to help creators benefit from 2 important trends: live video and short-form video. More than 0.5 million channels livestreamed on YouTube for the first time in 2020, from artists performing in their living rooms to churches moving their services online. And videos in our new Shorts player are receiving 3.5 billion daily views. We are looking forward to expanding Shorts to more countries this year.
Philipp will dive into the work to support online commerce and our partners, but I want to call out our News Showcase product. It's a $1 billion investment in partnerships with news publishers, and I'm really excited about our progress here. We have now signed agreements with nearly 450 publications, the majority of which are local and regional, across a dozen countries including France, Germany, U.K. and Brazil. And last month, we announced a new global deal with Reuters as well as an agreement with one of the major French publishing associations to open access to News Showcase. We want to do more partnerships in more countries, and we'll have more to announce in the weeks to come.
Among other highlights, we also launched our reimagined Google Pay app, making it easier to organize finances and save money. It's now used by over 150 million people in 30 countries. In hardware, we recently closed our acquisition of Fitbit, which will improve our product pipeline and help make health and wellness accessible to more people. To all the Fitbit employees, welcome to Google. We have a great portfolio of products, and I look forward to sharing more about our product plans.
Now a closer look at Google Cloud. I'm very pleased with the progress here. And as Ruth will mention, we'll continue making disciplined investments to scale the business and improve profitability. Google Cloud delivered revenue growth of 47% year-over-year, with GCP growth remaining meaningfully above the growth rate for Cloud overall. In addition, our backlog grew to nearly $30 billion, up from $19 billion in Q3, nearly all attributable to Cloud. We continue to invest strongly in the business given the momentum we are seeing.
These investments in our go-to-market organization have helped us win larger deals including several billion-dollar deals in 2020. Deals over $250 million more than tripled in the same period. We're also seeing strong growth through our broad network of partners, with our channel partner ecosystem growing more than 5x, and indirect channel revenue, more than doubling in the past 2 years. Our industry-leading customer satisfaction, as identified in a recent report from IDC, is helping us drive significant expansion and net revenue retention with existing customers.
Our products are mature and highly differentiated in many segments. In infrastructure cloud, our leadership in multi-cloud and cybersecurity helped us win large data center and IT transformation deals with customers like Highmark Health and Vodafone as well as cloud-native leaders, including Wayfair and Etsy. Our leading data and analytics cloud provides new customers such as Kyoto University Graduate School of medicine and health care and MercadoLibre in retail with the ability to analyze any data in real time across any cloud. Our industry solutions based on our AI/ML expertise have helped us win customers like Optus in communications and Otto Group in retail.
I'm also particularly excited to see us winning large transformations by bringing the entire breadth of Google's technology to customers. Yesterday, we announced our multiyear partnership with Ford, which is using Google Cloud, Android and other Google apps and services to transform their business. Google Workspace, the industry's only cloud-native communication and collaboration solution, is helping companies meet their evolving hybrid workplace needs. Workspace is driving innovation at many of the fastest growing companies. Additionally, this quarter, we expanded our partnership with SAP. They'll extend their usage of Google Cloud for their cloud solutions, including SAP Business Technology Platform, to provide the best experience for our joint customers.
Across the Alphabet portfolio, our investments in AI continue to drive progress. For example, DeepMind's AI part protein-folding breakthrough will enable researchers to tackle new and difficult problems, from fighting diseases to environmental sustainability. Google has partnership with Mayo Clinic in developing AI systems that can help plan radiotherapy treatments. Waymo is now providing hundreds of fully autonomous rides per week and recently partnered with Daimler trucks to develop fully autonomous trucks.
To wrap up, last year I talked about our 4 big themes of helpfulness, trust, execution and sustainable value. These will continue to guide our strategic focus across the company in 2021 and beyond as we continue to advance our core information mission in products like Search, Maps and YouTube; keep people's information safe and secure; drive substantial advancements in AI over the next 3 years; and ensure we are the most effective place to work beyond COVID, all supported by sustainable long-term businesses.
I want to thank our teams across Google and Alphabet for all of their work this quarter and throughout all of 2020. 2021 gives us another chance to be helpful to people, businesses and communities. While there's hard work ahead, I'm profoundly optimistic about what we'll accomplish together.
With that, I'll turn it over to Philipp.",1212

We're pleased with Google Services revenue of $52.9 billion in the fourth quarter, which continued the significant rebound from the negative impact of COVID earlier in the year. Two trends drove the strong results across Search, YouTube and network advertising. Consumers continued to move more of their activity online, and advertisers responded to the shift in consumer behavior by reactivating spend that they had paused earlier in the crisis.
In the fourth quarter, retail was the largest contributor to the year-on-year growth of our ads business. Tech, media and entertainment and CPG were also strong contributors. The trajectory of search advertising over the past year demonstrates its responsiveness to consumer interest and needs and how marketers can quickly adjust their spending as circumstances change to focus on generating ROI for their businesses.
In YouTube, Direct Response had a substantial year-on-year growth throughout the entire year, including the fourth quarter. After a substantial pullback at the outset of the pandemic, brand spending began to recover in the third quarter. Marketers realized that even if there was a pullback in consumer demand in the short term, they needed to keep their brands in front of people to stay top of mind when spending pick back up. In the fourth quarter, we saw significant acceleration of brand spending on YouTube. Network revenues in the fourth quarter benefited from the same uplift in spend by advertisers, particularly in AdMob and Ad Manager. Google other revenues were driven by growth in YouTube's nonadvertising revenues, primarily from subscriptions as well as by Google Play revenue growth.
I now want to step back from the results of the quarter and quickly reflect on the generational shift to digital we've seen over the past year and what that means for our business. First, dramatic changes to consumer behavior have fundamentally changed the way companies are doing business across many industries and geographies. Lufthansa is a great example. Like many airlines, they needed more insight on where to fly, at what capacity and how often as travel started to open up last year. Over the summer, we built a product called Flight Demand Explorer, which gave real-time answers to these questions, helping them find demand and ramp up. Within 2 months, they tripled destination routes and got more than 80 planes back in the air, with many flights fully sold out within days.
We're putting real-time insights into the hands of businesses and other verticals. In fact, we just launched a new insights page to give our advertisers the latest on ever-changing search trends relevant to their business right inside of Google Ads. Petco is another great example as people adopted an unprecedented number of pets during shelter-in-place. It led to a spike in demand for pet supplies, and Petco saw their curbside pickup services go through the roof. So they accelerated delivery and pickup options using Search, Shopping and local inventory ads and were able to drive a 100% increase in their e-commerce business. And this is important. Multi-touch points like curbside pickup and pick up in-store are in high demand and here to stay. We've seen huge year-on-year jumps in searches for available near me and curbside pickup. Retailers offering multi-touch are benefiting from this trend, and this offering sits squarely in our core capabilities with Maps and Search.
Let me tell you about L'Oréal. They did a great job adapting to changes in shopping behavior by making a sharp pivot to e-commerce and to TrueView. By making existing video creatives more timely and actionable, their Kiehl's U.S. brand drove record visits to their site from YouTube, 4x more per dollar. They're also partnering with us to bring AR experience for their cosmetics across Google Services, including YouTube and Search. I could go on and on. Companies are rapidly adopting.
Next, I'd like to talk about how we're evolving our commerce strategy. We've taken significant steps to accelerate an open ecosystem for online retail that benefits businesses of all sizes, from large online household names to your neighborhood store just around the corner. We've long said that we want to make Google the best place for users to start their shopping journeys, regardless of where those journeys end.
In the fourth quarter, the year-over-year growth rates in retail searches was more than 3x the rate we had seen in the same period last year driven in part by COVID. We also want to make Google the best place for merchants to connect with users, regardless of whether the transaction happens on our platform or theirs. Over the last 12 months, we grew our merchant community over 80%, with significant growth in small and medium-sized businesses. All of these merchants and their inventory will show up across Google, including Search, Image Search and YouTube.
I want to close by talking about something that has been a principle of Google since our founding. We've always believed that the future of Google and the future of our partners are fundamentally linked. In fact, we built our business on revenue share models that support a broad range of partners, including large and small online publishers, individual YouTube creators broadcasting from their homes and global music labels as well as Google Play developers of all sizes. We only succeed when our customers and partners succeed. One number, I think, is worthwhile highlighting in this context. Over the past 3 years, we paid out nearly $140 billion to our partners, from Google Play developers and publisher partners using our advertising services to YouTube creators, artists and media organizations around the world.
Our performance is only possible because of our customers and partners. I want to thank them for their partnership, collaboration and feedback. I also want to thank our product, partnership, sales and many support teams for their tremendous work, innovating to help our users, customers and partners succeed, especially through these difficult times.
I'll now hand off the call to Ruth.",1002
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2021",2021-02-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3043.0,2188886.0,85626185.0,Presenter Speech,Ruth Porat,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Philipp. We are very pleased with our exceptional fourth quarter performance after an unprecedented year.
For 2020, total Alphabet revenues were $183 billion, up 13% year-on-year or up 14% in constant currency. With our new segment disclosures this quarter, I'll start with quarterly results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. My focus will be on year-on-year comparisons for the fourth quarter, unless I state otherwise.
For the fourth quarter, our consolidated revenues were $56.9 billion, up 23%, which reflect broad-based increases in advertiser spending in Search and YouTube within Google Services as well as ongoing strength in Google Cloud. Our total cost of revenues was $26.1 billion, up 24%, primarily driven by other cost of revenues, which was $15.6 billion and up 25%. The biggest factors here were: first, content acquisition costs, primarily driven by costs for YouTube's advertising-supported content, followed by costs for subscription content; and second, costs associated with data centers and other operations, including depreciation.
Operating expenses were $15.2 billion, down 4%. The year-on-year decline reflects the lapping of valuation-based compensation charges in certain Other Bets in the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily in R&D, as well as the impact of actions taken earlier in the year as a result of COVID. Each of the 3 components of OpEx also reflects our decision to slow head count growth beginning late in the first quarter. Head count was up 3,180 from the third quarter. Again, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers with continued aggressive investment in cloud for both technical and sales roles.
Operating income was $15.7 billion, up 69%, and our operating margin in the quarter was 28%. Other income and expense was $3 billion, which primarily reflects unrealized gains in the value of investments in equity securities. Net income was $15.2 billion. Operating cash flow was $22.7 billion, with free cash flow of $17.2 billion in the quarter and $43 billion for the full year 2020. We ended the fourth quarter with $137 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services revenues were $52.9 billion, up 22%. Each component of our advertising revenues reflects the return of advertiser spend in response to the continued movement of consumer activity online that Philipp spoke about, including Google Search and other advertising revenues of $31.9 billion in the quarter, up 17%; YouTube advertising revenues of $6.9 billion, up 46%, driven by a rebound not only in brand advertising but also ongoing strength in direct response; network advertising revenues of $7.4 billion, up 23%.
Other revenues were $6.7 billion, up 27%, primarily driven by growth in YouTube nonadvertising and Play revenues. Within Play, app revenues in the fourth quarter continued to benefit from elevated levels of engagement, reflecting increases in active buyers and spend per buyer due to COVID. However, we did experience a deceleration in growth from the levels we saw in the third quarter. Google Services operating income was $19.1 billion, up 41%, and the operating margin was 36%.
Turning to the Google Cloud segment, including GCP and Google Workspace. Revenues were $3.8 billion for the fourth quarter, up 47%. GCP's revenue growth rate was again meaningfully above Cloud overall. Strong growth in Google Workspace revenues was driven by growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $1.2 billion, essentially flat versus last year.
As to our Other Bets, for the full year 2020, revenues were $657 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily, and reflect that most of our Other Bets are pre-revenue. The operating loss was $4.5 billion for the full year 2020 versus an operating loss of $4.8 billion in 2019.
Let me end with our outlook for each segment and our investments more broadly. For Google Services, we're encouraged by the increase in consumer online activity and the return of advertiser spend as reflected in our Q4 results. Looking forward to 2021, year-over-year quarterly comparisons will be affected meaningfully by the impact of COVID last year with easier comps in the first half, especially in Q2, and then lapping stronger performance in the second half. With respect to other revenues, with the closing of the Fitbit acquisition earlier this month, we will be reporting its revenues within Google Other.
In terms of investment levels within Google Services, late in the first quarter of 2020, as a result of COVID, we made what we described as tactical adjustments to slow the pace of spend in certain categories. Given the ongoing uncertainty in the external environment, we maintained the discipline through the rest of 2020. Looking forward, we do expect the pace of investment to increase to support the extraordinary opportunities we see given the usefulness of our products and services in this environment. The investment pace will ramp up over the course of the year.
As for Google Cloud, we've obviously been investing aggressively given the substantial market opportunity we see. Under Thomas Kurian's leadership, we further accelerated investment to strengthen the position of the business. For example, we are on track to meet our near-term goal of tripling the size of the Cloud Direct sales force and have greatly expanded the partner channel. We've also substantially improved our product offering while rationalizing our approach to focus on our 6 key industry verticals. And we've invested in expanding our network of locations for compute capacity to support Cloud, ending 2020 serving customers in 24 regions and 73 zones.
We're encouraged by the momentum in the growth of revenue and customer wins. We more than doubled revenues over the last 2 years from $5.8 billion in 2018 to $13.1 billion in 2020. Our backlog, which is nearly all attributable to Cloud, nearly tripled from 2019 to 2020. Although increases in backlog do not directly correlate to revenue trends, the growth in backlog demonstrates the success Google Cloud is having with large enterprises, which are signing meaningful long-term commitment agreements.
Looking forward, we will continue to focus on revenue growth driven by ongoing investment in products and the go-to-market organization. Cloud's operating loss reflects that we have meaningfully built out our organization ahead of revenues, as we've discussed in prior quarters, with respect to the substantial investments in our go-to-market organization as well as engineering and technical infrastructure. Operating loss and operating margin will benefit from increased scale over time. In addition, we are focused on delivering on efficiency efforts across the board to contribute incrementally to profitability over time.
Finally, as you can see from the historical data provided in the press release, Cloud's operating loss was higher in the first quarter relative to other quarters, and then the operating loss improves thereafter. We expect similar seasonality in 2021. In terms of Other Bets, we continue to invest with a focus on the long-term value creation opportunity.
On head count, we plan to reaccelerate the pace of hiring in Google Services, in line with our opportunities. Our head count growth will also reflect the addition of Fitbit and our ongoing transition of certain customer support roles from third-party vendors to Google's in-house operation centers. We also plan to continue to prioritize investment in both sales and technical roles for Google Cloud.
Turning to CapEx. At the consolidated level, the year-on-year results this quarter again reflect the slower pace throughout 2020 of investment in office facilities. Within technical infrastructure, servers continue to be the largest driver of investment in the fourth quarter, followed by data centers. Looking ahead, we expect a return to a more normalized pace of ground-up construction and fit-out of office facilities, which translates into a sizable increase in CapEx in 2021. Servers will continue to be the largest driver of spend on technical infrastructure.
Finally, a housekeeping point. As noted in our earnings press release, we have adjusted the estimated useful lives of servers and certain network equipment starting in 2021. We expect these changes will favorably impact our 2021 operating results by approximately $2.1 billion for assets as of year-end 2020.
We look forward to the year ahead. I hope everyone stays safe. Thank you. And now Sundar, Philipp and I will take your questions.",1380

Maybe I'll try first on Cloud. I don't know if it's better to Sundar or to Ruth, but can you just conceptually help us understand how to think about the opportunity you're going after versus Cloud and how it factors back into which you want to invest against the opportunity or, possibly, maybe even accelerate the opportunity by looking at inorganic paths to growing scale vis-à-vis competition in the space?
And then maybe for Philipp if I can. YouTube continues to evolve as a platform. There's now subscription offerings. You highlighted the strength you're seeing in DR. Could you talk a little bit about the path for monetization in the coming years and how we should think about the opportunity against a large-scale audience and engagement you see at YouTube broadly?",145

We see the large TAM ahead and, definitely, the market dynamics. And our momentum, in the context of the market, is what is the framework which we are thinking about, the scale of investments and the pace of investments. Obviously, it's an area in which the longer you are in, the cohorts add up and so contributes more and the economies of scale starts working as well. But we are definitely investing ahead to making sure we are able to serve the customers globally across all the offerings they are interested in, and that's how we are thinking about it.

And the key elements of it, I tried to call out in the opening comments: investing in product, go to market, data centers. And you can see it in the results. I think you're going to continue to see us building there, and that's what we're talking about building ahead. We are keenly focused on delivering for both customers and shareholders and that, of course, includes an intense focus on the path to profitability.",102

And on your question on YouTube, on the overall development and the subscription side, our Direct Response business on YouTube was practically nonexistent 3 years ago. And now it's one of our largest and fastest-growing ad offerings on YouTube. And with TrueView for action, we're actually making it easier for advertisers to unlock opportunities to reach audiences with video campaigns. And just to give you a few numbers, 60% of TrueView for action customers are new to YouTube. And we more than doubled the number of active advertisers using TrueView for action in the first 6 months of 2020.
And we're really tapping into the tremendous innate commercial behavior on the platform. 70% of YouTube viewers are saying they bought a brand as a result of seeing it on YouTube. I talked about L'oréal earlier. MasterClass is another great example. Online learning has become a huge opportunity, and they use TrueView for action to connect the right people to the right content and saw really big, like 140% increase in clicks to their sites, 70% increase in sign-ups to courses and so on.
YouTube continues, in our view, to be amazing for brand advertisers as well. Our brand business was hit hard in the early stages of the pandemic, rebounded in Q3 and into Q4. And it really helps advertisers reach younger audiences. They can reach anywhere. We now reach more 18- to 49-year-olds than all linear TV networks combined. Watch time is increasing. Advertiser effectiveness is getting better and better. And so this is a very nice development on the subscription strategy.
Maybe just briefly, music is an incredibly popular vertical on YouTube and, obviously, a key part of the overall experience. We found that users wanted a premium YouTube experience and we -- basically the ability to download songs and videos. YouTube Premium provides additional revenue streams, of course, for music labels and publishers as well. In 2019, YouTube paid the music industry over $3 billion. We have over 30 million music and premium paid subscribers. We are now operating over 95 countries, so members get a lot of extra benefits, yes.",355

Anything else you can add just in terms of the significant inflection that you saw on Google Cloud backlog there? And I guess, in particular, curious what you're seeing in terms of benefit and success as you're leveraging Alphabet more broadly like in the Ford deal. And then how do you think about Google Cloud margins structurally kind of long-term relative to peers? Any color there would be helpful.",83

And depending on the sector they are in, they are definitely interested in a broader solution set across the breadth of what Google and Alphabet can bring. We see this in health care, our efforts in Google Health, work that's happening in Verily, all end up helping. Ford is a great example of, I'd say, thinking longer term not just for Cloud but Android auto-powering their vehicles. And so these are big transformations cutting across the company. And one of the areas where we are really executing is leveraging our global business operations that Philipp runs and partnering closely with Thomas' teams, and that's definitely brings in a lot of synergies here.
On your second question, on the broader stuff, the one thing I would say is -- I mentioned a part earlier, we get into these long-term deals. And so over time, as you add more cohorts, that contributes to the margin structure. It is -- the scale of the product offerings, the number of areas and the number of regions in the world, there's a much more significant investment. And so there is definitely a fixed cost structure associated with it, and we are also investing ahead. But as we scale up the business, we expect the trends to be favorable.",224

As we've each noted, the financial results really did reflect this increase in advertiser activity. And that was in part unlocking budgets that they had paused earlier in the year as well as really reflecting the increase in consumer online activity. The largest contributor, as Philipp mentioned, was retail, the largest contributor to the year-on-year growth of the ads business. But I would say tech, media and entertainment as well as CPG were also meaningful contributors. And for Search, we saw ongoing improvement in advertisers spend broadly.
For YouTube, Direct Response, as Philipp talked about, really did maintain a very high level of growth. And the acceleration in overall YouTube revenue growth reflects a pickup in brand advertising across all verticals on top of the ongoing strength that we saw in DR. And then in network, also same point, it's this pickup in advertiser spend, as Philipp noted. It was led by growth in AdMob and Ad Manager.
So we're really pleased with Q4. It was a great end to a challenging year. And when we think about 2021, I made the point in the opening comments, we obviously have easier year-on-year comparisons in the first half as we anniversary the effects of the pandemic. So not much more to add, we -- it was a strong quarter, and we feel really good about the level of activity.",232

I appreciate the level of detail on the drivers behind the acceleration in Search and YouTube.

And as Philipp said, and we've talked about on prior calls, one of the first things that happens is a step-back and then you see, as users reengage and activity picks up and the effectiveness of advertising the ROI available, you see advertising come back in. I remember talking about this throughout last year that we had seen this actually going back to the prior financial crisis. And what you've seen is just a broad-based reengagement, which we're really pleased about across industries. And it's also -- as Philipp noted in his comments, there's been a tremendous opportunity really to step in here and help small, medium businesses as they were evolving and adapting to this new digital world, and it's been quite key there as well.",144

I'd be curious to hear about your discussions now with merchants and sort of what the largest friction points that they're looking for you to solve and sort of continue to help them as the world reopens, kind of the merchant discussions. And then secondly, a question on one of the earlier products on Discover feed, I'd love to hear about sort of early learnings on Discover feed and how you think about hurdles you need to overcome to monetize that.",108
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2021",2021-02-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3043.0,2188886.0,85626202.0,Answer,Philipp Schindler,,Executives,21,"Yes. Thank you very much for the question. Look, at the highest level, we want to build a healthier e-commerce ecosystem. When people come to Google to shop, we want them to help find the best product with the best prices from really the widest range of merchants, and we want our results to be as comprehensive and relevant as possible. And we took some significant steps last year, as you know, on Google Shopping. And in many ways, we really see them as a return to our first principles here: free listing, zero commissions, really good feedback, helps lower barriers for online retail. So we've become a great place for stores to connect with potential customers whether it's by driving traffic to the website for free listings or ads or just by making it easier for purchases to happen directly on Google. And by the way, let me be clear also, shopping ads will continue to be a powerful way for retailers to promote their products, obviously.
So overall, we're providing an open ecosystem that works for every kind of business, from national chains and online marketplaces to just your small local stores. And we're giving retailers more choice, which is very well received by opening our platform to third-party providers. We talked about this, starting with PayPal and Shopify. And we brought YouTube into the fold, and we began experimenting with a feature that lets you learn a lot more about products and videos on a limited set of channels and so on and so on. So I would say overall it's very, very well received.
On the Discover side, discovery has grown -- so discovery is Discover and, obviously, discovery ads. So Discover has grown dramatically since we launched it, I think, just 3 years ago. People are loving how we're surfacing relevant information, gorgeous visuals that are all in what we call [ Coriolis ] feed experience. And naturally, some of these experiences are commercial. And we made discovery ads generally available about 6 months ago. I think it was May 2020. And it's already reaching up to 3 billion people across Discover, YouTube, Gmail, and that's worldwide. And advertisers love how we're able to drive performance objectives by really matching their premium creatives with Google intent on our -- yes, what we call [ Coriolis ] surfaces.",392

Just given the strength of those services ads and subscriptions during the pandemic, I wonder if part of what we're seeing is more of an acceleration from TV ad budgets from linear spending to more of YouTube spending, I mean given also the momentum we've seen in over-the-top over the last 9 months or so. And then given some of the changing industry dynamics around privacy, including what you've already announced around browser cookies, wondering what plans might be as well for Android and how we should think about potential impact on ad revenues broadly as a result of privacy changes.",110
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2021",2021-02-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3043.0,2188886.0,85626205.0,Answer,Philipp Schindler,,Executives,24,"Yes, I can take that. We've seen brands steadily shift budgets to YouTube to complement their linear TV buys as TV audiences really become more fragmented. And as traditional TV ratings continue to decline, TV advertisers are turning to streaming platforms like YouTube to reach people who are no longer watching TV. Connected TVs are our fastest-growing screen. In the U.S., we have over 100 million people that watch YouTube and YouTube TV on their TV screens each month. YouTube helps advertisers reach general audiences they can't reach anywhere else. We talked about it. YouTube reaches more 18- to 49-year-olds than all linear TV networks combined. And so there is an opportunity, a big opportunity, for YouTube to help brands and agencies really more easily connect with this audience. And we're very invested in this space.
And just to give you a few examples, in the second half of last year, we launched YouTube Masthead on TV screens to help advertisers drive awareness with large audiences in basically a single moment. Many are taking advantage of it: Uber, many others. We launched Brand Lift for YouTube on TV screens to really help advertisers make informed decisions about ad performance, optimize streaming campaigns in real time and so on. And we also made it possible last year for advertisers to basically buy among the most popular YouTube and YouTube TV content viewed on the TV screens in one -- what we call one single lineup.
Quickly on the third-party cookies strategy in general, we know that expectations are really changing for how data is used online, and people are demanding greater privacy. We're taking our responsibility to user privacy and to supporting our partners in the web ecosystem very, very seriously. In 2019, we announced The Privacy Sandbox, which is an open standards initiative to invent new technology that will replace third-party cookies with a set of privacy-preserving mechanisms for the web, and we're making great progress. We've shared a detailed proposal with the industry for experimentation and feedback.
We shared recently as well our what we call FLoC, our Federated Learning of Cohorts API, which we think provides an effective replacement signal for third-party cookies. And we really believe Privacy Sandbox is the best path forward, and we remain very committed to our collaboration with the ads community on privacy-preserving open standard mechanisms that can, what we call, sustain a healthy and ad-supported web.",404

I wanted to understand the framework, if you could, and think about the bigger opportunity longer term and priority highs -- priority is in streaming video, right? So are you happy with the progress of YouTube TV so far? Will you expand into other countries? And can you contrast that versus the opportunity you see in connected TVs and devices as you've done for Google TV or Chromecast? And then is there a perceived added value from advertisers for this type of inventory? Does it attract a new type of advertiser to offer YouTube TV inventory or connected TV inventory from the traditional YouTube advertising?",115

We've invested across platforms, across devices, across countries. And I think the same applies for the YouTube experience. We want to bring it to the screen that's most convenient for users and, hence, our investments in Google TV, Chromecast, YouTube TV as a whole itself. And I think we are taking a long-term view here, obviously focused on the user experience and really getting it all to work well. We know -- while smartphones are at the center for YouTube, TV is an important form factor. And over time, people will use it across multiple screens. And so that's the experience we are focused on. And any time we create that experience, we know, over time, there is value to be captured commercially as well that makes sense for advertisers, but we take a long-term view.",172

And I talked about the connected TV part already. Maybe briefly just on YouTube TV, YouTube TV continues to gain momentum. Our advertising efforts on YouTube TV itself are still very, very early. But we think there is an opportunity to apply some of our targeting and measurement capabilities to really provide a better user and advertiser experience over time. And yes, we heard from customers, they have a very strong interest in advertising and streaming environments. I mentioned how we combine it in the single lineups.

I think you brought up in the past some of the ways AI is helping you with the products that you have in market right now. But as we take a more longer-term look into the future, what do you think some of the new applications could be?
And I think, Philipp, it might have been a few years ago when you were speaking at an investor conference, and you called out the desire to onboard and help SMBs, particularly as they really had no way to advertise before. And Google, and online in general, presented a golden opportunity to really help them grow their business. So where do you think you are in terms of putting together an easy-to-use set of tools to help those who otherwise don't really have agency representation so that they can reach all the different customers that they should be reaching across all of the different services that you're offering?",183

I'll answer the AI part first. We've always wanted to be foundational in how we approach technological advances, and that's the core competency. We invest across the company. We're one of the largest R&D investors in the world. And obviously, AI is a big part of it. Just I'm really excited that we -- over the past few years, while we have made progress in understanding different modalities, be it text, images, voice, vision, et cetera, there is -- we definitely -- I think we are at an inflection point, and we are investing to build better models and deepen our understanding and do it in a more generalized way. And when we do that, it will apply horizontally across our products.
You saw a version of that when we shipped Bird in Search in what was one of our biggest quality improvements, but you'll see that flow across be it Google Search, YouTube, Android as well as our investments in Alphabet, be it self-driving cars or robotics. So we take that view and, definitely, we want to make sure we are driving state-of-the-art progress. Philipp?",188

So first, let me recognize, I mean it has obviously been a very, very challenging environment for SMBs. Many weren't online. Many lost line of sight to demand overnight due to COVID. So around this time last year, as soon as we saw the scale of the impact, we really accelerated product that give our customers, and especially our SMB customers, signals to help them actually navigate and pivot. And as I noted earlier, as more consumers moved online and advertisers obviously responded by reactivating spend, we also saw our advertiser base grow, particularly the number of smaller advertisers or SMBs, and we're helping them see shift in supply and demand not just across sectors but actually within sectors. For example, travel continues to get hit hard, hit pretty hard. And after the initial lockdown last year, searches for vacation homes and near-me rentals saw huge spikes, and that continues to fluctuate.
On the other hand, if we look at retail, demand isn't disappearing. It's shifting in many cases. We're seeing increases in searches for things like gym equipment, crafts, patio heaters and so on, anything related to outdoor activity and so on. We're obviously thinking about how to help SMBs on products like Maps. Like, over the last 5 years, we've made more than 1,000 improvements to business profiles, making it a lot easier for merchants to connect with customers and especially now into the crisis. In 2020, we added new features to, for example, provide COVID updates, service changes and new attributes like takeout, delivery, curbside pickup, now all easily available for consumers on Maps to connect them to their favorite SMBs, so a really incredible investment, frankly, from our side, and I think it's very well received.",291

After a hard year, people in some parts of the world are beginning to rebuild their lives, businesses and communities, but recovery is far from uniform across the globe as the tragic scenes in countries like India and Brazil remind us. We are continuing to help support public health officials in their vital and urgent work. Our focus is on providing authoritative information. We are helping over 100 government agencies and nonprofits worldwide distribute critical information and billions of PSAs about COVID-19 and vaccines. And Google Cloud Technology is powering a virtual agent to help make vaccination appointments over the phone, supporting 28 languages and dialects for those with limited Internet access. We are focused on doing our part to help. 
In some parts of the world, the economy began to rebound, which created a rising tide in the first quarter that benefited a number of sectors, including existing and emerging companies and partners. For example, data suggest that investment in start-ups is at an all-time high. Our product releases are returning to a regular cadence. I'm particularly excited that our developer event Google IO is back this year all virtual and free for everyone on May 18 through 20. We'll have significant product updates and announcements, and I invite you all to tune in. 
Today, I'll briefly mention a few highlights from the past quarter, and go a bit deeper on cloud. Then Philipp will discuss advertising and partnership developments. Finally, Ruth will cover the quarterly results. 
Quickly turning to product highlights of the quarter. Our knowledge and information services like Search and Maps remain at the heart of our mission to provide helpful and accurate information during important moments. People have turned to Google Search more than ever since the pandemic began. We see hundreds of millions of searches every day for COVID and related health information. 
People are also searching for jobs. To help them, job seekers can now use Search quickly and easily find roles that do not require a college degree, and we are working together with the top employment websites to make the service even better. 
Maps will be adding over 100 AI-powered improvements this year, such as indoor live view, which helps you navigate airports, transit stations and malls using augmented reality. Last quarter, I mentioned Google News Showcase, our $1 billion investment in the news industry. I'm pleased to see continued momentum this quarter with new launches in the U.K., Italy, Argentina and Australia. In Q1, we added more than 170 publications across 12 countries with more coming soon. 
With respect to YouTube, people continue to find all types of informational content from educational videos to podcast. In fact, according to a recent study conducted by Ipsos, 77% of respondents say they used YouTube during 2020 to learn a new skill. YouTube Shots continues to gain popularity with over 6.5 billion daily views as of March, up from 3.5 billion at the end of 2020. We've added a new metric to our transparency reports called a violator view rate, which will help us estimate what percentage of views on YouTube come from content that violates our policies. 
In Q4 of last year, YouTube's violator view rate was between 16 and 18 views out of every 10,000. This is down over 70% compared to the same quarter in 2017, in large part, thanks to our investments in machine learning. 
Let me also mention Chrome OS, which this quarter celebrated 10 years. It's been a valuable tool for millions of students and teachers during the pandemic. According to third parties, Chromebooks were the most popular device in K-12 education globally for the last year. 
Next, I'll move to Cloud, where we continue to see strong performance across both Google Cloud Platform and Workspace. Q1 revenue grew 46% year-over-year, with GCP's revenue growth rate once again meaningfully about cloud overall. We continue to unlock the value of the Google ecosystem by signing multiyear multiproduct partnerships with companies like Global Payments and Grupo Global. And just yesterday, We announced a new Google-wide partnership with Univision, which is migrating to our cloud, continuing to distribute content on YouTube and reaching customers via play in ads. 
In cloud, There are 3 distinct market trends shaping our growth and driving our product and go-to-market strategy. First, we see very strong customer momentum in the data cloud. Our expertise in real-time data and analytics is winning companies like Twitter and Ingersoll Rand, who are moving their complex data workloads to Google Cloud. Our strength in AI and ML is also helping financial services customers like HSBC, Commerzbank, SAB Group and BBVA improve efficiency of payments, reduce fraud and risk and deliver faster payment solutions. This past quarter, we released new functionality for big query, delivering significantly better performance for business intelligence queries. 
Second, we are seeing customers wanting a robust infrastructure cloud in order to create operational efficiencies and reduce IT costs. We are winning large IT transformation deals with companies that are migrating their data centers to Google Cloud. Multicloud remains a differentiator as it provides the easiest and most open development environment for customers like Taylor's, allowing them to access and move their data between various clouds. 
Third, we continue to deliver helpful innovations to enable hybrid work with Google Workspace. This includes digital tools for frontline workers like nurses and retail store workers as well as new security offerings. These innovations have helped grow our revenue per seat and the number of seats in the last quarter. Workspace is being adopted by customers, including Keralty in healthcare, Sun Life in financial services and Airbus in manufacturing and aviation. 
Now a brief update on Other Bets. Waymo's fully autonomous public ride-hailing service in Phoenix is providing hundreds of rides per week. In San Francisco, Waymo's began limited employee testing. I'm pleased by the progress here and look forward to Waymo's continued momentum under the leadership of new Co-CEOs, Takedra and Dmitri. 
Calico and its partner, AbbVie, announced that it has entered clinical stage programs for new drug therapies for cancer and neurodegenerative diseases like ALS, Parkinson's disease and traumatic brain injury. 
Before I close, I want to mention that in 2021 in the U.S. alone, we plan to invest over $7 billion in offices and data centers and create at least 10,000 new full-time jobs. And as we do this, we continue to make progress on our sustainability goals. We matched our operations with 100% renewable energy for the past 4 years, and we are working towards operating on carbon-free energy around the clock by 2030, a far more ambitious goal that we hope will be transformative for the industry. Five of our data centers in Europe and North America are already operating near or at 90% carbon-free energy around the clock. 
We're also working towards our commitment to help 1 billion people make more sustainable choices with our services by 2022. One example of how we are doing this is a new AI-powered feature in Maps that will show the routes with the lowest carbon footprint when ETAs are the same. You'll also be able to compare the carbon impact between routes. 
Finally, as we look ahead to the rest of 2021, our 4 big themes continue to guide us: first, building and providing the most helpful products and services; second, continuing to earn the trust of our users by investing in high-quality information, and keeping users' data safe and private; third, strong execution as a company, particularly as we start to reopen our offices; and fourth, building sustainable value in our own business and for our partners. 
As always, thank you to our Googlers around the world for a great start to the year. To everyone, I look forward to seeing you at IO. Over to Philipp.",1307

It's great to be joining you again today. We're pleased with the strong growth in Google Services revenues in the first quarter. Year-on-year performance reflects elevated consumer online activity, broad-based strength in advertiser spend and lapping of the initial impact of the pandemic on advertising revenues that began in March last year. 
In the first quarter in Search, we saw sustained strength across most categories led by retail. We also saw strong performance in tech and CPG. In YouTube, we had phenomenal growth driven by direct response followed by continued strength in brand. We've seen great momentum in TrueView for action ads with a number of advertisers using the format doubling over the past year. 
In network, exceptional growth was driven by AdMob and Ad Manager, with particular strength in app campaigns. Google Other revenues were driven by growth in Google Play and YouTube's nonadvertising revenues, followed by hardware. I would now like to take a few minutes to dive deeper into the trends we're seeing in our business. 
As Sundar touched on earlier, the pandemic is evolving in different ways across the world. Some countries are in advanced stages of reopening. Others are facing reacceleration of cases, and there's everything in between. It's never been more important to help businesses navigate the pandemic as circumstances change. 
On travel, we're starting to see renewed interest from users as they turn to Google to plan their next trip even before they're ready to book. Every travel partner is looking to understand where demand is going, and we're helping them find these opportunities through insights and automation. 
For American Airlines, for example, that meant using our insight tools to anticipate demand on untapped routes. These newly prioritized routes had a significantly higher booking rate in Search this quarter compared to last quarter. Also, just last month, we made it free for hotels and travel companies to list their booking links similar to what we did with Shopping last year. For consumers, it means more choice. For hotels and travel companies, it means free exposure on Google. For advertisers, it means paid campaigns can be augmented with free listings. We are already seeing positive results across the board. 
Let me switch gears now and talk about retail, where we had a very strong quarter. As you know, we've taken important steps over the past year to accelerate an open retail ecosystem. We made product listings free, removed commission fees and opened our Shopping platform to Shopify and PayPal. We're also helping retailers lean into some key opportunities such as innovating in omnichannel as the line between digital and physical retail continues to blur and tapping into commercial intent on YouTube and other services. 
Let me talk about both. Over the last 6 months, people's shopping preferences have shifted constantly in response to changing conditions. It's not just online. It's not just offline. It's a mix. And that's our sweet spot with Search, Maps and YouTube. Last quarter, we talked about a surge in searches for available near me and for curbside pickup. That trend has not changed. Searches for local and businesses are up 80% versus last year. Omnichannel is here to stay. 
Take Dick's Sporting Goods. Throughout the pandemic, they accelerated curbside pick-up, pick-up in-store and ship from store fulfillment options and search. This approach contributed to 100% year-over-year increase in e-commerce sales in 2020. And just recently, they activated YouTube to build awareness for new store concepts. 
Michaels, the arts and crafts store, also activated their omnichannel fulfillment approach using Search And maps. And to meet surging demand for art supplies, they use TrueView Action to tap into the vast number of arts and craft searches happening on YouTube. In 2020, their e-commerce sales were up 350%. 
We're also doing more to help merchants tap into the incredible innate commercial behavior across Search and YouTube. Google merchants can now plug their product feeds right into their video action campaigns, and early adopters are seeing huge results. 
Luxury cosmetics company, Clarins HK, had a beautiful product imagery from the Google merchant feed as an extension and saw a 68% conversion rate uplift within 3 weeks. Any merchant can now light this up with a single click in our Google Merchant Center. 
Speaking of YouTube, we're helping advertisers address both brand and performance goals at scale, driving higher return on ad spend at a time when they need it most. We're only a few years in on direct response, and we think there is significant opportunity for innovation that will improve the user experience and provide better ROI for advertisers. 
On the performance side, advertisers of all sizes are actually seeing incredible results. Like global group fitness company Less Mills was hit hard when the 20,000 partner gyms closed during lockdown. They accelerated digital and grew app subscribers by almost 7x with TrueView for Action. 
We're seeing strong growth at YouTube's brand business, fueled by a global consumer trend from linear TV towards streaming video. With over 2 billion monthly logged in users and over 1 billion hours of video watched every day, YouTube is offering advertisers efficient reach to large audiences, which are incremental to those found on TV. 
Large brands are benefiting from this trend. Taco Bell saw a 27% incremental reach for the limited time offer campaigns. And Kellogg's saw incremental reach of over 30% for the recent Special K campaign. 
Before I close, I want to take a minute to highlight our work with partners. Sundar mentioned Google News showcase. We now have deals with 600-plus publishers across more than 12 countries: Le Monde in France, Der Spiegel and Stern in Germany, Clarin in Argentina, Evening Standard in the U.K., just to name a few. And we're continuing to expand the program. 
We're also developing more valuable relationships with some of our strategic partners. By teaming up, we're able to build new experiences for our users while helping our partners innovate and grow. We've gone well beyond ads to bring the best of Google across Cloud, Play, YouTube and more to help them do just that. 
Sundar mentioned Univision. In the quarter, we also announced T-Mobile, Albertsons, Allianz and Munich Re. 
I want to thank our customers and partners for their collaboration. We've always said we succeed only when they succeed. And I also want to thank our product, partnerships, sales and support teams for their amazing work and innovation. 
I'll now hand off the call to Ruth.",1085

Our very strong financial results in the first quarter reflect both lapping the impact of COVID on our business beginning in March 2020 and as well as the benefit of excellent underlying operating performance. My focus will be on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter unless I state otherwise. I'll start with results at the Alphabet level followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. 
For the first quarter, our consolidated revenues were $55.3 billion, up 34% or up 32% in constant currency, reflecting elevated consumer activity online and broad-based increases in advertiser spending within Google services as well as ongoing strength in Google Cloud. Our total cost of revenues was $24.1 billion, up 27%, primarily driven by other cost of revenues, which was $14.4 billion, up 25%, followed by TAC, which was $9.7 billion, up 30%. 
Within other cost of revenues, the biggest factors were: first, content acquisition costs, primarily driven by costs for YouTube's advertising-supported content, followed by costs for subscription content; and second, costs associated with data centers and other operations, offset partially by a reduction in depreciation expense due to changes to estimated useful lives of servers and certain network equipment. Operating expenses were $14.8 billion, up 4%. 
In terms of the 3 component parts of OpEx. First, the increase in R&D expenses was driven primarily by headcount growth. Second, sales and marketing expenses were essentially flat, reflecting headcount growth, which was offset by lower spend on ads and promo as well as on travel and entertainment. 
Finally, the decline in G&A reflects the benefit of lapping the unusually high allowances for credit losses recorded in the first quarter of 2020 due to the impact of COVID, offset by charges relating to certain legal matters. 
Headcount was up 4,694 from the fourth quarter, including more than 1,800 Fitbit employees who joined us in Q1. Again, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. 
Operating income was $16.4 billion, up 106%, and our operating margin in the quarter was 30%. Other income and expense was $4.8 billion, which primarily reflects unrealized gains in the value of investments in equity securities. 
Net income was $17.9 billion, operating cash flow was $19.3 billion, with free cash flow of $13.3 billion in the quarter and $50.7 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the first quarter with $135 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
Let me now turn to our segment financial results. 
Starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services revenues were $51.2 billion, up 34%, consisting of Google Search and other advertising revenues of $31.9 billion in the quarter, up 30%, with strength across most categories led by retail. 
YouTube advertising revenues of $6 billion, up 49%, driven by exceptional performance in direct response and ongoing strength in brand advertising. Network advertising revenues of $6.8 billion, up 30%, driven by AdMob and Ad Manager. Other revenues were $6.5 billion, up 46%, primarily driven by growth in Play and YouTube nonadvertising revenues followed by hardware, which benefited from the addition of Fitbit revenues. Google Services operating income was $19.5 billion, up 69%. And the operating margin was 38%. 
Turning to the Google Cloud segment, including GCP and Google Workspace. Revenues were $4 billion for the first quarter, up 46%. GCP's revenue growth was again meaningfully above cloud overall. Strong growth in Google Workspace revenues was driven by growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $1 billion. 
As to our Other Bets in the first quarter, revenues were $198 million. The operating loss was $1.1 billion. 
Let me end with our outlook for each segment and our investments more broadly. For Google services, for the remainder of 2021, year-over-year comparisons will be affected meaningfully by the impact of COVID last year with a greater benefit in Q2 from an easier comp relative to what you saw in Q1 and then beginning to lap stronger performance in the second half of the year. In the first quarter, we continued to benefit from elevated consumer online activity and broad-based strength in advertiser spend. It is too early to say how durable this consumer behavior will be as economies recover and restrictions on mobility are lifted. 
Within other revenues, Play benefited from an increased level of user engagement starting in Q1 last year due to the pandemic, which we are now beginning to lap. In terms of investment levels within Google Services, we still intend to invest aggressively to support the extraordinary opportunities we see. That being said, in some areas like travel and entertainment and marketing events, the pace of investment through the balance of the year may be affected by the pace of COVID recovery globally. 
As for Google Cloud, our approach to building the business has not changed. We remain focused on revenue growth, and we will continue to invest aggressively in products and our go-to-market organization given the opportunity we see. The operating results in Q1, in part, reflect some notable items in the quarter: first, the lapping of the unusually high allowances for credit losses recorded in the first quarter of 2020, as I already mentioned; and second, lower depreciation expense due to the change in estimated useful lives, although the dollar benefit will diminish throughout the course of the year across segments. 
As we've noted previously, operating results should benefit from increased scale over time. However, at this point, we do remain focused on continuing to invest to build the cloud organization for long-term performance. 
In terms of Other Bets, we continue to invest with a focus on the long-term value creation opportunity. 
Turning to CapEx at the consolidated level. The results reflect ongoing investment in our technical infrastructure, offset by a slower pace of investment in office facilities given the ongoing impact of COVID. Within technical infrastructure, servers continue to be the largest driver of investment as we continue to invest to support Cloud, Search, ads and machine learning. 
Finally, with respect to capital allocation, our primary use of capital continues to be to support organic growth in our businesses followed by retaining flexibility for acquisitions and investments. We complement these growth drivers with a return of capital. 
As we indicated in our press release today, our Board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $50 billion of our Class C stock. 
Thank you. And now Sundar, Philipp and I will take your questions.",1077

I appreciate the color on the 4 key priorities. I wanted to dig a little more into the build and provide the most helpful products and services. Maybe if you can sort of talk to us about Search. How do you think about the key investment priorities and innovation areas to continue to make Search more and more helpful for your users and your advertisers? 
And the second one for Philipp, maybe similar question on YouTube. You've done such a great job on innovation around YouTube. Where do you see the largest incremental opportunities for further innovation at YouTube to deliver more outsized value for your advertisers?",114
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,2806.0,2259900.0,87631362.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,7,"Thanks. On Search, great question. I still think we are in very early stages. A recent example, which I was proud of, was when the ship was stuck in the Suez Canal, then it got out. If you asked the question to Google, I think very soon after that, we had the right answer, that seems obvious to do except we need to provide right answers and without giving wrong answers or misinformation for many other things. So to do that is where all our underlying investments go and that's how we think about it over the long term. 
BERT, last year, I think, was a great example of it. It was one of our biggest quality improvements. And that was based on the transformer breakthrough from our Google AI team, which laid the foundation for it. So we are continuing to invest that way in the deep technology. As the web is scaling up, there's more information than ever before. So that's a big part of what we are doing. 
Beyond that, there's a lot of opportunity to improve the user experience. You've seen our efforts around shopping. That's one aspect of how we are working hard to improve the experience there. So -- but we are looking at it pretty deeply. Philipp?",214
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,2806.0,2259900.0,87631363.0,Answer,Philipp Schindler,,Executives,8,"Yes. On the YouTube side, let me start with our direct response business. Growth was truly exceptional this quarter. DR was practically nonexistent on YouTube a few years ago, and it's now a large and fast-growing business, and we're just getting started, in my view. People already, as you know, go to YouTube, to decide what they want to buy, and we want to make it easier for them to buy and make the discovery process overall a lot easier. 
And for creators, we launched new shoppable capabilities, so users can actually make purchases from the favorite creators directly on YouTube. Just as an example, as part of our Brand Connect program, Calvin Klein tested these and drove over, I think it was 200% lift in brand search and sold out multiple products, actually. For merchants, they can now bring their product feeds directly into their video campaigns. And I think we're still scratching the surface on what's possible really with commercial intent on YouTube. 
And then there's, of course, the opportunity to be a major platform for brands. Historical approaches to reaching audiences through, let's just say, call it, linear TV don't really work anymore. Advertisers are using YouTube now to reach the audience they can't find anywhere else. And remember, more 18- to 49-year olds are actually watching YouTube than all linear TV combined. And brands are also seeing more incremental reach on YouTube compared to TV. 
So we're starting to see advertisers buy a mix actually of awareness and more action-oriented formats. They're driving reach and results across the funnel, from awareness to consideration to action. So we see a lot of really interesting opportunities here.",279

First, Ruth, just wanted to ask you about Cloud. You saw some significant benefits just from the change in useful life. But I think in the past, you talked about 1Q perhaps being the biggest loss of the year. I was just curious if that's still the case in your view going forward. 
And then secondly, just given the management transition that we've seen at Waymo, should we expect any change in terms of how things are operated there going forward?",84
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,2806.0,2259900.0,87631366.0,Answer,Ruth Porat,,Executives,11,"Thanks for the question. So in terms of cloud and overall performance, I think the main point I would say is I wouldn't extrapolate generally from quarter-to-quarter, given we're still in the early stages of building the business. We do intend to continue to invest meaningfully in cloud given the opportunity. And so as you said, there were a couple of things that benefited margins in the quarter, both the depreciation expense side, but also lapping the unusually high allowance for credit losses that were recorded back in the first quarter. 
So the main takeaway is we're continuing to invest, we'll invest aggressively in products and go-to-market where we've talked about quite consistently over time. And as much as operating losses and operating margin will benefit from increased scale over time at this point, we do remain focused on investing to build the organization for long-term performance.",147

And Dmitri and Takedra have been working closely with them. And so we'll continue our investments there. Pretty excited that the fully autonomous experience of Waymo 1 is available in Phoenix, and we are also accelerating the development of our next-generation Waymo driver to deployed in San Francisco. 
And this past quarter, Waymo began limited driver testing in San Francisco. And so really focused on making sure we make the hard technical progress so that we can operationalize this, and so we'll continue executing towards that.",103

I think the main thing we'd want to leave you with is that we are seeing, in part, an acceleration of the shift to digital, but it's too early to forecast the extent to which these changes in consumer behavior and advertising spend will endure. 
There are some obvious examples if you think about, for example, the bump in consumption for things like outfitting your home to work-from-home. Obviously, that doesn't repeat. And so our main thing is that we think it's premature at this point to really assess how durable this consumer behavior trends are.",132

First, Philipp, you mentioned a couple of times that durability of the improvement is tough to gauge. Maybe you can help us understand what the key drivers of Search are that you're thinking about over the next couple of years. Is it queries, product improvements, certain changes in verticals like shopping? How are you thinking about driving Search growth? 
And then maybe for Ruth. Model showed great efficiency last year on the cost side and margins. Anything you're learning or experiences during the pandemic that we can think about post-pandemic on cost efficiencies or things like that?",105
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,2806.0,2259900.0,87631375.0,Answer,Philipp Schindler,,Executives,20,"Yes. Thank you so much for the question. I usually look at the different components of Search as basically 4 key drivers. The first one, obviously, being the queries. So are we really the best place for users to turn to when they need information? The second one is, I would call it ads coverage. So what percent of queries is really commercial? And then what percentage are we actually covering with ads? And then we need to ask ourselves, do both of these have upside. 
The third one is click-through rates or individual ad click-through rates close to being optimized. Is there more we can do here by just delivering better creatives, better ads, better answers? To what extent can we deploy next-generation machine learning here? 
And then the last one is obviously the CPC, right? How much is someone willing to bid for a click on their ad? And this is obviously, to a large extent, driven by the quality of traffic we're sending. And then conversion rate is a big driver of this. 
So we're working very closely with our partners, advertisers and so on across the world to help them optimize their conversion rates and their OI. Those are really the 4 big components, and I'm excited about all 4 of them, actually.",217

I think that at the highest level, the approach is unchanged. Our approach on investing in capital allocation is, first and foremost, to support long-term growth with financially sustainable businesses. It's about being sharper within product areas and then making sure we're investing in what I keep referring to as operational excellence, things like our technical infrastructure, systems to improve productivity, to improve velocity of our product teams and then the very important efforts around privacy and security and content moderation. 
And I think, to your question, the experiences of this past year underscored really the value of having made those investments to protect and support operational excellence. It really served us well and customers and our ability to deliver throughout this period of time. 
So that framework is unaltered. I think that part of what you're seeing in the first quarter, I've said it a couple of times now, but are some notable items in the quarter, the lapping of the allowance for credit losses, the benefit from depreciation life. And then there were certain things that were due to COVID, just the lower impact for things like T&E and marketing. 
And so the main point is we will continue to invest for long-term growth, so that's in both areas, Google Services and Cloud. And we continue to maintain that framework that you referenced about looking for efficiencies where they are, but ensuring that we can deliver for users and customers.",254

So I'm wondering if you could talk about the pace of change around data science and how Google can sustain its competitive advantage in those areas. 
And then Philipp, I wanted to follow up on the momentum in Search that you attribute to Google Shopping. Is it fair to say that the shift to free product listings has led to the desired increase in retail advertising across the platform? Or are there other reasons beyond the pandemic that you attribute for that success?",117

And obviously, as we are thinking about AI, it all starts with foundational R&D we do. I think we are one of the largest R&D investors in AI in the world. And so thinking ahead and doing that -- and we're doing it across all the foundational areas, and we are taking many diverse approaches. So as we make breakthroughs -- I earlier spoke about transformers and how that translated as BERT to improve search quality. And similarly, we are very committed to taking the AI improvements and bringing it through our GCP offerings to our enterprise customers as well. 
So it's an approach we are deeply committed to, and we are thinking of it with all layers of the stack. So this is why you see us work hard on TPUs, and we think about the tool chain for developers on top of all that. And so -- and I think if I look at the progress ahead, I think there's a lot more progress coming down the pipe. And so I'm pretty excited, and it's why I feel Google GCP will be differentiated over time as our competitive advantage plays out.",197

And on the Shopping side, look, it's been a year since we brought Bill onboard, Bill Ready. And we pivoted our Shopping strategy to better support retailers and consumers, trying to really build an open retail ecosystem. And we're pleased with the progress we're making. As you said, free listings and 0 commissions, they've actually lowered barriers for online retail. Shopping ads continue to be a powerful way for retailers to promote their products. And the combination of free and paid is a meaningful one. 
We had a set of new partnerships with Shopify and PayPal that are giving retailers a lot more choice. And we will continue to simplify the, let me call it, end-to-end user and merchant experience, of course. In particular, we are trying to streamline and working hard to streamline the back-end experience for merchants, especially for hybrid retailers, so retailers that play in both brick-and-mortar and in digital. And overall, we want to make it much, much easier for retailers to get started on Google and have their information appear across surfaces. And I mentioned the overall strength in retail before.

I think we've had record numbers of new business formations in the country and around the world on the unfortunate impact of COVID, but I think that's -- my guess is it's been a huge tailwind for your business. 
At the same time, we've had this real tip over, I think, of linear TV ad budgets in the back half of the year onto online channels like YouTube. So talk about these new advertisers that you've brought on to the Google platform, what you've been able to do, how confident you are in your ability to retain them, your advertiser retention strategy.",118

I mean, a lot of the new advertisers that you're referring to are obviously SMBs, and there is no doubt that this has been a challenging year for SMBs. The pandemic has disrupted how many of them connect with their customers. But frankly, the pandemic has also been a catalyst for key consumer trends, obviously creating a lot of new opportunities for small businesses. And obviously, consumers are spending more time online. They're buying more online. They were willing to try new brands, and they're eager to support local businesses, SMBs. 
So searches for support local businesses are up significantly since last year. And we've been focused really on helping SMBs with simpler tools so they can actually embrace digital a lot faster. And that's where we have really invested over the year and making everything simpler. 
We had a very wide range of solutions to help them get online. get discovered across all of our key products, Search, Maps, YouTube and so on. And there's multiple, multiple fascinating stories from them coming back to us. And we see this positively reflected in our rates here as well.",193

One for Philipp, one for Ruth. Phil, on the questions on search, I'm wondering when you step back, which categories, which geographies do you think you're still underrepresented as a percentage of marketing spending where we could see potentially even more lift to come? 
And then for Ruth, we always asked in the past about CapEx spending, noticed your useful life. But I wonder has this pandemic change maybe your approach to the office space that you bought and thinking about how the company is going to deploy capital in terms of space going forward and how we think about the future of CapEx the next couple of years based on post pandemic.",116

I'll go ahead and start on the CapEx question. So in terms of CapEx, I think I'll address 2 parts. You asked about office facilities, and I do think it's important to know. 
We are continuing to invest in our technical infrastructure, and that's what you saw again here this quarter, and we'll continue to do so to support growth that we're seeing in Cloud and Search and ads and machine learning. No change there, so you'll be seeing that. 
But the core of your question was really about office facilities. And I think it's -- we've been very clear we do value bringing people together in the office, and we're looking at a hybrid work-from-home, work-from-office model. As we look forward at developing our real estate footprint for offices, what we factor into it is, first, we are growing our headcount. 
We are looking at less density per employee. So even with a hybrid work environment, we will continue to need space, and so we're continuing to build out our campuses and office facilities. What you saw in the first quarter was a slightly slower pace of that and a slower pace on fit-outs as well as we're evolving what does the space look like, but we expect to continue to pick up the pace there as we fit out our spaces for this kind of new reimagined environment. So yes, we'll continue to be investing in campuses around the globe as we have been.",252

And on your first part of your question, look, we're looking at our business from a very global perspective and are excited about it. Keep in mind, we're not just addressing above-the-line marketing budget from an addressable market perspective, so not just traditional advertising, TV advertising and so on. Below-the-line budgets are really significant, everything, promotional pricing, product placements, sponsorships and so on and so on. 
So there's this massive acceleration in e-commerce due to the pandemic. Still more than 80% of commerce is still offline. So there's a huge opportunity here across the world for us to tap into those other budgets. They were really traditionally used in a very different context. So there's plenty of room for growth here. 
And I talked about how we look at it from a queries' perspective, from a commercial intent perspective. We're trying to use machine learning really smartly here. But the real focus in the end has to be how do we actually make our partners successful, how do we drive incremental ROI for them. And as long as we continue this well, I think we should continue to see budgets move our way as well.",196

And maybe in a similar vein, some of the changes you've made in that technology over the last few years may have had the effect of drawing some of your advertiser customers more deeply into your tech stack.

It's good to be with you. Today, I'll give an overview of the quarter, going through some of our product momentum, then touching on Cloud and YouTube. 
First, I want to acknowledge that the new COVID-19 variants have been challenging for so many communities across the world. As the pandemic evolves, we want to help people get the information they need to keep themselves and their family safe. I really encourage everyone to get the vaccine when it's available to you. 
Turning to the quarter, we saw a rising tide of online consumer and business activity. We are proud that our services helped so many businesses and partners. In fact, we set a number of records this quarter. This quarter, publisher partners earned more than they ever have from our network. We also paid more to YouTube creators and partners than in any quarter in our history. And on top of that, over the past year, we have sent more traffic to third-party websites than any year prior, in addition to generating billions of direct connections like phone calls, directions, ordering food and making reservations that drove customers and revenue to businesses around the world that are working to get back on their feet. 
A few years ago, we placed a bet on AI, believing that it would be a fundamental technology that would underpin and dramatically improve all our products. That vision was on full display at our IO Event in May, where we announced new advancements that will be helpful to people and businesses everywhere. As one example, we introduced Multitask Unified Models, or MUM. MUM is a big advancement in Search, a thousand times more powerful than our current systems. It has the ability to learn and transfer knowledge across 75 languages, which means that it can learn from sources in 1 language and help bring that information to you in another. 
We also announced a new AI system called LaMDA that achieves a new level of natural conversation capabilities. We think LaMDA will help make information in computing more accessible, and we are excited about this early-stage research. 
And last week, DeepMind shared its new AlphaFold protein structure database which doubled the number of high accuracy human protein structures available to researchers. In the coming months, it will include almost every sequence protein known to science. 
Turning to Android. We previewed Android 12 at Google IO. The latest version will include new ways to personalize devices and significantly improve speed and power efficiency. We have built new privacy productions directly into the OS, such as the new Privacy Dashboard, to help people keep information safe and private. Android 12 will, of course, be central to Google's own devices. I'm very excited by our fall lineup, which will showcase Android 12 and some of the deep technology investments that are helping us push boundaries. 
Pixel remains at the heart of that long-term strategy, and I'm proud of how the team continues to deliver the best of Google through our family of helpful devices including Nest and Fitbit. You can see all of these devices at our first retail store in New York City, and I'm looking forward to seeing some new ones there soon. 
We are also seeing developers getting tremendous benefit from Google Play. Through the end of Q2, over $120 billion has been earned cumulatively by developers around the world from Google Play. 
Let me talk a bit more about Cloud. Q2 revenue grew 54% year-over-year. Our innovative products, focused go-to-market strategy and growing ecosystem are driving our momentum. Organizations across industries are choosing Google Cloud as their platform for digital transformation, including SAP customers like PayPal, Johnson Controls and Whirlpool, who have deployed SAP environments on Google Cloud. 
This quarter, we saw 3 distinct trends. First, the increase in cyber and ransomware attacks is a wake-up call for the industry. Over 2 decades, Google has built some of the most secure computing systems in the world, and we are proud that our Google Cloud customers can benefit from our experience here. Customers like Major League Baseball are partnering with Google Cloud to further enhance their security program. We pioneered the Zero Trust approach, an architecture that builds in multiple layers of defense against unauthorized access. This approach in other security solutions help customers minimize the impact of cyber attacks and prevent them completely. 
At our Cloud Security Summit last week, we announced new solutions across our portfolio of products. BT is bringing our new security operations solutions based on Chronicle to the managed security services market. And Adobe in the state of Wisconsin are helping product users with our fraud protection product. 
Second, our expertise in real-time data and analytics continues to differentiate us in the data cloud, one of the fastest-growing segments of the market. BigQuery is not only a data warehouse, it's a platform for customer innovation, and it's helping drive our strong year-over-year growth with customers like HCA Healthcare, who will be using BigQuery to analyze data to improve clinical care. 
Additionally, our deep expertise in AI and machine learning remains a key differentiator. Winning customers like Groupe Casino and leading to partnerships with industrial automation leaders like Siemens. Our focus on delivering industry-specific solutions, coupled with our secure open cloud infrastructure, enable us to support leading telecommunications companies such as Reliance; Jio; Telecom Italia, TIM; and Ericsson to work together on applications and new solutions for 5G networks and mobile edge computing. These joined existing customers, Vodafone, Telus and many others. 
Third, Google Workspace continues to show strong growth, particularly in the enterprise space because we have designed the product to meet the challenges of hybrid work. This includes the announcements we made at IO about Smart Canvas as well as expanding our advanced security and compliance capabilities and solutions for front-line workers. These innovations are landing wins with companies like Carvana, the online auto retailer; and software company, Red Hat.
Turning next to YouTube. YouTube Shorts continues to gain momentum. We've been rolling it out everywhere YouTube is available in more than 100 countries worldwide. I'm proud to announce that YouTube Shorts has just surpassed 15 billion daily views. Also pleased with the progress we are making with YouTube subscription products across Music, Premium and YouTube TV, each delivering a fantastic experience and content for viewers. 
And finally, Waymo continues to build and commercialize the Waymo driver and grow the team. People love the fully autonomous ride-hailing service in Phoenix. Since first launching its services to the public in October 2020, Waymo safely served tens of thousands of rights without a human driver in the vehicle, and we look forward to many more. 
Before I close, let me call out our continued work on sustainability, which has been a core value for us since our founding. As you'll recall, we were the first to announce an ambitious goal that will be transformative for the industry. We aim to operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030. In Q2, we announced that 5 of our data centers are already operating at or near 90% carbon-free energy. To help us reach our target everywhere, we implemented a system to shift flexible computing tasks at different times and places with greater availability of carbon-free energy, and we are working to enable geothermal power in more places starting in Nevada next year. 
I want to thank all our employees around the world for their contributions to a great quarter. I know it's been a challenging 18 months. Through it all, taking care of everyone in our workforce has remained a top priority. Now we are reimagining the future of work with flexibility as a guiding principle. I was excited to see so many people in person as we started a voluntary return to our California offices recently. As we make our way back, we are giving employees more flexibility in how and where they work, and we'll continue to invest in our sites in the U.S. and elsewhere. 
Over to Philipp.",1344
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3118.0,2352140.0,89904096.0,Presenter Speech,Philipp Schindler,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. It's great to be with you today. 
We are pleased with the growth in Google Services revenues in the second quarter. Year-on-year performance reflects elevated consumer online activity, broad-based strength in advertiser spend and the lapping of the first ever revenue decline in our ads business last year due to COVID. 
In the second quarter, retail, again, was by far the largest contributor to the year-on-year growth of our ads business. Travel, financial services and media and entertainment were also strong contributors. 
Let's now take a few minutes to talk about the trends we've seen across our business. 
Over the last 18 months, we've been deeply focused on helping businesses, big and small, navigate profound change. First, as a lifeline during the pandemic, and now, as a partner to reaccelerate growth as the world begins to reopen. The road to global recovery is likely to be uneven and unpredictable. That's why the real-time insights we've put in the hands of businesses going into the pandemic will be just as important coming out of it. 
New tools like Travel Insights, which launched in the U.S. this month after rolling out to select countries in APAC and EMEA in December, are helping our partners get a clearer picture of where demand is coming from. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, for example, is leaning into insights and automation across Search, display and YouTube to meet travelers wherever and whenever they need a hotel. They drove nearly 2x more direct bookings from media deployed on Google in the first half of 2021 versus the year prior. 
Or take Amtrak. COVID hit, ridership plummeted, budgets were cut. Uncertainty ensued on how to efficiently reach essential travelers. So we stepped in with insights and automation. Bookings for the last quarter, which was Q2, increased 3x year-over-year, with cost per acquisition down 52%. 
These examples also underscore the value of AI and automation in a world that's changing fast. We know today that more than 80% of our advertisers use automated bidding. Using ML, our ads products are more efficiently connecting businesses with their customers, taking the guesswork out of getting the right message at the right time to the right customer, all in the privacy-first way.
And Performance Max, our news AI part campaign is now in beta. It lets brands buy ads from a single campaign across all Google properties, helping drive more online sales, more leads and/or more store visits. Early results for participating advertisers are great. 
Moving on to retail, where momentum remains strong. We're continuing to build an open ecosystem that benefits both users and merchants. Last year, we removed financial barriers with 3 product listings and 0 commission fees. This year, we're removing integration barriers. With Shopify, WooCommerce, GoDaddy and Square, merchants can now onboard and show their products across Google for free. And our shopping graph is using AI to connect these products to the people who want them, with over 24 billion listings from millions of merchants across the web. 
Let's talk omnichannel. Last quarter, I said it was here to stay, and it is. Retailers continue to build their digital presence to drive both online and offline sales. And we're helping them do it. Take Bed, Bath and Beyond, who quickly pivoted to curbside pickup, pick up in-store and same-day delivery when people were stuck at home. They've continued these offerings across Google with impressive success. Omni and digital shoppers now make up 50% of customers. And in Q1, 1/3 of total digital sales were fulfilled by stores, plus they've tapped YouTube to build awareness for their new customer-inspired owned brands. We'll continue to invest in new ways to help retailers through what is likely to be a long and uncertain recovery around the world. 
Let's move to YouTube, which had a great quarter with strong growth in both brand and direct response. We've seen 3 key trends. First, brand. YouTube is helping advertisers reach audiences they can't find anywhere else. According to Nielsen's total ad ratings reach reporting, from Q4 '18 to Q4 '20, on average, 70% of YouTube's reach was delivered to an audience not reached by the advertisers TV media. In other words, YouTube's reach is becoming increasingly incremental to TV, and this audience dynamic is a huge win for brands. In fact, Nielsen found that U.S. advertisers who shifted just 20% of spend from TV to YouTube generated a 25% increase to the total campaign reach within their target audience while lowering their cost per reach point by almost 20%. These combined effects of approved reach and efficiency are helping advertisers get the most out of their brand investments. 
Second, direct response. Advertisers are turning to the platform to generate demand and drive transactions. Like Malaysian ad tech platform Mindvalley, which focuses on personal growth and learning, increased their investment in TrueView for Action, and now, Video action as people turn to YouTube in record numbers to learn. In Q2, this generated 600,000-plus leads, with 20% coming from the U.S. 
Third, YouTube is uniquely positioned to drive both massive reach and action. We're seeing more advertisers adopt a full-funnel approach to scale their businesses with increased efficiency. Compara, a financial services market leader in Chile, combined a reach and direct response campaign to capitalize on leads. Over 10 weeks, they reached 5 million users with incremental conversions up 70%. This trend is widely embraced by our largest advertisers, where business are breaking down silos between online and offline. 
Since our founding, we've always believed that the future of Google and the future of our partners are intrinsically linked, from individual YouTube creators and major music labels, to global and local online publishers, to play developers, big and small. Our business is built on revenue share models that succeed only when our partners succeed. 
One excellent example of how we're helping our partners innovate is our work with the telecom industry. Sundar talked about efforts in cloud to help them build more efficient networks and transition to 5G. We're also working across Google to help carriers, including AT&T, Telstra, T-Mobile and Verizon, launch new devices and services, add new subscribers, rethink customer engagement via business messaging partnerships and support enterprise growth. 
I want to close with 2 huge thank yous. First, to our customers and partners for their collaboration. Second, to our product, partnership sales and many support teams for their extraordinary work this quarter and dedication to our customers and partner success. 
Now over to Ruth.",1086

Our strong revenue performance in the second quarter reflects lapping the impact of COVID on our business, elevated consumer online activity, broad-based strength in advertiser spend as well as the benefit of excellent ongoing execution by our teams. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter, unless I state otherwise. We'll start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results, and conclude with our outlook. 
For the second quarter, our consolidated revenues were $61.9 billion, up 62%, or up 57% in constant currency. Our total cost of revenue was $26.2 billion, up 41%, primarily driven by growth in TAC, which was $10.9 billion, up 63%; followed by growth in other cost of revenues, which was $15.3 billion, up 29%, the largest driver of which was content acquisition costs. Operating expenses were $16.3 billion, up 22%. 
In terms of the 3 component parts of OpEx, first, the increase in R&D expenses was driven primarily by headcount growth. Second, the growth in sales and marketing expenses was due primarily to the ramp-up of spending on ads in promo in contrast to the pullback in the second quarter last year. Finally, the increase in G&A reflects the impact of charges relating to legal matters. 
Headcount was up 4,061 from the first quarter. Operating income was $19.4 billion, up 203%, and our operating margin in the quarter was 31%. Other income and expense was $2.6 billion, which primarily reflects unrealized gains in the value of investments in equity securities. Net income was $18.5 billion. 
Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services revenues were $57.1 billion, up 63%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $35.8 billion in the quarter were up 68%, with broad-based strength across our business, led again by strong growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $7 billion were up 84%, driven by brand, followed by direct response. Network advertising revenues of $7.6 billion were up 60%, driven by Ad Manager and AdMob. Other revenues were $6.6 billion, up 29%, primarily driven by growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues; followed by hardware, which benefited from the addition of Fitbit revenues; and finally, Google Play, which lapped the increased level of user engagement that started in Q1 last year due to the pandemic. Google Services operating income was $22.3 billion, up 134%. And the operating margin was 39%. 
Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $4.6 billion for the second quarter, up 54%. GCP's revenue growth was again above Cloud overall, reflecting significant growth in both infrastructure and platform services. Once again, strong growth in Google Workspace revenues was driven by robust growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $591 million.  As to our Other Bets in the first quarter, revenues were $192 million, the operating loss was $1.4 billion. 
Let me close with some comments on our outlook. 
In the second quarter, revenues benefited from an FX tailwind of more than 4% at the consolidated level. Based on FX spot rates against the dollar relative to the third quarter of last year, we expect a more muted tailwind to revenues in the third quarter. In terms of outlook by segment, for Google Services, the benefit to revenue growth in Q2 from lapping the effect of COVID last year will diminish through the balance of the year as we begin to lap stronger performance in the second half of 2020. 
In the second quarter, we continued to benefit from elevated consumer online activity and broad-based strength in advertiser spend. We believe it is still too early to forecast the longer-term trends as markets reopen, especially given the recent increase in COVID cases globally. 
Within other revenues, Play revenue growth for the balance of the year will face headwinds due to the impact of lapping elevated engagement in the pandemic as well as the change in fee structure, which was implemented as of July 1. We continue to invest across Google services to support the extraordinary opportunities we see. 
A couple of reminders consistent with prior years: We expect that headcount additions will be seasonally higher in Q3 as we bring on new graduates. In addition, we expect sales and marketing expenses to be more heavily weighted to the back half of the year, in part, to support product launches in the holiday season. As for Google Cloud, we remain focused on revenue growth and are pleased with the trends we are seeing. Across Cloud, we will continue to invest aggressively, given the opportunity we see. 
Turning to CapEx. The results in the second quarter primarily reflect ongoing investment in our technical infrastructure, most notably in servers, to support ongoing growth across Google. We also began to increase the pace of investment in ground-up construction and fit-outs of office facilities, which were slowed due to COVID and are focused now on [ advances ]. 
Turning to cash and capital allocation. We continue to generate strong free cash flow of $16.4 billion in the quarter and $58.5 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the second quarter with $136 billion in cash and marketable securities.

One for Sundar and one for Philipp. Sundar, the first one is you've had so much innovation over the years using AI to improve Search and improve the overall business. Can you just give us some examples of where you still see low-hanging fruit or areas for further improvement in the company's overall products using AI, et cetera, over the next couple of years? 
And then, Philipp, your comments on omnichannel were pretty loud and clear. Give us some examples of where you're most focus to continue to enable more retailers to move in the omnichannel sort of drive that side of the business?",107

We see so much headroom given our bet on AI, going to our most important product of all, Search. When you see the launch of Bird, which was a significant improvement, and we are following that up with MUM, which is another extraordinary advance, so the rate information is growing, pretty rapidly. And so constantly developing better models to improve our search quality ranking, et cetera, is one of the most important ways we invest. Beyond that, I would say, all the work we are doing into making sure computers can understand in a multimodal way, be it images, audio, text, video, and then bringing it across our products, I think, is an important way we'll approach it. Philipp?",123

And to my part of the question, look, we want to make sure that when people come to Google, they are able to basically find the best products and prices available from, frankly, the widest possible range of merchants. And we're making strong progress under Bill's leadership. 
And as I said earlier, 2020 was about removing financial barriers. We made listings free, removed commission fees. And it's worth pointing out the upside of combining free listings with shopping ads actually. Merchants that used both in Q1 saw a 50% lift in clicks once they started. I think that's pretty impressive. 
2021, as I said, has been about removing integration barriers. We have the partnerships with Shopify, Square, BigCommerce, GoDaddy, WooCommerce and so on. And they're making it easier for businesses to get started with us, whether it's across Search and Shopping and image search and YouTube. And then once merchants are onboarded, I mean, there's so much more value we can offer them. We launched a new measurement tools to help retailers better understand performance and pricing. You asked specifically a question about focus areas. 
And then we're making the product and user experience better, not only with our UI/UX research feedback with our tech and AI capabilities. And maybe a cool example is how we're using AR to bring in-store experiences online, like with auto dealerships, and then letting users really try before they buy. And we do this in cosmetics and in apparel categories. And we have the shopping graph, which I mentioned earlier. We think it will open up completely new product experiences across Google. Shopping with Lens is one example. You can shop your screen shots or use your phone camera to find the dress or pair of sneakers that caught your eye or whatever. And we're working hard to build an open retail ecosystem, and that really levels the playing field for all merchants, and we think there is a lot of opportunity ahead. And I think those are our biggest areas of focus.",340

First, just I think the key initiative over the last couple of years has been to bring the full breadth of Google Services to customers. So I was hoping you could talk more just about -- when you think about the Search and overall ads recovery, and then also growth in Google Cloud, how those efforts are going as you work across businesses with corporate customers and what their reception has been? And then, Ruth, just on costs kind of in the back half and going forward, as you think about bringing some of these costs back, just curious if you can comment more around some of the puts and takes as you think about the overall cost structure pre COVID versus post COVID?",127
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3118.0,2352140.0,89904104.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,11,"Yes. Thanks, Doug. I would say, overall, as you realize, it's a broad digital shift. Customers are looking for digital transformation. And depending on the sector they are in, they look to Alphabet as a digital partner, and we try to bring the broader solution set that's possible across our capabilities. And that's been working well. 
You mentioned Cloud, most of our Cloud customers are either in conversations with us. It could be because they're concerned about security on their supply chain, or they're trying to understand the shift to digital and invest more in data analytics. Or the shift to hybrid workforce is what's probably getting them to think about Workspace and so on. 
And if they are retailers, we can bring in our expertise across ads, the work we are doing on commerce to be -- with the partnerships we have. And so we can bring those additional expertise to bear. And so that's a trend we are seeing across. Philipp gave examples of our telco partnerships. And so across our priority verticals, we are able to engage in a broad way. And maybe the recent Google-wide partnership with Univision was another example of a multiyear, multiproduct partnership with companies.",202
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3118.0,2352140.0,89904105.0,Answer,Ruth Porat,,Executives,12,"And with respect to the second question, how we think about investments in the back half. Really, the driving focus is how do we support near-term, long-term quality growth. And I think it's important to note that some of our costs are less variable in the short term, such as depreciation and the operations cost of our data centers. So when you look at  Q2 performance, in part, the meaningful year-on-year improvement in the operating margin in the second quarter, clearly reflects the strong revenue growth, but also the fact that some of these costs are less variable in the short term. 
However, to support long-term growth, and very much to your question, it's true across both Google Services and Google Cloud, we will continue to increase the pace of investment. And that's true in headcount, it's true with compute, sales and marketing, really across the board. And you also heard that in some of my comments about CapEx. We're continuing to pick up the pace of investment in office facilities. Both fit-outs and ground-up construction have been slowed as a result of COVID, and we're pleased that the pace has picked up, and that really relates to our comments about continuing to build out across the U.S., around the globe, in line with continuing to invest in headcount growth. 
I'd make one other point, which is, I think you're aware of this, but in this quarter, the results also reflect the benefit from the change in useful lives that we talked about earlier in the year that reduced depreciation expense. It's a benefit of about $721 million in the quarter, and the benefit from this change will be lower in the second half as you're looking ahead.",288

When you look at Search in the quarter, it really accelerated beyond the comp. And if you look at it quarter-over-quarter, it was really good. So wondering if there's any products or verticals that really surprised you, or things to call out? And how do you think about the sustainability here, specifically in Search and the product pipeline from here? 
And then secondly, on Cloud, really saw a nice margin improvement there. How do you feel about where you are on the infrastructure side and ability to really continue to show kind of that improvement in margins over time?",101

Maybe I'll take the second first. On the Cloud side, first of all, we do investments in our infrastructure. First of all, we are doing it across a set of cloud services we are building for Google. And it's the same that we bring to Cloud, and so there's tremendous synergies we have there. And maybe to give you an example of it, I already mentioned data analytics and processing. It's the same infrastructure, be it BigQuery, et cetera, which we have invested and built over time. And people are looking to use data analytics alongside with machine learning and AI. They want to do this across structure and unstructured data, do it across any platform. And so that's the kind of capability we are able to bring. And overall, I'll let Ruth comment on maybe the margin side of this a bit more. Ruth?",147

I would just build on Sundar's comment. There's really no change in our approach to building the Cloud business. We do intend to continue to invest meaningfully. We are very pleased with the business, as we both said. As an example, we're continuing to build out the global footprint, continuing to invest in our compute capacity globally. As an example, we most recently announced a second cloud region in India. This is our 26th cloud data center region globally. And so continuing to invest across the board, given the opportunity that we see. 
And as I said last quarter, I would not extrapolate from quarter-to-quarter, given we still are in the early stages of building the business, and we do intend to continue to invest aggressively, including expanding our go-to-market organization, our channel expansion, our product offerings and our compute capacity. Excited about what we're seeing the team executing upon here.",152

Is it fair to say as well based on your initial comments that security also represents some competitive differentiation that's contributing incrementally to business development? 
And then for Philipp, in the momentum in YouTube and capturing the shift in viewership and advertising away from linear TV, how do the different Google Services fit together in that? Not just core YouTube, but Android TV, Google TV, YouTube TV. Is this something that's been increasingly connected or linked in the back end and as well on the front end for consumers?",111

Obviously, Google for a long time. We are cloud native. We pioneered approaches like Zero Trust, built the architecture out from a security-first perspective. And so particularly over the course of the last couple of years, as companies have really -- with the recent attacks, they really started thinking deeply about the vulnerabilities, supply chain security has been a major source of consensus, particularly over the past few quarters. Cyber threats, increasingly, is in the mind of not just CIOs, but CEOs across our partners. 
And so it's definitely an area where we are seeing a lot of conversations, a lot of interest. It's our strongest product portfolio, and we are continuing to enhance our solutions, be it integrating Chronicle, BeyondCorp and all the product components we have there. So a definite source of strength, and you'll continue to see us invest here.",155

Maybe let me start on the brand side. The global shift to online video and streaming continues, with over like 2 billion monthly active users now, 1 billion plus hours of video watched every day. I think we're at the forefront of this shift. And advertisers have increasingly needed to look beyond linear TV alternatives to achieve their reach and awareness goals. And as I said earlier, Nielsen total ad ratings reach reporting has found, on average, 70% of YouTube's reach was delivered to an audience, not reached by the advertisers TV media. So not only are we driving improved reach, but we're also helping brands do it more efficiently. 
And as a result of this, you see many advertisers reevaluating the media mix and increasing their investments in our platforms. And as far as the direct response part goes, we're helping advertisers convert intent into action. We try to drive performance at an incredible scale. Take an example like with video action campaigns, which is our next-generation TrueView for Action format. Advertisers are getting access to even more inventory across YouTube and our partners, all in a single automated campaign. And as I said before, we're working really hard to make YouTube not only more actionable, but also more shoppable. 
So YouTube is proving to be meaningful for not just brand building and reaching a massive audience, but also for converting viewers into buyers. And what's nice is that we're seeing more advertisers leveraging brand to create demand and direct response to convert it. So they're basically using the funnel very, very smartly. 
And then to the second part of your second question, the YouTube TV ads, for example. This part, we're really trying to bring the -- well, connected TV is -- let me phrase it from a connected TV part. I think that's easier. 
It is really the fastest-growing consumer service that we have. And that growth started before the pandemic and has frankly solidified since. And in the U.S., we have over 120 million people watch YouTube on TVs every month, and that's up from like 100 million last year. We're #1 in reach and watch time among ad-supported streaming services. So we're very, very happy with the development that we're seeing here.",400

Look, there's a ton of commercial intent across YouTube, and it was a shopping destination before COVID. I mean, think unboxing videos, product reviews, make up tutorials and so on. And throughout the pandemic, we've really seen more shoppers turn to the platform for ideas, inspiration and really help them decide what to buy. And a number of shopping capabilities' already underway, and we're working really hard to make it easier for users to discover and buy directly on YouTube. And I mentioned how a merchant can globally add their product feeds now right into video action campaigns, and brands and shoppers alike are loving it, and we've also done beta testing this, for example, with Discovery Ads. And last quarter, I mentioned how viewers can make purchases from their favorite creators via early experiments with brand connect and shop with product shelves, and early adopters are seeing a lot of success here.

And then secondly, how do you go from tens of thousands of Waymo rides to millions of rides? Like what are the biggest obstacles to that? Any clue at all as to how long that takes? Are the issues more regulatory, more technical?",114

But obviously, local communities are in varying stages of recovery. Some are reopening, while others are, unfortunately, returning to lockdown. And we're focused on continuing to, I would say, level the playing field for SMBs here. And from getting them online and, frankly, set up for success, you're giving them all the digital tools they need to get discovered and be ready for what's ahead. This includes the ability to like seamlessly transition between online and offline and reach customers nearby, far beyond their local neighborhoods as well. 
So over the past few months, I mean, literally, just the past few months, we've made it easier for SMBs to show their products across Google for free, and we added new ways for them to highlight in-store inventory through local inventory ads. And we've also made it easier for them to leverage the power of YouTube. They now can create video ad campaigns literally within minutes via their smartphone. And these are just a few examples of the ways we're helping. Plus, also interesting trend, people are more eager than ever to support their local small businesses. Searches for support local business are up like 20x last year in the U.S. alone. And this is creating a lot of opportunity for SMBs overall. And I don't know, take an example, like [ Ayla Beauty ], for example, it's a San Francisco beauty brand. They made 100% pivot to online during the pandemic. And with insight into popular wellness and beauty searches and Google Ads, has been really able to grow their business significantly over the last year.",278

And where do you see the opportunity for Google in terms of your product offerings to maybe improve consumer adoption of connected TVs? 
And then for you, Philipp, people have been asking about Search. But if you look at Search on a 2-year stack, the growth is the highest it has been years.

Look, I mean, there is a shift to these becoming computing devices over time. They're going to be connected computing experiences. People who both consume content passively, actively, including gaming, over-the-top video and so on. So we view this as part of our platform shift. Android TV has made tremendous strides. It's a very customizable platform. We are working not only with TV providers globally, we are doing it with cable box manufacturers, as well as we supplement it with Google TV, with Chromecast as well. 
So it's a significant investment from our side, making sure we can drive that shift. And obviously, it has a lot of synergies for us in terms of being able to bring our services to our users as well as give more opportunities for our Play developers to reach more users as well.

Let me maybe talk a little about how we think about the overall market for Search. In the addressable market, in the last call -- last quarter, I gave you a little bit of a breakdown here. But what is really important is we're not just addressing above-the-line marketing budgets, which is different metrics around, let's say, around $500 billion which is traditional advertising, TV advertising and so on. There is also significant upside in below-the-line budgets overall, like promotional pricing, product [ placements ] and sponsorships and so on. 
And sure, we've seen COVID accelerate the shift to e-commerce at an astounding rate, but keep also in mind, 80% of commerce still remains offline. So there's a lot of room for digital to play a bigger role, and we think we can tap into other budgets that were traditionally used for, let's say, local advertising to drive sales. 
And as we think about our long runway for growth, we also think obviously about improving user and advertiser experiences for years to come here. And we're constantly asking ourselves how do we drive better answers to queries, including those with commercial intent? And how do we use our ML to deliver even more relevant and higher-quality experiences for users? And our primary focus is really on delivering great experience for users and driving incremental value for our partners and making them successful. And I think as long as we do this, we should continue to see budgets move our way.",263

But if I take your ad dollars this quarter, $50 billion in annualized, it's like $200 billion a year. Are you or the Board focused at all on trying to diversify away from the ad market? Or do you just feel like there's so much runway that there is no real reason to stay focused on non ad-based growth?",73

At a high level, we -- multiple parts to your question. Obviously, we are very focused on -- we have a mission. We have an approach of being helpful across certain important attributes. And we do deep investments in computer science and AI to build services. And out of that, naturally, there is diversification over time. When you look at YouTube, is contributing to that. You look at Cloud, and within Cloud, we have both GCP and Workspace contributing to that. And longer term, we have efforts like Waymo as well. 
Beyond that, as both Philipp and Ruth have spoken about, with this digital shift, we see a lot of headroom in terms of where market for either advertising or e-commerce. And so we see a lot of headroom there as well. 
So we take a long-term view. We start from first principles to its focusing on both investing in deep technology and solving user problems. And out of that, I think you have a set of diversified models that emerged, both different types of businesses. And also within a business, for example, in YouTube, we have both ads and subscription over time. And so I think we'll continue approaching it that way with an eye for the long term.",211

In 2016, I laid out our vision to become an AI-first company. Five years later, this quarter's results show how our investments in AI are building more helpful products for people and for our partners in local communities. Today, I'll begin with new product highlights then I'll cover our Cloud business, followed by YouTube.
First, product highlights. Search remains the heart of what we do. We have made remarkable advances over the past 23 years that benefits Search and related products like Google Assistant, which just celebrated 5 years. Earlier this year, we announced that we reached a significant milestone with multitask unified model or MUM for short. MUM is 1,000x more powerful than BERT and can understand information across many contexts, like text and images.
At our Search On event in September, we shared how we are using MUM to improve Google Lens so people can Search using both images and words. We also shared that we are bringing a more visual shopping experience to Search, powered by the Google Shopping graph. It links shoppers with over 24 billion product listings from merchants across the web.
Google Maps now offers eco-friendly routing. It lets drivers in the U.S. choose a more fuel-efficient route, saving money and reducing emissions. Maps now has a wildfire layer so that people can get up-to-date details and make quick informed decisions during emergencies.  
Finally, in Search and our Discover feed, we are continuing to support the News ecosystem and make quality journalism more accessible. Philipp will give a bit more detail about our News showcase partnerships.  
Turning next to Hardware. I hope you saw our fall Pixel event last week. I'm very excited about the range of Pixel phones available this holiday season. The new Pixel 6 and 6 Pro bring together the best of Google AI, software and hardware, with the most advanced and inclusive cameras we've ever built. 
They're beautiful, fast and powered by Google Tensor, a first-ever system-on-a-chip. It's specifically built to support Google AI and machine learning on device, and provides a long-term foundation for our Pixel devices. We also introduced our new Nest Renew program, which uses Nest thermostats to support clean energy use in the home. 
On to Android. Android 12 is getting great reviews. It's the biggest design change in Android's history with new widgets to personalize your phone. We also introduced accessibility features that use gestures to control your phone and communicate. Android 12 is secured by default and private by design. 
New dashboards and indicators make it easier to view and adjust privacy permissions, and disable access to device sensors and location information. We've also made progress with the Made for India affordable smartphone co-developed with Reliance. The JioPhone Next device features premium localized capabilities and is on track to launch in market by Diwali. 
On to cloud, where we see continued momentum with Q3 revenue growing 45% year-over-year with GCP's revenue growth rate about Cloud overall. At Cloud Next, 2 weeks ago, we unveiled hundreds of new capabilities, services and solutions. We also announced 20 new and expanded partnerships to support the growth and scale of our customers around the world. More than any other top cloud provider, Google Cloud has unique capabilities to meet the needs of enterprises, digital natives and SMBs around the world. I'll highlight 3. 
First, our leadership in real-time data, analytics and AI is winning customers like Carrefour Belgium, Deutsche Post DHL and Wendy's, who are unlocking data to deliver unique business outcomes. BigQuery, our leading data warehouse solution is reducing costs and driving productivity at Cardinal Health and ATB Financial. Our differentiated AI and ML-based industry solutions are helping leading global companies. GE Appliances, a Haier company, is integrating Vision AI into their next-generation smart home appliances. And iCare retail is using recommendations AI to drive a 30% increase in customer click-through rate.
Second, customers see value in our open scalable infrastructure that enables them to run workloads anywhere on our cloud at the edge or in their data centers. [ Road and fields ] scale that's SAP environment. Siemens Energy is migrating its global network of data centers and company-wide SAP systems and Indonesia's largest technology digital native, GoTo Group, is supporting over 100 million monthly active users with Google Cloud. 
General Mills, Bell Canada and Wells Fargo are harnessing our leadership in multi-cloud and our open development environment. And to meet the unique digital sovereignty needs of customers around the world, we announced industry-first partnerships with T-Systems in Germany and Thales in France.  
Third, as consumers, businesses and schools continue their shift towards hybrid work, the threats of cybersecurity continue to increase. Customers are turning to Google Workspace and our cybersecurity platform to provide the ease of use, collaboration and security they need. These include organizations like Discovery, CommonSpirit Health, and the State of Maryland who want to foster creativity while securely protecting their users.  
We are also seeing strong growth in our broad portfolio of cybersecurity products. This includes Chronicle, one of our zero trust offerings, which JetBlue uses to direct cybersecurity threats, helping to protect its customers and enterprise. We are bringing our team's deep expertise to customers through the Google cybersecurity action team and a new Work Safer program, which provides best-in-class security for e-mails, meetings, messaging and more.
Earlier, I mentioned a few of the sustainability-related product features we announced. Our cloud customers already benefit from operating on the world's cleanest cloud. And last year, we set an ambitious goal to run our data centers and campuses on 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030. 2/3 of the electricity consumed by Google data centers in 2020 was matched with local carbon-free sources on an hourly basis. And our new carbon footprint tool gives customers carbon emissions insights associated with their Google Cloud platform usage.  
Now over to YouTube for a few highlights. We recently surpassed 50 million music and premium subscribers, including those in trial, and YouTube shots continues to see higher option rates. In the past year, the average number of daily first-time creators more than doubled. Next week, as global leaders gather in Glasgow to address climate change, YouTube is partnering with COP26 to live stream conference activities, making the event more accessible for everyone.  
As we grow, we are maintaining our open global platform responsibly by removing harmful content and reducing borderline content. Both our AI investments and the promotion of trusted sources have helped us significantly lower the violator view rate, which is the percentage of views on YouTube from content that violates our policies.  
On to our other bets. Waymo began welcoming riders to its Trusted Tester program in San Francisco, in addition to its fully autonomous ride-hailing service currently in Phoenix. Next year, Waymo will open a dedicated trucking hub in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, helping support commercial freight routes across the Southwest. And we announced last week the first commercial expansion of Wing's on-demand air delivery service to Walgreens customers in select locations.  
To close, the world is slowly starting to travel and meet up in person. And this quarter, I joined events virtually to celebrate some big milestones in regions around the world. Earlier this month, we announced a $1 billion investment in Africa over 5 years to support the continent's digital transformation. And September marked 20 years since we opened our first office outside of the U.S. in Tokyo. We now have thousands of employees in 28 offices across the Asia Pacific region, and we are investing in cloud regions and digital skills programs to help expand economic opportunity there.  
As you can see, our business in APAC is growing really well. In Africa, Asia Pacific and beyond, it's been a successful quarter, and we have lots more innovation and product development on the way. Thanks to our employees around the world for their contributions. As we continue our mode to hybrid work, I hope to see more of you in person soon. Thank you, and over to Philipp.",1341
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3230.0,2413377.0,91772008.0,Presenter Speech,Philipp Schindler,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Sundar, and hi, everyone. It's great to be with you all today. We're pleased with the growth in Google Services revenues in the third quarter. Year-on-year performance was driven by broad-based strength and advertiser spend. Consumer online activity also remained elevated. In the third quarter, retail was again by far the largest contributor to year-on-year growth of our ads business. Media and entertainment, finance and travel were also strong contributors.
Let's take a deeper look at some of the trends that drove this quarter's performance. First, from a big picture, a global recovery perspective, we continue to see a lot of unevenness. Some economies have restarted and reaccelerated, albeit at different speeds. Other countries, depending on local regulations and vaccines have been slower to rebound. It's clear that uncertainty is the new normal. The world is in flux.  
So when it comes to anticipating change, predicting demand and investing in innovation, businesses need as much support now as they did 1.5 years ago and we continue to help. Like in travel, where hotel free booking links are increasing traffic for many partners, from OTAs to boutique hotels. Consumers like more choice. Travel partners like free exposure. And advertisers like to augment paid campaigns with free listings. So last month, we launched free booking links for things to do in a new ad format that makes it easier to promote local experiences.  
Now when you search zip lining, aquariums or the Tokyo Tower, you can buy tickets directly on Google. And then there are companies like Alaska Airlines that are harnessing first-party data and automation across Search to navigate market fluidity and better understand the lifetime value of their customers. They've increased return on ad spend by 30% plus versus the same period pre-COVID. Beyond travel, business of all kinds are increasingly adopting tools like AI-driven automation and insights to connect with customers no matter what stage of the recovery they're in.
150-year-old luxury retailer, de Bijenkorf turned to local insights and automation to speed up cross-border expansion beyond the Netherlands and Belgium to Germany, France and Austria. With a multipronged approach, including shopping campaigns, de Bijenkorf drove substantial growth throughout the pandemic, returning visitors to online stores were up fourfold in first half 2021 versus 2020, which leads me to retail, we had another stellar quarter. 
We've seen explosive growth in digital over the last 20-some months but as the world begins to reopen, shoppers are returning to stores. Brick-and-mortar isn't dead. Instead, omnichannel is in full force. Searches for open now near me are up 4x globally versus last year. Strong growth in local shopping queries means people are researching their visits to stores more often before they go.  
As a result, we've seen more advertisers include in-store sales alongside e-commerce goals to drive omnichannel growth. Adoption has nearly doubled over the past year. Take Kohl's. It optimized media spend into trending categories and launched curbside pickup just 2 weeks after its 1,100 stores shut down. After testing local inventory ads in Q4, Kohl's went all in on omnichannel bidding across its paid Search portfolio and is leaning heavily into a full funnel approach on YouTube, including CTV. 
Kohl's net sales were up 31% year-over-year in Q2, led by higher foot traffic and continued strength in digital. Innovating in omnichannel and next-gen user experiences remains core to our shopping strategy. A few of our latest launches include: easier ways for business to show the local services they offer, from hair extensions to auto repair across Search and Maps; local inventory ads that highlights which products are in stock and when to pick them up; free shipping and easy return annotations across Search and shopping; AR capabilities that bring in-store moments online and that users try before they buy; and then, instantly shoppable images with Google Lens, plus a new visual browsable experience on Search.
There's a lot more to come, including tapping into commerce on YouTube. From shoppable live stream experiments with retailers like Sephora, Target and Walmart to pilots that view us buy directly from their favorite creators videos, we're still in the early innings of what's possible. Our direct response momentum remains strong. Video action campaigns are driving more conversions than previous formats. And by adding product feeds to these campaigns, advertisers are achieving, on average, over 60% more conversions at a lower cost than those without. 
Our brand business is also performing well. As I said last quarter, YouTube's reach is becoming increasingly incremental to TV. We're helping advertisers find audiences they can't find anywhere else. Connected TV is driving part of this growth. It's our fastest-growing screen. The precision of digital paired with the scale of linear is proving to be an awesome combo and even more so now with the expansion of video action campaigns for CTV. 
Advertisers can now drive conversions on the big screen, which brings me to help brands of all sizes continue to buy YouTube at both ends of the funnel, to create future demand while they convert existing demand. And they're seeing upside. For example, we found that advertisers using both DR and brand video, brand driving 28% of conversion assists. Domino's Pizza is a great example. The U.K. business delivered a 9x return on ad spend on their direct response campaigns when paired with their brand campaigns.  
Lastly, I've said it before, and I'll say it again. Our success is only possible because of our customers and partners. We do well only when they do well. And it's a result of the revenue share models we've talked about many times before.  
Three highlights. First, as Sundar mentioned, our commitment to high-quality journalism and open access to information remains steadfast. It's been 1 year since we launched News Showcase. In Q3 alone, we signed over 120 deals and launched in 3 new markets: Japan, Colombia and Austria. And of the more than 1,000 publications across a dozen plus countries that we now have on board, 90% are considered local, regional or community newspapers.  
Second, over 2 million creators are now making money and building their businesses on YouTube via YouTube Partner Program with 10 different ways to monetize their content, from Super Chat to BrandConnect. The next generation of businesses and media companies are being built by creators on YouTube and we're excited to help them grow. 
Third, I echo Sundar's excitement on Pixel. And to bring it to life and to users, we worked with an entire ecosystem of partners. We signed partnership agreements with over 45 carriers and retailers across 9 countries at launch, including deep collaboration with each of the major U.S. carriers: AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon.
On behalf of many, I want to say how grateful we are to collaborate with so many amazing customers and partners every day. We can't wait to start doing more of this in person again soon. Also, a huge thank you to our sales, partnerships, product and support teams for their work and dedication. The impact you all continue to have is, as we say in German, [Foreign Language]. With that, Ruth, over to you.",1187
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3230.0,2413377.0,91772009.0,Presenter Speech,Ruth Porat,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Philipp. Our revenue performance in the third quarter reflects continued broad-based strength in advertiser spend and elevated consumer online activity as well as a strong contribution from Google Cloud. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter, unless I state otherwise. We will start with results at the Alphabet level followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook.
For the third quarter, our consolidated revenues were $65.1 billion, up 41% or up 39% in constant currency. Our total cost of revenues was $27.6 billion, up 31%, primarily driven by growth in TAC, which was $11.5 billion, up 41%. Other cost of revenues were $16.1 billion, up 24%, reflecting in part the benefit from the change in useful lives made earlier this year. The largest driver of the growth in other cost of revenues was content acquisition costs. 
Operating expenses were $16.5 billion, up 19% in terms of the 3 component parts of OpEx: first, the increase in R&D expenses was driven primarily by headcount growth; second, the growth in sales and marketing expenses was driven by headcount growth, followed by the continued ramp-up of spending on ads and promo in contrast to the pullback in the third quarter last year. Finally, the increase in G&A reflects the impact of charges relating to legal matters followed by headcount growth.
Operating income was $21 billion, up 88% and our operating margin was 32%. Other income and expense was $2 billion, which primarily reflects unrealized gains in the value of investments in equity securities. Net income was $18.9 billion. We continue to generate strong free cash flow of $18.7 billion in the quarter, and $65.7 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the third quarter with $142 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services revenues were $59.9 billion, up 41%. The Google Search and other advertising revenues of $37.9 million in the quarter were up 44%, with broad-based strength across our business, led again by strong growth in retail. 
YouTube advertising revenues of $7.2 billion were up 43% due to strength in both direct response and brand advertising. The deceleration in the growth rate versus the second quarter was driven by lapping a strong recovery in brand in the third quarter of last year.
Network advertising revenues of $8 billion were up 40%. Other revenues were $6.8 billion, up 23%, driven by growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues and hardware, which benefited from the addition of Fitbit revenues. Google Services operating income was $24 billion, up 66% and the operating margin was 40%.  
Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $5 billion for the third quarter, up 45%. GCP's revenue growth was again above cloud overall, reflecting significant growth in both infrastructure and platform services. Strong revenue growth in Google Workspace was driven by robust growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $644 million.
As to our other bets in the third quarter, revenues were $182 million. The operating loss was $1.3 billion. Let me close with some comments on our outlook. With respect to foreign exchange impact on reported revenues, based on current spot rates, we expect virtually no impact in Q4 in contrast to a 1.5% tailwind in Q3 and 4% in Q2.
In terms of outlook by segment for Google Services, as I noted, the strength of our revenues in Q3 reflected both underlying strength in advertiser and user activity as well as the impact from lapping weaker performance in the comparable period last year. Given the gradual recovery in results through the back half of 2020, the benefit from lapping prior year performance diminished in Q3 versus Q2 and will diminish further in Q4. 
Within other revenues, in the fourth quarter, we expect the ongoing drivers of revenue growth to be hardware due to the benefit from the holiday selling season and inclusion of Fitbit as well as YouTube subscriptions. Google Play's contribution to revenue growth will remain more muted, given the ongoing impact of both lapping the increased level of user engagement that started in the first quarter of 2020 due to the pandemic as well as the fee change that took effect on July 1. Within Google Services, we expect sales and marketing expenses to be elevated in the fourth quarter to support the holiday season. 
Turning to Google Cloud. We remain focused on revenue growth and are pleased with the trends we are seeing. In GCP, our customer wins, as Sundar noted, reflect our multiyear investments in products and solutions that are purpose-built to solve for the biggest opportunities within our targeted 8 industries. The benefit of these solutions to our customers is clear, and they are choosing to work with us as their long-term transformation partner.  
With respect to Workspace, we are pleased with the ongoing momentum in both seat growth and average revenue per seat, which underscores the value of collaborative solutions, in particular as people increasingly are embracing a hybrid work model. Across Cloud, we continue to invest aggressively, both in growing our go-to-market and product teams as well as building out our cloud regions. At the Alphabet level, headcount grew by nearly 6,000 in the third quarter including our seasonal campus hires, and we expect robust headcount growth in Q4 for both Google Services and Google Cloud.
Turning to CapEx. The results in the third quarter primarily reflect ongoing investment in our technical infrastructure, most notably in servers to support ongoing growth in Google Services and Google Cloud. We also continue to increase the pace of investment in fit-outs and ground-up construction of office facilities to accommodate our ongoing headcount growth globally. We will continue to pursue real estate acquisition opportunities where it makes sense as you saw in our New York City announcement in Q3.

Big picture. Coming back to how you started the call, when you look out over the next 3 to 5 years, what do you see as some of the big investments that Google needs to make to marry your ambitions on AI and machine learning against aligning Google's broader product and services against the rising digitalization of the global economy? I would love to have that as a framing over the next 3 to 5 years. 
And then maybe I'm not sure if it's directed better at Philipp or Ruth. But on a shorter duration basis, there seem to be an element of headwinds and tailwinds in the broader macro economy. Can you talk a little bit about the business of Google's products and what elements of reopening dynamic you're seeing on a sector basis versus potential headwinds as we move into Q4 and next year from things like supply chain shortages or labor shortages or things like that?",164

You're right in the fact that AI and ML itself is the broader deeper investments we are driving and we're using it across our product portfolio. The recent launch of Tensor and Pixel 6 is a great example of that. 
So for example, we are willing to go as deep in the stack as needed, silicon, both on the cloud side with our Tensor processing units and Google Tensor on the client side is an example of that. So overall thinking through compute, networking, building data centers, making sure they are clean and carbon-free and really investing in the advanced models and algorithms on top, which is -- a lot of it's just done by our AI research teams.  
So making sure we are able to attract the best talent across the world is all part of that. So -- but you'll continue to see us take -- undertake deep technology investments. And beyond that horizon, that's why we are thinking even about areas like quantum computing and so on.",173

But because every region is different, it's hard to make a generalization from the data right now. 
That said, the consumer shift to digital is real and will continue even as we start seeing people return to stores. Shopping habits have ebbed and flowed over the last 20 months. But the underlying takeaway is that people want more choice, they want more information, more flexibility, and we don't see this reversing. Omnichannel, I talked about it, is definitely in full force. I said this earlier. We've been really focused on building features and solutions to help retailers, large and small succeed here. 
And we think this will continue as the world reopens and shoppers fluctuate between online and in-store based on whatever is really more convenient. YouTube is exciting for many reasons. It's incredible to see the amount of content that's valuable for people across so many topics, and we're helping advertisers tap into this. 
And whether it's browsing for inspiration, product research or actually making the purchase, 1 billion shopping sessions happen across Google every day, and they're happening on Search and YouTube and Image Search and the shopping tab and Lens and so on.

We have 2. The first one, you have made notable strides in the Retail Search category over the past 12 to 18 months, and there seems to be more to come. Can you talk to us about which other Search verticals you are most excited to innovate and invest around the next -- within the next year or 2?  
My second question is maybe one on augmented reality. You have made some real progress here and now have some budding product integration. Philosophically, how do you think about the key augmented reality use cases you are focused on enabling? And do you need an Alphabet-specific hardware set to capitalize on the opportunity?",120

On augmented reality, we've -- for a while, we've deeply focused on thinking through computing for the long term. We've talked about ambient computing. And it's just a matter of time before, beyond phones, you will see other successful form factors and AR is an exciting part of that future. 
We are looking at all the deep investments we need to make. I think it's going to take some time. And so for example, when you look at something like Google Lens or when you look at the fact that we are making Search work in a multimodal way or when you think about YouTube and making sure it works well in a VR/AR world. So we are obviously investing in all our services. And beyond that, from a computing standpoint, both our hardware teams as well as our platform teams are thinking through definitely, and it's going to be a major area of investment for us.  
On the first question about -- I think Philipp spoke about shopping. We obviously -- Search is -- part of what makes Search so successful is people use it for a wide variety of use cases. And so we really invest comprehensively across all experiences, be it local and Maps, be it Images, be it videos. And so we are definitely investing a lot. People do come to Search for education as well. So making sure we are comprehensive. 
Health has been a major area of focus, particularly through the pandemic. And so the strength of Search is both in its depth and breadth. And so -- and getting it right with a high focus on quality and we'll continue to do that.",288

First, I was just curious if you're seeing any impact at all from the Apple iOS changes in your business and perhaps particularly in YouTube?

Starting with the iOS 14 changes. So overall, as we said, we're pleased with the strength across our business in the third quarter. It was broad-based. It was global. In terms of the iOS 14 changes specifically, they had a modest impact on YouTube revenues. That was primarily in direct response. I think as you all know well, focusing on privacy has been core to what we've been doing consistently. And let me have Philipp take you through some more on that.",86

So from our standpoint, we see ATT as one aspect of the many broader ecosystem changes that are underway. And we've been investing in privacy preserving technology for many years. Our focus is on supporting developers, small and large advertisers, creators, publishers, so that they're able to mitigate impact to their businesses. 
And we really see the future of digital advertising being built on advances and privacy preserving on device technologies, which support the free and open Internet, and obviously, a robust ads ecosystem. On your supply chain questions, I would say performance in Q3 was strong across ads revenue lines, regions and nearly all verticals, In line with the widespread reporting of supply chain weakness in the auto industry, we've seen some impact on vehicles within the auto vertical, which started earlier in the year, although the impact has really been offset somewhat by increased demand in related areas like parts, accessories, repairs and maintenance.",157

Sundar, margins have been strong this year, and I think the depreciation change has helped. Can you just comment on how you see the current investing spending levels of the company? Are you in good shape, anything where you might be increasing investment?
And then for Ruth, there are news about Play Store fee cuts on the subscription piece. How do we think about that maybe impacting the business in '22 when those start to take effect?",84

And applying it across a prioritized set of areas. And so no change in the framework.

Maybe, Ruth and Philipp?",82

An important point, hopefully self-evident, is that the improvement in the Q3 operating margin does reflect the strong revenue growth in the quarter. And as I said on the second quarter call, some of our costs are less variable in the short term, such as depreciation and the operations costs of our data centers. And we did have a gross margin benefit from this in the near term. 
But consistent with Sundar's comments and Philipp's, we do continue to invest here. And then to support long-term growth across both Google Services and Google Cloud, we're continuing to invest at a meaningful clip across headcount, compute, sales and marketing. I noted the headcount increase in Q3 of about 6,000, and we do expect the pace of hiring to remain strong. 
The benefit from the change in useful lives was obviously in the quarter as well, and that benefit does diminish, is lower in the fourth quarter. So just to put some of that in context, and as Sundar said, we are continuing to invest in the business, focusing on long-term growth. 
With respect to the play changes, again, just as it relates to this quarter, and I think as I said in the opening comments, the key point to note there was that results lapped the strength that we had in the -- going into the pandemic from user engagement and that continue seeing user engagement. But yes, there is a reduction in the fee that kicks in. This one that we just announced last week, it kicks in as of January 2022. And we'll let you do the modeling on that.",300

Is there anything that suggests that some of these ATT headwinds for other people in the industry actually cost shifts in budget over to your platforms, your different platforms? And then -- that's for Philipp. 
And then Ruth, just on the margins, is there anything other than revenue overage, that really strong revenue performance flowing against fixed costs and the extended depreciation schedules that's causing those margins to rise? Or have you been able to work out, eke out, tweak out new efficiencies in the model itself?",89
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3230.0,2413377.0,91772027.0,Answer,Ruth Porat,,Executives,22,"So why don't I start on that? The key points, as I said, is it starts with strong revenue growth and just timing lags. If some of the costs, as I said, are kind of more fixed in the near term, but we do continue to invest. And you can see that in gross margin. You can see it in operating margin. And we are continuing to invest to support growth we see in both Google Services and Google Cloud. 
You sort of -- and up-leveling the question, we've consistently said, let's -- our focus in capital allocation is investing for long-term growth and innovation and making sure that we remain focused on those long-term opportunities. At the same time, we've consistently also said that it's important to ensure that we're being sharp about investments within each product area, and we're continuing to do that. 
And we're continuing to focus on investing in what we call operational excellence to ensure we can deliver for all of our stakeholders in a high-quality way, and that includes all of our efforts around privacy, security and content moderation.

Look, overall, we continue to see strong momentum. The team is executing well. You mentioned BigQuery data and analytics and AI continues to be kind of a foundational shift for what companies are trying to accomplish, and BigQuery does stand out there and we are definitely seeing continued momentum there. It's a source of strength. 
The other areas I would highlight are security continues to be an increasing area of focus and a differentiator for us given over 2 decades of investment we have had. We pioneered zero trust and so on. So as cybersecurity elevates and concern across companies I talk to and the CEOs, it's definitely been an area.
Multi-cloud continues to be a differentiator. I do think customers are increasingly looking for it. And we've embraced it from early on. So that is an area as well. But above all, I think we are very, very focused on industry value propositions, so really sharpening our solutions by vertical, and that's really helped us get some of the bigger deals you mentioned as well, and we'll continue doing that.",182

I wonder if you can talk about the longer term opportunity for Alphabet in India from opening up that product and any type of time frame when do you think you will see maybe the benefits of what you're doing on the low priced phone there? 
And then for Philipp, it just seems longer term as mobile targeting becomes more difficult due to all these privacy changes. There has to be a mix shift in budget. So I wonder, how do you think the value proposition of Search will change going forward? 
And what can you do even more than you've done before to take advantage of what looks like real challenges in the ability to target and measure when it comes to mobile Search -- I mean, when it comes to mobile advertising.",155

Look, I think, obviously, the pandemic has been hard. But through it all, the people are looking for access and there's definitely been a wave of people who have adopted smartphones, and there is still -- we see the demand for people looking to shift from feature phones to smartphones. And so part of what excites me about the upcoming partnership with Jio in building a phone is really investing beyond just English and getting languages and getting the local needs right for people and doing it in a way that many more people can take advantages of a smartphone. 
So I view it as laying the foundation. It's a version of digital transformation and it's palpable, the demand we see. And I think over a 3- to 5-year time frame, it will end up having a lot of impact. But overall, India, just like Asia Pacific continues to be an exciting market for us.

This is a big area that we've invested already and that we are going to invest in even more. And as far as how we think about our runway for growth, we really think about improving user and advertiser experience for years and years to come. 
And we're always asking ourselves the same questions, right? How do we drive better answers to queries, especially on Search, especially including those with commercial intent? How do you use machine learning to deliver even more relevant and higher quality experiences for users that then drive higher clicks and more conversions for advertisers. 
So really our main goal is to consistently deliver great experiences for users, drive incremental value for our partners and making them successful.

So you're obviously doing really well there. And as large as it is and as high as the engagement is compared to just about any other app that we see across the broader Internet, the revenue at just around $30 billion this year, tails in comparison to core Facebook or Instagram. 
So do you think that this is obviously a huge opportunity for YouTube, especially with connected TV? Is there something that you guys need to change about your approach with either direct sales or kind of decoupling Search from YouTube and some of the other products that Google has under the same roof? Or do you kind of think continuing along the same path is the right strategy for YouTube specifically? Any color on that would be helpful.",138

And so you are dealing with -- in a new form. And obviously, as a company, I think we have taken a long-term view, which is why you see the engagement on the product. It's working at scale. Content responsibility has been our most important focus for the past many years. 
And beyond that, I think we worked hard to make sure both creators can do well, and it's a great platform for advertisers. We've had strengthened brand. We've built on it with robust momentum in direct response. There's obviously newer opportunities such as shopping, which we are investing in. And shots represents an additional early but important area for us from an investment and a growth standpoint.

Sundar, first off, looking at GCP and some of the innovations you've talked about like distributed cloud. I just wonder what you think the long-term future is for hybrid cloud environments. Are they really -- or is this really just a part of the process or stepping stones to bring more companies or most companies over to full cloud adoption? 
And then, secondly, we're seeing a clear blurring of the lines among e-commerce, digital payments and social platforms. So I was hoping you could share the vision for Google and YouTube and the other Google apps in this context, how those pieces fit together as a closed-loop shopping platform, if that's the right way to think about it.",124

So we want to meet the customers the way they want to take this journey. And I think are gearing up to support them both from a multi-cloud, from a hybrid cloud standpoint. 
But I do think over time, when I look at the scale at which we are investing to support, particularly to my points early around security and so on, I think people will see the value more -- so value more of a hosted cloud solution. But I think we want to be customer-centric here, and then we want to go where the market goes, and that's why we've built the scalable infrastructure we have. So I'm excited about the opportunity there.
On your second question around e-commerce, digital platforms, shopping, social, how does it all fit together? For me, I see there's 2 things. One is, we want to get the primitives right, which means as a user being able to be it in Search and YouTube, either on the products or as you -- we are trying to connect merchants to users, right, and be it organically or through advertising. 
And so we are investing in identity, payments, making sure it's seamless for users. And so that's a big part of our focus. The second is really from a user experience standpoint, both in Search and in YouTube and other areas like Maps and Discover over time. We want to make sure if users want to act more beyond discovery and they want to do more that it's seamless to do so. 
But we are going to be very focused on making sure for merchants that they can -- they get access to users, and that's the value proposition we deeply care about. And so we'll invest with that view in mind.",329

So Sundar, I think in the past, we've talked about the intersection of hardware and software for Google. And you touched on the Pixel 6 as well as the other examples in your prepared remarks. But as you look at all the different directions you're going with Fitbit, Nest and all the other devices. So how has your thinking evolved over the years? And what do you envision a hardware and software integrated Google meaning to the consumer over the longer term? 
And I guess, Philipp, if you look at some of the emerging and developing markets today, some of the companies there around the world have had to play multiple roles in helping to solve for transactional friction by rolling out payments, logistics and other solutions that we probably take for granted here in the States. So do you think Google should or could play a more expansive role in India and some of the other emerging markets to help accelerate the growth of e-commerce versus the role that you played in the U.S. and the West?",181

If you look at the Google Tensor bet, these are multiyear bets, which finally play out and I couldn't be more excited at the reception for Pixel 6 and Google Tensor. And I think lays a good foundation of what we want to do in the future. 
We definitely have a long-term view on where computing is headed. We want to make sure and to innovate there, you have to think at the intersection of user experience, software and hardware. I think we have a unique perspective to bring a unique point of view with our AI-first approach and applying that to bring new features and new experiences. 
So we'll be doing it to push computing forward. We want to guide our ecosystem when we do well in a category, the whole ecosystem benefits from it. And finally, we are going to be doing this with a view towards building a sustainable business. And we see this as an important area, and we are investing with that viewpoint.

I think we've all been there. 
So think about Google Pay as a checkout facilitator. We want to make it even easier for consumers to access whatever payment method they really want, credit card, PayPal, Shop Pay and so on, and so on. And to the global nature of your question, 150 million people across 40 countries are now using Google Pay to manage transactions and stay on top of their finances. And millions of merchants are using it to provide their customers with a simple and safe way to check out and whether it's in store or online or via their app. 
So right now, we continue to be very focused on helping both merchants and financial institutions create more intuitive digital experiences and connect with our customers. In the U.S., we're partnering with merchants to surface, we call them card-linked offers and coupons within Google Pay. And in August, we announced the partnership with Setu, a fintech company in India. That was a part your question, to help users open fixed deposit accounts directly from Google Pay. 
So we think there's much more that we can do for both consumers and our partners. So stay tuned on this one.",230
