Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding Google's future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures.

Good afternoon, everyone. This is Patrick, and you may remember we've mentioned last quarter that Larry will no longer be joining us on a regular basis on this call, as he focuses his energy on running the company. But consistent with our prior calls, Nikesh and I will be here. We'll cover the performance, as well as answer any questions you have about the business including significant ad product launches or other developments. And in the case that you have a very, very detailed product-related question, in some cases we may simply take it off-line with you. But with that, why don't we just dive into the details of our financial performance for Q4?
Our gross total consolidated revenue for the quarter was $16.9 billion, and the overall business was up 17% year-over-year and 13% quarter-over-quarter. Our Google segment gross revenue grew a healthy 22% year-over-year to $15.7 billion, it was up 14% quarter-over-quarter. Without currency fluctuations, the Google segment revenue growth would have been 23% year-over-year and 13% quarter-over-quarter. Our Google Sites revenue was up 22% year-over-year to $10.6 billion and was up 12% quarter-over-quarter, driven by the strength of our core Search advertising business. Network revenue was up 3% year-over-year at $3.5 billion and was up 12% quarter-over-quarter. This was driven in part by easier year-over-year comparisons as we anniversary some of our ad policy changes implemented at the end of 2012, but we also saw improved year-over-year growth from our Ad Exchange. 
Finally, Google's other revenue grew 99%, almost doubled, year-over-year to $1.6 billion and was up 34% quarter-over-quarter. The digital sales of apps and content in our Play Store drove the year-over-year growth in this line and in hardware sales, and the Play hardware sales drove most of big chunk of the quarter-over-quarter growth.
Turning to Motorola segment, gross revenue was $1.2 billion. As we announced yesterday, Lenovo plans to acquire our Motorola business for approximately $2.9 billion. This is great news for Motorola and the Android ecosystem. And as Larry noted in our press release, Lenovo has the expertise and the track record to scale Motorola Mobility into a major player within the Android ecosystem. 
Coming back to our Google segment, our global aggregate paid-click growth was strong this quarter, up 31% year-over-year and up 13% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate cost per click was down 11% year-over-year and down 2% quarter-over-quarter. And please note that currency fluctuations had a minimal impact on Q4 on the cost per click. Our monetization metrics continue to be impacted by a number of factors discussed on previous calls, including FX, geographic mix, platform mix, property mix, as well as product and policy changes.
Turning to geographic performance of our Google segment, we saw improved performance in the U.S. and the U.K. and strong performance in the rest of the world. In our earnings slides you can find on our investor relations website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits of our hedging programs, so please refer to those slides for the exact calculations. 
U.S. revenue was up 16% year-over-year to $6.9 billion. The U.K. was up 15% year-over-year to $1.5 billion, which includes a small $2 million benefit from our hedging program. So currency fluctuation had minimal impact on U.K. revenues in Q4. Our non-U.S. revenue excluding the U.K. was up 30% year-over-year to $7.3 billion, and this accounted for 46% of our total revenue, which included, again, a very small benefit from our hedging program. In fixed FX terms, the rest of world grew a strong 33% year-over-year.
So let's come back to an aggregate level for the total consolidated business. Our non-GAAP other cost of revenue was $4 billion in Q4 excluding stock-based compensation and Motorola restructuring.  And our non-GAAP operating profit was $4.8 billion in Q4, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin for the consolidated business of 29%. For our Google segment, specifically, our traffic acquisition costs were $3.3 billion or 24% of total advertising revenue. The other cost of revenue was $2.8 billion, excluding $127 million of stock-based compensation. And our Google segment operating expenses were $4.3 billion, again excluding SBC of $746 million.
Depreciation and amortization expenses on property, plant and equipment for the Google segment was $660 million this quarter, and Google segment profitability was $5.3 billion in Q4, resulting in a Google segment operating margin of 34%. At Motorola, total segment operating expenses including cost of revenue were $1.6 billion, excluding $29 million of SBC and $15 million of restructuring charges from Motorola. And keep in mind that intangible amortization expenses attributed to Google segment and Motorola segments are included in these segment measures.
Of the $279 million in consolidated intangible amortization expense this quarter, $153 million was a result of the acquisition of Motorola, of which $116 million was allocated to Google and $37 million was allocated to the Motorola segment. As a result, the operating loss for the Motorola segment was $384 million in Q4 and the operating margin for that segment was negative 31%.
Our headcount for the consolidated business was up roughly 1,300 people in Q4. Google segment added 1,700 people during the quarter. And in total, the consolidated company ended the quarter with approximately 48,000 full-time employees. Our effective tax rate was 16% in Q4. This tax rate this quarter was impacted by the continuing mix shift of earnings between our domestic and international subsidiaries.
Let me now turn to cash management. Our OI&E was $125 million for the quarter. Interest income and realized gains on investments offset the continued impact of our FAS 133 expense from our hedging program. For more detail on OI&E, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website. We continue to be happy with our strong operating cash flow at $5.2 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $2.3 billion. And this quarter, the majority of our CapEx spend was related to production equipment, data center construction and real estate purchases. 
As I mentioned last quarter during my remarks, we continue to invest for the long term and our infrastructure continues to be a key strategic area for us to invest. Our free cash flow, in consequence of all this, was $3 billion. So there you have it, strong results and an optimism that provides us the confidence to fund strategic growth opportunities, including Android, Chrome, YouTube, Enterprise, just to name a few.
Before I wrap up, I want to cover 2 quick things. First, I want to remind everybody, as I do every time at this time of year, that as we start the new year, things such as employer taxes, 401(k)s and all these other related accruals tend to be front-loaded in the year. So please consider this as you model your forecast. And second, before I hand it off to Nikesh, I want to give an update on our issuance of Class C shares. 
Our Board of Directors has formally approved the Class C dividend and have set the March 27 as the record date and April 2 of this year as the issuance date. So we expect the Class C shares to begin trading on April 3. And we were excited to announce that the Class C shares will actually trade under our original ticker that is GOOG, while the Class A shares will trade under a new ticker, GOOGL. We're setting up a link on our Investor Relations site, so that it can give you more information on the Class C dividends. 
And with that, I'll let Nikesh cover the details of our business performance in the quarter, and after his remarks, we'll open up the phone lines for questions. So here you go, Nikesh.",1301
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2014",2014-01-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3231.0,574794.0,26144304.0,Presenter Speech,Nikesh Arora,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Patrick. As Patrick mentioned, our business had a strong quarter at $15.7 billion in Google segment gross revenue. Overall performance was strong in retail, in automotive and CPG sectors. We had, particularly, good growth in Asia Pacific, including its various emerging countries, as well as in Southern Europe. I want to talk about 3 areas that are fueling growth for Google and our clients. 
First, our continued efforts to help performance marketeers reach customers and drive action across screens. Second, our continued progress in brand advertising. And third, our ad technology platform used by thousands of agencies and publishers. Then I'll say a few words about new areas like digital content, hardware and Enterprise. On performance. 
Performance advertising continues to be a mainstream for our core business. We're seeing good growth, is driven primarily by increased search activity across all screens, is driven by new measurement features and more sophisticated marketeers are aligning their Search and Display advertising strategies.
Last year, we made the move to Enhanced Campaigns and AdWords. 12 months in, marketeers tell us it helps them get results and reach people across screens in a big way. Our internal slogan for this is advertisers' ROIs don't lie. We also rolled out estimated total conversion. Marketeers can now measure results like calls and conversions that take place in different devices. For example, 1-800-Flowers discovered a 7% increase in overall conversions when they figured out that conversion can start on one device and end on the other. This is a great example of our vision as it relates to the seamless multiscreen marketing and something that was the impetus for us to launch an Enhanced Campaigns.
In the holiday season, one thing has become very clear. The web has truly become the new holiday store window. It's the first place people go and it's where everyone gets excited about holiday shopping. In the U.S., Walmart continues to use Google Search more and more. They're investing with us more than ever before to drive sales during the holiday season. There is also great momentum in Product Listing Ads and we continue to improve the experience of shoppers and retailers. 
Last quarter, Google Shopping came to 8 more countries. We even help deliver products to your doorstep in just a few hours. Google Shopping Express, our same-day delivery service, has been open to shoppers in the Bay Area since last year. I'm very pleased with the feedback we've gotten from our partners and users.
Now moving onto brand marketing. Working closer and closer with brand advertisers had been a big priority for us, and we're making great strides. You might have seen all the teaser ads running in YouTube ahead of the big game this Sunday. Given my personal passion for Cricket and lack of, pretty much, any knowledge of American football, I decided to turn to Google Trends and see who's leading. I see that Seahawks have more searches than the Broncos, so that's my bet for the Super Bowl, but folks in Denver will better -- then will better get searching if they want the Broncos to win. I don't know what that means for the big game on Sunday, but I do know that we are becoming essential to the biggest brand building campaigns of the world. 
There's 2 big areas of focus that brands and our agency partners really like. First, building out great content in YouTube. YouTube gives brands amazing reach and a passion that unique audience can't get elsewhere. YouTube has over 1 billion viewers per month and saw a 50% increase in daily watch time last year. Second, the best digital marketing captivates people when it's by the web, for the web. It's so much more than simply taking television ads and transplanting them on YouTube. So investing in creative ad formats that pivot around user engagement, like TrueView, or engagement ads across the web. Last year, for the first time, 3 videos by brand marketeers were on YouTube's list of top 10 videos for 2013. Third, and importantly, better measurement that enables brands and agencies to measure and optimize campaigns based on metrics like reach, recall or awareness. Last quarter, we enabled advertisers in our Google Display Network to start buying ads based on Google impressions. A fancy way of saying ads that people actually saw. 
In November, we began testing Neilsen OCR measurement on YouTube and our network. There's a lot more to come here, but it's an important step to helping brands invest online.
We think our efforts are really resonating with major clients and agencies from around the world. Our sales team continues to fire on all cylinders. I'm very pleased, we're pleased we hired Kirk Perry as our President of Brand Solutions from Procter & Gamble. His role is to help the largest brand ad agencies in the world embrace digital marketing more and more. He speaks their language so we hope that he will be able to convince them that the future for brands is truly digital.
We worked with Kraft to build a series of engagement ads showcasing brand videos, recipes and coupons for its new fresh-take brand. That campaign was very successful and led to an impressive 2.9% engagement rate and an average engagement time of 48 seconds. 
Moving onto our ad technology platforms. Our DoubleClick buying tools continue to be the choice of agencies around the world, and we're really benefiting from the growth in programmatic spend. One trend we're seeing is the move towards private Ad Exchanges in which a premium publisher uses our technology to make ad space available to a small number of hand-picked, highly quality -- high-quality and highly qualified advertisers. This can provide a very safe, real-time environment for both brand and publishers. 
The volume of impressions running through our private exchanges has, on average, doubled every quarter over the past year. Overall, our monetizing -- monetization solutions like our Ad Exchange, AdSense, AdMob are helping major publishers maximize their revenues from digital advertising.
So that's our core ads business. Let's talk about our trifecta of emerging new businesses, Google Play, Hardware and Enterprise. Google Play continues to win the hearts and minds of people, the latest books, newspapers and magazines, 20 million songs, thousands of movies, textbooks, all-access music. You can live your life in Google Play. People love it, so far. 
This quarter, we introduced the Google Play Newsstand that brings together more than 2,000 free and paid news sources including newspapers like the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Financial Times. We also introduced Google Play for education that's designed for schools and educator-approved apps, as well as tools to easily set up a classroom of tablets in minutes. We had a strong holiday season for our growing suite of Hardware products. One thing that has done really well for us is Chromecast. It continues to be a living room favorite, remaining the best-selling product throughout the entire quarter. We've also been adding to the growing list of content available through Chromecast with new supported apps like Google+, HBO GO and Pandora, and more to come.
Chromebooks are also seeing great momentum with 8 of the top manufacturers of computers now making Chromebooks, including new devices from both Dell and Toshiba. 1 in 4 devices sold into K12 education in the U.S. is a Chromebook according to Futuresource. We've also been seeing strong momentum in Nexus hardware, with great reception for Nexus 5. And as cars become more connected, we recently teamed up with the automotive technology leaders: Audi, GM, Honda, Hyundai and nVidia to form the Open Automotive Alliance.
Our Enterprise business continues to grow steadily as more businesses than ever want their employees to work the way they live. We're seeing great momentum in the retail space. U.K. supermarket, Waitrose, the clothing retailer, Chico, and the fashion accessory brand, Fossil, have all gone to Google this quarter. On our top platforms site, we announced that Google Compute Engine is now generally available supporting additional operating expenses -- operating systems at new lower prices. 
But before I close, I also want to give a shout out to our marketing team and, particularly, they have really helped drive the success of Google Play and our hardware products over the holidays. They've been able to do that through great effective advertising and creating awesome retail environments. And of course, thanks to all the Googlers and our partners for helping us have a terrific quarter. You're not just embracing the future, you're helping to shape it. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Patrick.",1437

29096.0,"Google Inc., Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2014",2014-01-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3231.0,574794.0,26144307.0,Question,Carlos Kirjner,,Analysts,6,"Two quick questions. Patrick, if you took your 5 or 6 major geographies for Search, and for each of them, you plotted separately the evolution of CPCs for mobile and for PCs and tablets. And you look at this curve from 5,000 feet, would they be mostly going up, down, flat or all over the place? And secondly, could you let us know if Google Compute Engine and Google App Engine are significant drivers of CapEx, 5% or more of your CapEx?",82
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2014",2014-01-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3231.0,574794.0,26144308.0,Answer,Patrick Pichette,,Executives,7,"All right. So let me jump by the second one first. Compute Engine, most of our CapEx right now is really driven by data center construction and machines that are actually driving both the core businesses of Google. And of course, App Engine, but App Engine I wouldn't describe as any of the core areas where we're seeing a ton of growth. Not that App Engine is not successful, it's just when you compare it to Search or other elements that kind of use a lot more capacity. In the case of your first question, it's very clear that we don't usually break down each of these geographies. But the fundamental trends are happening across the web, right, and in the same way. So all this issue of some markets are growing much faster, which is the emerging markets. So you can see that and you can infer that from our results, obviously. Clearly, there's a shift between all those platforms, whether it be mobile, tablet and desktop gain across the world, so you can infer that as well. Our sites versus network, the U.S. is a strong network area, everybody knows that. And so you can basically kind of, from your own inference, kind of pick apart these kind of elements. But they, together, move to actually really make the ecosystem vibrant and growing. And at the end of the day, when you have to do -- as just -- how did you say it? ROIs don't lie, Nikesh? So I mean at the end of the day, that's what you're pleased about. You're pleased about great results for our users that give them exactly the right answer they're looking for, and great answers for advertisers. So that's how actually you should think about it, Carlos. Thank you for your question.",302

29096.0,"Google Inc., Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2014",2014-01-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3231.0,574794.0,26144310.0,Question,Jordan Monahan,,Analysts,9,"It's actually Jordan for Scott. I guess 2 quick questions. The first is you didn't talk much about Nest. We were curious whether you were primarily interested in their design team or product or something else. And then on the other revenue line, what was the contribution to the other revenue line from Chromebooks or Chrome, otherwise, and the Enterprise?",61
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2014",2014-01-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3231.0,574794.0,26144311.0,Answer,Patrick Pichette,,Executives,10,"All right. Thank you for your question, Scott (sic) (Jordan). In the case of Nest, look, Nest and Google share a really common vision. Nest -- both of us believe that technology should be doing the hard work so that people can get on with their lives and do great things. So our goal is really, in the case of Nest, is to help them scale, right? And bringing the resources of Google to increase their investments, reach broader audiences and then scale internationally. So for us it's a terrific opportunity. And then bringing people like -- being able to attract people like Tony and Matt to the team is actually wonderful. So that's really the context of Nest. Your second question, let me just go back to your second question. The other revenue line. Well, actually, as I mentioned in my comments, the other revenue, it really grew well, like just under 100% year-over-year. If you look year-over-year, the biggest contribution was actually on the play apps and content, but quarter-over-quarter, because of seasonality, obviously, it's hardware, but it's both a combination, Nexus 5, which was very strong for us and the Chromecast. You got to remember that most of the Chromebooks are actually sold to other parties. So we're really a facilitator rather than -- and so we don't book revenue on the Chromebooks. So that's really the puzzle, Scott (sic) (Jordan).",234

And then, secondly, just on Nielsen OCR tagging, if you could give us some early market or feedback in terms of what you're seeing there? And then a little bit more color on your decision to go with outside measurement rather than how you've been doing it internally?",75
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2014",2014-01-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3231.0,574794.0,26144314.0,Answer,Nikesh Arora,,Executives,13,"Yes, sure. Look, I think, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, YouTube is part of our core advertising business, so both Search and YouTube are doing well for us around the world. It is part of a broader shift where we're seeing brand marketeers.  And if you saw -- as I said, our strength this quarter was not just from retail or automotive, also from CPG. And part of our ability to get CPG customers to come and advertise with us is that ability to convince them that brands can be built on the Internet. And YouTube, clearly, is a key player in our brand story vis-à-vis advertisers because they still think, visually, they still think video when they think brand advertising not just text ads. So I think YouTube is definitely a key part of our brand story and it continues to do well. I think our teams around the world have sort of figured out how to pitch YouTube to large customers and customers are paying attention. So I think YouTube continues to do well in addition to our core Search business and people are seeing the value of YouTube vis-à-vis brands. In terms of the OCR tagging and our decision to do it internally versus externally, I think -- look, in the long term, what advertisers want is a third-party to endorse various media. It's very hard for us, being a media owner, to be the person providing measurement against our own media. At the same time, we believe that there's tremendous amount of development that can be done in this space of measurement, where traditional measurement has been both set up after the fact and also has been on very limited set of parameters. And we believe we, as a team, can not only increase the parameters that you can measure, given the digital world, we also believe that you can look at different metrics simultaneously in a dynamic way and also create new metrics for the future. So our metric's efforts, internally, have been focused towards feeding future metrics, as well as more dynamic metrics as opposed to passive or legacy metrics. But that's work that we continue to do, we continue to work with third-party ad parties outside, including Nielsen and other players in the industry because we believe that's where the measurement industry needs to go and, eventually, we have to work with them to get them to roll with us in that direction. In terms of the early feedback of Nielsen OCR tagging, I think it's sort of like -- its table stakes. You have to have Nielsen OCR or some metric that is common across various media in the market for you to be -- for advertisers to be able to measure your effectiveness or your relevance vis-à-vis somebody else. And so I think what we've done is just early table stakes which is sort of a comfort factor for advertisers that they see that they can look at Nielsen OCR metrics vis-à-vis us and other people and get a sense that they're not spending their money in an unwise fashion. But I think there's tremendous amount of evolution and development that's going to happen in that space.",538

In terms of your first question in the area of app install, yes, clearly, it has become a larger market recently with this whole mobility factor where everybody is trying to get more and more mobile. We have solutions, we have all these app solutions as part of our AdMob product, as well as our AdSense products, where advertisers can use those forms of advertising towards creating app installs. And we continue to work hard to see where else in our various portfolio of services you can introduce the idea of app install. So you'll hear more from us in that area in the future, but I think you're right, this is an opportunity and we continue to work hard towards making this opportunity real, not just like existing products but also looking at other ways that we can keep driving this. In terms of your question on cookies and alternatives for cookies, I think it's fair to say that there's a lot of conversation around cookies and a lot of stuff going on in terms of how do we continue to evolve this area of technology and make sure that we give the users more control and also make sure that users have security in terms of what data gets transferred to their ROI and increase the transparency. So our teams are working on this. There are some early concepts in our teams where they're trying to see how they can evolve this notion multi-parameters that I mentioned, but I think it's too early to talk about what those precise solutions are likely to be.",271

One, could you just talk about, generally, what are the problems that, that group is trying to solve? Two, can you just tell us a little bit more about the structure of Google Wallet? Who runs the group? Who do they report to? And then when you're talking about the number of credit cards that you actually already have in that system, can you give us any help us understanding the quantity there? Are you measuring in hundreds of millions, tens of millions? And then separately, Nikesh, maybe you could just elaborate a little bit more on initiatives to improve add attribution and measurement in, specifically, measuring sort of the online to off-line attribution?",122

I think -- let me start with Google Wallet. I think the best way to think about what Google Wallet is trying to achieve is we're constantly trying to reduce the friction from somebody from doing a search to trying to actually acquire something. Whether that is going from online to online, from online to mobile, from mobile to mobile, or even online to off-line, like you referred to in your question at the end. So the hope of our team is to make sure we reduce the friction and, of course, create higher degree of security and comfort, vis-à-vis the end user, so they get a better experience. Now Google Wallet is actually a team that is run by our commerce team, which works with Sridhar, who works with Larry. And really, the best way to think about it is as people go more and more mobile, we're noticing a lot more people are spending time buying apps and digital content on their mobile devices and they end up signing up for Google Wallet as part of their Google Play experience. So we are seeing lots more -- lots and lots of users use our services. I'll leave it to you to infer how many Android users there are and how many Google Play users there are and what proportion of them are buying goods and services from us, so that gives you a sense of Google Wallet. It's definitely a number that we are very happy with, and it continues to grow.",261

Sales and marketing in Q4 was actually just really tied to the holiday season. We had great momentum on the Nexus side and the Chromecast. And so at that time of year, we decided when we have such winner products we would actually support them, in addition to a number of other areas where we actually invest. So very, very pleased with the performance of both of those, as well as Chromebooks, which have been, if you look in the press, the feedback, again, is #1, #2 in so many markets. So very, very pleased of actually kind of making that investment in these core products. For the PLA, I'll turn it over to Nikesh.",133

To break your question down in terms of -- there are 2 or 3 parts to your question. I think in terms of the growth in the rest of the world, effectively, the growth we're seeing in the rest of the world is actually not core Search advertising business and it's across-the-board. It's across our various products. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've done a lot of work in Enhanced Campaigns in trying to drive solutions on a multiscreen perspective. What you're really seeing is not a particular screen or a particular format, it's actually something which is allowing advertisers to come in and say, ""Hey, I'd like to acquire more customers. I'd like more people in my website. I like more people in my store."" And effectively, they're spending money in us helping them optimize across multiple screens how their money should be effectively spent. And then measuring their ROI and saying, ""This is good, I need to spend more money in this direction."" So it's not a particular change in our mobile platform or any other platform, it's actually really our move towards Enhanced Campaigns, which is helping us to strengthen our core business. Vis-à-vis Product Listing Ads, we've talked about this a few quarters ago that how we are moving from data links in certain categories to more into entity-level results. And Product Listing Ads is a prime example of how it's happening effectively. We are seeing adoption. As I mentioned, we've added 8 more countries this quarter. So this is part of a continued evolution and it's adding value to both our end users, shoppers, as well as our retailers. So it's clearly giving us benefit, our users benefit, and obviously, more relevant results allowing merchants to reach specific audiences.",298

I think that Motorola will -- in the mature handsets, terrific partner, and will provide scale and continued, really, momentum on what is now done very well, which is develop world-class product. In addition to that, Motorola, let's never forget, right, has really strengthened our Android ecosystem and done a terrific job on that. So I think that both from a perspective of the hardware itself in the handset area, as well as for the core Android ecosystem, I think that it's a real win-win for everybody. In addition to that rate, as you know from the Nest acquisition and Glass and wearables, we continue to innovate and we continue to be committed to hardware in areas that are kind of enterprising, promising, new frontiers, and that's where actually we're focusing on.

And which was the genesis of why we believe that entry-level search begins to make more and more sense. Whether it’s in travel, whether it's in hotels, whether it's in product listings, people are looking for more specific answers. And as you get mobile, you want even more bite-size answers so that people can get the information as quickly as they want. So that's sort of is the genesis of Product Listing Ads. If you take that to its logical conclusion, that is people declaring intent that they would like something, and that gives you a sense and a signal that, okay, clearly, they're looking for something they're more than likely wanting to buy it at some point in time. So we see our role as trying to enable the entire ecosystem across-the-board of retailers, both online and off-line, to be able to provide those goods and services directly to the end-user as quickly as possible with the least amount of friction. And friction comes in their ability to find it, friction comes in their ability once they've found it, to buy it, that's why things like InstaBuy exist in Google Wallet where you can have instant purchasing capability. And then, of course, then there's a notion of clarification, once you bought it, I want it as quickly as I can get it. So you can see that our product initiatives are sort of triangulated across all of these things, whether it's PLAs, in terms of their ability to find it, whether it's payment capabilities to try and close the loop, or whether it's delivery experiments where we see how can we get it to you as soon as possible. So it's more of an open system approach, to be fair, where we can help the entire ecosystem, our various partners. And you can see that our teams are working very hard towards enabling this vision but it takes time and great execution.",358

And we're very happy with the progress. It's fully embraced. It's fully up and running across -- around the world. Our thousands and thousands of salespeople around the world are trained. Our customers and advertising partners have understood that, that's the way for them to go target audiences and users, and really focus on ROI metrics. And we talked about we will launch the notion of estimated total conversion, so we can look at -- let people think about it in a multiscreen way. Because more and more we're seeing that people do not distinguish the activities they conduct on one screen. So, earlier, I said that people usually search on their desktop. And on their mobile devices when they're mobile, they do different things. But we're noticing that across each screen, you get the sense of pretty much the same activity that happens, which means that advertisers should be somewhat agnostic on where they're able to reach the user, they should want to reach the user right over there. So our thesis has been proven right. Advertisers are embracing it. Users are exhibiting those behavioral patterns. So it's provided, honestly, tremendous amounts of efficiency in our ability because we don't need specialists in various screens, various technologies to try and work with advertisers. We can have one team work with just products, which our product teams have created, which makes it very, very simple, and people can look at the ROI they get from spending money with us or in the digital economy as opposed to having -- break it down in silos that doesn't need to happen. So it’s been very successful, we're really happy with it. I think it's in its full stride. And the effects that you don't see, in fact, we see internally in the amount of efficiency and clarity and our ability to work with advertisers and then being able to measure their ROI effectively.",336

You guys are working on assisting users in mobile, not just answering search queries with hyperlinks that you did during the kind of PC browser era. Yet most of the data suggest that mobile users are spending pretty much all their time thumbing around in apps all day. So how do you envision Google improving the mobile experience? And how do you envision Google potentially controlling the purchase funnel if we stay in apps all day like you controlled it in the PC era?",95

And, Ross, I think that the fundamental tenet is rather than to speak about mobile and only mobile, it's really living with the user. And once you think through living with the users, supporting our users across all their day, whether it be on a TV, whether it be on a mobile phone, whether it be on a desktop, whether it be on -- with Google Glass wearables, that's really the aim that we're actually shooting for. And if on -- if it happens that on mobile they spend some of their time on apps, right, that's just one portion of the puzzle. But when you're looking for the question, the answer and actually getting you to the real assist across your day, not -- then you just -- what the devices you're on, what's your question or what -- how should we assist you, I think is the real question to answer. And I think that's a much broader and a much richer set of opportunities for us, rather than just to be cornered into one. So I kind of -- that's at the premise of your argument, because I think it's -- I mean our agenda is so much richer and so much more exciting for us when you think about it in the way we just did.

First on local advertising, I'm curious about Google Maps, Google Ways [ph], monetization of local, are geo-targeting-based products helping local advertisers to drive ROI? And what do you guys need to do to drive that business in terms of advertising real-time locally? And then the second question maybe for Nikesh, you mentioned NFL jokingly, I wonder what the growth of YouTube as a platform when you look at the birth and the growth of Chromecast. Why is it that you wouldn't find professional content or sports content strategic or useful in terms of driving the next leg or era of growth and monetization for YouTube?",108
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2014",2014-01-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3231.0,574794.0,26144342.0,Answer,Nikesh Arora,,Executives,41,"Thank you for your question. Let me answer 2 different parts of it. First is in terms of your question on local monetization. So I think we are clearly experimenting with new ad formats in Google Maps. But I think there's a broader way of thinking about local. It's not just about app, it's about location. And as the world begins to interact across multiple screens, you begin to look at location in a whole different way because you have a better understanding of where users are and how you can use that as a filter to provide them more precise information and, hopefully, much more relevant advertising, which requires both ends of the spectrum. It requires us to understand the user's location, but also requires the advertisers to make sure to give us the location of where their services are best utilized. So we need location extensions from advertisers, we need locations from users and we have to be able to marry them across not just Google Maps, but all -- across pretty much every experience that we have, whether it's Search, whether it's -- anything, whether it's YouTube, whatever service that the end user is using, we have to able to localize it because location is a great filter and it allows us to make things more relevant both from advertising and from an organic perspective. In terms of YouTube, I think we're very happy with the growth that YouTube is having and has had, both from a user perspective, as well as content provider perspective, and as well as from monetization perspective. In terms of content providers, we talk to content providers large and small, across entire spectrum, because we want YouTube to be the platform where creators of any size can build an audience. They can build an audience of scale, fans can find the content that they want. It's hard to comment in a particular piece of content because it starts a whole sea of conversations. But we would welcome any content on YouTube as long as people felt that it would add value to the end users and as long as there is a right economic model associated with it.",366

Sorry, no, that was Kevin. Sorry. Thanks, Kevin. Kevin, as I mentioned earlier, we had a long spirited answer around measurement. We are seeing measurement as table stakes for brand advertisers because they want to understand what is the return of their brand spend. Now it's easier in performance advertising because you can see the number of clicks you get in a website, or you can measure the number of people who walked into your store. On brand, it's a different metric. So you want to actually try to understand how many people were you able to reach of a certain age or gender. And that's what Nielsen OCR allows you to do. It allows you to compare across various brand and media, so it sort of acts as table stakes. And as I said earlier, it is the early set of metrics that are sort of basic entry metrics into the space, but we hope that this market is going to evolve from a measurement perspective over the coming quarters, coming years, where we can have more sophisticated metrics and metrics that actually allow you to see the impact of this advertising on your brand.",198

As I've reiterated many times before, and we were with our board yesterday at the Audit Committee reviewing this issue. And so, clearly, the cash position of Google is seen as a strategic asset. It is an important asset to us, both in terms of offensive and defensive, given the world in which we live in. And in that context, it's being reviewed regularly and we make sure that actually we get the best return for investors on that asset as well. So we have a real strategy for that as well. So for now, we have nothing else to announce on it, but just to give comfort to our investors that we do take this issue seriously and it is reviewed on a regular basis by both ourselves, our management but also raised to the board for the right answer.

Thanks, Richard. Let's see, yes, I guess to your point, yes, there are other people who are beginning to absorb some amounts of digital ad spend. I think that $15.7 billion for this quarter with a majority of this being advertising I still think we have substantial advertising spend coming into us. But again, from a longer-term perspective, I think every piece of advertising becomes digital. So we're still at single -- I'd say at low double-digit numbers in terms of how much ad spend is digital versus non-digital. So we need more people in the digital space getting more and more advertisers to shift from what we call traditional old media. I think, over time, television becomes digital, I think every piece of advertising becomes digital because this provides so much efficiency, from a measurement perspective and a targeting perspective, if you take out a lot of the waste out of the system. So with that in mind, I think we're still in the very early days of how much advertising is going to move over to digital media. And I think you're right to identify that places like Google+, places like YouTube are still very, very sort of in their infancy in the amount of advertising they can support vis-à-vis the amount of usage we're getting. So we continue to work hard. We had to strike the right balance between user services -- end user services and the amount of advertising we represent to them because this continues to be sort of evolving space and what you don't want to do is you don't want to overwhelm users with tremendous amounts of advertising because that may be good in the short term, but creates a bad experience for the users in the long term. So you will notice that many of our products still do not have tremendous amounts of advertising because we still believe those products are evolving and the right form of advertising just hasn't been invented for those particular areas. So we remain hopeful in the long term for finding more and more ways of enabling advertising for users. And for sure, perhaps some of the products may not lend themselves to advertising and users will prefer to pay for an ad-less product as it relates to certain areas like applications or digital content, et cetera. So those models also exist out there. So I think there's tremendous amounts of scope in the future. And I think you've rightly identified some of the areas where we should be concentrating.",426

So in that sense, right, I think that we have clear objectives to support -- we've always had a clear objectives to support all of our partners. And after this transaction, it's very clear that we'll continue to be kind of this impartial supporter of the entire ecosystem. As it relates to the detail fragmentation, we've taken a number of steps. We've talked a lot about this already in the past, that there's a number of steps taken to make sure that, in fact, there isn't fragmentation. And then just encourage you to kind of circle back to both the -- what's written, as well as circle back to the IR team for more of the details. But we've done a lot of progress already on this over the last kind of 18 months and a lot more to come. So thanks for your question.

I'm still trying to parse your question. Look, I think we have done really well from an Enterprise perspective, steadily growing revenues on our traditional Google Apps business. Outside of that, on the platform services, the Google Compute Engine the Google App end and stuff, we continue to make progress. I think we should -- we have more room to work harder over there. We understand there are other players out there, but again, that is such, such an early, early stage in that market. We think, over the long term, almost every business out there, existing and new, has to be on a cloud platform, has to be in a large-scale industrial-strength infrastructure platform. And there is still few players out there and there's lots and lots of room. So I'm not sure if price is the current factor on which people need to make a decision. People will make a decision based on robustness, based on security, based on availability, based on the breadth of services we can offer in that platform. I just think it's early days. So we should be working on all those things, and you should be hearing more from us in the future.",206

29096.0,"Google Inc., Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2014",2014-04-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3250.0,612164.0,27608645.0,Presenter Speech,Patrick Pichette,,Executives,2,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2014 earnings call. Before we jump into my usual remarks, I'd like to bring 2 points to everybody's attention. First, a reminder that on April 2, we issued our Class C stock dividend. With twice as many shares outstanding, our usual per share information will look quite different starting this quarter. Also, second, and also as a reminder, our expected sale of the Motorola business, Mobile business, to Lenovo triggered discontinued operations accounting treatment, which means Motorola's quarterly results are shown separately from Google's net income. You'll see this new presentation in our financials starting this quarter. So with these 2 caveats noted, let's dive into the details of Google's financial performance in Q1.
Our gross total consolidated revenue grew a healthy 19% year-over-year to $15.4 billion, and it was down 2% quarter-over-quarter. Without currency fluctuations, our gross total consolidated revenue growth would in fact have been 21% year-over-year. Google site's revenue was up 21% year-over-year to $10.5 billion and was down 1% quarter-over-quarter, driven by the strength in our core Search Advertising business. Network revenue was up 4% year-over-year at $3.4 billion and was down 4% quarter-over-quarter, driven by improved year-over-year growth from our Ad Exchange and AdMob businesses.
Finally, Google's Other revenue grew 48% year-over-year to $1.6 billion and was down 6% quarter-over-quarter. Digital sales of apps and content in our Play Store drove year-over-year growth. Chrome cash sales were also strong. 
Our global aggregate paid-click growth was strong this quarter again, up 26% year-over-year and down just 1% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate cost per click was down 9% year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter. 
Currency fluctuations had a minimal impact on Q1 CPC growth. Our monetization metrics continue to be impacted by a number of factors discussed on previous calls, including geographic mix, device mix, property mix, as well as products and policy changes. And to help investors better understand the complex dynamics of these monetization metrics, we'll begin disclosing paid clicks and CPC growth by property in Q2. 
To be clear, this means that we'll disclose CPC and paid-click growth rates for both our sites and our network businesses. We will continue to disclose, obviously, the aggregate growth rates for CPC and paid clicks. 
Turning to the geographic performance. We saw strong performance in the U.S. and rest of world, solid performance in the U.K. In our earnings slides, which you can find on our Investor Relations website, you'll see that we have broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits from our hedging programs. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations. 
U.S. revenue was up 14% year-over-year to $6.7 billion. The U.K. was up 14% year-over-year to $1.6 billion and in fixed FX currency, grew 11% year-over-year. Our non-U.S. revenue, excluding the U.K., was up 25% year-over-year to $7.2 billion. This accounted for 47% of our total revenue, which includes a $8 million benefit from our hedging program. And in fixed-FX terms, the rest of world grew, in fact, 30% year-over-year.
Let me now turn to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.2 billion or 23% of total advertising revenue. Our non-GAAP other cost of revenue was 2.6% -- $2.6 billion in Q1, excluding our stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $4.6 billion, again, excluding stock-based compensation. And as a result, our non-GAAP operating profit was $5 billion and our non-GAAP operating margins were 32% in Q1.
Just a quick word on a few items that may have created noise in our operating expenses this quarter. We had some discrete legal expenses that hit our G&A line, as well as one-time M&A-related costs that increased our operating expenses, particularly in R&D. So absent these discrete items, our expenses continue to demonstrate the same disciplined agenda we've always had.
Headcount was up roughly 2,100 people in Q1. In total, we ended the quarter with approximately 50,000 full-time employees. And please note that the headcount still includes approximately 3,700 full-time employees from the Motorola business, as well as the employees from the acquisitions completed in this quarter.
Our effective tax rate was 18% in Q1 and our tax rate this quarter was impacted, obviously, by the federal R&D credits, which expired in 2013. Let me now turn to cash management.
Other income and expense was $357 million for the quarter and realized gains on investments and interest income offset the continued impact of expenses from our FX hedging program. For more details on OI&E, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website. 
We continue to be happy with our strong operating cash flow at $4.4 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $2.3 billion. This quarter, again, the majority of CapEx was related to data center construction, production equipment and real estate purchases. 
As I mentioned last quarter during my remarks, we continue to invest in the long term and our infrastructure continues to be a key strategic area of investment for us. Our free cash flow was $2 billion for Q1. 
And before I close, I want to give a brief update on Motorola. Motorola had a great quarter in Q1, with the Moto G showing strong sales momentum, especially in emerging markets. The team continues to be hard at work, and we look forward to seeing them join up with Lenovo soon. 
So there you have it. Strong results and an optimism that provides us the confidence to fund strategic growth opportunities, including Android, Chrome, YouTube, Enterprise, just to name a few. 
And now I'll cover more details -- I'll let Nikesh, in fact, cover more details of our business performance in the quarter and after his remarks, we'll open up the phone lines for questions. 
Here you go, Nikesh.",972
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2014",2014-04-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3250.0,612164.0,27608646.0,Presenter Speech,Nikesh Arora,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Patrick. You're welcome to cover more details, if you'd like. Or business is growing well, with $15.4 billion in gross revenue, we had a particularly good advertising performance in the United States, highlighted by a very strong auto sector showing around the Super Bowl. We had strong Play growth in Asia and we had a few isolated drags. 
By now, you're aware of the 4 areas driving our business. The first one, direct response, or as I like to call it, performance marketing; the second one, helping clients build their brand; third, our high-tech platforms for publishers and agencies; and fourth, our emerging businesses, like digital content, Enterprise and hardware. Let me give you an update on all of those and talk about industry trends that are driving the investments we're making. 
On performance advertising, people are now always online and they want a seamless, easy experience as they move from screen to screen. This constant connectivity is driving our investments here. As people use Search to navigate their world, Google is really well-positioned to help people navigate between web, apps and the places around them. They help marketeers measure the entire customer journey and they drive better monetization. 
Next week, we'll be welcoming hundreds of advertisers to our AdWords Performance Forum, where we'll talk more about our work in this area for marketeers. But clients are already benefiting from our recent investments, like Enhanced Campaigns and estimated total conversions. For instance, Shutterfly recently began measuring cross-device conversions in AdWords to understand sales that start on one device and end on another. As a result, they saw 60% increase in mobile conversions for nonbrand terms, leading them to include 100% of their keywords on mobile devices. 
We're seeing great momentum in product listing ads as well, with the new shopping campaign system. International retailer, Farfetch, upgraded their shopping campaigns and increased their conversion rate by 13%, while reducing their cost per acquisition, or CPA, by 20%. 
And Domino's Pizza -- who doesn't like Pizza -- recently made it easier for customers to pay with Google Wallet [indiscernible]. 
Moving onto brand building. For years, you've all seen the rise of digital video, over [indiscernible] networks, connected screens, streaming devices and high-quality digital programming. Already, for example, YouTube reaches more than 1 billion people a month through hugely popular channels like Fashion Guru, Bettany Mota, CookingMaven, Rosanna Pacino, and the cult hit Nerdist. For marketeers, this is an irresistible trend. And we're now at a significant industry moment. Marketeers and agencies that have historically built their brands on TV are reorienting their creative planning and investments to put digital at the center. 
This year, nearly all Super Bowl advertisers turned to YouTube to extend the life and reach of their TV spots, and Super Bowl-related ads on YouTube have been viewed over 300 million times. That's roughly 3x the size of the audience that watched the ads on TV. 
In Australia, we worked with Nissan to create made-for-YouTube video for the launch of their new Patrol SUV. The campaign, which is promoted by TrueView ads and the YouTube masthead drove a 340% increase in daily visits to their website, and more than 2% of those who interacted with the campaign booked a test drive. 
In a few weeks, in New York, at our annual Brandcast upfront event, we'll focus on our new Google preferred offering. This features exclusive access to the best, most engaging content on YouTube with guaranteed audiences through third party measurement providers, Nielsen and comScore. We're really excited about this, and we're looking forward to the results of that upfront Brandcast event.
We're also helping brands through our newest Display ad formats. We recently teamed with Tory Burch to bring her New York Fashion Week show to a global audience across our Display network. They hosted the first-ever live stream of fashion show in an ad using our Lightbox Ads, and were able to share the exclusive event with more than 7 million of their biggest fans. 
Third, moving to our ad technologies [ph] and platforms. Our programmatic ad technologies are seeing -- are continuing to see great momentum with premium publisher partners, like the Local Media Consortium. That's comprised more than 800 daily newspapers and 200 local broadcast stations, as well as Time, Inc. Both of them signed on with us in February to be a part of [ph] Exchanges. This maximizes the value of their ad space through a hand-picked premium environment. 
One thing we know is that agencies and publishers want to trust the environment in which they're transacting. Our ad network and exchanges are widely regarded across the industry as having the best quality controls, and we continue to invest here. 
In February, we acquired a well-known fraud fighter, Spider I/O, and thousands of our clients are already using our MRC-accredited Active View technology to buy high-quality viewable ad impressions. 
Let me switch over to our emerging new businesses, digital content, hardware and Enterprise. Google Play continues to be the targeting [ph] hub of our digital content business. This quarter, we introduced Google Play movies to 39 new countries, so now people of more than 65 countries can enjoy movies through Play. We also teamed up with Sonos to bring high-fidelity Play music into the home, and we introduced new developer tools for Google Play games, including game gifting and iOS multiplayer support. 
Over 75 million new users joined Google Play Games in the last 6 months. All of this is helping turn developers around the world into full-fledged businesses. In fact, we paid out more than 4x as much money to developers in 2013 compared to 2012. 
And following the Open Automotive Alliance that we announced with partners in January, designed to bring Android to the car, in March, we have announced Android Wear, a project that extends Android to wearables. We're also already working with several consumer electronics manufacturers, chip makers and fashion brands and can't wait to see what developers come up with for your wrist. 
We also continue to see strong momentum from our suite of hardware products. Our $35 Chromecast is a real hit. Last month, we brought Chromecast to 11 more countries. We also recently opened up Chromecast to developers, and in just a few weeks, more than 3,000 developers worldwide signed up to bring their apps and websites to the platform. 
Turning over to Enterprise. We continue to see strong product adoption around the globe. We launched Chromebox for meetings, which makes it easy for any company to have high-definition video meetings through the power of Google+ Hangouts and Google Apps. We're also investing significantly in the Google cloud platform and have seen a very positive response to our most recent product announcements. We expect to see continued momentum in this area, and we believe we can bring significant value to the many companies adopting public clouds because of our experience in building and operating one of the world's largest cloud computing environments for over a decade, to be able to pass on the savings that come from lower digital storage costs to our customers through highly competitive pricing. In addition, every day, more businesses, governments and schools start using Google Apps to work better together, including the state of São Paulo, who moved to Google Apps for more than 4 million students and 300,000 teachers and staff. 
Before I close, I want to call out our marketing team, who continues to highlight the magic of Google to people around the world from the fourth Annual Google Science Fair, the Doodle 4 Google in the United States, the hugely popular ad campaigns. They also helped to create -- build great retail experience for Chromecast in over 6,000 stores. I'd like to thank all Googlers around the world who helped make this a terrific quarter. 
I'll now hand it over back to Patrick.",1316

And then maybe, Nikesh, if you could talk about the theme of sort of advertising attribution and how that's going to help you potentially bring over more brand dollars. And how do you think about bringing over those television dollars? I mean is that something that's going to come sort of a big rush in 2014 or is this going to be a slow evolution over many years?",114

Why don't I start? Look, on the discrete legal expense that impacted, it really impacted our G&A, if -- and then the one-time M&A deal costs impacted all of our operating lines. But most prominently, our R&D line, which you'll notice will have jumped a bit. The one-time M&A deal costs are largely stemming from the Nest deal, which was a pretty large transaction for us this quarter. But I think that the best way to describe it is that our expenses in Q1, they're completely in line with our objectives if you would kind of take apart these 2 items. So that's how I would describe it. Nikesh?",112
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2014",2014-04-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3250.0,612164.0,27608651.0,Answer,Nikesh Arora,,Executives,8,"In terms of brand, Ben I think -- the brand question is a very good question. What we've noticed in the past, let's just say, 1 year, 1.5 years is that people have slowly started coming to the digital medium to create extension of their existing brand campaigns. Like I mentioned, the Super Bowl ad, people come to YouTube and say, ""I'd like to reach certain audiences, which are only available on digital medium."" Hence, we see those advertising dollars shifting as in enhancing existing television or media campaigns. Now the real fun will begin when people start doing campaigns exclusively on digital, to go out and help them build brands. That requires us to get ahead of the curve and get into the creative process much earlier because, usually, what we end up doing now is we get to the end of the creative process and they just want to extend their brand. So we're working really hard to work with creative ad agencies, the large agency groups, as well as our advertisers, to say, ""How can we get ahead of that creative process? How can we help you conceive brand campaigns that actually start and end in digital where, perhaps, you use TV as an extension medium, as opposed to the other way around?"" I think this is definitely the Holy Grail. This is going to take us a little bit of time to get there. But with things like attribution in place with our deals with Nielsen and comScore, we are beginning to create the comparability, saying, ""Look, the same dollar you spend on television equates to so many dollars on digital or vice versa."" The fact that we can give them sort of cross-media measurement capability, we can give them comfort that their dollars are being well spent, even better spent on digital. We'll go a long way in making sure that we get them to transition from just using traditional media to including digital in their media mix and, eventually, designing campaigns that start and end at digital.",343

Thank you for -- Doug, for your questions. So in the case of the U.S., if you think about it, you have the Q4-to-Q1 issues that are typical.

And I think the reason -- the way to think about it is that, in mobile, you have location and you have context of individuals, which you don't have on the desktop. And the more you know about the user and their context, the more effective advertising you can provide them, the better the conversion is likely to be for a search or any piece of advertising that you do. There's a whole bunch of building blocks that need to come into play for us, like you said, to get the gap to close. The good news is a lot of people are spending a lot of time on mobile devices. There's a lot of mobile search queries that we get. People are more and more focused about what to look for in mobile devices. They're closer to intent. They're closer to transaction. You see that there's a lot of frictionless ways of paying and converting transactions into commerce, which is happening with things like Instant Buy, et cetera. You're also seeing -- a lot of the advertisers are seeing the true value of making sure that they're present in a great experience on the mobile device. So part of our challenge has been that -- maybe you've had this huge mass of advertisers in the desktop, which over the last decade, have become better at advertising, understanding optimization, understanding conversion, understanding transaction. That journey is just beginning for advertisers in the mobile side. They're just beginning to understand what it takes for the end-user to come transact on their website. So sort of like, right now, we can lead the horse to the water, we can't make it drink. But with all the advertisers coming on board and working with us, we are actually beginning to show them real transactions. And as that begins to gain traction, I think we'll begin to see that gap continue to converge.",361

And, Nikesh, you just mentioned that you guys paid out 300% more revenue to developers in '13 versus '12. So I guess, how much is Play contributing to the overall licensing and other line. And there's clearly some lines -- or some items in that line that are not growing nearly as fast to get to the current 48% average. So can you talk about maybe what's underperforming in that area? And then last question on this topic is, I think if you go back to the infamous Andy Rubin slides from the Oracle case, the rev share was around 5% for Google Play App Store rev share. Where is that now? And is it changing as the Android ecosystem gets larger?",133

Ross, the -- if you think of our other revenue estimates for this quarter, right? First of all, it's -- we're really delighted by the Play business. So in -- you'll remember that a year ago, we had -- I mean, I'm going to bring back everybody to Q1 of 2013. We had a lot of Nexus 4 hardware sales because we were in stock out in Q4. And that, in combination with the accounting change of our Play app content revenue recognition. Again, remember Q1 of last year, both just simply created a bit of a tougher year-over-year comp for this quarter. But overall, very pleased with all of the kind of big lines of growth in this space. As per the rev share, I mean, obviously, this accounting change kind of goes to 30% rather than the -- what you would have seen before, which would have been the net. And -- but we don't divulge what the percentages are that we keep going forward. So that's basically where we stand on it. And that's why we're pretty pleased with this line for this quarter.",197

I mean, people kind of tend to forget it, but last year, we had a very strong Q1 for the U.K. And the combination of these 2 things just kind of, year-over-year, made the comparison a little tighter for this quarter. As it relates to websites -- partner websites, I covered that a bit earlier. And we're -- I mean, again, you go back to last year where network -- if you think of Ad Exchange and AdMob continues to be very, very strong. And you will remember, again, last year, that we started the DLA [ph] policy change in Q1, or maybe it was in Q4. But the impact of the DLA [ph] actually takes time to flow through. We said that would take multi quarters. So this has not kind of flowed over completely. So what you have, again, there is very strong on the cores where we want -- so the Ad Exchange and the AdMob. But on the flip side of that, right, you still have the tails of the DLA changed policy that's from a year ago, but the effects have not fully flowed through. So even in the coming quarters, you should see a bit of an effect there. But overall, pretty pleased with, actually, these results, Mark.",257

First, in the last 8 quarters, headcount has grown significantly slower than revenue. But this quarter, you hired, I think, 2,300 people in the core, and headcount grew with revenues. Was this change in hiring rate mostly because of acquisitions and, more generally, what prevents you from hiring 2,300 people a quarter or even more as the business grows? And secondly, Patrick, in the spirit of giving more transparency to shareholders, can you give us some color on what has driven such a sustained increase on CapEx over the last 4 quarters? Because I don't -- I think, clearly, it's not just some lumpy behavior. Are you buying data center sites in advance of demand? And if this is the case, can we infer that CapEx will revert to historical levels?",135
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2014",2014-04-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3250.0,612164.0,27608670.0,Answer,Patrick Pichette,,Executives,27,"Thank you, Carlos, for both of these questions. So to the headcount question. I think you've basically nailed it intuitively, which is the acquisition of Nest, the acquisitions this quarter had a quite a bit of people impact on this number. Or kind of -- if you think of our organic numbers have actually not changed in any material way. So it just happened -- you buy Nest and it comes with a lot of people. We also had, you'll remember, the acquisition of DeepMind and a few others. So, for us, we had a doubleheader of having the opportunity to continue to attract people on an organic basis through our processes. And these few acquisitions kind of moved the needle quite a bit for us this quarter. As it relates to CapEx, listen, you're right that we -- and I have mentioned this in the last couple of quarters, where we have -- and just a reminder to everybody, right, if you think of the CapEx categories, right, data centers first, then data center construction, then production equipment, then all other facilities, is kind of like the hierarchy of needs. And in the case of data center construction, we have found that the option value of having more capacity on standby and available to us to grow, versus not having it, is actually a real strategic issue for the company. And in that sense, if for whatever reason we continue -- we had a spike in demand that was really pronounced and sustained for a couple of quarters and we did not have the capacity, it would be a real issue, strategically, for us, relative to the quite low cost of having the infrastructure in place. So that's why we're really pushing ahead of the curve and so it's with this view of long term. So from that perspective, you're also right that, that's the mindset we're applying. And we've always said that CapEx was lumpy, so you have a good manifestation of it right now, right here.",339

I'm not sure I can give you a lot of detail in terms of precise impacts of any individual products that we have. But Enhanced Campaigns are working. It was a necessity that we had to do them, both for process reasons, as well as the reason that consumers are going from screen to screen, as well as advertisers need to advertise across multiple screens. So from that perspective, Enhanced Campaigns is working, it's part of life here. We don't do anything without Enhanced Campaigns, across the board, it's gone from being Enhanced Campaigns to regular campaigns because we don't have any un-Enhanced Campaigns anymore. In terms of PLAs, it's something -- as I alluded, it's actually working. It's providing a lot of color in the shopping vertical, it's providing a lot of the whole new shopping campaign effort that we have. PLA is working for us and it's sort of working from multiple perspectives. It is providing users the detailed information that they need when they're declaring intent and saying, ""I'd like to search for a particular product, please don't send me to a website."" So it is working. We are going to roll that out once every [ph] time around the world.

Travel, actually quite strong in the U.S., in the U.K., as well as in the rest of the world, a little bit less than the U.S., but just to give you a sense of. And then, real estate, clearly, in the U.S. has been a strong vertical, as well as in the U.K. So again, a good reflection of the economy there, Justin.

Nikesh, we'd love to get your view on sort of your view of the travel industry, sort of how you're approaching that industry as a participant, from an economic basis, in that industry, both the marketing funnel and, potentially, the booking funnel longer term. There's been a lot sort of written lately about the way in which you guys might approach that industry vertical. And then second, Patrick, for you. Maybe taking a stab at the one-time expenses from a different approach. When we look at the model, if we take your comments before about sort of smoothing out the expenses we saw in the back part of the year and even year-on-year, it appears the one-time expenses might have been about a 50 to 100 basis point impact on each of those 2 lines, which would have sort of brought the blended number back up to sort of somewhere between 75 to 150 basis points on margins.

Thanks for the question. I was actually -- while you were talking, I was pulling up the article, which recently were -- down in Houston talked about the effectiveness of Google advertising for Priceline. And I think that's a public endorsement that all our efforts in the last many years around the travel industry are actually working. They see tremendous value in our ability to help them bring more travelers to their sites and for them to help convert them into real transactions. So whatever we're doing is working. I think -- I am expecting -- suspecting that the commentary -- the comments you're talking about is our continued efforts in providing more and more detailed information when people do searches. And as we've talked in the past before that people's information needs are getting more and more precise and we have to keep evolving the results at Google, whether it's Knowledge cards or Google Now, all the things that we do, towards giving them more and more precise answers. In which case, sometimes, we are required to go work with various industries to get the underlying data to surface it when the users are looking, as opposed to send them to other sites, where they have to go through that search process again. So I think you can expect us to continue to do that, but our intent there is to provide a better answer for the users, whether it's on their desktop or mobile devices. Accordingly, we also work together with the advertisers to provide them various advertising opportunities, which allow them to work effectively with the end-user and provide them the answer that they're looking for, or perhaps, in this case, the ticket or the hotel booking that they're looking for.",296

And on my side, Eric, look, as I said in my earlier comment, our Q1 expenses were completely in line with our objectives and there's always seasonality. As you've noticed, from Q4 to Q1, there's always, we spend less on marketing, and so that's true for this year as well. And for the other areas, right, we would have been in line with the objectives we'd set for ourselves. So these one-time costs were genuinely -- and that's truly one-time. And, I mean, when you acquire Nest for a bit over $3 billion, there's just a lot of stuff that flows through the P&L, a lot of accounting. And so that's really the issue there. So I would go back to your instinct of at least kind of we should be roughly in line with our expectations were. And that's why the nature of truly extraordinary items.",148

There are different aspects to attribution and I think you guys are doing a great job on the cross-screen attribution and taking advantage of your ubiquitous log-ins across different platforms and enhanced campaigns. I wanted to get a better understanding of how you're thinking about online versus offline attribution for those types of marketers, particularly brand advertisers, supermarket advertisers, the 30,000 SKUs and those retail channels that don't have e-commerce and really don't have much of a Search opportunity. How are you helping them close the gap between their online activity and offline sales?",102

Thanks again for the question. I think, as you rightfully pointed out, the attribution story on the advertising side is kind of becoming clearer as we partner with Nielsen and comScore, and adopted some of the mechanisms that traditional media has used to create the comparability between traditional and new media. I think you identify a good challenge, which is that how do we bridge the gap between online commerce and offline commerce and relate that to the advertising opportunity, i.e. when we sell Search and/or we sell traffic to different people, how do we convince them, how do we make them realize that, that traffic that they bought not only results in online sales but also results in offline sales in stores and how do we encourage that activity? So over the past many years around the world, we have run specific studies working with various advertisers, which I call online-to-store studies, where we actually try and measure what online activity created by them to control groups could result in more foot traffic in their particular stores in certain regions or not [ph]. And we pretty much have very good results across the board. I can't detail specifics right now because they're all specific to individual advertisers we work with. But we do understand that opportunity and the problem, and we work specifically with third-party research teams to work on figuring out how do we keep showing the online-to-store efficacy. And there are other products, as you can see, where we start doing conversion, we start looking at things like Google Shopping Express, which also helps in those areas.",272

Thanks, Heather, for the question. I think -- and look, there are some very simple things and there are some complicated things.

So that enablement is happening across the industry, across multiple payment platforms. There's also the need that when people search for some things, they can get quickly down to the information and they don't have to browse multiple sites because people are more keen on declaring intent in mobile devices than going and surfing multiple websites in trying to figure out what they're trying to do. And that intent could be in the form of a restaurant, could be in the form of a taxi, it could be in the form of them looking for an individual product. And you're beginning to see apps, you're beginning to see solutions in Search that allow you to get to that granularity of information. And of course, there's a big building block, which is getting all you people out there which are the advertisers, effectively, in this case, the merchants who actually have to have experience in the mobile side which are simpler to execute on. So try buying something on many companies' mobile website and it's more onerous than their desktop site because they've spending a decade trying to optimize their desktop site, when they haven't spent enough time optimizing their mobile experience, in some cases not believing that people want to transact with them on their mobile device. In some cases, they're just slow -- and they're just slowly diverting resource from the desktop to mobile. So if you take all those things and if you take the notion that we need to keep sort of working hard towards getting these building blocks in place, I think there's a finite time when these building blocks will come into place. And as they keep coming into place, you will see, or as we talked about earlier, perhaps the convergence will happen between pricing in mobile and desktop. There's a whole bunch of other issues that go into that, but I think those are the big things that we can think of right now.",415

And first off, if you can put some context around the impact of this business on CapEx and OpEx, particularly on the infrastructure, the service part of the business. And then, secondly, if you could talk about how you're planning to differentiate this service? Is it really about pricing or is it by tying in the software and platform-as-a-service offerings? If you could touch on that.",86

Look, we're very comfortable with our cost structure. In light of Google efficiencies, economies of scale, our vertical integration from data center to chip, to servers, to software, I mean, we really have a -- we believe we have an absolute unique position from a cost structure perspective. And therefore, from a margin perspective, it makes us very, very comfortable. In terms of differentiation, I'll just let Nikesh jump in here.",86
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2014",2014-04-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3250.0,612164.0,27608691.0,Answer,Nikesh Arora,,Executives,48,"I think, Colin -- thank you again for the question. The important part to -- at least acknowledge in the space of cloud computing is we think it's very, very, very early days. I mean if you think about the potential scope and scale of what this opportunity is, that pretty much every business, which is going to be around for the long term, has to operate in the cloud. There's no efficiency compared to the efficiency of the cloud, but -- compared to owning your own infrastructure and running it by yourself. So this shift is going to happen, it's a matter of every company going through that shift one at a time. And if you look at the opportunities out there and the options, there's very few options. So there's a lot of room for all of us to have a great time for many, many, many years before we start worrying about differentiation and why my sort of thing is better than yours. So right now, the key is to be able to work with the companies out there, the Enterprise customers out there, to get them to shift off their legacy systems, get onto the cloud and realize that Google has been working in the cloud for more than a decade because we have been running one of the largest cloud computing platforms in the world, in the public space. And we have all the expertise and the skills that are required to be able to serve these -- these enterprises and get them off their current legacy systems onto the cloud. So our effort is really trying to work with these third-party partners, trying to get them off their legacy systems, onto our cloud. I don't think the challenge right now is the need to differentiate. I think our biggest differentiator is we have the most experience in the space.",315

A couple of big picture questions, I think, for Nikesh. The first is that I think there is an ongoing debate about whether the mobile web or mobile app is going to win and what the implications are for various businesses, Google included. And then I'm just curious to get your view on whether you think one will win over the other and then whether it matters for Google. And then the second is, when you look at Google's share of global advertising, you're coming up on about 10% of total. But when you look at your business in the U.K., you're north of 20% of total. So when you think about your global businesses, as economies start to mature, do you think the U.K. is a fair proxy for thinking about your business globally? Or are there other factors that you think may prevent you from getting to that type of scale globally?",159
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2014",2014-04-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3250.0,612164.0,27608694.0,Answer,Nikesh Arora,,Executives,51,"I guess -- let me answer the second question first, Jordan, because I'm standing here, Patrick is looking at me asking the same question. I think the way to think about it is that we have 10% by some metric, depending on what you believe the total is, as per your metric, we have 10% of the total advertising -- sort of money. In the U.K. we have 20%. That just tells me there's 90% more opportunity around the world and 80% more opportunity in the U.K. So we're not going to constrain our thinking in terms of what we believe is a stable state. Our aspiration is to be able to serve every advertiser in the long term, and our aspiration is that -- our hope is that every piece of advertising becomes a digital advertising. The question is how much of that are we able to provide through our technology platforms? How much are we able to provide through our own sort of properties and how much do we partner with others to provide on their network? So I guess I'm trying to tell you that we don't constrain ourselves in our thinking. I'm not trying to be arrogant and say, ""We want 100%."" But we'd like more than what we have in every market out there. In terms of your question around the mobile web and mobile search, that is a tough question. And that is a very involved question. And I think the approach -- the best way to think about it is that we're trying to make sure that we can make both of them effective for the end-user and make them both work because we're not about to try and pick winners. Right now, you can see that people spend as much time on mobile devices, more time on mobile devices than they're beginning [ph] to spend on the desktop. And they're spending their time across the mobile web, as well as the mobile app landscape. We're participating in both those ecosystems, whether it's through our place sort of in the app front, whether it's through our browser-based search properties, or through our app-based search properties. So we're participating across the board. And I think, at the end of the day, it's going to boil down to ease-of-use and consumer choice.",387

The first one is on the revenue side. Can you talk a little bit and can you maybe give us an update about the breakout of YouTube versus DoubleClick revenues? Where are those today and where could they be over time? And then on the cost side, Patrick, could you maybe just walk us through just how you think about the ROI on capital? We get a lot of questions from investors asking about spending. Could you maybe just tell us more about the thought process of how the company looks at the ROIC of capital going forward?",106
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2014",2014-04-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3250.0,612164.0,27608697.0,Answer,Patrick Pichette,,Executives,54,"Okay. Well, Robert, let's start with the last one first, and then we'll go back to revenue. ROI, clearly, we have -- we always look at capital intensity. The fact that we're investing quite a bit in CapEx right now, right, is a real tribute to kind of the potential and the optimism we have about our business going forward. Most of our core businesses, if you think of YouTube or advertising or Search, right, are not that capital-intensive relative to other areas that we have, such as, for example, Google Fiber, if you think of the access portion, right, which is much more traditional CapEx. For each of these areas, we actually track and make sure that we have good returns and we have a capital efficient. So even though, an area that, take the advertising business that we run, even though you could argue that it's phenomenally good on the return on capital, the question that we will ask internally is, ""Okay, so if the utilization rate is x on our machines on this business, right, why can't it be x-plus something?"" So even though we have already good return on capital on these areas, we continue to always push the envelope to make sure that our capital efficiency continues to be better and better on a year-to-year basis. And then across the portfolio, every area has some capital kind of targets to make sure that we're driving for value. Finally, there's a number of areas if you think of -- take the most -- the newer stuff like Loon, for example. In those cases, you test through the hurdles that we kind of we seed capital to the Loon team as they hit their hurdles and they kind of earn their right to the next toss of funding. And in doing so, right, we continue to always have the business case in mind that says, ""Hey, here's why this continues to make sense to fund and invest and with ROIC or value in mind for the long term."" But in the short term, it's really kind of delivery of milestones on very specific engineering objectives that actually gives them the next round of funding. So, Robert, as you can see, given the portfolio of mature stuff we have and growing areas, as well as kind of much more R&D and innovation at the early stages, right, we just need to have a basket of tools to actually manage the concept of ROIC or ROI on each of them. And that's what we do, I mean, it's not rocket science, it just requires a lot of discipline on our part. On the revenue side, look, we don't break out DoubleClick or YouTube. I can just tell you, as I mentioned a bit earlier, we're really pleased with our network revenue in the kind of AdMob, Ad Exchange. Many of our areas, right, continue to grow very well and we're very, very pleased by these investments. And clearly, continue to be very pleased with YouTube, as mentioned -- Nikesh mentioned a bit earlier. And that's the story there.",519

So why don't I take the last portion and then Nikesh may have views on this data conversion plan. On Fiber, look, you've heard our announcement earlier this quarter where we're working with 34 cities and looking for working with these municipalities where -- I mean, they've indicated to us they're really excited about -- they kind of self-selected to be really excited about getting Fiber and the next generation of access. So right now, we're basically working directly with them to look if we have the right conditions to actually go to the next stage, which would be the build. So very excited about it. I think that it's a really good sign of things to come in access, in general. I think that everybody now in the industry is talking about the gig. It's becoming the standard. And we're absolutely thrilled for all of the users out there that can think that they'll one day get a gigabit of symmetrical Internet at a reasonable price.

I think Datalogic is one of those things, which we are looking at to see how we can help quantify the opportunity and quantify the answer for our offline partners.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2014 earnings call. So I'll dive right into the numbers. Nikesh is going to give you a business update, and then we'll open up for Q&A. So let's dive into the details of our financial performance for Q2. Our gross total consolidated revenue grew a healthy 22% year-over-year to $16 billion and was up 3% quarter-over-quarter.
Without currency fluctuations, our gross total consolidated revenue growth would have in fact been 21% year-over-year, still very healthy. Our Google site revenue was up 23% year-over-year to $10.9  billion and was up 4% quarter-over-quarter, driven by strength in our core search advertising business.
Our network revenue was up 7% year-over-year at $3.4 billion and was up 1% quarter-over-quarter, driven by year-over-year growth in our AdMob and Ad Exchange businesses.
Finally, Google other revenue grew 53% year-over-year to $1.6 billion and was up 3% quarter-over-quarter. Digital sales of apps and content in our Play Store drove the year-over-year growth.
Our global aggregate paid-click was strong this quarter, up 25% year-over-year and 2% quarter-over-quarter. Aggregate CPC were down 6% year-over-year, but flat quarter-over-quarter. And without currency fluctuation, aggregate cost per click would have been down 7% year-over-year. So currency had a very minimal -- and currency had no impact on quarter-over-quarter CPC growth.
As we indicated on our last earnings call, we're now disclosing paid clicks and cost-per-click changes by property type in addition to aggregate numbers. So to that end, Google site's paid clicks were up 33% year-over-year and up 6% quarter-over-quarter. Our Google site CPC were down 7% year-over-year and down 2% quarter-over-quarter.
On the network side, network paid clicks were up 9% year-over-year and down 5% quarter-over-quarter. And our network CPCs were down 13% year-over-year and up 3% quarter-over-quarter.
Our monetization metrics continue to be impacted by a number of factors at an aggregate level, including geographic mix, device mix, property mix, as well as our ongoing product and policy changes. And since we're now disclosing additional property metrics related to our monetization, it may be helpful to remind you all of what we include in each property.
So let's start with sites. Sites monetization metrics include ads that were served on Google owned and operated properties across different geographies and form factors. So these properties include: YouTube search, obviously; YouTube engagement ads, like TrueView; and then other owned operated properties, such as like Maps or Finance and otherwise. Our network monetization metrics include ads serves on non-Google properties participating in our AdSense for Search, AdSense for Content and AdMob businesses.
We also provide corresponding historical data since Q1 of 2013 for reference, which can be found on -- in our earnings slides. Nikesh and I will obviously be happy to respond, as usual, to your question about our Q2 monetization in the Q&A today, but I'm sure that some of you may have detailed questions about monetization trends from prior quarters. And help you with that, the IR team will be ready to answer your questions after the call.
Turning to geographic performance. We saw solid performance in the U.S. and the U.K. and continued strong performance in Rest of World. In our earnings slides, which you can find on our Investor Relations website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and Rest of the World to show the impact of FX and the benefits of our hedging programs. So please do refer to these slides for the exact calculations.
The U.S. revenue was up 12% year-over-year to $6.6 billion. The U.K. was up 22% to $1.6 billion. And in fixed FX terms, the U.K. grew 15% year-over-year, a clear improvement from last quarter's performance.
As we've mentioned in previous quarters, our AdSense for Search business skews toward the U.S. and the U.K. And our ongoing user-focused product and policy changes have continued to have a clear impact on our revenue growth in these 2 geographies.
Our non-U.S. revenue, excluding the U.K., was up 31% year-over-year to $7.7 billion. And this accounted for 48% of our total revenue, which includes a $6 million benefit from our hedging program. So in FX term, the Rest of World grew also 31% year-over-year.
Let me now turn to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.3 billion or 23% of total advertising revenue this quarter. Our non-GAAP other cost of revenue was $2.7 billion in Q2, and this is excluding stock-based compensation. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $4.8 billion, again, excluding SBC. And as a result, our non-GAAP operating profit was $5.1 billion and our non-GAAP operating margin stood at 32% in Q2.
Headcount was up roughly 2,200 people in Q2 in the last 90 days. And in total, we ended the quarter with approximately 52,000 full-time employees. But please note that the headcount does include approximately 3,500 full-time employees from the Motorola business.
Our effective tax rate was 21% in Q2. Our tax rate this quarter was impacted by the continued mix shift of earnings between our domestic and international subsidiaries. Let me now turn to cash management. Our OI&E, or other income and expense, was $145 million for the quarter. Interest income and realized gains on investments offset the continued impact of expenses from our FX hedging program. And for more detail on OI&E, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website.
We continue to be happy with our strong operating cash flow at $5.6 billion. And CapEx for the quarter was $2.6 billion. This quarter, the majority of the CapEx spend was related to data center construction, real estate purchases and finally, production equipment, in that order. Investors should see our investment in CapEx as a positive signal since it reflects our sustained optimism about Google's business.
As I've mentioned before, we will continue to invest for the long term, and our infrastructure and real estate assets remain a key strategic area of investment for us.
Our free cash flow for the quarter was $3 billion. And before I close, I want to give a brief update on Motorola. The team continues to be hard at work, and we look forward to seeing them join with the Lenovo team soon. Motorola had a great Q2, with the Moto E and Moto G both showing strong sales momentum, especially in emerging markets.
So there you have it. Strong results and an optimism that provides us the confidence to continue to fund strategic growth opportunities in many areas, including our CapEx area that we talked about earlier. And now I'll let Nikesh cover some more details on our business performance in the quarter. And after his remarks, I'll take it back to open up the phone lines for questions. Here you go, Nikesh.",1132

We've had an amazing last few months at Google. And our focus on creating great, multi-skin experiences is paying off. I hope you saw our annual I/O developer conference a few weeks ago. We were joined by over 6,000 developers in San Francisco, along with approximately 1.9 million people globally tuning in online.
We unveiled the upcoming Android L release. We also showed how we're expanding the Android platform to cars, watches, TVs, as well as making it easy to search Google from anywhere by simply saying, okay, Google. Making magical products that people love using every day is what drives our ambition, fuels our business. Last quarter, we saw strong growth with $16 billion in gross revenue. We saw particular strength in the travel and retail verticals, as well as in several countries like Japan and India. By now, you know the 4 areas driving our business. One, performance or direct response marketing. Two, helping clients build their brands. Three, our ad tech platforms for agencies and publishers. And four, our emerging businesses like digital content, enterprise and hardware.
I'll quickly go through each of them. And this quarter, I want to highlight the investments we're making to serve small businesses. Firstly, in performance advertising. In the long term, we're battling towards a world where people jump seamlessly across screens of all sizes on all types of surfaces.
In today's world, unlocking the mobile phone opportunity is absolutely key for every marketeer, and we're seeing tremendous amounts of momentum here. We've been building popular mobile app formats for years, like showcasing a business' location or Click-to-Call, et cetera. The teams are laser-focused in making ad campaigns easier across screens and helping businesses measure their effectiveness across devices, as well as offline.
We already offer great solutions for marketeers wanting to promote app installs. In April at our AdWords Performance Forum, we supercharged our offerings for app developers across search, display and as well as YouTube.
We launched improvements like app deep linking and search to help developers reengage users who have already downloaded their app, better targeting options in AdMob to help them reach the most likely customers, even a new app install format on YouTube and more powerful measurement tools so they know exactly how their app is performing at every stage. Mobile hotel booking app, Hotel Tonight, uses mobile search ad as a key part of their global marketing efforts because it drives consistently high value users who are more likely to purchase quickly in the apps.
In fact, international mobile search campaigns drive 3x times higher conversion rates compared to other direct response channels. We're also seeing tremendous amounts of momentum in the Retailer segment, as product listing ads across screen. In fact, this past quarter, we sent over 3x as much traffic to merchants on smartphones and tablet devices compared to Q2 of last year.
Moving on to the second area, brand-building. I recently spent some time at the Con Line Festival [ph]. I know it was work in con [ph], where Google had a big presence, hosting over 300 meetings with creative agencies and brands.
What was actually interesting this year was how much the conversation with brands has changed from years' past. Whereas digital used to be just one channel, today's brand are putting digital at the center of their brand-building campaigns.
We see this from our clients as well, and video seems to be linchpin of the strategy. YouTube continues to be driven by the insanely popular channels from some of our top content creators, like breakout hit Epic Rap Battles of History and new sensation VICE News. We launched our Google Preferred video offering at Brandcast in April, giving marketeers access to top content on YouTube. And we've gotten phenomenal amount of support from agencies and brands so far.
Digitas was our first agency to sign-on. And since then, Omnicom Media Group has also pledged their support. Brands including General Motors, Coca-Cola, and Universal Pictures are also having tremendous amounts of success with Google Preferred. Adidas was one of the major brands to leverage our Google platform to reach fans during the World Cup. They engaged soccer fans by live streaming events with athletes, promote them on YouTube, through TrueView ads, as well as using beautiful Lightbox Ads across our Display Network.
Now a few words about our ad technologies for agencies and publishers. Again, video is at the forefront of our efforts here. Last month, we introduced a premium programmatic video marketplace called Google Partner Select to help publishers monetize their video content and to help agencies reach top-quality video content across the web. The feedback that we've gotten from agencies and publishers has been great. We continue to see strong growth across premium inventory, particularly with the growth of private exchanges, across AdMob and AdSense, publishers are increasing their investments in mobile sites and apps and growing their businesses using our platforms.
Before I move on to our emerging businesses, I want to talk about an area we continue to invest in: online tools for small businesses. Small businesses are the cornerstone of the world's economy and a major priority for us at Google. But there's still a huge opportunity, as over 50% of SMB still don't have a website.
To help set them up for online success, last month, we introduced Google My Business, which helps small businesses manage their online presence across Search, Maps and Google+. We also have a vibrant ecosystem of partners who help local businesses optimize their AdWords campaigns and even improving our customers' support for small businesses. In fact, over the last 3 years, we've doubled our advertiser customer satisfaction scores, which bodes really well. Now let me talk about emerging new businesses, digital content, enterprise and hardware. Google Play continues to grow at breakneck speed across all types of digital content, helping developers and content partners reach users around the world. For instance, clear movies is now available in over 90 countries, with the recent additions in Argentina, Poland and the Czech Republic. We also recently signed deals with CBS-TV and Viacom to bring their TV content to Google Play.
With over 1 billion active Android users, the growing success of Google Play means that more developers are building successful global businesses in our platform. As we mentioned at I/O, since last June, we paid out more than $5 billion to developers through Play, which clearly means it's a growing business for us as well.
Shifting gears to our enterprise business. I can report that over 60% of the Fortune 500 use our paid products. This quarter, we added even more, like Rockwell Collins, that signed up 20,000 employees to use Google Apps. We also launched Google Drive for Work, a premium service for businesses that includes unlimited storage. The reception so far has been great, and we even closed our first sale within minutes of the announcement. Our cloud platform business also has momentum with new features announced at I/O.
On the hardware side, over 1 million Chrome books were sold into schools, clearly a record quarter. And the popularity of Chromecast continues to grow, now available in Australia, Korea, Portugal and many more. I got to watch some World Cup games from the ESPN app using my Chromecast. Before I close, I want to mention our marketing team. In addition to a great I/O this year, we also launched the Made With Code initiative with partners like Girl Scouts of the USA and Girls Who Code to inspire the next generation of women coders. We are really excited about the enthusiasm around this initiative. And who knows, hopefully, some of these coders will join us at Google. With that, I'd like to thank today all the Googlers around the world who helped make this a fantastic quarter. On a personal note, as you might have seen, I'm moving on to a new adventure. I'd like to thank Larry and Sergey and the founders of Google, my colleagues in Larry's staff, as well as everyone at Google for the amazing experiences and the phenomenal 10 years I've had. I look forward to working with them in the future and cheering them from the sidelines. I'll hand back to Patrick.",1381

Could you just clarify, even if it's just historical data, the size of that asset and any more color around the growth there, new monetization initiatives, et cetera?",80

And as we -- Mark, as we had discussed in the last quarter, we had talked about the U.K. having had a tough comp the year before. So you can see basically the recovery of that in the numbers, and we're pretty pleased with the momentum there. In terms of YouTube, I mean, we -- I know there's been a lot of speculation out there. But in essence, right, what we have is great opportunities in front of us. And we don't kind of comment on outside estimates. YouTube, it serves as a powerful starting point for advertisers who are looking to anchor their brand campaigns online and coupled with the online measurement of the digital audience, the Nielsen, comScore, everything that we've just announced over the last couple quarters, right, clearly, a great runway ahead of it. So that's basically the story on YouTube.",149

29096.0,"Google Inc., Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2014",2014-07-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3490.0,659331.0,29339052.0,Answer,Nikesh Arora,,Executives,10,"Yes, thanks, Eric, for your question. I think 2 quick answers to that. As we've talked in the past, PLAs is actually a fundamental sort of existential need of our product, sort of our search business. Because as people go to tablets, as people go to mobile devices, they're looking for more and more precise answers when they search. And the ability for them to go directly to the entity they're searching for is phenomenally powerful when they're searching for these things. And Sridhar and his team have done a great job with working with every retailer out there to try and get as many products listed in our product listing service. So when you actually search, you get a platter of options in terms of where you can buy the product, what it's priced at and how many products are available in that category. So it's actually a very, very good evolution from a search perspective, which clearly translates into people clicking on those and thereafter, hopefully, driving more commerce towards our partners in the retail segment. And as I said, we drove 3x as much traffic this quarter than we did same time last year. So it's clearly good. In terms of Google Shopping Express, it started off as an experiment. Clearly, our users are delighted with the service. I mean, I can't seem to find people who are not happy with Google Shopping Express. And we are seeing tremendous results. We are learning a lot. We're getting our logistics right. We are getting our processes right. And we believe it's clearly an opportunity for us, and our teams are really, really excited about continuing to invest in that area, and we keep experimenting with different formats and different solutions to make sure that we can provide the most optimized experience to our users.",306

Patrick, when you're budgeting for some of the longer-term projects and you're trying to think about sort of the timeframe to get to profitability, for instance the team at Google X or Google Fiber or something on self-driving cars, how do you think about the timeframe for getting to profitability? Is there any general rule on how far away it needs to be? And related to that, in terms of the potential financial contribution within the next, say, 3 to 5 years, what are the new initiatives that you expect to have the most impact?",106
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2014",2014-07-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3490.0,659331.0,29339056.0,Answer,Patrick Pichette,,Executives,14,"Thanks for your question, Ben. And what you really have, as I've explained many times before, we set up our kind of governance around a bit of like a VC model, where we actually have gating and funding. And projects that have -- that are more software-based will have much shorter lifetimes before we expect a bunch of returns. Projects that are much more kind of fundamental physics R&D will have much longer life kind of timelines for actually funding and expected milestones. But in both cases, they're all set around the boundaries of you have a business case, you have a thesis. And that thesis is basically tested on a regular basis through the gating of the funding that they get. And in some cases, like self-driving cars, obviously, multi-year. And we have a couple of other projects next that are of that nature, where it would take, we think, of kind of half decade, sometimes even a bit longer before we know that you can get kind of real momentum on revenue and profitability. Others are much shorter. So that's how we kind of think about it. What matters most is really that we actually set up that gating and that we have these refinements to the business model. And Google Shopping Express, another great example of that, right, where you just kind of have the gating and then they come back for funding every so many months to kind of look at where they're going. So that's what we have. In terms of the next 3 to 5 years, I wouldn't be able to comment on the specifics of any one of those. But you can basically, through the guidance I've just given you, you can comb through what is really an asset-intensive versus a software kind of intensive kind of play, and then it gives you a guidance of how fast and how slow we should expect our returns to be.",325

You mentioned on the prepared remarks that the U.S. growth is being impacted by some of the network changes. I don't suppose you could quantify it, but please do, if you can. But when do you think you kind of work through all those changes and we can start seeing a normalized growth rate or maybe you can answer it by how far are you along that process. And then the second question, pretty excited about Google Play opportunity. Can you just tell us what's the margin opportunity related to Google Play or the profit opportunity?",100
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2014",2014-07-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3490.0,659331.0,29339059.0,Answer,Patrick Pichette,,Executives,17,"I'll take the first and then I'll let Nikesh talk about the second. On the first one, we have -- we've talked about this. Again, as you said so rightly, Justin, we have talked about a couple of things going on, right? As early as -- early kind of Q1 of 2013, we announced these DLA policy changes. And you all remember that. And we also reminded you at the time that by announcing these changes, it would take time to actually flow through to a bunch of partners across 2013. So clearly, there's an effect there on a year-over-year basis, right, as it didn't all happen in Q1 of '13. In addition to that, I` mentioned in my prepared remarks that we continue to have ongoing user-focused product changes, and they continue to impact our AFS business as an example. So AFS, right? And then what you end up with is, you all remember that AFS or AdWords for Search -- AdSense for Search, it really skews to the U.S. and the U.K. And because of that, right, that's why you see the disproportion into those results. So on the DLA, obviously, they will lapse over the course of this year. And -- but the additional kind of continued product changes and the user-focused product changes and policy changes will continue to kind of hammer them to make sure that we get the perfect balance between what is right for the user and what's right for the advertiser. And so that's why, all in all, I feel pretty confident in what I said when I said that we're pretty pleased with our growth rate in the U.S. As for the Play, why don't I actually let Nikesh give you a bit of comments on that.",297

I mean, it's come from nowhere. It's a phenomenal platform, which provides services, apps, content around the world. As we've mentioned, over 90 countries with Google Play movies. So -- and as Patrick would say, he gave away $5 billion to developers, which is 5,000 million. So a lot of money, and it's actually really great for innovation, it's phenomenal for the app developer ecosystem, and it's a really good binding glue for the Android ecosystem because people find tremendous amounts of agility and all the apps and all the service that they get in Google Play. So for us, we're really, really very excited about the Google Play opportunity. I think, in terms of the margin, you should be able to look at the market and understand how typically these relationships work and there should be no different than what the current market is around the margin opportunity for services in the long term.",174

So at I/O, you announced some new innovation in search and discovery for apps, including opening up app indexing globally. So what kind of timeline do you think Google's on before we start to see a lot of app content appearing in core search results more regularly? And what kind of revenue opportunity do you see around that? And then the second question, somewhat related, is you also announced a bunch of new screens for Android watches, TVs, et cetera. I know it's still very early days, but do you envision the long-term business model for these being similar to the existing model with ads in Google Play or do you see potentially building close-loop transactions, as an example?",125

Let's talk about the app indexing first and then about the screen stuff. I mean, if you think about it, Google has been in the business of making sure that we drive traffic on behalf of people and advertisers and help people find things. And as you look at mobile phone behavior, people spend a lot of time on apps as well as in the browser searching for things. So I think it's important for us to make sure that we provide the content that users are looking for. So you should expect us to most aggressively try and make sure that app indexing all happens and it's available and easily accessible across devices. And when people are looking for things, we provide them the most relevant answer in which, in certain cases, that happens to be the app. So allowing for people to discover apps, as well as creating more engagement for apps that people may not have been engaging with for a while. So I think, clearly, an area of focus. And clearly, you should see -- expect us to see activity in that space. And in terms of revenue, it's not unlike any revenue we create in search, where we help people find things and that allows us to create an advertising opportunity, where people are -- we're able to monetize that on behalf of sort of our properties. In terms of your second question, I think you had to take a longer-term point of view towards the screen question. As you can see, the whole screen was sort of almost designed as island, where every screen has its own operating system, has its own ability to work. But we're noticing more and more people who want to switch from screens and retain the service experience. And towards that end, the Android team is doing a phenomenal job, making sure that we provide that seamlessness across screens and that fungibility of services across those screens. So I think, in the long term, we have to think about this as a user-centric model. We're helping users take their services fungibly from one screen to the other and making that happen seamlessly. And if that works out, I think there will be phenomenal business opportunities for us in the future. But at Google, we always worry about the user first, and we'll figure out the monetization when we have a lot of users excited about it.",413

One on revenues. Is there a significant positive net impact of growing penetration and usage of smartphones on search revenue. And what happens to search revenue growth if there's no more benefit in developed markets as smartphone penetration approaches 100%? Second, you added more than 2,400 employees to Google in the quarter versus 1,400 in the second quarter last year. I think that's the highest quarterly headcount addition in more than 2 years. Patrick, is this the norm in terms of the rate in which you'll grow head count for the core? How do you think about the rate of headcount growth versus gross profit, or you don't think about that at all?",118

On the issue of headcount. Look, we have this amazing opportunity and machine to actually look around the world to look for the best engineers. And we promised ourselves that given the bar is very, very high, when we do find people that fit the culture and that you think will actually do a great contribution and be great Googlers, we actually don't hesitate and we hire them. Because if we hire them a bit too early or a bit too late, on balance, we're very happy to have them early on. You're right that if you look at the last couple of quarters, I mean, the trend has been pretty kind of solid. And in addition to that, you have to look at the impact also of our acquisitions, when we make acquisitions, that kind of compounds a bit the numbers. But from that perspective, Carlos, we don't set up a specific target. We say, we're going to end with X amount for this quarter, and then once we hit our quota we see everybody else the next quarter. So from that perspective, we're a bit more organic about it. And we are the vast majority of our hiring to kind of give comfort to our investors. It is really still in the engineering field and the product management field, which is really where we want to focus our attention. And we continue to focus there. So that's basically the puzzle in which we work. On the question, maybe Nikesh can talk about revenue and smartphone penetration.",274

As we see more and more users and penetration of smartphones, people spend more time looking for things with smartphones. And I think there's a very, very long sort of runway that this opportunity has because we are just seeing people getting onto smartphones. Now you're beginning to see businesses and other websites take mobile very, very seriously. They want to be present on mobile. I think the revenue opportunity is phenomenally high because right now, mobile does not monetize as well as certain other forms. But given the huge influx of queries you're seeing, we expect as people make it more and more relevant to be able to find information in the long term, mobile should be monetized even better than desktops. I think it's a tremendous runway going forward. I don't think we have to fear the sort of saturation of smartphones penetration in developed markets for a while.",160

Then, Nikesh, if you don't mind talking about GCE afterwards. The -- look, here's what's going on with Google Fiber. It's important to bear in mind the following. First is the economics of a fiber network today are clearly much cheaper than they were, say, a decade ago. There's been a lot of improvements and cost reductions and technology components all through the fiber network, but also in the way we build it. Second one is, I just want to remind everyone that an important part of our strategy is actually to build to demand. So unlike the typical over builder, actually, we have a very different kind of business model and thesis for that. And we do work closely with each city to streamline the process that keeps again the cost of construction away down. So as an update to you right now, Anthony, we have, as you know, we are working with 34 cities, separate cities, with a kind of a completed checklist of items to help us prepare for the next kind of wave of our construction project. And we'll going to be basically -- they're in the last throes of finishing this checklist since coming back with us. Over the coming months, we'll actually be going through all of the details with them, whether they'd be right of way or permitting or otherwise. And that's what we're going to use to make decisions as to how broad a program we'll have. We expect that to kind of give an update between now and at the end of the year, as the information comes along. So we're really thrilled about the opportunity. It continues to be kind of a great piece of focus for us. And just stay tuned for more, the next update on it. As per the GCE, do you want to take it, Nikesh or...",321

What we're really concerned about is making sure we have an amazing offering for businesses so they find value in working with us and making sure that we can support them in their transition to the cloud. We think we have a great set of products. Our team is really excited. We're beginning to ramp up. So I think there's tremendous opportunity going forward. And I think it won't be time to slice the pie for a long time because a lot of businesses are clamoring to move their business to the cloud because that's where the users' already are, because we're used to the cloud in our personal lives and it's about time that our businesses that we work in actually got to the bleeding edge of technology as much as the consumer services are.",203

I think some of the quality initiatives that you've been undergoing and continue to for a while, part of the intended consequence or result, I would imagine, will be to recognize higher overall CPCs or pricing over time. But that doesn't seem to been the case so far. So I wonder if you could shed a little light as to why we're not seeing that show up in some of the metrics and kind of what your expectations are going forward? Is that, in fact, one of the intended consequences that we should be expecting going forward? And then, secondly, you've highlighted not just this quarter, but previously, that one of the main headwinds to the company's overall CPCs has been the mix shift around geography. I wonder if you could shed some light on if you've been seeing or making any progress in closing the gap there, maybe in markets like APAC, and what exactly are you doing to try to improve pricing outside the domestic and more stylish markets?",178

I think that you rightly pointed the fact that we are spending -- there are so many factors. The issue we have with the CPC. One of the key things about CPC is it clearly gives you a trend, but the trend is really shaped by the combination of CPC and click. So you can't just look at one in isolation of the others. It's really that mix of the 2. And in the case of network, for example, I mean, we just discussed at the beginning of the call that we've put a lot of time and a lot of energy in the last 18 months to actually work on quality issues. And that clearly has an impact when you push on quality to when you look at the mix to actually drive for the kind of revenues and growth rates that you see in our results on network. Having said that, it's also compensated by all of the other positive factors that we see, whether it be, as you said, geography or product mix or otherwise. So all in all, I think that the team is doing a good job, both on network and on sites. And you can see that as well on our detailed information of sites, where we continue to see the kind of -- or certainly over the last few quarters kind of creeping back up of CPCs, which actually continue to push for this quality issue. In terms of geography, I think that, yes, geography makes a big difference in that CPCs are much, in some cases, lower in international markets or emerging markets. But the team continues with a number of localization initiatives to like so we don't take CPCs as just one general. We will focus on each country, look for initiatives on localizations for each country to get the maximum CPCs on a geographic basis, country-by-country basis. And that's why you'll see a lot of localization initiatives. There's just one, again, one contributor. And it's really early days. There's so much more potential in many of these areas. And that's why, Sridhar's team and our search teams continue to work side-by-side to continue to push on these areas. So we see a lot of runway in this one, and geography is just one of these areas. And you mentioned like APAC. But APAC is a combination of more mature markets like, Australia and Japan. And then we have the real emerging markets in there as well, like Indonesia or India. And so even APAC itself is, again, localization matters immensely because very different answer for different countries. But all in all, a pretty good story. And we're really proud to continue to focus with this balance between user first and then make sure that we have the right monetization. So thanks for your question, Mark.",480

First, thanks for the added disclosure just on volume and CPCs. If we look at the site's data on pricing, it looks like we've seen an inflection here over the last 2 quarters and then now more flattish here sequentially in 2Q. Can we interpret from that, that we've seen the worst in terms of the negative pricing impact from mobile? And can you give us some color on what you're seeing in terms of like-for-like mobile pricing at this point? And then, secondly, just on CapEx, Patrick, can you just help us understand how your philosophy maybe has changed around CapEx spending over the last few years? And if you're in this period of building out potentially a lot of excess capacity, is it reasonable to think you're at some point over the next few quarters, we can also see things slow down as the business grows into that spending more?",158

On CapEx, listen, if you listen to the script I gave a couple of minutes ago. Interestingly, this quarter, in priority order, was construction of data centers. Second was actually real estate, which typically would have been historically you would have heard me talk about kind of equipment. And then equipment was third. So CapEx continues, we think, continues to be a strategic asset of ours. And you are correct in that we've signaled that, that we're actually building. We have a big building program right now because these are long lead items for our data centers. And we've just talked about a minute ago about GCE and other cloud services that continue to grow. So to strategically have the capacity versus not having the capacity is such a strategic asset to us that we'll continue to look that way. In terms of real estate, we found the same thing. We found that we have -- when we have opportunities to actually acquire real estate, that it's a make versus -- so a buy versus a lease option. And if you think of our growth and the growth in the strategic areas where we want to be, when we find great opportunities, I think we have a no regret move in actually taking that action. So you're seeing more activities on that front, which answers a bit -- a lot of questions have been around is the core business' kind of capital intensity growing. Well, you can see from these kind of data points that it's not really that. It's really a strategic focus that we have right now in making sure that we have the long-term assets necessary to win. So that's basically the mindset in which we're kind of investing in CapEx. In the volume of CPCs, you're talking about more flattish sequential in Q2. This is for sites, I assume. Was that for sites?",334

But I think on a quarterly basis, there can be so many fluctuations. I think year-over-year gives you a much more kind of realistic trend about what is fundamentally going on in the business. Because 1 or 2 changes can really kind of swing. Even seasonality can swing quite a bit, both in terms of growth rates or CPC's clicks and CPCs. So beware always okay -- and if you can see that in the network numbers, clearly, on the quarter-over-quarter as well, there's a lot of noise in the data. So you have to be careful in the quarter-by-quarter. But year-over-year actually gives you a pretty good story of the efforts we're putting into this. That's how I would do it.",143

Could you help us understand a little bit on some of the qualities of the small business growth profile? Is this about bringing businesses that have no online identity online or is it about taking more mature small businesses and getting a greater share of the spending? Just wondering if you can step back and maybe give yourself a report card on the small business progress you've made and where the best opportunities are?,86

I think, again, if you think about the phenomenal scale at which the Google team operates vis-à-vis small business, it's staggering. We have millions of advertisers, millions of publishers we deal with. And we're trying to make sure that millions of publishers get monetization for advertising. At the same time, we're trying to make sure that millions of small businesses achieve their goals in trying to drive traffic both online and off-line and do whatever services they're offering to their end-users. Now as we've gone through this transition to mobile, it's very important that these small businesses make that transition effectively, because all the user traffic is slowly and steadily shifting towards mobile. And part of our effort is to make sure that we work closely with all of our small business advertisers existing to help them go mobile. At the same time, trying to bring on more small businesses, both on the mobile and the desktop platform. So it's really a concerted effort to try and support small businesses around the world. It's a very targeted program to show them ROI, to show them the value of living online because we believe in the long term, that's where most businesses are going to get conducted. So it's really a long-term strategic effort to bring them all on-board. And I think the teams are doing a phenomenal job executing that around the world.",238

And then I have a second one, just I was going to start with that one since it was long-winded. And then the second one was just Google Shopping Express seems to be a great way to impact the small business environment.

I think Google Shopping Express is really about local. And local is really about both small businesses, as well as large businesses. So it really -- so absolutely, small businesses will be part of the focus area. And we're engaging with many of them, which is actually pretty terrific. But it's really about local. So it's not only with a focus of small and medium -- small businesses. And that's really the focus of Shopping Express. In the case of Chromebooks and Android, I mean, we've discussed this many times in the past where basically, you have a great convergence because there's humongous strength in both of these platforms, and they're basically converging in many ways. Today, you can get -- for example, you -- the -- on an Android phone, right, Chrome kind of powers the search and vice-versa. So we have a lot of these cross pollinization between the 2 teams. They're under one leadership, which is Sundar. And he basically actually make sure that these 2 teams continue to work into an integrated fashion. Everybody knows that Chrome has a huge focus on security, and that is in fact a great focus, to kind of migrate over into the Android ecosystem to make sure that we have kind of the equivalent of enterprise-grade security for all of our users, whether they be Chrome or Android. So I think that when you think of multiscreen, there are -- both of these OSs are actually very complementary to each other, and that's why we continue to kind of work in parallel. I think that across these multi-screens, you should expect -- Android continues to be very much the thing of choice for mass and Chrome continues to be very much the enterprise infrastructure, and you should continue to see kind of that evolve with that collaboration. So that's how we think about it, Heather. It's not -- there's no kind of -- it's one or the other. I think they are perfect complements. So thank you for your question.",350

Whether they are directly tied to advertising because they're an advertising product or they are at platform that actually gives you distribution, that gives you a great infrastructure on which kind of -- that fuels the searches in the advertising.

I think it's fair to say that YouTube has all forms of professional content available today. It has all the way from user content, to very popular user content with like people like Michelle Fan [ph], et cetera. And it has a lot of clips from professionally created content from various media partners. We talked about CBS and Viacom in the earnings call. So we have lots and lots of content from different players out there. And our monetization model in YouTube is working. It's a phenomenal model. It is now the linchpin of each of our brand strategies with our partners, and advertisers want to come work with us to create brand campaigns because YouTube allows you to actually target a fragmented set of interest in a most efficient fashion as opposed to trying to burst advertising that you would do on television and broadcast. So clearly, the monetization model is working. In terms of other models, as you've seen in the past, we have experimented with various models on YouTube. And we continue to experiment to see if advertising is the only model or there are ways that we can monetize using subscription or paid for content, I think that we will continue to do and see which ones of those sticks to the users.",223

And for Patrick, 2 things that would help us benchmark Google versus peers. First of all, can you talk about the portion of ad growth or even the overall ad sales which are being driven by mobile? And also, clearly, there's some questioning of the notion that large amounts of offshore cash can be permanently reinvested. Can you tell us what portion of cash is now offshore and how we should think about international opportunities that might absorb these very large volumes of cash?",125

I think in terms of your question around Google Fiber, YouTube, content-bundling subscription revenue streams, I think it's a very good question. I think it's an area where there's a lot of movement across-the-board, where different people are trying different models, where cable is trying to provide content over-the-top, or YouTube is available on television screens, where people are trying to increase the broadband speeds because everybody gets a sense that people consume more and more broadband content. I think what's clear to us in this process is that bandwidths will continue to increase, people's appetite for bandwidths will continue to grow up. It's clear that people will consume content more and more in a nonlinear fashion. It is clear that content will come from different places, not just the traditional mechanisms of cable and television. So I think that's pretty clear. It's also clear that people will monetize content, both either in some form of payment or some form of advertising. Beyond that, how all of this sort of coagulates and takes form still remains to be seen. I think it's fair to say we're experimenting on different ends of the spectrum where we have, like YouTube, purely advertising-based content and monetize today is over-the-top, which works on broadband. We have Google Fiber. We have channel bundles. So I think we are experimenting, we are playing in every space. And I think, eventually, the user will decide whatever is most convenient and most -- they're most able to use. They will decide. But I think it's fair to say we have a horse in every one of these races.",278

Let me jump into the second question. I'm going to, once again, kind of take a bit of exception to the premise of your argument about how much is driven by mobile. We really are living in a multiscreen world. You start on mobile, you hop on tablet, you go to your desktop, you kind of come back to your television, you kind of Chromecast back to your TV. That's the world in which we live. And when people say, how much of your advertising is really driven by one, and we do a lot of research that actually shows that, in fact, that's what we tried to show to our advertisers is how much attribution to kind of show to each of these elements what's in the chain of activities that actually leads to the end, which is either a consumption of something or a purchase. So from that perspective, that's why we don't actually talk about mobile as a percentage of ads. What really matters is that you have the footprint across all of these devices and modes to actually deliver the best answer to our users. And that's why you heard about I/O continuing to kind of expand that landscape. In the case of CapEx and international, like last quarter, our offshore cash was about kind of 60% and 40% in the U.S. We'll share those numbers in our 10-Q, so stay tuned. But in rough numbers, that's really where we stand today. It may move a percentage here and there. We do have great opportunities outside the U.S. as well to actually invest our cash, whether it be through acquisitions. You've seen a number of acquisitions in the last year that were made internationally. As well as we're building data centers outside of the U.S. where our headquarters in Ireland continues to grow and we're investing quite a bit of money there as well, to the real estates. So when you see our real estate numbers, they may include over time a number of these projects in Ireland. But also, in London and other places, where we're investing. So we actually have pretty exciting plans for our international portfolio, both in APAC and in Europe. And so there's a real kind of great case to actually continue to keep this amount offshore. It's not a shortage of opportunities that we have. So it's just a question of pace and discipline. So thank you for that. Thank you, Richard.",415

Firstly, through Google Play and applications such as Shopping Express, there already is a transactional model in place in terms of purchases and payments.

On the first question, I think that's a fair observation, Colin. And I think if you look at some of the applications that our payments team has developed around InstaBuy, it's the ability to do a one-click buy, where we can partner with merchants and any kinds of transaction providers, where they don't have to keep entering their data or entering their credit card in different places. So it gives them the comfort, ease of transaction. So I think over time, it's kind of like an open system solution where we have platforms, where retailers can work with us and pick and choose what part of our platform they want to leverage. And our hope is to create more and more frictionless ability to create transactions, which effectively benefits commerce and hopefully creates more revenue opportunities for us.",139

As some of you may know, we have a new leader in our Investor Relations team at Google. Her name is Ellen West. That's that great voice you just heard a minute ago -- a second ago. Ellen is a long-time Googler, who joined us in 2007. Although she is here with us today in Mountain View, she's actually based out of New York, and that will give us a bit more footprint on the East Coast as well. So Ellen, welcome to the team.
With that, let's dive into the details of Google's financial performance for Q3. Our gross total consolidated revenue grew a healthy 20% year-over-year to $16.5 billion and was up 4% quarter-over-quarter. Without currency fluctuations, our gross total consolidated revenue growth would have been 19% year-over-year.
Google sites revenue was also up 20% year-over-year to $11.3 billion and was up 3% quarter-over-quarter driven by the strength in our mobile search. Network revenue was up 9% year-over-year at $3.4 billion and was flat quarter-over-quarter driven by improved year-over-year growth in the AdMob and the Ad Exchange businesses. Finally, Google's other revenue grew a healthy 50% year-over-year to $1.8 billion and was up 15% quarter-over-quarter, was driven by year-over-year growth mainly from the Play Store but also complemented by an increase in licensing revenue.
Our global aggregate paid click growth was strong this quarter, up 17% year-over-year and up 2% quarter-over-quarter. Aggregate CPCs were down only 2% year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter, and without currency fluctuations, aggregate cost-per-click would have been down 1% and in fact, up 1% quarter-over-quarter.
As we began to do in our last earnings call, we continue to disclose paid clicks and cost-per-click changes by property type as well in addition to the aggregate number, so to that end, Google sites paid clicks were up 24% year-over-year and up 4% quarter-over-quarter. Google site CPC were down 4% year-over-year and down 1% quarter-over-quarter.
Our network paid clicks were up 2% year-over-year and down 4% quarter-over-quarter, and network CPCs were down 4% year-over-year but up 2% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate monetization metrics continue to be impacted by a number of factors, including geographic mix, device mix, property mix as well as ongoing products and policy changes.
Turning to geographic performance now. We saw solid performance in the U.S. as well as in the rest of the world. In our earnings slides, which you can find on our Investor Relations website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits of our hedging program. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.
U.S. revenue was up 15% year-over-year to $7 billion. The U.K. was up 17% year-over-year to $1.6 billion, and in fixed FX terms, the U.K. grew 10% year-over-year. In the U.K., growth was impacted by a combination of factors this quarter, including platform and property mix as well as tough comps from year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth rates for a number of reasons, including, for example, weather.
Our non-U.S. revenue, excluding the U.K., was up 26% year-over-year to $7.9 billion. This accounted for 48% of total revenue, which includes a $10 million benefit from our hedging program. In fixed FX term, in fact, the rest of the world also grew 26% year-over-year, very healthy.
Let me turn now to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.3 billion or 23% of total advertising revenue. Our non-GAAP other cost of revenue was $2.8 billion in Q3, which excludes stock-based compensation and also, a noncash impairment charge of $378 million related to a patent licensing royalty asset acquired as part of our Motorola Mobility purchase. Non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $5 billion, again, excluding SBC, and as a result, our non-GAAP operating profit was $5.4 billion, and our non-GAAP operating margin were 32% in Q3.
Headcount was up roughly 3,000 in Q3. In total, we ended the quarter with approximately 55,000 full-time employees. And please note that the headcount does include still approximately 3,500 full-time employees from the Motorola business.
In the past year, we continued to attract and hire the best talent from the best colleges and universities from all around the world. Continuing our past trend, graduates start are much more heavily concentrated in Q3, which is part of why you're seeing the significant bump in headcount with the majority of being tech hires, I want to kind of precise.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22% for Q3 and which includes the impact of the impairment charge that I mentioned earlier, which is a nondeductible for income tax purposes.
Let me now turn to cash management. OI&E or other income and expenses was $133 million. Interest income and realized gains on investments offset the continued impact of expenses from our FX hedging program. And for more details on OI&E, please do refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website.
We continue to be happy with our strong operating cash flow at $6 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $2.4 billion, and this quarter, the majority of the CapEx was related to our data center construction, production equipment and real estate purchases, in that order. It's important to remember that our infrastructure supports all of our products, whether they are core products like Search or Ads, Maps or YouTube, but in addition to fueling our growth products, like Photos and Hangouts, Google for Work and the Cloud Platform.
If you look at our data center announcements over the last 4 quarters, you'll also see that we've been really busy with both groundbreakings and expansion all around the world, including Finland, Taiwan, Singapore, recently announced Netherlands, in addition to our ongoing investments in the U.S. In total, our free cash flow was then $3.6 billion.
And before I close, I want to give a brief update on Motorola. The team continues to work hard, and we look forward to seeing them join the Lenovo team soon. Motorola had a great Q3 with strong user reviews for products like the Moto X, Moto 360 and Moto Hint, clearly demonstrating the impressive momentum of the company.
So there you have it, strong results with continued strong growth in both revenue and profits and an optimism that provides us the confidence to fund strategic growth opportunities, including the usual Android, Chromes and YouTube but also Google for Work and Cloud to name a few. 
Before I hand things over to Omid, I'd like to share with you some great news. I'm really thrilled to announce that Omid is now officially Google's Chief Business Officer and this on a permanent basis. All of us at Google couldn't be happier to see Omid at his post running our business organization once again.
And with that, I'll turn it over to him for more details on our performance in the quarter, and after his remarks, as usual, we'll have Jamie open up the line for your questions. 
Here you go, Omid.",1168

I'm Omid Kordestani. I'm happy to be back at my new old job, and thank you for joining us this afternoon. I joined Google back in 1999 to help get our business off the ground and led our business operations until 2009. Since then, I've served as an adviser to Larry and outside Google, actively help many entrepreneurs. I'm thrilled to be back at Google, leading our global business again.
We continue to have the same boundless energy and endless curiosity we've always had as a company, and we are as focused as ever in our mission of making information useful and accessible to everyone. Case in point, we're really excited about this week's Android Lollipop launch. This is our largest release on Android ever with over 5,000 APIs for developers. It adds new features, including better notifications, battery life and security and introduces a refresh consistent visual style. And alongside the new devices, Nexus 6, Nexus 9 and Nexus Player, consumers in India, who bought the recently announced Android One, will get the update to the latest software at the same time.
Now I'll do a quick walk-through of the business highlights from Q3. As usual, we'll give an overview of these 4 areas: performance and brand advertising, our advertising platforms and our emerging non-ads businesses.
Let's start with performance advertising, the core of our business. People want the right information at the right time. They don't want to have to think about whether it's on the web or in an app. We have learned this first hand as a developer of many services, Maps, YouTube, Gmail, that also are some of the world's most popular mobile apps. With that in mind, we have a simple goal with performance ads: help marketers connect with customers at the right moment to drive measurable results.
Our partners have driven hundreds of millions of app downloads with AdMob and our click-to-download formats, but most mobile apps are downloaded, used once and eventually deleted. So we launched new features to help advertisers reengage with users post download. For example, advertisers can now deep link from their search ads directly into their mobile apps. To succeed with multiscreen marketing, advertisers also need modern measurement tools, so they can understand when their ads drive phone calls from customers, result in conversions on other devices or lead to store visits and purchases.
Last October, we announced Estimated Total Conversions, our effort to help marketers better measure the value of their multiscreen advertising. We have worked to continue developing this product and launched cost device measurement for display ads. Clients have already found that mobile display campaigns drive 15% more conversions than they had previously measured.
Let's shift gears to talk about our shopping efforts. These dovetail nicely with performance ads. We are directly connecting people with products and services and then enabling them to buy and have them delivered. We keep making improvements to our products to help retailers. Keeping inventory organized and up-to-date is a constant challenge for retailers. We help them manage this issue by completing their transition of Product Listing Ads to our Shopping campaigns platform. And finally, people often want to find stores near them to make a purchase in person. We have long had local inventory ads that enable merchants to show customers this information in the U.S., and we launched these in the U.K., France, Germany, Japan and Australia last quarter. In summary, the core of our business, performance advertising, continues to deliver great results.
Let's move on now to our brand business. Our objective is clear here: make digital the best possible canvass for creative and effective brand-building campaigns. First, let's talk about YouTube. Any conversation about great advertising starts with great content. On YouTube, stars produce amazing content that our users love, from Bethany Mota to Smosh to Mental Floss.
Earlier this year, we launched Google Preferred to help connect brands with premium ad inventory on our most popular YouTube channels. Since then, we have secured upfront commitments from top media agencies. We're just getting started with YouTube and its potential.
We have sold out the majority of our U.S. Google Preferred offering, which represents among the top 5% of popular channels inventory on YouTube, and as a result of terrific Brandcast events in Germany, France, U.K. and Australia, we're seeing tremendous interest from local agency partners around the world.
Last quarter, we also saw some great progress in our brand efforts beyond YouTube. We launched new ad formats customized for mobile screens. We also announced an expansion of YouTube's TrueView ads into AdMob's network of more than 650,000 mobile apps.
Every day, our teams work to develop both the products and terrific partner relationships that enable us to tackle any digital marketing challenge across multiple channels together. With encouragement from Google and YouTube, ABC executed a digital-first marketing plan for their new fall TV lineup. The effort included custom 5-second ads for TrueView and collaborations with homegrown YouTube stars.
We are very excited about the new deal with Mondelez and Starcom MediaVest. This global agreement will focus on video and display and is Mondelez's largest digital media deal ever.
Next, let's take a look at one of the fastest-growing parts of digital advertising world, programmatic platforms for agencies and publishers.  For many years now, our goal has been to provide world-class technology for brands, agencies and publishers to power their ads businesses. Today, our DoubleClick suite is used by all major agencies, and we are particularly focused on multiscreen and video. DoubleClick Bid Manager is the go-to tool for marketers and agencies to navigate the rapidly growing programmatic advertising space. It's doubled in size year-over-year by impression volume, and we really love the progress we see here.
For publishers, we help them make money from their content via our publisher tools from our Ad Exchange to customized private changes, which complement our core offerings. This quarter, we signed new private advertising exchanges -- exchange deals with publishers like FOX TV and Edmunds. This helps publishers generate revenue from premium ad space. We have nearly doubled the number of private exchanges running on our system year-over-year.
Finally, we're seeing remarkable momentum in our newer non-ads businesses. Whether it's Play, hardware work or Google for Work, we continue to see strong growth, and we are thrilled to be a platform for our partners' successes as well.
Google Play's growth continues to impress. It's a linchpin of the amazing Android ecosystem. We brought Play Music to 17 new countries, bringing the total to 45, and our expansion continues. Today, Play Movies is available in 93 countries, and Play Books is available in 61 countries.
On the hardware front, just yesterday, we unveiled 3 fantastic new Nexus devices, Nexus 6 phone, Nexus 9 tablet and Nexus Player and Android-powered streaming media player. This quarter, we worked with HP, Toshiba and Acer to introduce 5 new Chromebook devices and teamed up with ASUS, LG, Motorola, Samsung and Sony to help launch new Android Wear devices. We're also selling Chromebook in 6 new countries. They are now available in 31 countries around the world, and we sold more than 1 million Chromebooks for education this quarter, even more than last quarter.
Chromecast celebrated its first birthday this past quarter. It's been a smashing success. Users have hit the Cast button more than 400 million times since it launched to enjoy their favorite sports, music, premium movies and TV shows. In September, we added even more content to Chromecast, including Disney content.
And we were so proud to launch Android One, an effort to make high-quality, low-cost smartphones available to as many people as possible. We started in India, and we'll be expanding to other countries, including Indonesia and the Philippines in the coming months.
For businesses, what was called Google Enterprise is now simply Google for Work. This business has great traction. In addition to the tremendous growth in our apps business, we have more than 1,800 sign-ups for Google Drive for Work every week. Plus, there are almost 250 million active Google Drive users, including consumer, education and business users.
We continue to invest in our growing Cloud Platform business, helping developers realize the promise of cloud computing by providing affordable on-demand access to world-class technology. We recently announced Google Cloud Platform for start-ups and offer up to $100,000 in credits to enable the best and brightest start-ups to use Google Cloud Platform.
Sony Music recently built an interactive app in less than 3 weeks using App Engine to engage fans tuning into One Direction Day, an 8-hour YouTube live stream featuring the band, one of the largest ever YouTube music live streams.
Lastly, our marketing team had a great quarter as well. Google My Business helped more small businesses get online and our Art, Copy & Code project showed advertisers the creative potential of digital marketing. And from the annual Google Science Fair to more recent campaigns showcasing amazing content on Play, YouTube stars and the power of the Google App, the magic of Google was on prominent display.
All told, it was another terrific quarter at Google, continued momentum in our core business and exciting innovation in new areas. Kudos to the Googlers around the world who made it all happen.
I'll turn it over to Patrick to wrap up and start our Q&A.",1572

I just wanted to get a little bit better color about how that was developing and how you're going to go forward with it.",96

So we're really trying to learn a lot here. Innovation is a messy process, and especially with Google Express here, there is a lot of understanding that we need to have on improving efficiency and the logistics process, trying to find price points that shoppers find attractive. And our goal is really to help the 35 -- over 35 merchant partners succeed and reach their customers. And I'm a user of it, and I'm really impressed by how much time it saves. I see the carts running around the city, around me, and I think our goal is really to take it a step at a time and see the success, understand the logistical operations, how much it costs us to do this and can we deliver this basically in a successful way.",138

One is, clearly, we've announced this week 3 other cities. So if you go back to the fundamental premise of kind the argument we table, which is the first thing was would people show up and want this product. It's very clear people want this product. The second one was -- and that's why we're expanding the product. The second question then is we've had a lot of questions about monetization, and we've announced this week, we're taking real actions on the monetization service, both including commissions on these transactions for merchants but also service fees that were announced as well. So from that perspective, we kind of think of it as now we're in Phase 2 of this product where, according to our business plan, right, we continue to kind of look for the barriers, the milestones and then when we hit those milestones, then we, with enthusiasm, keep on going. All this to say, it is, nevertheless, a scale business, so working on efficiencies, working on all of the issues that are related to logistics continues to be a big focus of ours. And on the partners, I mean, we're really thrilled to have the partners we have. You can expect, as we kind of grow through this, that we have a few coming in, more coming out -- a few coming out, but overall, very, very pleased with the trajectory there. And so I think you should see the announcements of this week as this kind of sign of optimism and momentum in it. Thank you so much for your question, Eric.",275

And then comment a little bit on the paid-click deceleration. What's driving that? And do you even see that as an important metric?,56
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2014",2014-10-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3365.0,705115.0,31133893.0,Answer,Patrick Pichette,,Executives,11,"So I'll take that. The 2 points is, one, look, we don't give the breakdown of the Google sites, but actually, it's pretty healthy on all dimensions. I think that from that perspective, I mean, Search is going well, and all of the other dimensions of our sites are actually doing pretty well. That's what you see in our kind of 20% year-over-year just for sites growth. So from that perspective, I think that we're pretty happy on that front. On the CPC issue, it's pretty simple. I mean, we really had -- again, you have to think of the CPC and the volume as one basket that actually delivers. So monetization overall is still very strong. We're very happy with the monetization, Jamie, and if we have in one quarter kind of movements between one or the other, that's just basically the continued experimentation and the impact of all of the factors that I usually talk about. So from that perspective, there is nothing of -- noteworthy to kind of mention this quarter. We're very happy with the trends in both cases. Thanks, Jamie -- sorry, Justin, I meant.",191

So is there any data you can share on your newest users in the emerging markets who are going just straight to mobile? Is it safe to assume that consumption from these new users are running in a pretty similar growth trajectory with what you've seen historically on a desktop and as well as your established markets?

One is, clearly, emerging businesses -- emerging markets are just fundamentally different than the more developed markets, right. If you think of a country like Indonesia or India, where people go straight to mobile, and so in that context, there's clearly a lot of differences between those markets and how they're evolving compared to what would have been 10 years ago, the U.K. or the U.S. So from that perspective, I think that -- and that's why you see us launch things like Android One, right? When you have 1 billion -- over -- just under 2 billion people around the world that have already smartphones, right, the vast majority of the population looks for things online, so these kind of initiatives that we're launching, I think, is the most important piece. From an investment at Google, we're investing. Without giving you all the details, we're clearly investing in our core business. It remains the focus of our activities. But if you look across, right, as Omid mentioned, he mentioned the Cloud business, the Google for Work business, all of these other areas, right, the Play business, the hardware business, these are all areas where we're investing and we're investing with enthusiasm with each their own specific business case, each of them actually looking for what is their growth and profitability models, and we just monitor them pretty tightly.",242

No, I mean, look, it's very clear that mobile is still a big part of our growth, and we're very pleased about it. I mean, it's -- and -- but when we talk about mobile, I think that there's a couple of things, right. One is you have to continue to look at both the growth in volume and the growth in pricing, so these are long-term trends that we're seeing. The CPCs and the clicks, they can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. It just happens that we've made some changes this quarter that improved the mobile pricing while impacting the lower-quality clicks, and that's what you see a bit reflected in our numbers. And again, -- and I wouldn't -- just as an overall statement, remember to everybody that I wouldn't attribute the aggregate CPC movement just to that one factor of mobile right because there's still a full factor mix that -- as I talked about in my remarks, about geography and about product changes, and so all of this actually makes a big factor as well. So that's what we've seen in the strength in mobile, but we're still very pleased with the momentum. Thanks, Mark.",198

So the U.K. growth looks like it's dropping off pretty hard on an x FX basis, either 1-year or 2-year growth rates. So I think this is an economy that folks generally think is supposed to be holding up pretty well. So can you talk about what you're seeing in the U.K.? You had mentioned weather and a few other things, but a little bit more color on what's going on with the ad market in the U.K. And then mobile payments, that's an area that's getting a lot of attention lately. Can you just give us an update on where the Google Wallet team stands and what kind of traction you're seeing in terms of user adoption and maybe how you plan on addressing merchant payments kind of outside of in-app or things from the app store?",151

As we talk about the U.K., a couple of points are worth note. One is the U.K. contributed roughly 10% of our total revenue this quarter, and that's been the same for kind of the past many quarters. And in fact, if you go back years, it'll still be in the same range, so there's nothing kind of fundamental that -- it's worth noting that it's still a pretty good market with decent growth. The issue of deceleration this quarter specifically, on platform -- I mean, I mentioned a number of developments, right? So platform mix, we do see maturing of desktop tablet searches having a greater impact in U.K. than anywhere else that we see in our network of countries. On property mix, you'll remember we talked about this also on prior calls. AFS, as a business, has much bigger part of our both U.K. and U.S. business, so it'll skew to those geographies. And so those are kind of some of the elements. And as I mentioned, right, year-over-year comps were difficult. And then if you have a great summer in terms of weather or a bad summer in weather, I mean, it can have some real impact on the growth rates as well. So it's a combination of a number of factors at the U.K. that's driven our performance, but still, pretty pleased. So -- but I won't -- that's really what's going on there. In terms of the payments, I'll let Omid give you an update there.",271

So reducing friction in everyday shopping experiences is how we approach it and the focus on the user, and we're really developing a fully functional payment system. So as you may know, users can send money today to friends through Gmail using the Wallet app; we have loyalty and gift cards that can be stored in the Wallet app; the Buy with Google button makes it possible for users to make purchases very quickly with 2 clicks.

So the way we look at it is that users are really accessing Internet on large screens with high broadband speeds, and we're getting great monetization on these screens, and advertisers are really paying attention. So we have seen a real shift where marketers and agencies, who have historically built their brands on TV, are really reorienting this toward investments on digital. And as -- in regards to YouTube, our focus here is really this focus on investments and more content, more creativity. And I think you also mentioned the -- you had a Facebook comment. What they are doing, I think, in video and we -- has always helped us with bringing more attention and more innovation to this space, so we welcome that. And the way we're going to approach it is just continue to invest in our platform and on the creators and building better and better monetization solutions. Just again, you may know some of these metrics, but I'll say it again that we have 400 hours of content that are uploaded every minute, and partner revenue is up 60% from 2012 to 2013 on YouTube.",196

Let me jump, Ben, on the YouTube-specific questions. On the tax issues, I mean, you've heard about the Ireland announcement earlier this week on the double Irish tax structure. I mean, for us, we've always said that it's for politicians to decide what laws they want to put in, then for companies just to comply with those laws, and that's what we're basically doing. So we're deeply committed to Ireland. We've worked there for many years. We have a great -- that's our headquarters. We have over 2,500 employees there, and so from that perspective, we're committed to the place. And we're going to work with the authorities just to kind of get clarifications over this, but it's really way too early to tell what's going to happen. So we're just like you, getting the information, the news, and we're going to work with the authorities to understand it better and then comply with the laws. In terms of stock-based compensation, a few -- just a few notes on this one for this quarter. We have -- it's the time of the year where we do equity refresh. And from a timing perspective, last year, we did the equity refresh in Q2 instead of Q3, so there's kind of like a geography of Q2 versus Q3 that kind of hit us in Q3. In addition to this, we -- if you go to our filings, you'll see that our executive compensation, so think of the top 15 or top 20, I can't remember the exact numbers, but it's stated there, that they do their refreshes every 2 years, and it happens to be this quarter as well. And then finally, I mean, we obviously have more employees. So it's just a compounding set of factors, Ben, that I kind of lumped it all into Q3, so it's no more, no less than that on that one. So thanks for your question.",322

Is there anything in particular, Patrick, that you might call out in terms of expense growth in the quarter as you have operating deleverage through the P&L? Just wondering going forward if that's likely to continue. And then a question for Omid, I suppose, on YouTube. You mentioned -- I know that YouTube's investing in its studios as a way to help along new talent, new homegrown talent onto the platform directly. I'm wondering if you could talk about the multi-channel network, how YouTube's relationships with the multi-channel networks, the MCNs are our evolving at a high level, how you guys think about that dynamic between the homegrown YouTube talent itself as compared to talent that resides on the MCNs.",125

Why don't I jump in right now on just expenses for the quarter? I think if I had 2 comments to make on expenses in the quarter, you may notice that relative to a few models that I saw, their R&Ds was higher and in other areas are a bit lower. And I just want to highlight that we hire and we focus clearly our hiring in our tech payrolls or think of it as all of our engineering, and that skews to R&D. So as we bring on people and we push forward the growth of our -- we really focus it in the areas that are going to make a fundamental difference to Google, which is engineering, and by doing so, it kind of skews to R&D. So that's why R&D was kind of maybe a bit higher than expected by some models out there, and so that's one piece. And then the other one is just wanted to reiterate that, I mean, it's very clearly an extraordinary quarter from a hiring perspective for the comments I made before, and so we're kind of clearly seeing that. But at the same time, I wouldn't say that this is clearly a new run rate for us or anything like that. It just happened that most of these kind of college students end up landing in Q3, and we have the result of a banner year from a hiring perspective, all through -- it takes a year to hire them all, and then they come into this quarter. So that's really the kind of the 2 big elements that I've actually flowed, Anthony, to our P&L this quarter. I'll let Omid answer the YouTube question.",292

So again, we have a very, very partnership-minded organization here and company as a whole, so we view MCNs as -- or I mean, organizations that are really going to help develop a great content, support the creators on YouTube.

Patrick, is CapEx still driven by real estate and construction? And if yes, can you explain in a bit more detail what changed about 18 months ago in the way you acquired real estate and build to drive the inflection in capital intensity that we have seen? It looks like you operated for more than 10 years in 1 way, and then there was a shift that has led to this massive inflection. So what happened there? Secondly, do you think that Google again is adopted or inspired to being adopted by a large enough number of important mobile apps for you to be competitive in the long term? When it comes to offering mobile targeting attribution? And can you give us an update on the developer adoption of deep linking?",135

So I can certainly take the first and let Omid answer the second. I've made that comment before in the prior quarter, Carlos. The CapEx intensity and our CapEx program has been built by a combination of, as I mentioned in previous quarter, catching up when we were running too hot in terms of tightening of capacity. And so in one side, I'm very happy that when we kind of really talk our utilization rates. On the other side, it creates a lot of operational issues, and that led us to believe that, in fact, investing ahead of the curve was actually a strategic imperative for us to make sure that if we have the extra capacity, we will grow into it. And I mean, the difference between, certainly, on the data center side, right, data center construction and machines and you'll have noticed that this quarter again, the priority is if you look at the nomenclature I gave, right, construction of data center is the primary. So it is the core infrastructures. It's groundbreaking. It's -- and it is setting up the core infrastructures. And machine was the second one for this quarter, but you'll notice that it flip flops real estate. In the case of the real estate, I mean, you -- we have been investing for our campus and otherwise. When we see -- when we hit kind of minimum scale, we need to kind of make investments in real estate and again, with an eye of looking for the long term rather than just filling at least for the next 12 months or 24 months because once you kind of -- if you decide you're going to grow in a place, then you need the capacity for multi-years. So all of these factors have actually kind of been the driver for the shift in capital intensity that you've seen over the last 18 months. So that's basically the explanation, Carlos. I will -- I'll let Omid kind of jump on the second question about the mobile question.",342

So the AdMob network reaches 900 million unique devices per month, and our own apps are hugely popular, Gmail, Maps, Google App and YouTube. And our focus is also is helping developers generate app downloads and reengagement with users who've already downloaded their apps as I mentioned in my remarks earlier, and we're really helping drive hundreds of millions of app downloads through app promotion products. Again, to go here is that you just search and not worry about where the answer is. Is it on a webpage or an app? And we've been in this game for a while. 4 years ago, we acquired AdMob and have continued to invest in this space heavily. And this quarter, we launched the next generation of these app promotion ads across Google Search, Google Display Network and YouTube. So we're really focused on this area to help the developers and our users.",153

First, you talked about estimated conversions and seeing a 15% increase there. Can you just talk about whether you think that's actually leading to more spend at this point from advertisers? And then, secondly, are you seeing mobile like-for-like pricing improvements at this point? And what gives you the confidence in mobile closing the gap with desktop over time?",63

Both are really good questions, are related, really. I think the way this is going to play out is that, I think, advertisers are going to, with these tools, be able to just understand conversions better. Where is it happening? And then the dynamics of how this changes is all the way back to adjusting bids and then paying attention to where the conversions are coming from. So again, I think just to maybe highlight some examples for you, we have a fashion retailer, Express, who is an early tester who found that the overall return on their ad spend doubled when offline sales were included in the online advertising results. So we're just continuing to invest here and get this right. It is too early to figure out the impact exactly on revenue, but we expect the Estimated Total Conversions to help the advertisers fully measure this and ultimately adjust their bidding and just get much more sophisticated in these measurements. I hope that answers.",168

But clearly, cloud is an area that is kind of booming, right? We know that the long-term trends are very clear for us, which is the vast majority of businesses, everybody's moving their infrastructures to the cloud. So -- and it is an area where we have fundamentally great assets to contribute to this industry, both in terms of the flexibility, the cost structure, the technology, and that's why we're investing heavily in there. We're seeing great progress from adoption perspective, signing up new customers. And from a CapEx, obviously, you need to kind of -- that's one of them that, as I mentioned on the CapEx story with Carlos a few minutes ago, if you do take off, right, and you really get the kind of customer adoption that you expect, if you don't have the capacity in place, I mean, it can have a really important kind of differential in your success. So there is one that we're keeping a pretty close eye on from a CapEx perspective and making sure that we have the option value. On the third question was mobile that have network clicks. So yes, I mean, clicks and CPCs, I mean, always fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. It just happens that we've made some -- as I mentioned, made some changes this quarter that improved our mobile pricing while impacting low-quality clicks. So sometimes -- and sometimes, it goes -- if you think of a long-term trend, right, in the mobile sector, a piece of our product, right, sometimes you kind of put a new change in the network, and it creates a lot of clicks for it, but then the CPCs are much lower and then you -- if it doesn't actually create something that's really good for the user, you need to kind of pull back on it, and that's what you've heard, for example, on our -- parallel to the AFS business. So it's kind of constantly fluctuating. What's really important to look at is really the combined volume and pricing growth. And so for us, it's very clear that we're doing some great work in this area, and monetization and aggregate is doing very well. And that's really what we're -- yes, look on a quarter-to-quarter basis, don't panic about little movements here and there. You'd look at the fundamental trends, and that's where we're very pleased. Now did you have a first -- was there a first question that I missed, Mark?",441

Going back to Estimated Total Conversions. Wondering if we could expect Adometry to be integrated into the DoubleClick platform and how that may or may not work with the Estimated Total Conversions tool. And then finally, wondering if you could comment on your work around coming up with a solution that reduces the dependence upon cookies and perhaps, introduces across platform, across device, ID for Google and what impact that could have on the market.",78

I think -- again, it's early for us to call it Adometry. It's a great attribution solution, and we've been investing in ad tools for a long time now and trying to just get this right by all the innovation that's happening within Google and just really understanding the impact of these usage models and between the mobile devices and desktop. And so I think we're going to look at everything that's available out there, both what we're developing and partners out there that we could partner with and continue to invest here. It's going to take us, I think, a while, just like we experienced before with Search, to get this right and have that real end-to-end solution for marketers and publishers. And so I think you'll see a lot of innovation in this space, what Facebook recently announced is another approach, and we're going to study that and just figure out what is the right -- what set of offerings from us. So I guess, unfortunately, I can't give you a very specific answer here, but I think what you'll see from us is pay huge amount of attention here to make the measurements and see the impact and then offer a full suite to our customers.",210

The first was a follow-up on Google Shopping Express. I mean, just wondering, when you think about what Amazon is doing with same-day delivery, they're obviously building these fulfillment centers themselves, which theoretically should give them scale over time. I'm wondering if you could share with us how you see this evolving for Google over time. And then follow-up question would just be related to your comments about payments. And I'm just wondering how critical is it for Google itself to solve the payment friction that you're seeing with kind of a ubiquitous digital wallet. Or would you be fine with a third party doing so for the Android platform?",114

I'll take the first and then let Omid answer the second. Clearly, Google Shopping Express, I mean, there is an issue of scale, and it's a combination of an issue of scale, tools and efficiency. I mean, that's how you, if you think, over time, end up with a product that you can deliver within kind of hours at the right value and where you can make money. So it's not only about -- I mean, yes, for efficiencies, you need centralization. You need a bunch of distribution tools that actually work. We're clearly focused on that as well. I mean, it is part of the business case that we're building, but you need more than that, right. There's a lot of other elements as well. So clearly, focused like our competitors would be. And our announcements today, again, right, kind of our -- was it yesterday? Yesterday's announcements on Shopping Express kind of tell you that we are investing both for the 3 new cities, kind of give you a hint of, yes, it's about scale. So clearly, we're focused on that.",186

And Heather, on the Wallet question, I think, again, we're going to continue to be open here. So we are trying to get it right and innovating on multiple fronts as I mentioned earlier, and if partnering makes sense, we'll take a look at it as well. So -- and the goal is here really to provide this very seamless experience for the users and then get the merchant adoption and hopefully, get this right. I am certainly delighted every time I use this and it works. And I think if we can all get the ecosystem right and there are multiple players in it and partnerships that are making it happen, we're definitely open to that.",118

So essentially, Google Play's doing great, and everybody wants to kind of be part of this -- this answer. And so for our carriers, I mean, they're really done on a one-by-one basis, so the real question is what's the win-win, and so they're all done individually. We have great, great partnerships with many carriers that actually fuel this, and we're -- including carrier billing. So all this, actually, is just a very, very positive ecosystem for us, and so we're totally thrilled to have these partnerships, and we expect to continue to do so.",100

You mentioned Google Preferred in your comments. Any color on further expanding the upfront process with the ad agencies? Basically, do you anticipate that upwards of 5% to 10% of your top inventory could actually be set aside for Preferred longer term? And then, just given the shift of offline TV dollars to online, as you've mentioned, any comments on political specifically or other new categories more aggressively moving onto YouTube?",79

So we secured upfront commitments from 5 top agencies, IPG, OMD, Digitas, Carat, SMG and some major brands like General Motors and Coca-Cola, and we were actually very, very pleased with how Google Preferred was experienced and adopted. And so I think we're going to definitely continue working on this. And also, if you look at our history, we're very used to it, this selling model that was all about performance. And then, as we added properties like YouTube and brand and mobile, we're just getting -- more and more now gaining a better understanding of how to work in this upfront process, for example, to offer the marketers this incredible asset that we have in YouTube and in our network. So we're going to just continue getting better at -- on the product side, figure out how to package this inventory better and then the tools that are needed and then on the selling side, just get better at also working with the agencies and our advertisers and marketers to get this type of selling right. And on the political vertical, I think clients love to use our products as part of their campaigns for federal local state campaigns, and it is really a great area for us. We have actually a political sales team that's focused on it, so I think you'll see more of that effort from us.",235

Jamie, that's all the time we have, so if you don't mind, I'd just like to close by reiterating what Omid said a bit earlier. This quarter was a great quarter with great momentum again. And I just wanted to thank all the great efforts of our Googlers around the world who make -- I mean, make us look good on this call because of their fantastic efforts. So with that, Jamie, I'll let you close the call, and have a happy Q4, everyone.",86
