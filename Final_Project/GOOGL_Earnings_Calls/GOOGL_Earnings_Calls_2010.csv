Good afternoon, everyone. It's Patrick Pichette speaking. Thank you for joining us. Starting the new year provides us with a great opportunity to tune and streamline our quarterly earnings communications. So as a result, we have today for you a new format for the call. First, the two calls we had last year will be merged into a single call going forward and slightly longer for the Q&A. Second, Eric will not be joining us going forward, so I'll be leading the call.In the new format, Jonathan Rosenberg and I will review the quarter with prepared remarks and then Nikesh Arora, our Head of Global Sales and Operation will be joining us for Q&A. Unfortunately today, Jonathan couldn't be with us, but however, what we have is Jeff Huber, the Senior Vice President of Engineering for ads and Susan Wojcicki, our Vice President for Advertising Products, sitting in for Jonathan. So here we go.Let me start by giving you some high-level thoughts about our situation in Google before I go into the details of our Q1 performance. As we enter 2010, it's really clear that the digital economy, it continues to grow rapidly. And at Google, our users and advertisers, all continue to benefit from this profound and positive trend.Our Q1 results are simply a reflection of these trends and this really fuels our optimism, as we continue to invest in innovation for the long run. Consequently, we are continuing to invest heavily in people, products and acquisitions. So you see this already in our results for Q1 on people. We've already stepped up hiring, which is evident, obviously with the numbers presented. And we expect to continue hiring aggressively through the year. We have a strong pipeline of candidates, primarily focused on engineering and sales. And we're onboarding them to fuel our growth agenda as fast as possible.On product, we continue to really push the envelope on two fronts. First, we're intensely focused on user experience. Our continued success really depends on delighting users with differentiated products that really inspire, think of Google Goggles, for example. Second, we're continuing to improve our Ads business to show the right ad, in the right format, to the right person at the right time, all this regardless of device. Susan and Jeff will really each cover each of -- in the coming minutes, both of these sections. Finally acquisition. We've been very active this far, so far this year and we have a strong M&A pipeline in place. It's really designed to build on our existing focus areas and to bring new talent and new technology to Google, feeding our entrepreneurial spirit. It really matters to us. So in sum, we continue to be incredibly excited by the opportunities in front of us, and in consequence, we should expect to see continued investments in each of these areas.On the business front, Q1 was really a strong quarter. The healthy momentum from Q4 and the general economic recovery has simply continued, resulting in a very positive start to the new year for us. Large advertisers have come back in force versus last year, reflecting really an improved economy and a few really key important trends. So for example, it's clear now that our offerings are much broader in scope. And by this I mean, the offer is highly measurable but also integrated campaigns across Search, Display and Mobile. As a result, our conversation with advertisers, they're becoming more and more strategic because of this integration. And you can see this in our results in our performance.By this I mean, we perform well across every major product area including Search, Display, Mobile and Enterprise in Q1, running on all cylinders. So Search, google.com was very strong. Great performance across all geographies and all major verticals, including retail, travel, local, technology and finance. Growth in Display was also really strong. Q4 momentum continued across all regions, product and channels. The Google Content Network was strong, driven by increased demand in consumer package goods and entertainment. The Ad Exchanges is also gaining great traction as we move all the buyers and sellers into the latest version of the platform. And finally, we saw very impressive growth on YouTube, with several exciting new content deals signed.Mobile, our third access, another great very important area for Google, is also growing very nicely. Benefiting from both the continued growth in the smartphone volumes and Internet user and usage on this iHand mobile devices. Finally Enterprise, recently launched a host of successful integrations, including a large deployment, for example, KLM, just one example among many. All this great performance is reflected in our financial results and our trajectories. So I'll now, if you'll allow me, go through our results quickly.So financially, gross revenue grew 23% year-over-year to $6.8 billion. Google website's revenue grew up 20% year-over-year to $4.4 billion with strength, as I mentioned across all major geographies and vertical. Our AdSense revenue was up 24% year-over-year to $2 billion, reflecting a gain of continued strength in the Google content network, an important part of our Display business. Other revenue was also up 68% year-over-year to $300 million and that includes the revenue from the sales of Nexus One product. Global aggregate Paid Click growth remain healthy, up 15% year-over-year and up 5% quarter-over-quarter. Aggregate Cost-Per-Click growth was up 7% year-over-year, but down 4% quarter-over-quarter.You should know that FX had a positive impact on the year-over-year on CPC growth and also a negative impact on quarter-over-quarter. A lot of movement in FX year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Remember too that this is an aggregate number, which includes both google.com, but also the AdSense properties.Turning to our geographic performance. Revenue from the U.S. was up 22% year-over-year to $3.2 billion. In our earning slides, which you'll find on our Investor Relations website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and the rest of world, to show the impact of FX and the benefits from our hedging programs. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations. International revenue accounted for 53% of our total revenue or $3.6 billion, up 24% year-over-year, which includes $10 million of benefits from our hedging programs. And this is a big difference compared to $154 million of benefits in Q1 of last year. Using fixed exchange rates, our international revenue would have been roughly $242 million lower year-over-year. Finally, the U.K. was up 15% year-over-year to $842 million. So very strong performance right across the board on the revenue.Let me turn to expenses for a moment. Traffic acquisition costs were $1.7 billion, or 26% of total advertising revenue. The other cost of revenue was $741 million, including stock-based compensation of $6 million, which also are expenses related to the sale of Nexus One. Finally, all operating expenses total $1.8 billion, including approximately $285 million of stock-based compensation. The increase year-over-year in OpEx was primarily due to increases in payroll and advertising and promotion expense. As a result of all these, our non-GAAP operating profit, which does exclude stock-based compensation increased to $2.8 billion in Q1, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 41%, up approximately 180 basis point year-over-year. Headcount was up 800 approximately versus Q4 of last year, ending the quarter with approximately 20,600 full-time employees. Finally, our effective tax rate, 22% for Q1. For a minute let me turn to cash management. Other income and expenses was $18 million for Q1, which include great progress in our portfolio management performance, but also largely offset by the timing and accounting impact of hedging expenses associated with the FASB 133. For more detail on OI&E, again please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website.So all of this turns out into operating cash flow, which was very strong at $2.6 billion. CapEx for the quarter $239 million, again primarily related to our data center operations. As a reminder, CapEx is lumpy from quarter-to-quarter depending on when we're able to make these investments. Free cash flow finished the quarter with a strong $2.3 billion. So in summary, we're very pleased with the performance in Q1 across revenue, margins and cash flow. As a result, we are very optimistic and therefore pushing ahead with significant investments as I outlined to you a few moments ago. Finally, let me remind you as I do every year at this time, that our revenue typically exhibits some seasonality between Q1, Q2 and Q3 because of the coming summer months. With that, and before we open it up to questions, we'll have Susan and Jeff cover their comments and then we'll come back to Q&A. Thank you, and I'll turn it to Susan.",1450

I'd like to take this opportunity today to talk about some of the big areas of investment in our Advertising business, Search, Display and Mobile, and how they are going so far. We see a lot of opportunity to innovate in these categories and to make the ads better and more useful. As we expand to new kinds inventory beyond Search, our goal is to enable high-performance, cross-media campaigns from within AdWords. Let me start with Search. Starting about a year ago, we asked ourselves why do Search ads just have to be text links. In organic search, the right result might be a video, a book or an update from a social network. We call this Universal Search. But ads are also information. They are commercial information and in many cases, it may be more useful to the user and the advertiser if we show a video or a picture or a product in the ad.For example, if you search on the query HP All-in-One Printer, some of the ads now include pictures of HP printers, prices and where you can buy them. Or if you're looking for a movie and you search on The Losers, the ad may give you the option to watch the movie trailer right within the ad. Other ads, which we call Sitelinks, enable advertisers to drive traffic to specific parts of their site. The query, Toys ""R"" Us, is a good example of this, with links to products the retailer is promoting, such as Nerf toy specials or pre-ordering Barbies. The idea is to make the ads more useful and therefore higher performing. And so far, they're doing very well. Clickthrough rates on Sitelinks, for example, are up as much as 30% to 40%.We also want to give advertisers more data and insight into their campaigns and customers. Users usually go through a progression of searches, and can interact with a number of ads before actually buying the product. For example, a user may search and click on ads first for digital camera, and then on Canon, before actually clicking on an ad for the PowerShot S90 and buying the camera. To help use advertisers optimize for this behavior, we launched a new reporting feature this quarter, called the Search Funnel, which tells advertisers about those earlier searches and the ads the users interacted with earlier in the buying process. By thinking about the right portfolio of keywords, advertisers can maximize their conversion.Moving on to our Display business, we've seen very strong momentum. We're investing heavily in three different areas: Our platform, which includes the DoubleClick suite of products, our Ad Exchange, and our Content Network in YouTube. We're bringing the performance efficiency and measurability to the Display world like we did with Search, which we believe can overall grow the Display market and benefit everyone.On the platform side this quarter, we launched the largest Google and DoubleClick integration to date. A new version of DoubleClick for publishers, which has been rewritten on Google technologies. The new version gives publishers more data and better tools to manage and maximize their returns directly and indirectly sold ad space.We're also doubling down on our new Ad Exchange, the second pillar in our Display strategy. It's ramping nicely and publishers and advertisers are getting great results. Some publishers are increasing their yields by as much as 130% when compared to ads sold directly to ad networks. One of the key features that we're very excited about on the new Exchange is realtime bidding, which enables advertisers to bid on an impression-by-impression basis, using their own data. By bringing this level of efficiency to Display advertising buying, everyone wins.And third, on the Content Network, we've introduced a number of new features in the past year. It's a long list. Interspace advertising, frequency capping above-the-fold targeting, new measurement tools and many new formats among other features. Combined, they create a compelling platform for Display advertisers to reach users globally. This quarter, we added a new feature that I'd like to talk about called remarketing. Remarketing enables advertisers to show adds to users who have visited their website or the YouTube or their YouTube channel. So if you're shopping around for a vacation destination, or go to one resort site and then leave, when you visit another site in our network, that resort could show you an ad with a discount coupon. As a user, this means I can get a much more compelling ad. As an advertiser, it's an opportunity to connect with interested users. Mobile is also doing very well. This will be an increasingly important form of advertising as users transition to smartphones with full browsers. We want to make it easy for advertisers to extend their existing campaigns to Mobile rather than having to start from scratch. When advertisers run on Desktop and Mobile, we enable them to separate their campaign stats by Desktop or Mobile, to understand their Mobile performance. Many of them are surprised by how much Mobile activity they have received. Based on this information, they can decide how to customize their Mobile campaigns going forward. We also rolled out new formats and targeting options, specific for Mobile. This quarter, we launched a Click-to-Call feature that automatically puts a phone number in the ad that's running on a smartphone. So if you're looking for auto insurance and do that query from your Android or iPhone, the ads will include a number to call. Not surprisingly, this has increased clickthrough, or should I say, callthrough. I'm just scratching the surface of all the innovations our Ad team is working on, but I have to hand it over to Jeff now. Thank you.",951
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2010",2010-04-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,4500.0,56337.0,4244861.0,Presenter Speech,Jeffrey Huber,,Executives,5,"Thanks, Susan. Across all our products, we pushed to push ourselves to continually innovate. We believe in open platforms and encourage everyone else to push innovation too. A reference in Mobile are a great example of this at work. Eric Schmidt mentioned in his speech at the Mobile World conference in Barcelona in February, that we're taking a Mobile first approach to most everything we do. That means doing things that take advantage of the unique characteristics of Mobile smartphones. One of those is that your smartphone knows where you are, your location. So this quarter, we launched a feature called Near Me Now that essentially turns your location into the search query. If you go to google.com from a smartphone, you'll see the Near Me Now link, right under the search box. Click on it to see restaurants, cafés, shops, gas stations, ATMs and other things of interest or closest to you. Another common use case is when you're searching for something at home and then want to find it again when you're out and about. Our new Stars in Search feature helps out there. You do a search, say for a chili recipe, and when you find a great result, you click on the star next to it. Later, when you're at the grocery store to pick up the ingredients, you just repeat the search with your smartphone, which is easy to do with the Suggest feature. Just type the first character or two, the query will pop up or with Voice Search, which is increasingly ubiquitous across the platforms and that Starred result shows right up at the top.The same Starred results now work on Maps too. Do a search at home or work, like on an address or for a restaurant, click a star next to the right result and that star shows up in your Map on a smartphone, making it easy to get directions or get more information about it. These are small features in some ways, but a big innovation in how smartphones can integrate into your everyday life.Our open platforms, Android and Chrome, are gaining a lot of momentum. Android is now powering 34 devices, which is up 70% quarter-over-quarter from 12 different OEMs and over 60,000 Android devices are sold and activated everyday. Our whole mantra with Android is open. First, the Android OS itself is open for partners to modify and extend on their own. Then the Android Market for apps is open for all developers, which is driving a lot of growth and great apps. We're now at over 38,000 apps, up 70% quarter-over-quarter. The net effect is to make web-ready smartphones more widely available. It is helping drive a lot of Mobile search and apps usage. Chrome is also going really well, mostly driven by its technical innovations and performance in its security relative to other browsers. The new Chrome feature we launched just a couple of weeks ago, helped to address language as a barrier to web use around the world. Chrome can now automatically translate any page you're viewing into any one of 52 different languages. So if you're an English speaker and want to read the local news in Paris, you can go to lemonde.fr and Chrome will offer to translate the page for you. Update has been great. We're already translating over 60 million pages per day. If we can help knock down the language barrier through innovative features like this, the web becomes a lot more accessible and useful for everyone around the world.Our latest open ecosystem effort is the Apps Marketplace for Google Apps. Many of our enterprise customers want to move more of their operations to the cloud, including applications that Google doesn't offer like CRM, accounting, project management, workflow automation, HR, the list goes on. The Apps Marketplace has had thousands of enterprise apps purchased and installs ready, all integrated with the Google Apps experience.Finally, we're looking forward to our Google I/O Developer Conference coming up in May. I/O sold out in just a few days, as developers know that in the event's short history, we've used it to announce some pretty amazing things, in addition to covering a huge amount of content on how they can innovate with and leverage Google's open platforms. When you open up the web, and unleash the passion and innovation of thousands and thousands of developers, great things happen.Thanks for your time. Back to Patrick.",741

And then second question is, with regard to domestic and international revenue, it's great that your domestic revenue is growing almost as fast now as your international revenue, but it's also a little bit surprising to me. Is that primarily because you've got more new activities like Nexus One contributing domestically than internationally, or does that reflect a more V-shaped recovery domestically than internationally?",94

On the first, it's because when we bought onto [ph], what we wanted to do is -- it was a shared transaction, you will remember.

We are seeing a better recovery in the domestic market, definitely. If you look at the comps from last year, clearly the numbers look much better. We are seeing tremendous activity from our large advertisers who are coming back in droves and actually reconfirming their faith in Search Advertising, such all working. Plus many of product innovation start in the U.S., which allows us to drive those revenues faster in the U.S. Having said that, internationally, our revenues did not take as material a dip, as relative to the U.S. So clearly, the comps are much stronger on the international side. And it is a basket of many, many countries. So we're seeing recovery in some of the major markets. Some of the markets are still not on that curve of recovery as we're seeing in some of the more mature, larger markets in Europe.",160

I'll give a couple of comments about the CPCs. So I think there are a number of trends that we see. I think it's important to remember, first of all, that the CPC and the numbers that we released are an aggregate number. And so there are a couple of things happening. One of them has to do with the growth rates of the different regions. And CPCs being different in the different regions. The second thing, which I believe is a long-term positive for Google, but may be reflected in the CPC number here, is that we are releasing a lot of tools to enable advertisers to try to find more, what I'll call long-tail keywords. So keywords that they might not have been bidding on beforehand and that they might not be the more competitive lines. And so as a result, the CPCs may vary. And we believe long term, that's good because we're actually selling more keywords and the auctions are becoming more competitive, but it may change the mix.",174

Eric's everywhere. Eric is in every public -- I mean, I've seen him in Abu Dhabi and then fly across to DC the next day. He's everywhere. So the fact that we've just decided to streamline our process just for earnings, doesn't mean that Eric is not available and he is clearly leading as spokesperson of the strategy of the company. So it's very transparent as we were. So on that point, it was just simply an issue of kind of streamlining and making, you know, more focused on financial results for this call. You shouldn't read anymore or less than that in this decision. On the 800 people, we have talked about, ever since last summer, that we're trying to ramp up of our machine to hire back, specifically in engineering, specifically in the support of sales, where we see great opportunities. And it takes a couple of quarters to ramp up the machine so that we get levels that we want. So we're very pleased with hiring we've done. The bar at Google, let me re-emphasize that, has not changed. It is incredibly high. But we're very pleased of the onboarding that we've seen this quarter, and now that this infrastructure's in place, you can expect us to continue to invest heavily in this form. And we have so many projects that we would love to have more engineers right now that we'd like to fuel our growth, that it is really paramount to us to continue to focus on it. On the Apple, maybe Jeff can comment.",269

One, questions about Paid Clicks growth rate. So considering that Mobile is growing significantly faster and some of the international countries growing significantly faster, Paid Clicks growth rate, 15%, is it fair to assume that the domestic Paid Clicks growth rate has decelerated significantly? And can you give us some color how should we think about the domestic Paid Clicks growth rate? And second question is more of a long-term threat to Google. If we look at third-party data, it seems like, that Facebook and other social networking sites, while still very low, becoming a bigger part. They're growing significantly faster as a traffic source to a lot of your big customers like eBay.

I'll comment on the Paid Click growth. Overall, I think we've been very happy with the number and the growth that we've seen. And it's a result of a number of things. Certainly, the advertisers coming back, some of the largest advertisers spending more money on Google, as well as the growth across the board in all regions. But we've also, some of the new ad formats that I spoke about, have brought more clicks as to advertisers, because they're coming up with formats that are more compelling for users and offering information that's very useful for the users onboard and that's causing a lot of growth in Paid Clicks.",111

Do you feel better about a trajectory of year-over-year growth exiting the quarter than you did entering the quarter? And then secondly, on marketing spend, I think it's up 48% year-over-year, excluding stock based comp, always thought of you as more of a technology-driven company.

If you look at -- we spend marketing dollars to go and acquire advertisers on our B2B side. We spend marketing dollars to promote various products. But it's very clear for us to understand, for each dollar we spend, what return we get in terms of long-term value to each customer that is acquired for different products, which create additional monetization across our property. So you can expect us to spend marketing dollars as and when we see it is relevant for our long-term strategy, and have lots of more uses for our products and lots for Advertising.",115

It's not moving that much. And what you see is a shift between -- regular G&A is actually going down, which is a good news. And you're seeing, if we have an incremental dollar and a great -- as Nikesh said, good ROI-based, I mean, we should take the opportunity on that. As it relates to your first question on, we don't get comments. I mean, we had such a crisis in the last 18 months. Back then, it may have made sense to give some color about quarters.

Let me comment on China. We've explained to people that the revenue numbers for China were kind of immaterial to the financial performance of the company in previous blogs and communications. The bottom line though on China is, this was a tough situation where we really believed we've made the right decision. Google stands for really important values like openness, user choice, protection of privacy and these are, in a company that remains true to its values, that's what you do. You make a decision that is driven by those values. Having said that, what we've announced a few weeks ago, right, or a few days ago, clearly has us staying in China. We have just changed our strategy and adapted our strategy, but our engineering force remains in China and we'll continue to develop great products. We continue to keep our salesforce in place, because there's still an export market. And then, a lot of opportunities in China for sales. And what they've done is move back to Hong Kong for Search, where we can operate uncensored.

Look, the case for AdMob is there's overwhelming evidence that the mobile advertising industry, both in terms of platforms and providers, is nascent. It's incredibly competitive. It didn't exist 24 months ago. There's dozens of ad networks out there and even last week, you may have heard that there was an announcement from Apple that they were starting their own. I mean, it is incredibly competitive and that's why we believe that, actually, we're very positive about making this transaction happen. The case is on our side.

I will say that Google does have a monetization product for monetizing Mobile applications, AdSense for Mobile applications and that is a product that we are investing in, and we have seen good growth with that one. But I just want to reiterate the point that Patrick said which is that we see this as a very new and nascent market. It's less than two years old and there's a lot of competition in this market. So we are continuing to work with the FTC on AdMob. Your other comment was about ad applications versus web. And Google is investing and believe that HTML5 has the opportunity to enable a lot richer applications on the web.

And it's really important to remember that this is also an aggregate number across all of our businesses. And so, as we saw advertisers come back and start spending again, driven by a lot of our largest advertisers really increasing their spend, as well as Google and the Ads team bringing a lot of new types of products to market in terms of the Sitelinks product, which had not just one place to click, but multiple places to click. We started seeing advertisers have higher click throughs. And so, all of those higher click throughs that I talked about do manifest themselves in terms of aggregate paid click number. Mobile is a component of many different types of inventory that Google is expanding to, to increase the overall paid click number.",145

So we're very disciplined. This place continues to be frugal in many ways. On the other side, right, we are hiring. We are hiring and it's obviously lumpy. So the point is like we are, every time I could find another great engineer to add to the Chrome OS platform, I'm going to hire them. We're going to hire them. Google needs them.

Having said that, as I mentioned, there are parts of the rest of the world which are continuing to perform really well for us. Places like Brazil, which we talked about last quarter, places like Russia, et cetera, continue to perform well. There are some parts of the European economy, as you're aware, which are still undergoing some direction like Greece, where clearly, you can't expecting us to be performing too well. So there are pockets of strong performance in the rest of the world. They are pretty much in line with our expectation in terms of trends we're seeing, which are dependent on broadband penetration, dependent on the e-commerce activity, dependent of this small business's adoption to the Internet.

So on the cost-per-click decline, 4% sequentially. By our math, if you exclude forex, the decline was probably closer to 2.5%. And just want to try to rank order the drivers of the sequential decline, and our thinking is, it's Forex who's the number one driver of the decline. The second was the geographic mix, which is an ongoing issue, was the second driver. Third was related to tools Susan spoke to find more of long tail keywords which, over time, should drive CPCs higher or certainly assist CPCs. Before, it was the slower economic recovery in Europe versus the U.S., and your comment about Greece, related to that. And fifth was another Susan comment, the product innovations rollout in the U.S. first which, over time, is a rollout the non-U.S. market should help CPCs outside U.S. One you didn't really mention was Mobile, which is probably a factor as well. Is that the right laundry list of drivers of a sequential CPC decline and the right list in the right order in your view, Patrick?",184

And I can tell you that the FX, anybody, because it's kind of public information on FX, it is a big contributor to that 4%. The other last element of the equation is always the mix between Google properties versus the partner properties, which also has -- and especially in the case of International, the U.K. So you have all the elements of what to talked about, plus you have to look at the mix between dot com properties versus the partner properties.

I mean, it's a combination of the core businesses is strong and growing. So we're continuing to invest in that. Susan went through, in her section, a lot of the innovations and new products that we've introduced in the core Search and Display Ads business. Some of the other or major areas of engineering investment are some of the things that I cited. The open platforms, Android and Chrome, are growing very quickly and having a big impact.

As Jeff mentioned, on the business side, we are continuing to add resources selectively in Search, as we see the market continue to grow, as well as deploying it in markets where we see higher growth, as I mentioned earlier. In addition to that, we are putting significant amount of resources in our Display space as the product team continues to announce our Display offering and give us more features. And that will continue to mean [ph] this will be our focus for us throughout the year going forward. In terms of what we're seeing from marketers, I think the pullback we had seen about six to nine months ago is all gone. What has also happened in parallel, I continue to see tremendous amounts of capability building on the advertiser's side. As one of the challenges you always have, you can go to an advertiser, pitch them on a tremendous search campaign, however, they feel like we can lead the horse to the water but they still have trouble making it drink because their websites aren't fully capable of conducting the e-commerce transaction to the level they would like. Having said that, I've seen tremendous amounts of capability improvement in the last six to nine months across the majority of our mature markets, both the U.S., U.K., Germany, France, et cetera, which allows us to go in with bigger, more sort of larger campaigns to these guys. And they're beginning to understand that search is sort of a diminishing inventory. If you don't buy it today, it's not going to be there tomorrow. They have to be more willing to be flexible with their budget and be open, depending on what's going on. And they are very -- they are getting more and more sort of averse to the ways of search. So clearly, we're seeing them get more flexible with their dollars on the search side. They're beginning to understand the value of products like Susan mentioned, like remarketing and how to use the display networks effectively in sort of a CPC model and a CPM model, depending on which one to choose. So clearly, in the more mature markets, we're seeing awareness with the digital marketplace. We're seeing them sort of keep the search budgets open and we're seeing tremendous amounts of engagement from their side.",413

I think, to be fair, most of the small businesses are very, very good with their allocation. As you'd seen us a few quarters ago, we've seen a dip in large advertisers and none on small advertisers because they've always been ROI-driven. They totally understand how to bring in a search lead and how they can work that search lead into dollars. I think the -- but the challenge of the large advertisers has been, that is a proportion of their total advertising revenue, they have not been able to allocate a lot of dollars toward search.

One additional thing I would like to add is we definitely see an opportunity to move to taking a percentage of the conversion. In fact, we call this CPA, cost per acquisition. And one of the products that we've developed in this area that we are optimistic about is the product to ad product. And the way that works is the retailer just gives all of the information about their products, the price, the listing, description, et cetera. And then, Google actually does the targeting to decide where to show those ads. And then, we take a percentage when the product is actually purchased, when the user actually converts. And we do see that as an opportunity to really simplify the process for advertisers over time, and it's something we're investing in.",136

And the reason is because if we can make a percentage increase off of that very large business, that can have a significant impact. And so we had a, what we'll say, a modest quarter from ads quality. We had more than a dozen different launches that were significant across the board. And they certainly, over time, do play an important role in how they affect the metrics. The other thing I'd like to point out that I think also is really an important thing to look at with our overall business is something we've introduced in AdWords called Opportunity Center. An opportunity Center is a way for advertisers to know this is how many more clicks I should be getting or could be getting. And so, what we want to do is we want to give a lot more guidance to advertisers in terms of here are more keywords. They're very easy to add to your keyword list. We just launched this quarter, for example, bid suggestions to give them an understanding of what are the trade-offs between volume and CPCs, and where is the optimal place that they should be bidding, as well as budget suggestions. And because Opportunity Center is applied to the core business and to all of our advertisers, it can move the metrics over time in terms of getting more advertisers to buy keywords or increase their budgets or change their bids.",287

I wondered if you could give some color around the paid click and cost-per-click growth as it relates O&O and the network. Did paid clicks grow faster on the O&O network or on the AdSense network? And same for CPCs. And then, the second question is, there are a lot of innovative companies in the display space. Earlier, you mentioned remarketing. But generally speaking, there are others out there doing remarketing. So my question is, what are the top couple of things that Google is doing that's different in the area of display, particularly from a targeting standpoint that is meaningfully differentiated?",105

And yes, we definitely agree with you that the display is a really vibrant space and there's a lot of innovation that's happening right now in the display market. And I think ultimately, that innovation will enable the market as a whole to grow. But one of the things we have that's very unique from the remarketing perspective is users or advertisers can re-find users across the Content Network. And the Content Network, because we have so many publishers in our site and because we are a global network as well, it gives advertisers the opportunity to expand and find a lot more of those users across the network, and they probably can with a lot of other options. The other thing that we're doing from a targeting perspective is we're trying to make it really easy for advertisers to work with the existing interfaces. So right now, you can do remarketing within AdWords. So if you are an AdWords advertiser, you can do the remarketing there. If you are a DFA advertiser, then you can also do it from that perspective as well. The other thing that is important is from -- because you also asked about different types of targeting, we offer a number of different targetings that we think are unique. And one of them that were best known for is a contextual targeting. So the ability to actually figure out on a page what this page is about dynamically and then, serve an ad that's matched to that one specifically. Then, we also have placement targeting, where we give advertisers ability to choose where they want their ads to appear by actually selecting these are the sites and this is where I want them to appear. So the combination of all of these things together give advertisers a large number of options and we're thinking about how these things actually work together, so how do all of these different targeting mechanisms, how you combine them in a way to provide the best options for the advertisers and users.",358

We do see Sitelinks appearing mostly on navigational queries, where the user is looking for the brand name or the product category. But it is a very powerful tool and we believe there's still a lot of advertisers that are not using it today that would benefit from it.

So on the Mobile component, I'll say that we do give advertisers the option to -- the default is for advertisers to be on Search, Content and Mobile. And the reason we do that is because we want to make it as easy as possible for advertisers to get as much reach and reach as many potential users as possible. And we try to do the right thing for those advertisers. So the default is for them to be opted into both. However, we do offer the ability for advertisers to run a Mobile-only campaign. And under that Mobile-only campaign, we give them the option to target, for example, a specific Mobile OS. And we give a lot of options within the Mobile category, but I'd really think about that more for advertisers who have the capabilities and are advanced enough to know that these are the capabilities that they want to do and customize their campaign in order to make it worthwhile for them. On the format question, I will also say, we definitely have been introducing new formats into the display network and we've been really excited about that. In fact, we have a product called Display Ad Builder and Display Ad Builder is a way -- it's a template system that enables us to have lots of different ad formats and to add them very, very easily to our network. And from an advertiser's standpoint, they're very, very easy too, to actually start and get running. It's really just a click, click, click, and your ad can be running. Your display ad can be running. So because the Content Network, in the way that we choose which ad is actually run is an auction, what it displays mostly, if display is winning, then it's winning because it's actually a higher CPM ad. And so by bringing display ads to the mix with text, there's more competition and there's more variety. And so when it makes sense for a display ad to run, then it wins the auction. And because it won the auction, then it's bidding more than the existing text ad. And so over time, that can bring positive competition to the auction.",373

Look, our hedging program is really effective. I just want to remind everybody, for us, it's an insurance policy. It's an insurance policy for high volatility and specifically if the U.S. dollar strengthens dramatically. And so if you look at where the euro was a year ago versus where it was 90 days ago versus where it is now, I mean, and then, you go back to last year as we discussed, we had booked this time last year, big hedging revenues was mostly because we had such a massive appreciation of the U.S. dollar. So for us, very effective in finding the right sweet spot to make sure that we have the right coverage. And what we're caught with is the accounting rules which, some quarters like last quarter, had very little FAS 133 ruling pushing through the P&L and this quarter has a disproportionate amount. They don't represent our regular cost of hedging, so it creates a bit of kind of a fluctuation for you to model. But in the end, we're very happy with what we're getting out of it. In terms of the verticals, I'll turn it to Nikesh.",206

I also alluded to the capability building for e-commerce, which is primarily I was talking about the Retail vertical where we're seeing good strength. Travel is growing strong and is steady. Retail and Travel end up being some of our large verticals in the entire landscape. Having said that, I'm seeing good strength as well from CPG and Entertainment because that's where a lot of the display advertisers like to focus. Because those verticals, even though they're smaller numbers, those verticals aren't traditionally strong search verticals. But they definitely play in the display space and a lot of the display efforts have been targeted at those verticals.",117

The site revenue and network revenue were both flat sequentially. So I was wondering if you're suggesting that CPCs in the network are actually declining, if that was a contributor to the sequential decline in CPC. And then secondly, you've recently indicated the 50 million Chrome users, and I think Android smartphone shipments have been roughly 6 million per quarter run rate.

And we're continuing to work diligently on this. We're very excited about it. And we think that there's going to be a ton of innovation coming out of that.

Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements we make today may be considered forward-looking including statements regarding Google's future and investments and our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our business and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.
Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As Jane mentioned, Jonathan and I will begin with the prepared remarks but we also have Nikesh with us for the Q&A. So let me start you by giving some high-level thoughts about the quarter, and then we'll get into our detailed financial performance.
So overall, we're very pleased with our Q2 results. We experienced continued solid growth in our core, but also very strong growth in our emerging businesses year-over-year. Taking a step back, actually, these results reflect a few really important trends in the digital advertising. First, we are really taking notice that more and more traditional brand advertisers are embracing search and search advertising as a way to build their brands online. A case in point, P&G, it's one of the largest brand advertisers in the world, and it's now one of our top advertisers in the U.S.
Second, we see also a real trend in large advertising, focusing on highly measurable, but also integrated campaigns across Display, Mobile and Search. So as a result, we saw strength in every major product in Q3. Google.com was strong, with strong performance across major geographies and most major verticals, including CPG, retail, travel, et cetera. 
Our growth in Display was also very strong. Our continued focus in this product area is clearly generating results. Our Display Network, which includes YouTube, is growing very rapidly. The scale and quality of our network continues to increase, and we see increased demands  from traditional brand advertisers in that space as well. 
In addition, we made yet another significant stride in Display this week when we entered into a strategic agreement with Omnicom Media Group. We'll be working together with Omnicom to co-develop their exchange trading desk for the DoubleClick Ad Exchange in the coming years. YouTube, specifically, will continue to see very impressive growth as brand advertisers also consider it a must buy. For example, and as I mentioned moment ago, in Q2, we ran World Cup advertising campaigns for major advertisers over the likes of Coke, Visa, Nike, Sony, et cetera.
Finally, on YouTube, I think it's really worth noting that we're very pleased, of course, with the court's decision to rule in our favor in the Viacom case. But more important in this victory, it's not for us, but for the users and just the Web in general, specifically for all the blogs and the community forums across the Web that do rely on this user-generated content for sharing information and also for free expression. But we were very passionate about this issue at Google and so much so that we have made a significant investment of approximately $100 million to win this case. And once again, it just was the right thing to do, and we did it.
In Mobile, our revenue continues to grow as advertiser increasingly opt into their mobile-specific campaigns, and with the successful completion of the AdMob transaction in Q2, our business is gaining momentum. And so, we have a very competitive mobile advertising platform now. And, of course, underpinning our growth is the success of the Android platform itself, with over, as we announced a couple of weeks ago, 160,000 devices activated daily, that's two every second. And it creates an even larger base of data-centric smartphone users. Finally, enterprise had another good quarter with several high-profile deals including, for example, Virgin America. 
The world is simply moving into the cloud, and successful products do require investment. And that's why we're focusing our resources on products that, as you all know, leverage computer science to solve our big problems, offer great ROIs and very large growth opportunities.
For example, in Q2, we've added approximately 1,200 employees. That's obviously counting the acquisitions of AdMobs and the others. But the majority is done in Engineering and Sales and in the following product areas: Search monetization, Display, Mobile, Apps, all the next billion-dollar businesses that are growing incredibly rapidly, and that's why we're investing in them. Jonathan will give you more details about that in a moment. 
So now let me turn to our financial results. Growth revenue. Growth revenue grew 24% year-over-year to $6.8 billion. Our Google website's revenue was also up 23% year-over-year to $4.5 billion, with strength as I mentioned across most geographies and verticals. Our AdSense revenue was up 23% as well to $2.1 billion, reflecting our continued strength specifically in the Google Display Network. 
Other revenue was up also 39% year-over-year to $258 million and it includes the last quarter of revenue from the sale of Nexus One. As announced, we're discontinuing the direct-to-consumer channel in Q3 and as a result, beyond Q3, we won't recognize any revenue or costs associated with the sale of Nexus One. They are still being sold through various carrier partners, both in the U.S. and Europe [indiscernible]. 
Our global aggregate paid-per-click growth remain quite healthy, up 15% year-over-year and down 3% quarter-over-quarter due to the typical summer seasonality. Aggregate cost-per-click growth was up 4% year-over-year and 2% quarter-over-quarter. Note that the FX had a positive impact on our CPC growth year-over-year and a negative one quarter-over-quarter. Remember, too, that this is an aggregate number and it includes both google.com and our AdSense properties.
Turning now to our geographic performance. On a relative basis, the U.K. lagged a bit the global economic recovery, certainly relative to the U.S. and rest of the world, in which we're strong. Revenue from the U.S. was up 26% year-over-year to $3.3 billion and in our earnings slides, you'll find on our investor website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and rest of the world to show you the impact of the FX and benefits from our hedging programs. So please refer to these slides for the exact calculations.
International revenue accounted for 52% of our total revenue or $3.5 billion, was up 21% year-over-year, which includes $79 million benefits from our hedging programs. This is compared to $124 million of benefits in Q2 of last year. If we used fixed exchange rates, our international revenue would have been roughly $24 million lower year-over-year. The U.K. was up 8% year-over-year to $770 million.
Let me now turn to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $1.7 billion or 26% of our total advertising revenue. Our cost of revenue was $735 million, including stock-based compensation of $8 million and also expenses related to the sale of the Nexus One. And finally, all operating expenses totaled $2 billion, this is also including $301 million of stock-based compensation.
The increasing year-over-year OpEx is really primarily due to increases in payroll, professional services and advertising and promotional spend. So the result of all these, our non-GAAP operating profit, which excludes stock-based competition, increased to $2.7 billion in Q2, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 39%, essentially the same as last year.
As I mentioned already, our headcount was up approximately 1,200 heads versus Q1, ending the quarter with 21,805 full-time employees, and again, that reflects the acquisitions as well.
Our effective tax rate was up to 24% in Q2 versus 22% in Q1, essentially due to the mix of earnings between domestic and international subsidiary and the impact of our hedging program. 
Let me quickly turn to cash management. Other income and expense was 69% for Q2 -- that's $69 million, sorry, for Q2, which includes good progress in our portfolio management performance, although it was somewhat offset by the impact of our hedging expenses with FASB 133. For more detail on the OI&E, again, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website. 
In addition, we've announced today a $3 billion commercial paper program in a related credit facility. This, to us is an important step in establishing a more capital-efficient structure that'll provide us with low-cost working capital availability and flexibility. And it's also an excellent time to do it, given the historical low interest rates.
Operating cash flow was very strong at $2.1 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $476 million, again, primarily related to our data center operations. And as a reminder, we continue to make significant CapEx investments and they just turn out to be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. Our free cash flow therefore stands at $1.6 billion, in a very good position. 
So to take a step back from all these numbers, this is where we stand, we are very pleased with our Q2 performance, seeing growth across revenue, margin and cash flow. And it really paints a picture where we are very confident about our future. And that's why we continue to attract and hire among the best talents in the world to further invest in our growth agenda.
So with that, and before we open up to questions, let me turn to Jonathan for his comments. Jonathan?",1478
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 15, 2010",2010-07-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,4740.0,67984.0,5009669.0,Presenter Speech,Jonathan Rosenberg,,Executives,3,"Okay, well thanks, Patrick. So let me start with search. Search used to be pretty simple. You'd  enter a query and we'd return a bunch of links to websites. But now the Web is much, much more complicated. There's videos, there's books, there's music, there's news. Just about any type of media you can name is online. So the scale of the Web now is grand and it isn't slowing down. 
To keep pace, we migrated a whole lot of our index to a new infrastructure, which we call Caffeine. And Caffeine is basically a new way of updating our index. So now when we find a new web page or new information like a video or an image, we add them straight to the index without a delay. This means that the results that you get are a lot fresher and, in fact, they're about 50% fresher than before.
But then, once you get your results, you need tools to work with them to get to the right answer. And we've launched the new UI that has a bunch of options on the left-hand side to help you filter those results. I especially like the timeline feature, which I think is great when you're doing research and you want to see results from a particular time. So you can enter, say, oil spill, and click on timeline and 1969 and you can read all about the big Santa Barbara spill that led to the ban on offshore drilling in California. 
On the other hand, sometimes, you just want an answer. The query is effectively the result. And we're getting much better at knowing when that's the case and giving you what you need. So enter, for example, ""Barack Obama birthday"" and you'll see what I mean. You'll see his birthday listed August 4, 1961, and citations for the different sources where we got that information. All of these works and suggests to. Try typing ""capital, South Africa"". By the time you get to the first A in Africa, we tell you it's Pretoria. I put all these things out because the great things about features like these is most people, I think, don't even notice the changes. They just notice that they get their answers fast. I think I mentioned on the earnings call back in January that we're working on putting more wood behind pure arrows and search innovation is definitely one of those arrows. Our pace here is actually accelerating.
Voice Search added six languages. We launched spelling full-page replacement, suggests with spell correction and over 100 quality enhancements. So there's lots of stuff going on. In fact, there's so much that we're putting out a weekly blog post to document all the search improvements. But interestingly, as search gets better, it actually creates another huge challenge for us. The ads need to keep pace and get better, too. Otherwise, what would happen is people will click on relatively fewer ads and that would be bad.
So this dynamic where consumers are in control, holds for all types of media and not just search. It used to be consumers had to watch, see or listen to whatever the advertiser wanted to show, but now they don't. I think this is a fundamental shift for the advertising industry when people don't have to watch your ads, what do you do? Well, you have to make ads people actually want to watch. I was in Piazza San Marco in Venice a couple of weeks ago, and there was this huge billboard advertising a ski jacket. It was like 90 degrees and we were sweating in shorts and t-shirts. And I looked and I thought, what a waste of money. So I took a photo of the ad with my smartphone and I sent it to my team as proof there's lots of upside in improving ads. 
And this quarter, we made great progress on that upside. We added new ad formats and we focused even more on quality. The new formats let advertisers put more useful information into their ads, such as pictures of a product or a local address or a phone number. It turns out that when you're searching for something from your phone, you're much more likely to click on the ad when it has a phone address in it. This seems obvious, but now we actually know from the data that it's true. One of our customers, Carnival Cruises, increased bookings from mobile phones by 175% when they included Click-to-Call ads.
Lastly, on ads, I know you often ask about headroom and ads quality, and I'm thrilled to say we had one of our most productive quarters there in the last couple of years, over a dozen launches on search with a strong impact on revenue. We did things like put better ads on the second page of results where we realize that the ads weren't as good. And we also had over 20 quality improvements on the Google Display Network. Display, by the way, is going very well. One recent development is that we're working closely with our agency partners to help them move to what they call an audience buying model. And I think this is another fundamental shift in advertising where the ultimate goal is to designate a particular audience on our network, let's say, women between 18 and 35 who like basketball, and then we automatically target that audience for you. 
We're also making progress with features like remarketing, which we launched last quarter. Advertisers can reach people who have already visited their sites. Interest-based advertising, which we launched last year, is also working very well. And so is the DoubleClick Ad Exchange, which we launched in Q3. We've got several of the top ad networks on it and we're tracking some big buyers like agency holding companies. Advertisers really like the technology, which is real-time bidding and publishers like that it's open to all advertisers and ad networks who they want to work with.
We want to be open in everything we do. We believe open systems are better for the Web, they're better for competition, they're better for the user. This is not philanthropy. When the Web is better, more people use it more often and that means they search more often. Android is a leading example of this. As Patrick mentioned, we're now activating over 160,000 Android devices everyday. This is up from 65,000 last quarter. What's even more interesting there is that most of these devices are developed completely independently of Google. One of those is the Sprint EVO, which is actually my favorite phone right now. It has a big screen, it's got great video, it access a Wi-Fi hotspot for me, it has 4G bandwidth, at least when you're around Mountain View. The Android market is also open, of course, and now has over 70,000 Apps. That was around 30,000 in April.
As you look at these new Apps being created, you'll also realize that your mobile phone isn't alone anymore. It's actually connected to several million computers 24/7. This is letting us do things that we used to think were impossible. We just released a new version of Goggles that lets you take a picture of something in another language with your phone and it translates it for you. I actually use this a lot to read menus on my vacation in Italy. You literally don't have to guess what you're going to eat anymore. 
Or say you want to read about how the locals are celebrating their World Cup victory. Congratulations to Spain, by the way. Anyway, you just go to elpais.com and Chrome or Toolbar automatically translates it for you in a second. So cloud computing also means that enterprises can take advantage of these innovations. We just launched this feature where you can have, say, a PDF or the image of a scanned document. You can upload it to Docs and we'll convert it to text so you can edit it. You don't have to install any special software or anything. If you're a Google Apps customer, it's just there, and it works.
Of course, the cloud is pretty good for wasting time, too. I hope you played with our special Pac-Man Doodle. We put it up on May 22 to celebrate Pac-Man's 30th birthday and we estimate people spent 4.8 million hours playing it. If you missed it, go to google.com/pacman.

So remember, 1,200, just to give a bit of clarification, there is probably around 300 of those 1,200 that in estimate, that come from M&A. So really, kind of organically, if you think about it more like 900, which was not unlike last quarter. As I had mentioned in my core notes, Imran, the most of the headcount is in Engineering and Sales, and most of the headcount, like the vast majority is going to the four core areas of focus of the company, so they are about search and search monetization. They are going to Mobile and Android. They are going to Apps. And they are going to Display. We see so much momentum in each of these right now, but that's where the bulk of the resources are going because that's where the focus of the company is. On the CPC, Nikesh?",153

But you have to understand, the Mobile advertiser sees Mobile as a very different platform vis-à-vis the desktop advertiser. You see high CPCs where there are transactions that can be consummated on the Mobile, i.e., in digital entertainment. You don't see as high CPCs as when you're trying to get directions to a certain restaurant or a place where they might conduct commerce. So there's still some disparity between the CPCs in the desktop and Mobile and within Mobile, depending on the verticals there is disparity depending on the type of advertiser.",119

Android is not, in terms of cost, it's not material to the company. And not only that, but let me give you a further kind of proof point of the value of Android is, some of the key products that have been launched over the last few weeks and two months have not been developed by Google at all. I think that the last Android X or the Motorola, what is it? Droid X, has been developed by Motorola directly with Verizon and not involving any of the Google resources. So it's not a huge resource investment. It's a formidable return in that. What you have is the entire ecosystem exploding. And I'll let Jonathan give you really the sense of that one.

But I think the most important, the most obvious thing to think about from our perspective is what's the most popular app on these devices. The most popular app is a browser. And what do people do with the browser on these devices? They search an order of magnitude more than they have on any previous type of smartphones, which they'd had in years past. So the combination of people browsing on these smartphones connected on very, very fast networks and searching on them is basically the formula around how Google makes -- how Google succeeds.",123

I mean, really, the commercial paper is a fantastic opportunity for us, given the portfolio that we've put in place for our cash to actually have the working capital flexibility around it. So now if I need, in fact, working capital for my day-to-day operations, I have that flexibility through a commercial paper and that's really the essence of what we're doing. We have made no decisions at all on share buybacks or as I said to everyone, it's a topic that is regularly debated, brought to the Board for debate, and we have nothing to announce on that one. On the macro side, I would say, look, there's kind of two things, right? Everybody reads the press, everybody is seeing all, everything that happened in Q2 to Europe, the debt of this for that. I mean, for us at Google, it's been a great quarter. We've had -- our business has been a great quarter and we've seen no impact of what's going on in the macro world to us and that's why we said for the last three, four quarters, we've said we're really pleased with how we're kind of performing in this kind of economy and that's why we feel confident about the future and feel confident about investing now and that's why we're doing it.",227

Are these ads having a material impact on CPCs because we understand they're being sold on a CPI basis.,44
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 15, 2010",2010-07-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,4740.0,67984.0,5009696.0,Answer,Jonathan Rosenberg,,Executives,30,"This is Jonathan. I can give you a quick review of the top formats and then maybe, Nikesh can chime in and give you a sense of some of the specific customer experiences that he's had. The Click-to-Call Ads on the high-end mobile phones are doing very well. The click-through rates go up 6% when you put Ads with a phone number, 8% when you put a local address. So Click-to-Call is doing very well. It's easy to see some of those. If you want, you just take a look for yourself. If you tried travel agency from a smartphone, you'll see them. There are thousands of active campaigns on Click-to-Call. So you can take a look at that. Sitelinks is also making pretty good progress. We've given you examples on past calls where you type a big brand like Sears, and then you see the more useful links that you can get through. And the click-through rates on those can go up as much as 30% over the Ads without the Sitelinks, but we changed the way we do Sitelinks and we've added a new one-line format. And that also allows Sitelinks to show up in more places. You can try flowers if you want to see that. And then the other format that's getting some adoption is the -- we're adding the seller ratings, which shows merchants ratings out of six stars aggregated from reviews on the web. You see that if you look for things like digital cameras. And that's doing pretty well as well.",258

29096.0,"Google Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 15, 2010",2010-07-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,4740.0,67984.0,5009698.0,Answer,Nikesh Arora,,Executives,32,"I guess from an advertiser perspective, they've always had a sense that over the last few years, we've actually had some disparity in the quality of our natural search and quality for ads. Things like Sitelinks create tremendous parity between what people get in natural search and what they get in from an ad format. So there's tremendous appetite on our large advertisers to be able to send their consumers or users to a deeper part of their website, which Sitelinks allows. So the adoption of Sitelinks, the adoption of Click-to-Call, the call, as Jonathan said, is extremely sort of more lucrative for them because they can actually track it and they can actually track the transaction that it creates. So these new ad formats are definitely helping and are getting out there. One thing which Jonathan did not touch upon is the ad innovation on the Display side as well. And we've had tremendous new formats. We've launched the whole YouTube front, where we actually increased inventory because we're getting more and more content where we can show ads on. In addition to that, we also have new ad formats, which effectively, I mean imagine a basic ad and now getting it to be an auto expandable masthead which was up on YouTube, which allows us to impact the pricing of the ad format. So the more richer the ad, the more an advertiser is willing to contribute because it creates a more engaging experience and therefore, a higher revenue opportunity. So I think across the board in the ad formats, are both -- we're seeing more appetite for them. And at the same time, they're allowing us to create more return for the advertiser, allowing us to price them better.",292

So can you talk about the operating margins in the Display business on a revenue ex-TAC basis? How much of the margin compression that you're seeing right now is coming from Display growing faster than search? And then second question is, it looks like the ROW region accelerated a bit in the second quarter if you strip out the hedging and currency impact. Can you talk about, Nikesh, which regions are driving that? And can you specifically talk about the environment in Europe given the macro? I know you talked about it for a second earlier, but just any further color about Continental Europe?",114

If you take the DoubleClick platform, for example, which is more transactional. But overall, I think that they still are quite healthy. And if you think of CPCs the way I think about them is you have, really, two big components at work. The innovations that Jonathan talked out that actually drives CPC up. And then because those products perform better, they add pressure to the auction and therefore, drives CPC up. And then the two or three components that actually dragged them down in the short term actually, it's not as much Display as the places like Brazil and India. They are going very well, so internationally. And because they don't have as strong an auction right now, right, the CPCs are slightly lower but they're growing. So that's positive. And then we already talked about Mobile themselves as being lower CPCs. These are the two that actually are growing incredibly rapidly in that -- on the mix in the short term, may kind of put a bit of a downward spin on the CPC formula. But both of them as we know, they're growing more rapidly, so it's real dollars net in. And then on top of that, we know there's going to be future pressure on them. So I'm pretty pleased about the performance of those. On the issue of Europe and FX, it's really -- everybody's got a model out there, right? We've lived an incredible roller coaster of FX over the last year. So if you look at currencies like the euro and the pound, right, they were kind of quite similar on par versus the year-over-year but the last quarter versus this quarter, a huge change. And then in addition to that, if you look at places like the Real in Brazil, the Canadian dollars, the Yen, I mean those have quite increased year-over-year. So when you do your models relative to FX and OI&E, just take in consideration the fact that year-over-year, the net-net position is it's been strengthening all in. Quarter-over-quarter, it's been going down all in. And then on top of that, our FX kind of our hedging program is really a long-term hedging program. So this quarter, we've reaped $78 million, $79 million of benefits in there. So it's a tough puzzle to solve, but just please take the time to look at year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, because it's a puzzle to build. I hope that answers your question.",427

And then second, I guess just curious, the feedback we keep getting in the industry is that the Android kind of infrastructure and support seems to be lower than what at least your ecosystem would like. I guess, what is the appetite to create other revenue streams outside of advertising inside, let's say, Mobile in the form of, let's say, an app marketplace that is pretty vibrant?",112

It's both. I mean, obviously, having -- we did it for offensive reasons, not defensive reasons, right? We believe that actually opened platforms that create the ecosystem where our developers can actually create a whole set of new generations of Apps is incredibly important. And in addition to that, right, we do know that these new formats, like the smartphones, create an entire new set of activities in which you live and you will search and you will transact. So from that perspective, I think that it's obviously both. I think that I take your comment that if the market in general is saying they want more support from us in that space, right, we're investing heavily because we believe one, that search advertising, our acquisition of AdMob by the investments we're making is because for us, advertising is completely nascent in the space relative to kind of tech search.

But I don't think of this as defensive at all.

One is our recruiting. If you go year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, we had three big elements. One is we had -- our recruiting machine that started to build last year was not built in Q2 of last year. So if you think of the hiring infrastructure and the people infrastructure, has actually been kind of been building and now you see the full flow-through. We also have had in G&A in general, another area. If you think of everything else that's kind of people, we've talked about legal, we've had a number of legal costs through this quarter that have also flowed through just because of a number of legal activities that we've taken. So these are the two biggest components that actually would explain the big variances.",138

Look, we don't comment on YouTube. What I can tell you is we're incredibly pleased by its trajectory. I mean YouTube is, you take a step back, it's 2 billion views per day in its fifth year of existence. It's won over 1 billion monetization videos per week. It's a huge kind of a first page, and it's aggregating audiences and you see it today to the top brand advertisers showing up for it, right? So in the World Cup, you saw the Sonys and the Cokes and the -- I mean, this is the power of YouTube today. It's like a worldwide audience. So in that sense, I would argue, just read in the TVs. It's a great business for us. On the Display side, Nikesh?",144

To be fair, what Display and YouTube has given us, it's allowed us, in the case of large search customers to complement the portfolio in terms of being able to offer integrated campaigns, which go all the way from branded sites like YouTube to networks like the Google Display Network and to be able to sort of coming a lot with search. Not only that, many advertiser now actually coming a lot with television ads, as well as their print programs. So you see a much more integrated campaign capability that begins to happen. We got examples recently like Patrick mentioned in the Sony folks slogan at the World Cup. What's interesting is Procter & Gamble has become one of our larger advertisers this quarter. That's primarily driven by the ability of CPG companies to both see the value of Search in their ability to build a brand, where they have figured out that people research online and purchase after research. Yes, research online, purchase offline is going to have a ripple effect. So people like P&G are beginning to see that impact. Other consumer companies are beginning to see that impact. In addition to that, we're seeing, like Patrick mentioned, the Omnicom deal which we just announced. Agencies are beginning to realize that this is an integrated buy. It is a buy you need to do across multiple properties not just YouTube, the Google Display Network and the Search Network. Hence, the notion of trying to create a trading desk not just for people like Omnicom, but we have deals in places to put this in and group [indiscernible].",277

I think the biggest thing is just the continued secular shift in advertising from things offline that are not measurable to the ROI-based model of search advertising, where the advertisers can actually see the benefits in the ROI that they're receiving on the money that they're spending. We did see a good bit of that during the recession. I think there was a disproportionate fraction of budgets that were spent on things where the ROI could be tracked. I think on our side, we're doing a lot in terms of ads quality, as I mentioned in my scripted remarks.

We've seen that and we've seen the great recovery in Q1 and in Q2. And on a year-over-year basis. I think that for us, what's really interesting is people are searching.

I think it's important just to mention it. If you go back to the fundamentals of hiring in CapEx, CapEx is lumpy. And here's a perfect example of lumpiness. To be able to work in Scandinavia in the winter is difficult. As we said, we were building a data center there. Now it's spring and we're working there. So we're also adding machines, and it just happens that when you get the generations of chips available and everything available, then you start rolling out. We had a bit of kind of -- the lumpiness shouldn't surprise anybody. And I think that everybody that I had discussions with when we were at kind of, like, $189 million or it's clearly on also unsustainable low levels. So we're kind of running our plans accordingly. So just stay tuned for CapEx but it just happen to be lumpy. In terms of hiring, I think that it really is the case that I'm going to take a step back to three quarters ago when we said, ""Look, for us the recession is over."" For us, we see great products and we have a mindset of the next half decade and the big platforms we are building that are creating these huge ecosystems. And for us, Search is one and then Mobile and Android, as we had just talked about is one. And then Display is amazing, it's really growing and to not put resources to actually shield this ecosystem which is the next decade, it's just such an opportunity. So that's why we're investing aggressively. We think it's the right thing to do at the moment in the company, and that's the balance we're striving. Even in Q3, if you think of headcount, you have a lot of people who just graduated from universities, they're going to join us. So there maybe even be -- you can think of the bump of the accepted but not started because they're going to go backpacking for the summer before they come and join us. But I mean ultimately, we're looking at a trend of continuing to invest and it's the right thing at this time in the history of the company. So that's on CapEx and on hiring. And then on contextual search, if there's something that you need a more refined answer for, Jonathan? I'm not sure I understood.",424

Basically, if you think about it from a search perspective, it's a spurious request because it's not really an incremental search. So the thing that matters to us is ultimately, consummating transactions via conversions that we're sending to advertisers. So what we care about is the number of genuine searches that users are running, where they want to get directly to an answer or a website, or where they're interested in actually clicking on an advertiser's ad. It wouldn't help us in any respect, other than in generating counts in share data to cause the total number of searches to artificially go up if there wasn't user intent behind them that was of value to our advertisers.

If you're asking about Greece, I would have to answer the question.

It's a combination of Internet penetration getting higher. It's a combination of people getting savvier, advertisers are getting more and more ready for the eWorld. So we're seeing good growth this quarter as ever [ph] growth in Brazil, India, Russia and then we saw great growth, and then we saw good growth in many other parts of the world.

I think probably the easier way to answer the question is to just give you my quick observations on the things, which are clearly contributing to driving CPCs on average up versus those that are impacting them in the other direction. I don't see anything from a user perspective or share perspective that is obvious, that's impacting the overall equation. I think we are seeing on the positive side, conversion rates improving, which is driving CPCs up. I think your comment about the relative shift in mix to google.com from AFC does contribute positively to CPC. Google.com is obviously higher, so any mixed shift there, everything else being constant, increases CPC. The obvious things that we've talked about in the past that pushed it in the other direction are emerging markets, Brazil, India and Nikesh talked about some of those examples earlier. Mobile growing in the mix. And people increasingly looking for longer tail queries that monetize lower to add in to their campaigns but those are the overall factors.",173

On China, look, we're basically at the same place when we last discussed or last time I talked about it, which is we have -- the good news is we have our license renewal. But apart from that, certainly from a financial perspective, I just want to reiterate to everybody, revenue from China is not material to our revenue.

I mentioned there are new formats and efforts that we've offered that are starting to increase them like formats and efforts that we've offered, that are starting to increase them like the Click-to-Call offering. I think the main thing that's really going to fundamentally have to change there, which is the big difference between Mobile and desktop is that today, on a Mobile phone, people are actually less likely to consummate a transaction because the logistics of entering a credit card or being signed in on a browser is somewhat more time-consuming and onerous. So I think that for the Mobile system to move very aggressively is going to require more of those commercial transactions actually being taken and placed on the Mobile devices. On the Display side, the AdSense for Mobile is actually doing very, very well, and one of the reasons that, that's doing well is sort of the opposite of what I just stated in terms of effect. On a Mobile device, the Display Ad is something that really kind of gets in your face. The screen is relatively small so you see it. It's unlike a desktop in that you're not typically doing multiple things at once. So Display, I think, is relatively closer to the desktop than is search-based ads.",230

Can talk about what the ramifications are? What sort of advertisers do you expect to participate? And any other details would be appreciated.,39
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 15, 2010",2010-07-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,4740.0,67984.0,5009746.0,Answer,Nikesh Arora,,Executives,80,"You have to understand, as we look at Display, there are two significant changes that are happening, right? One is display buying, which traditionally has been advertising, advertisers buying sites is slowly and surely shifting to audience buying. So I, as an advertiser, no longer want to buy tiffany.com or newyorktimes.com only. I want to be able to say, ""I'd like 18- to 35-year-olds who are savvy, who understand technology, and they'd be interested in our product. As you go through that audience-buying notion, what advertisers are looking for is they're looking for specific inventory and specific audiences, whichever site they might be on. So it becomes even more important for some sort of trading desk-type phenomena to exists, where an advertiser can buy across any publisher they'd like to buy. Now that makes it even more important that you can find some trading desk for trading, that way you can have every publisher represented. Because if you have seven different networks, it's sub-optimal as an industry to have an advertiser that'll have to go to seven different networks to be able to accumulate audiences with different standards, different ways at seven different networks to look like. So effectively, the ad agencies which are buying advertising for advertisers would like to have plum platform, which allows them to buy across these entire network. And that's what we're working on Omnicom, where they believe that if they have the right trading environment setup for their advertisers, it's going to be tremendous value for the advertisers, because advertisers come to a one-stop shop and buy across network. And also allows for tremendous efficiency, because the best seller of advertiser may not be the best acquirer of a publisher. So therefore you can separate that in some sort of an Ad Exchange context, which is what Omnicom is working with us on. And if you get it right, there's hundreds of millions of dollars at stake in this kind of a deal, because that allows very effective buying across the board on a network. And every player in that ecosystem can get their fair share of the profit.",355

We do remarketing on the Display side. We basically are able to go look at what we call interest space advertising. If you understand that certain users are interested in certain things we have, based on their having chosen to allow us to use that information, we have the ability to then market to them and show them ads.

The more effective the advertising is, the more likely the advertisers are willing to burn a bit more money for it. So you should expect the more efficient we make advertising, the more relevant it become, the more ROI it generates to the advertiser, they're willing to compete more aggressively with other advertisers for the same piece of real estate.

What I'm going to say is, that we have -- there's a real kind of triangulation between three factors in our strategy for acquisitions. So think of it as talent, intellectual property, and then price. And so what we're looking for is the sweet spot, where we find teams of people that have clear leadership. That if you think about it, the venture capital world is actually kind of voted by them surviving though as long as they have. And they have as a team, great talent, engineering talent specifically. Then on top of that, put the second piece of it, which is they have proven that they actually have good intellectual property. Whether it'd be whatever do you have there they're working on or whatever in the case as you just mentioned of ITA, right? A lot of interesting kind of structural data. So the third piece is obviously price. There's a price, after which it's not worth it to us. And then there's a trade-off on price. And what we do is, we do every one of them. We ask ourself the question, now we look at the intellectual -- and then, let me put the overarching fit, which is how does it fit within those four areas that I've talked about earlier, of which is where we're trying to accelerate our development. So AdMob is a perfect example of that, where great technology, fantastic team at the right price, that basically takes a huge chunk of what was our engineering roadmap and bring it today, integrated into the team. And then we have much smaller teams, sometimes there's 12 to 15 engineers that have a great piece on tours and other one like that, right, when you think about the view of products. So it's always the trail end. There are many cases where we look at them and we don't buy them, because we can't find the fit somewhere in those three. So I mean that's how we think about it. And it is disciplined, and we have to base upon them. And sometimes, we kind of want to say and we often say, ""no."" That's how we think about it.",375

So almost all searches that you were otherwise doing on your desktop, I think you're still going to do on your desktop. On the other hand, there are times when you are out with your mobile phone and you didn't have your desktop device. And obviously, those are by definition, incremental, unless of course in theory, you'd remember to go back and do that search when you came back to your desktop. But I don't think that there's much evidence that, that's the case. I think the vast majority of them are incremental. I think there are also slightly different usage patterns across desktop and mobile. You tend to see more use of the mobile devices on weekends, which is not surprising. But there are actually have any more specific data that proves those observations or that hypothesis.",187

Because you'd be able to do a lot more when you're out in the field. And for example, being able to within a store, scan a bar code with your smartphone, look at the price on the shelf and determine whether or not you actually would prefer to consummate the transaction through a web-based alternative and then automatically complete the transaction, is the kind of thing that's all going to be incremental.

But you have to understand first of all, YouTube is five years old, right? So this is a phenomena that has been created over the last five years. We look at YouTube, and we monetize it in many different ways. We monetize the Home page of YouTube. We monetize watch pages on YouTube. We do promote your videos, and looking at various new ways and looking at how we can put ads into content. Now part of the process that has been going on is they have to continue to free up more and more inventory for it to be available for us to advertise on. So we've done a lot of deals recently where, whether if music societies around the world, in various countries around the world, where we are getting permissions to be able to show advertising in those places, which allow us to create more inventories. That's the inventory side of things. And we believe we're in a good path to continue to create more and more available inventory. In addition to the inventory side, we have to now keep getting advertisers to start getting -- giving us quality video advertising, which can be put in the YouTube. My view on this is that we're in a very, very early stages of video advertising, because what advertisers do, they will splice a video ad that they've created for television, and they will stick it on YouTube. You have to understand, YouTube allows you two more things, which the television does not: A, it allows you to interact with the ad, which TV does not. And most of the ads on video ads, so far are not interactive. So we expect, as that begins to happen, people will start creating more and more interactive. The second thing, it allows you to, it allows you to create some degree of personalization. The ad your grandmother sees and I see and my daughter see, need not necessarily be the same ad for anything. So both of those features, we think will come into play and more and more in the advertising side. So as we get more personalization, more interactivity, as we get more inventory, clarified for YouTube, we think that it's going to create more monetization opportunities. And we couple that with the previous conversation on Display and the ability to buy audiences, now it just provides sort of the icing on the cake, as this thing goes forward.",419

We're still on the PO side, I don't want to comment on the specifics. What I can say is two things, right? Obviously with more clarity from this judgment, it gives us more room for experimentation that we didn't have before, because until these rules are clear, you don't know exactly where the bar is. And with that clear bar, we now have much more room for experimentation. And then just to comment on if there was ever a great illustration of Nikesh's point a minute ago, just look in the last few weeks above the Old Spice experiment on YouTube. And if you have not tried that, just go on YouTube and check Old Spice about the interactivity of Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and advertisers. It's just absolutely phenomenal.

The Ad Exchange allows a buyer to buy across multiple networks. So without an Ad Exchange, it makes it very inefficient for advertising to be bought. And therefore the buy is not going to go as fast. So you want to make sure that you can create some consistency and standardization in the way display advertising has been bought, if you want to take the big TV dollars to start coming into display as it had been in the early years. I think with Google Display Network, it's our ability to prove that we can create a network of our own of multiple publishers and create premium capability for our advertisers to be able to target those publishers. And last but not the least, YouTube becomes our owned and operated property, sort of like us operating google.com and our Google Network. So clearly, the margins on our owned and operated properties are higher. And that allows us to have a premium property in the space. And also allows us to achieve in a tremendous amounts of content, which we can then there offer to advertiser. So it was that all these three are very relevant to the overall strategy and not trying to prioritize any one over the other, but clearly, YouTube being able to monetize, bringing more TV dollars into YouTube is fantastic. Google Display Network being able to monetize that opportunity across multiple publishers is great. And without AdEx, which is the glue that will bind all these networks together, it is hard to see that industry growing as fast as we'd like to see it grow.",286

Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. As Jane mentioned, Jonathan and I will begin with our prepared remarks and then Nikesh will join us for Q&A. In addition, and as a bit of a surprise, we may actually have Eric join us for the first 30 minutes of Q&A before he has to run to a plane. 
So let me start by giving you some general thoughts before I get into the details of our financial performance for Q3, at the highest level, we're very pleased with our Q3 results and it's clear that the digital economy continues to grow rapidly, a relentless trend that continues to drive growth in both our core business, core search and creating market and also for fueling momentum in our newer businesses. 
Our Q3 results clearly reflect this phenomenon. That is our continued strong growth in our core business and continued very strong growth in our emerging businesses year-over-year and indeed, we saw strength in every major product area in Q3. That is search, display, Mobile, as well as apps enterprise. And when I say our newer businesses are seeing great momentum, I really mean it. And in that, Jonathan will back that statement up with some hard facts in a few minutes so stay tuned for the details. 
Now let's turn to specifics of our performance in the quarter from a financial perspective. Let's move quickly to the results. Gross revenue grew 23% year-over-year to $7.3 billion. Our Google website revenue was up 22% year-over-year to $4.8 billion, with strength, as I mentioned, across most major geographies and verticals. Our AdSense revenue was up 22%, year-over-year to $2.2 billion, a gain reflecting continued strength in our Google Display Network. Our other revenue was up 35% year-over-year to $254 million, down sequentially, reflecting the end of our direct-to-consumer sale of the Nexus One. 
Our global aggregate paid click growth remained healthy, up 16% year-over-year and also up 4% quarter-over-quarter. Aggregate cost-per-click growth was up 3% year-over-year and 2% quarter-over-quarter. You should note that the FX had a negative impact on CBC growth year-over-year but the impact for quarter-over-quarter was quite neutral. Remember too that this is an aggregate number which includes both Google.com and our AdSense properties. 
So now turning to our geographic performance, the U.S. and Rest of World are growing at a healthy pace. As our results reflect, but also while the U.K. continues to lag a little bit in the economic recovery, again seen in our results. Revenue from the U.S. was up 26% year-over-year to $3.5 billion. In slides, which you can find in our Investor Relations website, you will see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and Rest of World to show you the impact of FX and the benefits from our hedging programs. So please refer to those slides for detailed calculations. 
International revenues accounted for 52% of our total revenue or $3.8 billion up 20% year-over-year, which includes a $89 million benefit from our hedging programs. And that compares to a $39 million benefit for Q3 of last year. If we used fixed Exchange rates, our international revenues would have been roughly $169 million higher year-over-year. The U.K. was up 10% year-over-year to $840 million but actually if using a fixed exchange rate, that number would have been just shy of 20%. So now let me turn to expenses. 
Our traffic acquisition costs were $1.8 billion or 26% of total advertising revenue for this quarter. Other cost to revenue was $747 million, including stock-based compensation of $8 million and finally, all other operating expenses totaled $2.2 billion, including approximately $372 million of stock-based compensation. 
The decrease year-over-year in OpEx was primarily due to increase in payroll, professional services and advertising and promotional spend. So as a result of all this, our non-GAAP operating profit, which excludes the stock-based compensation increased to $2.9 billion in Q3, resulting in our non-GAAP operating margin of 40.2%, essentially the same as last year.
Headcount was up approximately 1,500 versus Q2. And we ended the quarter with approximately 23,300 full-time employees, of which about 300 came from acquisitions. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%, down from 24% in Q2 and because this is mostly because we released certain tax reserves as a result of the settlement of our 2005, 2006 tax audits which are now completed.
Let me now turn to cash managements. In the line Other Income and Expenses, it was $167 million for Q3, which includes good progress on our portfolio management performance, although that was slightly offset somewhat by the impact of our hedging expenses associated with FAS 133. For more details on OI&E, again please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our investor website.
Operating cash flow, very strong for the quarter at $2.9 billion, CapEx for the quarter was $757 million. Again, mostly primarily related to our data center operations and as a reminder, we continue to make significant investment in CapEx and these have shown to be quite lumpy from quarter to quarter depending on when we're able to make these investments. So in the end, free cash flow was also very good at $2.1 billion.
Before I close, I want to say a few words about how we're continuing to grow the business for the long-term. And when I say the long-term, we really mean not the next quarter and the following quarter but we're thinking about the next five to 10 years. Looking ahead, we continue to see tremendous opportunity in our agenda in both our core and in our emerging businesses. So simply put, we're on this growth agenda at full throttle. We're doing it largely in two ways, if you think about it, continue to invest heavily in people and also in product. In people, it's pretty simple story. The explosive growth in the digital economy that we're experiencing, it's really created a war for talent in our industry, the digital economy and one that is quite out of sync with what's happening in the rest of the economy. 
So we believe this trend is only accelerated in the next 18 months and will continue to accelerate. So in context of that, we stepped up our hiring machine and we are currently exploring how we can continue to attract and retain the very best people in this exceptionally competitive environment. So we strongly believe that the difference between the winners and the losers in our industry will be, to a large extent, determined by who we can attract and who can retain the best talent. So to that end, we're incredibly proud to attract approximately 1,500 people to join Google in Q3, the majority in Engineering and Sales once again.
On the product side, our goal continues to be to develop truly innovative products that leverage computer science to solve these incredible problems that we tackle and offer, obviously, significant ROI across a number of very large growth opportunities. As I mentioned, Jonathan in a few minutes will be speaking of this great momentum our products are experiencing. And as always, we're investing with discipline following the Google tradition of being generous but frugal. 
So in summary, very pleased with our performance of Q3 across revenue, margins, cash flow. And we plan to continue to attract, hire, retain the very best talent in the world wherever they are, to fuel our innovation agenda. Now is the moment for me to turn the call over to Jonathan, which usually means that my number parts is over. But today, I've actually asked Jonathan to share with you, and let me emphasize, on a onetime basis, a few product specific metrics that I think everybody will be very interested to hear. 
And as a CFO, you know I'm usually the official buzz killer so I need to make it very clear that we will not be updating these numbers going forward. We are merely sharing them with you as a proof point of the great momentum we're experiencing in our emerging businesses. 
And with that, let me turn it to Jonathan.",1361

So I think you guys can see from the financial numbers, we've got tremendous momentum in the core business. But in these emerging businesses, you guys basically have to invoke your Jedi guesstimation skills to try to figure out what's going on. So today, with Patrick's permission, I hope to shed a bit more light on these businesses with some numbers that we've not shared before. 
But let me start with the core. Search is more important than ever. The Internet, as you guys know, continues to explode. There's lots more website, there's more videos, there's more images, there's more books and news, all this stuff is coming online. And at the same time, more people are coming online, too. And what do these people do when they get online? The first thing they usually do is search. So search is still at the heart of the web, and with all of this new content coming online, doing search well is even harder than ever. I actually believe search remains one of the most challenging computer science problems of our generation and probably the next one as well. This is why we're so incredibly proud of Google Instant. 
Many of you guys speculated that we launched Instant to make more money. Well let me tell you that's simply not the case. We launched Instant because it's so much better for the user. In fact, from a revenue standpoint, it's impact has been very minimal and from a resource standpoint, it's actually pretty expensive. So why did we do it? Well we believe from a user standpoint, Instant is outstanding and the data that we're seeing actually bears this out. We took something that no one thought was a problem and we created something that once you use it, you can't recall how you lived without it before. It saves about two to five seconds per search and users absolutely love it. 
The percentage of people who select Instant results before they finish their query is steadily rising. So in other words, that means the more they use it, the more they like it. So let me be clear that Instant wasn't based on a narrow financial calculation. We launched it because we could and because it's great for our users as we've always said.
Of course, I know it's an earnings call, so let me be clear on another point. We do in fact care about money. And search is still the most monetizable moment on the web. And as search gets better, our ads have to keep pace. The good news is, they are. Turns out we also have a lot of great momentum with AdWords and this is particularly true with the new ad formats. 
On past calls, I've talked about making ads more useful with the new formats like Sitelinks and ads with the seller ratings and product listing ads, which we think -- which we could see now are starting to have a real impact. These ads appear on more than 10% of the queries where we show ads and people like them. We see this because click-through rates are up for some formats as much as 10% and up more than 30% on some others. We're also seeing great momentum in our newer businesses and this is where Patrick is letting me give you some big numbers. So I hope you find them useful.
The numbers all begin with the letter B. And remember, as I always remind my team, a billion is a thousand million. So, the first big number, $2.5 billion. As in Display is on an annualized run rate of over $2.5 billion. So that's non-text display meaning it doesn't count text ads running on our network. What it does count is YouTube ads, non-text ads on the Google Display Network and of course on the DoubleClick platform. So you guys often ask me, ""Jonathan, where is the next multi-billion dollar business after Search?"" There's your answer, it's Display, and it's already here, clocking in at over a $2.5 billion run rate. 
So clearly, we're firing on all cylinders in display. The advertisers are running, great branding campaigns, the Ad Exchange is taking off, we're partnering very well with agencies and of course more publishers are making more money. If you want to know more on the display front, Nikesh, who's here, is passionate about this business. He's made enormous strides with the sales force and clients, which I'm sure he'll be happy to talk to you guys about in the Q&A.
So second big number, 2 billion. As in YouTube is monetizing over 2 billion views per week. That's up over 50% year-over-year. And when you think about that growth, it's important because the RPMs are really strong on YouTube. We've just launched some new add formats called TrueView, where the viewers get to choose which commercials to watch or they can even skip watching the ad together. Turns out, when advertisers only pay for the commercials people watch, we discover the ads are a lot more valuable to advertisers when they're only paying for viewers who've actually chosen to watch them.
Finally, third big number, $1 billion. Mobile is on an annualized run rate of over $1 billion. This means the people who are accessing our products and services through their Mobile phones, are adding $1 billion annually to our existing revenue streams. Clearly, this is the future of search in the Internet. More people in more countries coming online from these smartphones. 
Our Mobile search queries have grown 5x over the past couple of years. And of course, a lot more of those queries are now coming from Android phones. So they’re the facts that Patrick has let me say just this once. Non-text display, $2.5 billion run rate, YouTube, 2 billion monetized views per week and Mobile, over $1 billion added to our business. And Patrick, maybe I'll ad-lib on one more fact here without asking you, you should know all these businesses are growing.
So I hope this gives all of you a sense of why we're so excited about the incredible emerging businesses at Google. 
And with that, I'll take it back to Patrick.",1041

Before we take your questions, just want to add one fact regarding the new disclosures Jonathan just gave you. Obviously, this information reflects our revenues from two different angles of our business and with it, we recognize in some cases some small overlaps. So, for example, the AdMob revenues are obviously included both in the Mobile number because it's a Mobile product, and in display because it's also a display product. So these are very small, but I wish to just clarify it out for everybody.
So with that in mind, what I'd like to do is turn it over to Connie to open -- and we have Eric with us. So the may is now an actual. Eric is with us -- he's got 20 to 30 minutes then he's running for a plane. So delighted to have you with us, Eric. And what I'll do is I'll turn it to Connie for the Q&A questions period.",161

Is that because your query growth is also fairly consistent? Or are you supplementing query growth with monetization initiatives that increase paid lead tickup? And then secondly, and separately, thank you extremely much for disclosing the billions in terms of Mobile and Display advertising. But within the $2.5 billion plus of Display Advertising, how do you account for advertiser spending through the DoubleClick Ad Exchange is that on a gross or net basis?",118

Certainly, the highest correlation between ad clicks and anything else is query growth. So that's going to certainly, by far, dwarf any other factor. I think the other factors that we're seeing is that the new formats that we have, which I've mentioned, certainly drive click growth as well, and I mentioned that those formats appear on 10% of the queries. If you try some of those like Halloween costumes, you'll see that they make the ads much more compelling as do things like merchant ratings, if you type in laser printers. So by improving the ad formats, we are increasing the relative number of clicks because the click-through rates go up.",120

So as the web becomes more social and realtime, how does Google compete in that world in terms of realtime search market and how does it impact your business? And secondly on the Mobile trend, obviously, you have this Apple ecosystem with Apple i-applications people are going directly to applications and how does that impact Google's business model over the long-term? And the housekeeping question, near term question, the tax rate was 20% on the quarter, is there anything specific in this quarter? How should we think about the tax rate?",110
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 14, 2010",2010-10-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3660.0,79943.0,5739488.0,Answer,Eric Schmidt,,Executives,15,"With respect to social and realtime, we use complex signals to do ranking and overtime, we will add additional social, if you will, ranking clues. Fundamentally, we want to make search more personal and as we get more information about who your friends are we can make the search that much better. We're quite convinced that, that produces a better search results for people who choose to give us that information. For people who want to continue to do what is generally known as anonymous search, that is also possible. So one of the ways to think about that is that we want users to be more logged in to Google. The more logged in they are, the more likely we are again to buy them not only the social information but the other information. You also asked about realtime. We already have significant feeds from realtime information providers, we have a realtime index, which of course is a very, very successful for us and you could see that whenever anything interesting happens, it's already right there in Google. But, for example, we use Twitter as a realtime source of information. So if you search for almost anything, you'll see the Twitter feeds now as part of the universal search. Could you repeat the second part of your question for me?",221

So does that impact your search volume as people go directly to the vendors through the app. It seems like Amazon talked about $1 billion sell-through coming from mobile devices. How does that impact Google's business long-term?",49

This is one of those sort of worrywart questions what we get all the time that the success of one thing, could that impinge on something else? And in fact the rising tide lifts all boats. I would say that again, I hear is this sort of presumption that it's a zero-sum game and that one wins and another one loses. What's really happening is that all of the companies that are driving the web and web applications are all doing really well. People are moving from offline to online. And in the course of doing that, they're using these systems more. They're searching more, using apps more, et cetera. Now from our perspective, you have this phenomenal success of Android, which is well past anything that I have ever hoped for, and looks like it's on its way to being a huge, huge success with a number of partners a number of devices an open model for access, lots and lots of innovation, more dynamic, more competition than any other part of the platform. They're up to 90,000 applications on Android and growing very, very fast and those applications of course have Search service inside of them. So we don't see them as negative, we see both as very strongly positive.",217

We did get a onetime benefit this quarter on the tax side, and it is related as the statutes expire for 2005 and 2006, all of our taxes are now closed.

When you think about Android as an operating system, how does that proprietary to Google when you think about your Search services. Does that give you an advantage over other phones for some of your services, and is the phone operate better when you're using Google services? And then second, I think you were quoted in an article saying “maybe someday Google can make $10 per phone”, which using, is that number right or something you did say?",90
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 14, 2010",2010-10-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3660.0,79943.0,5739494.0,Answer,Eric Schmidt,,Executives,21,"The latter one I made out of thin air. So we don't really have a notion of exactly what it is, but it's probably pretty big. So one way to think about Android is that it's probably the largest, single platform play available in the market today. Because it's a platform for computation, for location, for everything that you could do, with the new and most popular set of computing devices there emerging. That market is larger than the PC market. The tablet market is a small component of it but an important part of it. So if you think of Mobile as phone plus tablet plus all the other things, we hope to become the leading platform in that space and we're doing it with an open-source approach. So in the open-source approach that means we give the software away, which is always paradoxical and people say, ""How do you make money from that?"" Let's start with the fact that the evidence we have that the people who use Android search twice as much as everything else. So clearly, there's more revenue associated with those searches. Another thing of course is if they're using Android systems, the revenue that we share in the search is shared with the operator but not with anybody else. So again it's more lucrative. So not only is there more searches and there's more ads but it's also more lucrative. So on that basis alone, Android is hugely profitable. And we maintain the anti-fragmentation and other things by a series of contracts around this store and so forth and so on. So Android is likely to be financially successful to Google without even any of the applications that are possible. So Patrick calls up and says, ""Okay, what else can you do for us?"" and the answer of course is we can layer on value-added services, which is how you get to the $10. And the value-added services could be of any kind. Our primary purpose right now is building this open platform. Google chose to make a bet on open systems and open platform and the open Web. That serves us well so far and it looks like it's going to work really well for us in Android.",375

And that revenue model sort of proves to us that roughly the revenues are split between our search efforts, our display efforts and our application efforts. We are able to play across all those three spaces in our mobile monetization efforts and the more people who use smartphones, the more people who are able to access the web on their devices, the more we see the trend of people that are searching them. They're going to give us opportunities to put Display Advertising on them. So we see no reason to change our monetization model.

On display, we just don't break it down. So we will not give the details we wanted to give today with the numbers we're sharing is a sense of scale and trajectory. And that's really what we wanted to share so we unfortunately won't give any more details on that. On the Android competitive stores, Eric, maybe you can give us more prospective on it?",82

And it's not a revenue goal for Google. So there certainly will be multiple stores there will certainly be the key one from us and we think it's a net win for everybody. So it's not a primary focus on Google from a revenue perspective. It's really for the developers.,70

Nikesh can maybe give you more of a customer base perspective. I think as some of you know, we recently started smart pricing on the Mobile devices and it is the case that the CPC is on the Mobile devices are a good bit lower. It's primarily because there isn't the measurement, there isn't as much of a consummation of a transaction on the Mobile devices. People don't have their credit cards in them, it's harder to type into them. So the Mobile rates remain relatively lower, as payment platforms get built into the Mobile devices and these people are more likely to actually complete a transaction, I think you'll see those things go up substantially. I think it's also the case that on devices like the iPad, the kind of activity looks a little bit more like it does on a PC, primarily because people have a larger window, a bigger browser and they're also more able to input information. Nikesh?",165

And there, we're beginning to see sort of better CPMs and better monetization. Generally, we think that's where the trend is. That's where we're going to see more monetization. And clearly we are seeing monetization in the application side of mobile because with the AdMob sort of team that we have. And all the advertiser want to be part of the application. The applications are becoming a big share of people's Mobile usage.",142

And is the tablet option within AdWords going to be similar to the desktop laptop option or is it going to be kind of a separate category? And then Nikesh, can you just give us a little bit more color on the Rest of World growth, just in terms of regions that we're driving that 26%, was it broad-based or was there anything that stood out?",105

We tend to see Mobile as very complementary to the desktop. I think you do see some differences in the search patterns. People use Mobile at lunch, they use it on the evening, they use it on weekends, they use it more on holidays. But we see both Mobile and web search traffic growing and they appear to us to be complimentary and not cannibalizing each other.",73

I'm very pleased with the way our U.S. team has driven the revenues sort of across the board, across our revenue categories. On the international side, I'd say generally, the trend has been positive across the board. I know that U.K. has been a bit weaker but there's a bit of currency in there as well. But France, Germany and those markets have actually been very, very robust. I'd say Southern Europe has done way better than some of the northern European countries but that's expected because they are enjoying sort of a bit of a growth curve and clearly some of the Asian markets are growing robustly for us.",119

And second, I guess if you look at your competition in Mobile, in another company in the space in Mobile they make about $300 in operating profit per handset sold, I guess, do you think this is more the upper bound as it relates to lifetime profit per handset? Do you think it can be higher? I know obviously, you're going out for a different strategy. But where do you think is the upper bound in terms of the profit potential on let's say a two-year handset in terms of monetization?",157

And so I may just refer you back to the IR Team that can actually dig that out because we actually shared that with the public over the last, kind of eight months or six months, and it's actually very detailed into how much economic is actually flowing to our systems.",86
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 14, 2010",2010-10-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3660.0,79943.0,5739517.0,Answer,Eric Schmidt,,Executives,44,"This is Eric. I understand the question that you're asking. Our model, remember, is that the handset manufacturer and the operators are going to make a lot of that money. And our model is that our operating system is free and we're going to make money from advertising and value-added services on top of the Android platform. So it's a completely different model. And it's not very difficult to compare the two, really apples and oranges. It would be, I think, premature for us to estimate what that would be, but if you assume that search monetization on handsets will become equivalent to PCs and eventually exceeded, which is my personal view, then it should be highly lucrative because the customers are using Google services, they're going to use them more, because they're more personal, they're more targeted. And so ultimately, it should be a very, very strong revenue stream compared to a PC.",154

And we also have in development other ways in which people can give us that sort of information that can make it even more personal.,57

29096.0,"Google Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 14, 2010",2010-10-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3660.0,79943.0,5739522.0,Answer,Nikesh Arora,,Executives,49,"I think the important part on the side of the Mobile space is that the reason the $1 billion number is an interesting number is that just means that now the large advertisers can get more interested because we can help them spend these nimble amounts of the money. It's very hard to go make a pitch to a large advertiser when the maximum inventory that you can offer them is in the $5,000 to $10,000 or $50,000 range, especially with advertisers who got $100 million, $200 million advertising budget. So to get them interested, if they get interested, they'd like to be able to deploy reasonable amounts of money against this market. So the part I'm excited about is that the inventory continues to grow. That is diversity in formats. People are interested in search-based advertising, people are interested in display-based advertising, they want to be in the middle of applications and get customer engagement. So we are seeing sort of a reasonable broad-based interest. Clearly, the early adopters are people who can actually consummate a transaction. So in short services, want to Click-to-Call, they want to be to pitch, they want a customer to be able to pick up the phone and call them. There are people who are on the local space who want the customer to come to their restaurant, they want the customer to come show up where they're offering a local service. So that interest is going up. Now the retailers who actually are interested when you're looking for a local JCPenney or RadioShack that we can tell you where it is and they can actually click and find out where it is. Interest continues to grow as you look at the local categories, as you look at the Click-to-Call categories, and as Jonathan said, as payment capabilities start getting bills into the phone, you'll start seeing even more of an interest from the e-commerce players.",322

If you try, for example, typing in car rental, there's a very good chance you'll see an Enterprise Rent-A-Car ad that tells you how far away it is to their nearest location, half a mile along with a phone number and a link to a map.

Prior to the recession, the company was obviously putting up very large international growth rates and we've seen a slowdown and now a rebound.

I think that you have to take it from the current performance that you see over the last couple of quarters that there is clearly a separation in the world of economic growth in general and the digital economy growth.

What accounted for that, and is that sustainable going forward? And two, growth in the last few quarters was driven largely by volume, not price, so to what extent is that driven by more SCO less SEM, maybe a mix of domestic versus international, and how realistic is it for us to kind of expect hockey stick, maybe not hockey stick, but reacceleration in pricing trends?",83

On the attack it's very simple, I mean this quarter, we've had two really factors. One is our MySpace deal is now over and with it, there was a contract with minimum guarantees that now has expired. So that's one element and then the second one is simply the mix of our partners within the network, actually will affect our attack and that's really the effect that you see for this quarter.

And so to the extent that, that continues and that really, is putting a dampening effect on CPC growth going forward, the mix between domestic and international should shift to more international and that over time we should see higher CPCs. I'm just trying to kind of see as we look at the business, over the next several years, how realistic is it to assume that one i.e. the increased international CPCs will offset the SEO trend?",103

As far as I can tell SEO has always been pretty big. Pricing has been pretty healthy from my perspective coming out of a recession. Bids are healthy. We've got very strong conversion rates and presumably, that's because the advertisers are seeing buyers again.

In the past, you allocated resources 70, 20, 10. Is there a shift in terms of how you're allocating resources now? And secondly, this may imply more of asking guidance, but I guess my question is by when do you envision Mobile Advertising overtaking Display advertising?",61

On the question of allocation of resources, I think at the end of the day, Larry and I have talked about our job to use our best judgment based on the sum of technological opportunity, business opportunity and so forth to divide, if you will, between the classic core business as you're really asking and some of these emergent ones. So we're informed by the hockey stick nature of these things. So there's a couple of ones, I'll give an example of Android, which is small in resources and growing very quickly. So they pretty much have been able to get whatever researches they need and they're going up against very large giants with a factor of 10 or more resources. And so we sort of measure in that way. When we then go back, and sold for 70, 20, 10, it turns out we're roughly consistent with 70, 20, 10. But it's not really as much of a formula as is much looking at where the real excitement is. The thing that we're doing is we're organizing ourselves, and Nikesh is actually leading this effort, into more of an internal business unit structure because frankly it's just become so large and so complicated that it's been difficult for us to keep track of all the details. And so, that will give us a better tie-in between where the current and future revenue is and where the resources are going. And I think Nikesh sits on the order of 10, 15 kind of structure by the time we're done with the obvious big ones being Search and Ads and Display and Enterprise and that kind of stuff, YouTube.",306

And we keep the flexibility to make sure that we really feed the winner so that they keep the momentum as you've seen, for example, in Android in the last 24 months, which has been tremendous.",70

How does Google think generally about leveraging user data both to better target ads and how to stay competitive with those like Facebook and Microsoft and Yahoo that are leveraging data, possibly more so than what Google is today. And I think this is particularly relevant for using search data for your Display business but would love to get your thoughts on that.",84

The reason is that we take our end-user data privacy incredibly seriously and the trust that people have, with respect to giving us that information both their search histories as well as other piece of information, they get very upset very, very quickly if we, in their view, misuse it. So what we typically tell people is we're not going to do the kinds of things that you could do with this, particularly use it to generate sort of strange ads against your history and things like that without your explicit permission.

I'm glad that Patrick and Jonathan have allowed us to disclose that run rate of $2.5 billion. I think this puts us in one of the top three Display Networks in the world. I also believe that the technology suite we offer is second to none. In terms of the video versus the other display formats, it is primarily a lot of this is still display in terms of banner ads and other formats and this video is beginning to come into it. But we believe in the future there's going to be a lot more rich media involved in the Display Network. As we go forward you're going to see more and more modernization of video but it's on YouTube or other partners site that's going to happen. So we believe the Display Network we offer has maximum frequency and maximum reach. It can reach people more times a day than anyone else. I'm very excited about display. I was not sure what you meant by what would become as 100% of Display?",188

But in terms of the 1 million partners we have, the entire partner network is part of our Display Network that we offer. And we actually have the ability to offer them display advertising or text-based advertising and basically, it's based on ROI and CPMs that we make that determination or the publisher makes the determination or the advertisers make that determination.

Let me give you a couple of closing thoughts. One is, just want to reiterate that what we did today was give you a few indications of why we believe we're successful in these emerging businesses. These data points are not about giving you more information on the coming quarters, but more to give you the confidence that while we're investing and just really feeling this great growth rates in building meaningful businesses. 
I want to thank Eric for taking the time. I know he's running for the plane, but it's terrific to have you on the call, take a few minutes with our analysts and shareholders.

Good afternoon to all. Happy new year, and welcome to our Q4 earnings call. This is a very strong quarter for Google, an extraordinary and to a roller-coaster year by any measures. 17% year-on-year revenue growth and we performed, literally, I think, well across the board.
We learned a lot in 2009: The strength of our management team; the talent of our employees; pace and the innovation within our product and engineering teams. If you take a look, the investments we made, for example, with Chrome and Chrome OS that we announced over the summer; the resilience of our business model. When advertising dollars are scarce, measurement matters even more. Because we tended to benefit more than you might have expected, and that's great. And we're optimistic about the future, as a result.
The digital economy continues to grow very rapidly.  And specifically, we're moving, literally, eyeballs and advertising online. We continue to benefit from that. And our decision to start ramping up our investments in Q3, which we talked about eight to six months ago, was clearly the right one. So we'll get the benefit of that now in 2010. 
So we continue to invest heavily for the long term, investments that were designed to maintain and even increase Google's pace of innovation. So where are we investing? Well, we are obviously going to invest first in people: Engineering, the best engineering; best technical; best researchers, and so forth; and product sales in key markets across the country, in all the ways that we've talked about before. 
Second, of course, investment is in technological innovation, which is our core-value proposition, if you will. So we're going to follow the 70/20/10, which just works so well for us: 70% in our Established businesses; Search, with an emphasis on search quality and as we continue on our quest, which will never be fully realized, to create the perfect search engine. We added, for example, real-time search in Q4, which has been very successful. More than 550 search quality enhancements in 2009, far more than one per day for obvious -- and it's just continues to accelerate. Search advertising, the shift online, as I talked about, lots of growth in our core business as a result of that shift. 
Display, we've talked about before, is now a huge opportunity for Google. 60 quality improvements are display ads in last year. YouTube, great progress with our key TV and music deals in Q4, of which have been discussed already in the press.
Enterprise business, again, very strong, terrific momentum there, as people moved to the web-based model with products that really work very well. 
In the 20% area, newer businesses, these are newer business seg [segment] that few are Search business. For example, Mobile, everybody knows about the success of the Android. Our search traffic increased 5x in the past two years. The Droid and Nexus One showed the power of the Android approach, great devices, multiple partners, great features, lots of different use cases; again, a pretty clear success at this point.
And we also have our 10% of long-view investments. And here, we're interested in things like commerce and social initiatives, which Jonathan will talk some more about. 
A third component for 2010 will be acquisitions. The pace of deals in Q4 shows that we're at least on a path of one per month. And we should expect that to continue. Some big, more small than big, probably; and designed, either to build upon an existing business, the most obvious one being Terasen [ph] (00:06:16) and DoubleClick. But are also to bring in new talent if you look at, like, the Gizmo5 acquisition again, people with a unique expertise that we can use as part of our platform.
So overall, very pleased with the performance in Q4. We're back in business, full blast. And throughout 2009, if you look at it, we're investing heavily. We're excited about continuing to reinvent Search, which continues to be our core mission. I think with that, why don't we turn it over to Patrick, and take us through the numbers. Patrick?",689
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan-21-2010",2010-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,5820.0,1757631.0,68818160.0,Presenter Speech,Patrick Pichette,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Eric. Good afternoon, everyone. So I'll go through the financial results quickly, and then turn it over to Jonathan and Nikesh for more details on our performance. 
So we had a very strong finish to 2009. We're very pleased with the Q4 results. And that gives us, as Eric said, the confidence to turn our focus to the growth opportunities in 2010 already. Making already, in the back end of 2009, the necessarily and significant investments to pursue those opportunities.
So let's go through the numbers quickly. Our gross revenue grew 17% year-over-year to $6.7 billion. Our business was strong across the board in Search, Display, Apps and Mobile. Nikesh will go into more details on our performance in a few minutes on these matters.
Google website revenue was up 16% year-over-year to $4.4 billion. We saw strong growth on google.com across the world, boosted by a very strong retail season, economic recovery in many of our major geographies, as well as some favorable FX. 
We also saw some impressive growth in YouTube revenues. AdSense revenue was up 21% year-over-year to $2 billion, driven primarily by solid performance in AdSense for Search, the strength in AdSense for content and growth in our Display initiatives.
Our global aggregate paid click growth remained healthy, up 13% year-over-year and 9% quarter-over-quarter. The aggregate cost-per-click growth was also up 5% year over year and 2% quarter-over-quarter. Year-over-year CPC growth was also positively impacted by some of the FX. Remember too that this is an aggregate number, which includes both Google and AdSense properties; and also includes diverse geographic markets, some of which have lower CPCs.
 
Turning to our geographic performance, revenue from the U.S. was up 11% year-over-year, to $3.2 billion. International revenue accounted for 53% of our total revenue, or $3.5 billion, with about $8 million of benefits from hedging program this quarter. The U.K. was up 13% year-over-year to $772 million, and this despite a weaker pound in Q4 of 2009 compared to last year. Finally, using fixed year-over-year exchange rate, our international revenues would've been roughly $196 million lower.
So let me turn to expenses. Our traffic acquisition costs were $1.7 billion, or 27% of total advertising revenue. Our other costs of revenue was $688 million, including our stock-based compensation of $6 million. And finally, all other operating costs total about $1.8 billion, including approximately $270 million in stock-based compensation. 
So on a year-over-year basis, our OpEx excluding SBC was higher by $138 million and up $172 million quarter-over-quarter; the increase, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to increases in marketing expense. As a result, our non-GAAP operating profit, which excludes the stock-based compensation, increased to $2.8 billion in Q4, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin above 41%, 41.3% to be exact. 
Our headcount was also slightly up at the end of the quarter, approximately 20,000 full-time employees. And as Eric discussed, we plan to continue to aggressively hire through this year, particularly in engineering and sales.
Let me turn for a moment to cash management. Our other income and expense was $88 million for Q4. And for more details on the OI&E, please refer to the slides that accompany this call in our Investor Relations website. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23%. 
Now turning then to operating cash flow, it was also very strong at $2.7 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $221 million, again, primarily related to our data center operations.
We continue to make significant CapEx investments and these continue to be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, depending on the timing of when we're able to make these investments. The net of all these is a free cash flow, quite strong at $2.5 billion for the quarter.
So in summary, we're very pleased with the strong performance of Q4 across revenue, margins and cash flow. As we enter 2010, we're very excited about the opportunities in our core business, our Display, Mobile, Apps. And so you should expect us to continue to drive real investments in significant ways, in the areas we believe have real long-term opportunities for Google. And that will accelerate our pace of innovation.
With that, thank you for your time. I'll now turn it to Jonathan who, despite you'll hear quite a rough voice and a bad cold, I can assure you, has all his regular expected energy. Let me turn it to Jonathan.",732
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan-21-2010",2010-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,5820.0,1757631.0,68818161.0,Presenter Speech,Jonathan Rosenberg,,Executives,4,"Okay. Thank you, Patrick. I'll do my best. So naturally, I think that part of our success this past year was the result of a very focused product strategy. 
At the beginning of 2009, our strategy was basically to double down on our core, which was Search, AdWords and Display and, of course, push on monetizing YouTube. We also wanted to invest in Chrome, Chrome OS and GEO. And at the same time, we made some very hard decisions. To focus our resources, we shut down Lively, Notebook and our Ads and our Audio Ads efforts. Internally, we referred to this as the more-wood-behind-fewer-arrows approach. And I think it worked for 2009. As we look back, AdWords launched a whole new front end and several new ad formats that I think you can see are delivering results. 
Android started 2009 with just one device, and is now 20 in 48 countries. And I'm proudly carrying the gorgeous new Nexus One in my pocket. DoubleClick is now fully integrated, and Display's ramping nicely. And we open source the whole new operating system designed for the Internet era with Chrome OS. 
We also saw a steady stream of small businesses, large enterprises and lots of schools move to the cloud. And YouTube is, in fact, it turns out monetizing well. And we're hoping lots of our partners who are working with us there make money.
But most importantly, Search did particularly well in 2009. And I think that maybe the best example of what we feel we can do when we double down and focus. We launched 550 quality enhancements, which Eric mentioned. We produced a much bigger and faster index. We expanded the capabilities of universal search. And we added tools like the ""search options"" that let you work with your results to get to the best answer.
We also launched music search and real-time search, which are pretty amazing. I don't know if any of you are actually in Northern California, but we had this 4.1 earthquake a couple of weeks ago, and like my office shook while I was in it. And two minutes later, Google Search was showing me people's tweets from all over the Bay Area, talking about the quake that had just occurred. And within minutes, I was looking at news reports and the USGS [U.S. Geological Survey] data on the same quake. This looks easy, but we had to build dozens of new search technologies, so we could process the hundreds of millions of real-time changes that occur each day to make it happen.
Eric mentioned that in 2010, we're going to be investing. So let me try to take a minute to talk about how we're thinking about making those investments. Of course, we're going to pour a lot into Search. 
The key there, as always, is time to resolve. How fast can we get the user to the best answer for her or him? Whether that's a web page, a map, a video, a Twitter update, whatever it is. We're also going to work hard on making the ads richer, more diverse and more useful. We talked about the single perfect ad. And we mean that from the perspective of both the advertiser and the user at the same time.
Beyond Search and Search Ads, I think we see a few major trends that are transforming in the Internet. And we think we're in a great position to compete in those areas too. The first is social. And when you say social, I think people think of social networks. But really, we believe the entire web is social. So we're going to look at making all of our products more social. 
We think it more likely to trust a restaurant or a movie review from a friend of yours than from a stranger. So maybe, it should be rated as a higher quality result. But only for you. The Internet is also local, and we see more and more of businesses online presence is as important as its physical one. So we're trying to make it easier for businesses to manage that presence, and to connect with people who might actually be right around the corner and want to find them.
The web has also always been about commerce. And now more and more people who buy things off-line are starting their shopping process, and researching all that stuff online. And we want to help those people decide what to get and where to get it, whether it's off-line or online. 
Personalization is also getting more important, and we think mobile is a big part of that. More users, both for Search and other products, are accessing us from mobile devices. And with all the capabilities these phones that are coming out have, GPS, cameras, we think there's the potential to actually make this mobile web better than the PC web.
Finally, the shift from enterprises to online will accelerate. And now, we think organizations are moving to the cloud. Not because they save money, but because it's actually a better way to run their business. They can do things in the cloud that they simply can't do in the old desktop world. 
So those are the trends that are guiding our product plans in 2010, and we think it's going to be an exciting year. And we'll certainly look forward to sharing our progress with you on future calls. So with that, I guess I'll turn it over to Nikesh.",918
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan-21-2010",2010-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,5820.0,1757631.0,68818162.0,Presenter Speech,Nikesh Arora,,Executives,5,"Thank you, Jonathan. This was an exciting quarter for us after a challenging year. 2009 started under a cloud of uncertainty. But after about three quarters of steadily improving performance, I'm now pleased to report that we ended the year with a robust quarter in revenues.
Let me take a quick few minutes to provide details on some examples of how advertisers can and have better leverage, their online marketing to reach their audiences. 
The first macro trend affecting all of our ad-driven businesses was the continued rising adoption of online advertising by larger companies. In these tighter economic times, we saw bigger companies like Staples, Volvo, Ubisoft, Abbott Labs, et cetera. turning the increasing proportion of their spend to what is a more measurable ROI of online advertising.
We're basically shifting to where the audiences now spend their time.
Looking globally, we saw a significant uptick in retail advertisers online spending. This was for the change driven by both online e-tailers as well as traditional brick and motor companies. Our sales teams took advantage of these trend, had strong showings in Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which marked the start of the largest e-commerce holiday season in history.  
It's interesting to note, remember, Search ads are always at better value in December. CPCs go up, but CPS go down because people end up buying more during that period.
Let me give you a geographic flavor of how our revenues fared out around the world. Within the U.S., the come back [ph] of the economic recovery is being neutral, particularly in sectors with a strong ROI focus. On the other side of the Atlantic, U.K. companies and verticals that have been traditionally large spenders on off-line have also increased in online ad budgets. 
If you shift to emerging markets, we're very happy with our performance, and most of these markets we see very clear effects of underlying economic expansion again, as well as the accelerating adoption of both Search and online Display advertising.  For example, our Q4 growth in Brazil was particularly strong, driven by efforts to educate the advertisers and the under-penetrated companies to help them understand the value of online advertising and what that represents in their overall marketing mix.
The second big trend we're seeing is brand marketeers continue to better understand the online display format and incorporate that into their campaigns. With our broad portfolio products, we're pleased towards the performance of pretty much all four parts of our Display strategy: YouTube, the Google Content Network, DoubleClick and our Ad Exchange. 
In YouTube, we've had many successful brand advertising campaigns to note. One that you might have come across is Fox's integrated media campaign for Avatar, which used pretty much all four parts of our Display strategy. If you haven't seen it, you can go to the Web, to YouTube, query Avatar, and it will show you the integrated multimedia channel, with Splash [ph] advertising the movie's trailer in hi-def. 
We're also very excited about an event we held with American Express and Sony for World AIDS Day, where we streamed and hosted live Alicia Keys' benefit concert in YouTube. And the campaign, American Express and Sony, were able to reach millions of viewers in 167 countries around the world. 
Beyond YouTube, brand advertisers continue to see the value of our million publishers in our Content Network, and finally the Ad Exchange, which we launched in Q3 continues to show good progress, and is increasingly becoming an important part of the display ecosystem, we believe most of the top networks are now signed on to the Exchange.
Third, as Jonathan mentioned, we continue to see the global trend towards cloud computing speed up. As companies grow more and more comfortable with a host of applications, our sales teams are moving quickly to capitalize on these opportunities. We have key wins at Jaguar, National Geographic, as one of our most comprehensive deals with the City of Los Angeles, which moved 30,000 users to Google Apps.
So against these major commercial wins, we assigned educational deals at Virginia Tech and Fresno State, while both small and medium-sized businesses continue to adopt to Goggle Apps.
Finally, with the trends that Jonathan mentioned, with the penetration of smartphone and other mobile devices, our sales teams are continuing to work with advertisers who can reach and target their customers to mobile advertising like never before. One campaign of specific note was done by Razorfish, an agency partners of ours who used to target at mobile campaign to improve conversion rates for one of the retail clients by approximately 10%. So we continue to see promise in this area. And now I'm going to turn it over to Patrick to set up the question period.",793

I wonder if the discrepancy was due to any of the following: First, the U.S. having easier comps in international from a year ago; second, the monetization improvements you made in the U.S. that you haven't yet rolled out internationally; or third, be the fact that Display advertising is benefiting more U.S. business more than your international business at this point?",117

Q4 tends to be a modest quarter for us quality-wise. We had about a dozen launches, but the dynamic that we have there is that we tried to freeze the launches after Thanksgiving so that we have stability for our advertisers around the holiday period. So from an overall impact on RPM perspective, the quality launches are actually more modest, some of the ads changes that we made, site links, comparison ads and product extensions certainly started to take effect as did the fact that all our advertisers are now on Ad Boards Three [ph], which we think is allowing them to be much more effective in terms of their bidding efforts. But I would generally describe the quarter as relatively modest from a quality perspective. Nikesh and others maybe can give you their perspective on Mobile. The main thing that I think we're starting to see there is that advertisers are getting better at figuring out what kind of ads work on the mobile devices. The simple addition, for example, if things like, including a phone number or an offer is substantially increasing the click-through rates and the ROI for the subset of advertisers who are correctly optimizing their mobile campaign. So we're certainly seeing very strong growth there.",226

So when you think of all of the applications like Goggles, and all of the -- we would have seen on voice-recognition and navigation. That's all innovation that basically drives people to the Web with these new mobile applications. Obviously, the more people spend their time on it, then they trigger into search and then monetization occurs. So for that perspective, I think that's the core engine of the mobile model. On China, I suggest that Eric answers that one please.",114

Just a review for everybody on the call, we announced about more than a week ago, three reasonably separate facts. One, that there had been a cyber attack on Google, probably emanating from China, origin, details unknown, still under investigation. We believe we've made the necessary technical changes to prevent such a future attack. The second was a -- we discovered in the course of that, a perhaps related, perhaps unrelated, monitoring of human rights activists, which we disclosed, in the spirit that people will be aware that this may be occurring. And then third, was a decision for those reasons and other reasons, a decision for Google to no longer be willing to apply the censorship rules in China. This has a bunch of consequences, one of course is that we're in conversation with the Chinese government. The second is that our business in China is today unchanged. We continue to follow their laws. We continue to offer censored results. But at a reasonably short time from now, we will be making some changes there. We've made a strong statement that we wish to remain in China. We like the Chinese people. We like our Chinese employees. We like the business opportunities there. And we'd like to do that on somewhat different terms than we have. But we'll remain quite committed to being there. So I hope that helps.",245

Our marketing, I think it's fair to say there's two things. There's the high level and then I'll let Nikesh give a couple of comments. At the higher level, remember when we said at the end of Q3that we wanted to ramp up our investments in a bunch of areas to accelerate our growth? Marketing is one that you can actually affect in the short term quite well. And because we have such a kind of scientific approach to track it, we decided to invest a bit more in Q4.

Do you expect that to go down in Q1? And also, how much were bonus accruals for Q4 due to exceeding your full-year trend? And how should we think the bonus cycle [ph] will go down in Q1?",100

So on bonus, here's what everybody has to remember because last year, you'll remember there's a lot of questions about that. When we start a year, we reset the plan, and as we progress through the year, if we had varied to plan, whether positive or negative, then we have to make additional accruals, but at the beginning we just don't know that. So in 2010, next quarter, you can expect that we will reset our plan and therefore, we'll go back to the base number. For this year, 2009, specifically, we had actually by Q3 figured out that we had a different trajectory than the base line, and what we did is in consequence, is actually we did a combination of cash up to Q3 and Q4 to make sure that we were properly provisioned for the bonus at year end. And that's why you haven't seen like at the end of Q4 of last year, a big lift for that reason. We've increased but just in proportion to the second half of the year. So that's the key on bonus. On marketing, I think the issue from a financial perspective, clearly, we don't get any perspective view on marketing. I think the most important thing is that, we're really pleased with the experiments we're running right now in the marketing domain. And again I'll circle back to Nikesh if he wants to give more precision on it.",254

And I mentioned Click-to-Call, putting phone numbers in the mobile ads making a difference. Try something  like auto insurance on your phone, and you'll see that the progress of that on the phone actually shows the phone number while on the PC it doesn't. Nikesh gave the Razorfish example in his opening remarks, and we're also letting the advertisers target high-end devices, specific devices or specific carriers.

What I can say is the big shift we are continuing to see in Youtube is that it's gone from being a nice-to-have to an essential part of the media mix of any display campaign that our advertisers are planning. And that's a big shift from our perspective and we continue to see people. And if you look at YouTube, it's very easy to see. You will see that our homepage ads are there on there, our watch page ads are there on there. And we have been able to expand that across the world in many markets where we have YouTube in place.",117

So the retail has been particularly strong during the holiday season. Most of the large retailers have created very robust websites, and they're able to target a very, very large host of keywords, and just to some degree, automated to stop. And we continue to work with some of our smaller advertisers and bring them to frey [ph].

Obviously, the smaller ones are going to grow faster than the larger ones. We have said for a pretty long time that the next huge business for us is Display. And we put in place a series of acquisitions, a series of products. We've integrated them. We're seeing the benefit of -- I think one of the stories that's not really come out yet is how successful Google is at Display. I think you will see that especially in 2010. So if I were to talk about absolute numbers that are not Search, I would say that's probably your number one. But obviously, the smaller ones will grow faster on a relative basis. They are the most obvious one. In terms of growth rate, it would be Mobile. And a lot of that depends on the competitive dynamics of the industry, how successful the new AFMA [ph] product from us is. The AFMA ad[ph] acquisition if that comes through. We have a lot of evidence that people are moving to these data-friendly mobile devices very, very quickly. Our Search traffic is quite a -- Growth rate is quite a bit faster than our PCs. We expect that to continue. So for lots of reasons, 2010 will be a year of significant mobile revenue growth for the whole industry and I'm sure Google will play a major part of that. With respect to Apple, it's probably better to say that Apple, I, as a former board member, have a special spot for Apple in my heart. But I will tell you that Apple is a very well-run company. They've got a lot of very good stuff coming. We have a couple of very good partnerships with them. And it's clear we also compete with them in a couple of areas. And my guess is that's a pretty stable situation for a while.",324

I guess broadly, as you look forward into broader ecosystem of consumers and business partners you work with, are there newer, more unique ways that's kind of adding value to the broader ecosystem in terms of new revenue models or business models that are kind of maybe worthwhile exploring as you look ahead. And to try to break away from the sensitivity of ad business, that seems to be tied to macro. Second on Mobile, your strategy seems to be a little bit perplexing in that. You've got a partnership strategy with a slew of handset OEMs. And then the Nexus One, I guess is that a comparison of network and, oh no, is that kind of how we should think about the evolve -- the kind of evolution of that strategy, or you're just trying to push the smartphone category, and be the, obviously, the interface and the brand that consumers use to access information through those devices",182

I think the evidence would say that we faired better than most companies in a global economic downturn. And hopefully, global recovery is clearly underway at this point. We've seen that at least for six months or maybe longer. So I'm not so worried about our reliance on ads, which is the sort of the premise of your question. From our perspective, our goal, as a business, is to solve the advertisers' and the other search businesses' problems, which is ultimately about selling product and marketing them and so forth. We are in various conversations about trying to do alternative ways to distribute this traditional content. We're trying to come up with new ways of using GPS data to sort of advertise against position in place. We have a lot of initiatives in this category. The ones that we'll probably have the biggest impact are not in that, as much as those are exciting, will probably be in the Display area. Because in the aggregate's side, our Display business will give people an opportunity to reach people with visual stories, with images, with narratives, but they couldn't do a search text. So it's probably the case that the combination of local advertising, all the things that we're doing on the Display, plus some of these new and more speculative things will likely to drive a lot of new ways of solving the businesses' problems. We haven't talked very much about this. We have quite a healthy enterprise business that's going to grow, we think quite rapidly within the next few years, as people move from the older legacy sort of PC-centric traditional operating system model to the new web-based application model. And the trend there is clear. Everyone is moving there. We're going to be one of the leaders there.",321

And there isn't a lot of confusion about that. It's probably easiest to understand on the following way. What the Nexus One is really about is a new way of buying a phone. And the Nexus One is simply the first of a series of examples where you can essentially purchase a phone online from one or multiple manufacturers, self provision it or have it just work. And we think that's a natural evolution of a particular model. It does not exclude the other models, I think it's comparable with them in the sense that the retail model will continue to be quite successful. So, so far, our partners have understood that message and they have been okay with it and the Nexus One, itself, of course, is just a magnificent product.",147

Is the fourth quarter TAC decline a reflection of a declining trend in TAC or is it just seasonal? And then the second question is, I think investors have a good sense of the assets in such the Google brings to bear in the online Display space but doesn't have a good sense of the size of Google's Display business and the trend in market share there. So the question is just how big in fact does Google in Display today?",100

The fact that it's been trending down has to do simply with kind of mix issues, and it's not really tied to seasonality. So there's nothing of a big surprise there in our mind and we continue to have great partnerships with all of our partners on AdSense and others. In the case of Display, I think that the few facts that we shared already on the last webcast on Display that are worth mentioning is the industry itself is a  $17 billion industry. So it's a big pie and if you just take the TV advertising industry, which is a $170 billion industry, that is all I buy [ph] instead of shifting over time to the Internet or the digital content. That's also going to make its -- some of it's going to make it's way progressively to Display. So there's no doubt that it's a huge pie to go after. And then from our side, we clearly don't comment on the specifics of our market share or our revenue dollars, but I think you should take from the tonality of Eric's comments that this is really a big focus for us because it's got a lot of runway. And I'll leave it at that, if you don't mind.",234

If their campaign objectives are sort of response-oriented, they favor search, as well as certain parts of the Display network, which would give them a higher conversion rate and a higher clicked rate as it relates to the advertising.

And the reason is that, that the systems that they make are sort of stand-alone. In other words, they will simply maximize the amount of Search advertising they do to maximize their revenue. And then the Display decision is the decision that they make, which is both a revenue and also strategic decision around their branding and so forth.
