It's clear that after a period of significant acceleration in digital spending during the pandemic, the macroeconomic climate has become more challenging. We continue to have an extraordinary business and provide immensely valuable services for people and our partners. For example, during the World Cup final on December 18, Google Search saw its highest query per second volume of all time. And beyond our advertising business, we have strong momentum in Cloud, YouTube subscriptions and hardware.
However, our revenues this quarter were impacted by pullbacks in advertiser spend and the impact of foreign exchange. I'll focus on 2 major things today in a bit more detail, and then I'll give a shorter-than-usual quarterly snapshot from across our business. First, how we unlock the incredible opportunities AI enables for consumers, our partners and for our business; and second, how we focus our investments and make necessary decisions as a company to get there.
First, the AI opportunity ahead. AI is the most profound technology we are working on today. Our talented researchers, infrastructure and technology make us extremely well positioned as AI reaches an inflection point. More than 6 years ago, I first spoke about Google being an AI-first company. Since then, we have been a leader in developing AI. In fact, our Transformer research project and our field-defining paper in 2017 as well as our path-breaking work in diffusion models are now the basis of many of the generative AI applications you're starting to see today.
Translating these kinds of technical leaps into products that help billions of people is what our company has always strived on. Everyone working on the various projects underway is excited. We'll pursue this work boldly but with a deep sense of responsibility with our AI principles and the highest standards of information integrity at the core of all our work.
We have been preparing for this moment since early last year, and you're going to see a lot from us in the coming few months across 3 big areas of opportunity. First, large models, we published extensively about LaMDA and PaLM, the industry's largest, most sophisticated model plus extensive work at DeepMind. In the coming weeks and months, we'll make these language models available, starting with LaMDA so that people can engage directly with them. This will help us continue to get feedback, test and safely improve them.
These models are particularly amazing for composing, constructing and summarizing. They will become even more useful for people as they provide up-to-date more factual information. And in Search, language models like BERT and MUM have improved searches for 4 years now, enabling significant ranking improvements and multimodal search like Google Lens. Very soon, people will be able to interact directly with our newest, most powerful language models as a companion to Search in experimental and innovative ways. Stay tuned.
Second, we'll provide new tools and APIs for developers, creators and partners. This will empower them to innovate and build their own applications and discover new possibilities with AI on top of our language, multimodal and other AI models. Third, our AI is a powerful enabler for businesses and organizations of all sizes, and we have much more to come here.
There's a few flavors of this. Google Cloud is making our technological leadership in AI available to customers via our Cloud AI platform, including infrastructure and tools for developers and data scientists like Vertex AI. We also offer specific AI solutions for sectors like manufacturing, life sciences and retail and will continue to roll out more. Workspace users benefit from AI-powered features like Smart Canvas for collaboration and Smart Compose for creation. And we are working to bring large language models to Gmail and Docs. We'll also make available other helpful generative capabilities from coding to design and more.
And for our advertising partners, Philipp will discuss in detail how AI is powering dramatic campaign improvements and value-adding features for them. Of course, in addition to all this, AI also continues to improve Google's other products dramatically. And we'll continue our work with others outside Google, including joint research collaborations to develop AI responsibly and to apply AI to tackle society's greatest challenges and opportunities.
For example, DeepMind's protein database of all 200 million proteins known to science have now been used by 1 million biologists around the world. We continue to invest in AI across the board, and Google AI and DeepMind are integral to a bright AI-first future. Over the past few years, DeepMind has been increasingly working across groups within Google and the Other Bets And to reflect that progress, we'll be making a financial reporting change that Ruth will share more about in her comments. We are just at the beginning of our AI journey, and the best is yet to come.
The second thing I wanted to discuss is our sharpened focus. We are committed to investing responsibly with great discipline and defining areas where we can operate more cost effectively. We are focused on methodically building financially sustainable, vibrant growing businesses across Alphabet. For example, we are working to improve the economics and hardware as we focus more intently on the Pixel line and our overall cost structure there. Cloud remains very focused on its path to profitability. And there are many opportunities to build on our progress at YouTube over the years, starting with Shorts monetization. 
Overall, I see this as an important journey to reengineer the company's cost base in a durable way. There are several dimensions already underway, including prioritization of our product investments across Google and Other Bets. It also includes a careful focus on our hiring needs, reflecting these priorities as well as efficiencies in our technical infrastructure and productivity improvements from our AI tools.
As part of this, we did a rigorous review across product areas and functions to ensure that our people and roles are aligned with our highest priorities as a company and we announced a reduction in our workforce. I'm grateful to the Googlers leaving us for all of their contributions and their hard work to help people and businesses everywhere.
Let me give a few quick updates from across the business this quarter. Just this week, we started bringing revenue sharing to YouTube Shorts, which is now averaging over 50 billion daily views, up from the 30 billion I announced on the Q1 2022 call. This will reward creators and help improve the Shorts experience for everyone. Our subscription business continues to grow, with YouTube Music and Premium surpassing 80 million subscribers, including trialers. Together with YouTube Primetime channel subscriptions and YouTube TV, we have good momentum here. YouTube's NFL Sunday Ticket will accelerate that by helping to drive subscriptions, bring new viewers to YouTube's paid and ad-supported experiences and create new opportunities for creators.
Turning to hardware. Many outlets and reviewers named Pixel 7 Pro the phone of the year. Features like Magic Eraser and Photo Unblur are incredible and help differentiate Pixel from others. 2022's Pixel 6A, 7 and 7 Pro are the best-selling generation of phones we have ever launched, and we gained share in every market we operate in this year.
Next, Google Cloud. We see continued momentum with Q4 revenue growing 32%. Our differentiated products and focused go-to-market strategy continue to drive customer momentum, beginning with real-time data analytics and AI. Customers are increasingly choosing BigQuery because we unify data lakes, data warehouses and advanced AI/ML into 1 system and now analyze over 110 terabytes of data per second. Customers like Kroger can analyze data in multiple clouds without moving data in most cases, and MSCI processes unstructured and structured data at scale.
In infrastructure, our global network and advanced TPU v4 AI supercomputer helped Snap triple the throughput for its business-critical ad ranking workload while significantly lowering cost. Our machine learning infrastructure with Cloud TPU v4 Pods can run large-scale training workloads up to 80% faster than alternatives according to third-party benchmarks, which is helping customers like Bayer accelerate drug discovery. Our reliability advantages and open edge cloud powered the mission-critical 5G network of Telefonica Germany.
As I mentioned, our suite of AI/ML solutions across verticals are a key differentiator. We helped Wells Fargo automate the customer service experience for mobile users, and helped [ CA ] continually improve the quality of patient care. In 2022, Mandiant, which we are now integrating, helped over 1,800 customers prepare for or recover from the most critical cybersecurity incidents.
In Workspace, the innovations mentioned earlier are helping drive new wins and expansions across geographies. In Other Bets, from Calico to Waymo, we are focused on investing sustainably across the portfolio and creating good businesses. Verily, for example, has recently honed its strategy and structure to more clearly focus its product development.
To close, we are all standing on the cusp of an era of amazing opportunities. We are going to be bold, responsible and focused as we move into it. A healthy disregard for the impossible has been core to our company culture from the very beginning. When I look around Google today, I see that same spirit and energy driving our efforts. Thanks to our employees, our partners and people everywhere who use our services. I'm excited for what's next. Over to you, Philipp.",1555
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2023",2023-02-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3386.0,2730326.0,102339902.0,Presenter Speech,Philipp Schindler,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Sundar. Hello, everyone. It's good to be with you all. I'll start today with our Google Services performance in the fourth quarter and then dive deeper into our priority areas. Google Services revenues of $68 billion were down 2% year-on-year, negatively affected by sizable foreign exchange headwind. In Google advertising, Search and Other revenues were down 2% year-over-year, and YouTube Ads and Network had high single-digit revenue declines. Google Other revenues were up 8% year-over-year, with strong growth in YouTube, non-advertising and hardware revenues, offset by a decrease in Play revenues.
I'll highlight 2 other factors that affected our Ads business in Q4. Ruth will provide more detail. In Search and Other, revenues grew moderately year-over-year, excluding the impact of FX, reflecting an increase in retail and travel, offset partially by a decline in finance. At the same time, we saw further pullback in spend by some advertisers in Search in Q4 versus Q3. In YouTube and Network, the year-over-year revenue declines were due to a broadening of pullbacks in advertiser spend in the fourth quarter.
I'll now zoom out to share more broadly where we're investing and see clear opportunities for long-term growth. First, Google AI. It's important to recognize that our advertising business has obviously benefited over the past decade from the transition to mobile. More recently, we had outsized growth in advertising revenues during the pandemic, with 2022 advertising revenues $90 billion higher than in 2019. Going forward, we are focused on growing revenues on top of this higher base through AI-driven innovation.
Sundar highlighted the incredible opportunities underway with AI and the transformative impact it will have on businesses. Already, breakthroughs in everything from natural language understanding to generative AI are fueling our ability to deliver results that drive meaningful performance for advertisers and are useful to users. Take Smart Bidding, which uses AI to predict future ad conversions and their value, helping businesses stay agile and responsive to rapid shifts in demand.
In 2022, AI advances boosted bidding performance, allowing us to move advertiser outcomes down the funnel to drive better ROI and use budgets more efficiently. In search query matching, large language models like MUM matched advertiser offers to user queries. This understanding of human intent of language, combined with advances in bidding prediction, are why businesses can see an average of 35% more conversions when they upgrade exact match keywords to broad match in campaigns that use a target CPA.
Google AI also underlies our creative products like tech suggestions in Google ads and creative optimization and responsive search ads. We're excited to start testing our automatically created assets beta, which uses AI to generate headlines and descriptions for search created seamlessly once advertisers opt in. Then of course, there's Performance Max, which offers the best combination of our AI-powered systems to our customers. But we're not stopping here, and these examples aren't exhaustive. AI has been foundational to our ads business for the last decade, and we'll continue to bring cutting-edge advances to our products to help businesses and users.
Number two, retail. Our foundation for delivering value over the long term includes 3 pillars. First, we are on a multiyear mission to make Google a core part of shopping journeys for consumers and a valuable place for merchants to connect with users. This means constantly improving our consumer experiences, starting with a more visual, immersive, browsable search.
Second, we're empowering more merchants to participate in our free listings and ad experiences. In 2022, we saw an uptick in merchants, particularly SMBs and product inventory, coming on to Google. Adding more value for merchants remains a top priority.
Third, to drive retail performance further, we focus on great ads products, from automation and insights to bidding tools and omnichannel solutions to AI-powered campaigns like PMax. We're helping retailers hit their goals and connect with customers no matter where or when they shop.
Two quick insights on PMax, which we upgraded the majority of advertisers to from Smart Shopping Campaigns last year. First, advertisers on average see a 12% uplift from SSC to PMax. Second, it was a success story during the holidays and Cyber 5. Its ability to scale and adapt to changing traffic over a volatile peak retail season drove strong results for many retailers, particularly mid-market advertisers.
Moving on to YouTube. Despite ongoing revenue headwinds in Q4, we're confident in YouTube's long-term trajectory. Here's how we think about our strategy. It all starts with a creator ecosystem. Creators are the lifeblood of YouTube. In 2022, more people created content on YouTube than ever before, long-form, short-form, audio, podcast, music, live streams, what sets YouTube apart is we give creators more ways to create content and connect with fans and more ways to earn money than any other platform. More creators means more content, means more viewers, which leads to more opportunities for advertisers.
The creator ecosystem and our multi-format strategy will continue to drive YouTube's long-term growth. And to support that growth, we're focused on: number one, ramping Shorts; number two, accelerating engagement on large screen; number three, investing in our subscription offerings; and number four, a long-term effort to make YouTube more shoppable.
First, Shorts. Viewership is growing rapidly, as Sundar said, 50 billion-plus daily views. We're also still pleased with our continuing progress in early monetization. On the creator side, it's been impressive to see the innovative ways creators are using Shorts to introduce their content and extend existing channels. We're focused on providing creators with the best content creation and monetization tools, new, richer features and analytics capabilities that help individualize and optimize their content strategies. It's early days for Shorts but we're confident the runway is long.
Next, connected TV, where users are increasingly watching their favorite creators on the big screen at home. According to Nielsen, YouTube is the leader in U.S. streaming watch time. Advertisers are leaning in. With AI-powered solutions, we're helping brands deliver efficient reach and ROI and address pain points like frequency and measurement. 
Then there's our subscription offerings. It's clear the future of online video is about helping users seamlessly discover and watch content across ad-supported and premium services. Our goal is to be a one-stop shop for multiple types of video content. That's why we first offered YouTube Music and Premium, where 80 million-plus paid subscribers and trialers enjoy their favorite content and music ads-free.
We then expanded into YouTube TV, significantly improving on the legacy television experience. And then last fall, Primetime Channels launched, making streaming subscription services available on YouTube on an ala carte basis. Given the potential we see in our subscription offerings, we recently announced a multiyear agreement to distribute NFL Sunday Ticket. As Sundar highlighted, we're excited about the opportunities this will open up.
Lastly is our focus on shoppable YouTube. It's still nascent, but we see lots of potential on making it easier for people to shop from the creators, brands and content they love.
I'll close with something I've said many times before. Our success is only possible because of our customers and partners. The reality is we only do well when they do well. Since our earliest days, our revenue share models have been structured around ROI for our partners, from Play developers and online publishers to YouTube creators, artists and media orgs around the world. Over the last 3 years, I'm proud to share that we've contributed more than $200 billion to these ecosystems. We remain as committed as ever to fueling the next generation of businesses, media companies and creativity on the web.
On that note, a big thank you to our partners and customers for their ongoing collaboration and trust, and to Googlers for their energy, focus and dedication to helping our users, customers and partners succeed, especially through these tougher times.
Ruth, over to you.",1309
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2023",2023-02-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3386.0,2730326.0,102339903.0,Presenter Speech,Ruth Porat,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Philipp. For the full year 2022, Alphabet delivered revenues of $283 billion, up 10% versus 2021 and up 14% on a constant currency basis, adding $37 billion to revenues, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. I will briefly cover the main points of our fourth quarter results and then turn to our outlook to give you more context for Sundar's comments on how we're focused on investing for growth as well as on reengineering our cost base for long-term success.
For the fourth quarter, our consolidated revenues were $76 billion, up 1% or up 7% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth on a constant currency basis. Our total cost of revenues was $35.3 billion, up 7%. Other cost of revenues of $22.4 billion were up 15%. The increase was driven by 2 factors. First, hardware costs due primarily to $1.2 billion in inventory-related charges, and secondarily, to strong unit sales. The charges reflect ongoing pricing pressures and changes in expected future inventory needs.
Second, costs associated with data centers and other operations. Operating expenses were $22.5 billion, up 10%, reflecting an increase in R&D expenses, primarily driven by headcount growth, followed by an increase in G&A expenses, primarily reflecting an increase in charges related to accrued legal matters. These increases were partially offset by a decline in sales and marketing expenses primarily due to lower advertising and promotional spend. Operating income was $18.2 billion, down 17% versus last year, and our operating margin was 24%. Net income was $13.6 billion. 
We delivered free cash flow of $16 billion in the fourth quarter and $60 billion in 2022. We ended the year with $114 billion in cash and marketable securities. We also repurchased a total of $59 billion of our Class A and Class C shares in 2022.
Turning to our segment results, starting with Google Services. Revenues were $67.8 billion, down 2%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $42.6 billion in the quarter were down 2%. Search delivered moderate underlying growth in Q4, absent the impact of currency movements on reported results. YouTube advertising revenues of $8 billion were down 8%. Network advertising revenues of $8.5 billion were down 9%.
Other revenues were $8.8 billion, up 8%, reflecting several factors: first, significant subscriber growth in YouTube Music Premium and YouTube TV; second, strong growth in hardware revenues, primarily from the Pixel family. Offsetting growth in these 2 areas was a year-on-year decline in Play revenues, reflecting a particularly large foreign exchange headwind in APAC as well as the impact of reductions of Play Store fees. TAC was $12.9 billion, down 4%. Google Services operating income was $21.1 billion, down 19%. And the operating margin was 31%.
Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $7.3 billion for the quarter, up 32%. Revenue growth in GCP was again greater than Google Cloud, reflecting strength in both infrastructure and platform services. Google Workspace's strong results were driven by increases in both seats and average revenue per seat. In Q4, we saw slower growth of consumption as customers optimized GCP costs, reflecting the macro backdrop. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $480 million. As to our Other Bets, for the full year 2022, revenues were $1.1 billion, and the operating loss was $6.1 billion.
Turning to our outlook for the business. In 2022, our year-on-year revenue growth was affected by a number of challenges. First, we faced very tough comps, given the outsized recovery in 2021 from the impact of the pandemic. Second, foreign exchange headwinds grew throughout the year. And third, we were operating against the backdrop of a more challenging economic climate that also impacted many of our customers and which remains ongoing.
Within Google Services, we are focused on investing in the opportunities we see for long-term revenue growth. First, within advertising, we are focused on using advances in AI to drive new and better experiences for users and search as well as to deliver better measurement, higher ROI and tools for more compelling creative content to advertisers. In YouTube, we are prioritizing continued growth in Shorts engagement and monetization while also working on other initiatives across our ad-supported products.
As to our outlook for other revenues, in Play, 2022 results reflected the particularly sizable impact from foreign exchange, lapping the uplift in user activity during the pandemic and the impact from the fee reductions we introduced. We remain optimistic about the longer-term prospects for mobile apps and gaming although remain more cautious near term, given industry trends.
With YouTube subscriptions, we're optimistic about building on its momentum across YouTube Music Premium, YouTube TV and Primetime Channels. In hardware, we continue to make sizable investments particularly to support innovation across our Pixel family while working to drive greater focus and cost efficiencies across the portfolio.
For Google Cloud, we remain excited about the long-term market opportunity and the trajectory of the business. Enterprises and governments are increasingly turning to us for their digital transformation initiatives across verticals and geographies. While investing for growth, we remain very focused on Google Cloud's path to profitability. In terms of Other Bets, as Sundar mentioned, we will be making a financial reporting change as it relates to DeepMind. To reflect the increasing DeepMind collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud and Other Bets, beginning in the first quarter, DeepMind will no longer be reported in Other Bets and will be reported as part of Alphabet's corporate costs. 
I'll now walk you through the key elements of our efforts to deliver a durable reengineering of our cost base in order to slow the pace of operating expense growth. We expect the impact will become more visible in 2024. First, with respect to Alphabet headcount, we are meaningfully slowing the pace of hiring in 2023 while still investing in priority areas. In Q4, we added 3,455 people. As in prior quarters, the majority of hires were for technical roles.
With respect to our recent announcement that we are reducing our workforce by approximately 12,000 roles, most of the impact will be seen in Q1. We will take a severance charge of $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion, which will be reported in corporate costs. We will continue hiring in priority areas with a particular focus on top engineering and technical talent as well as on the global footprint of our talent.
Second, we have a longer-term effort underway to reengineer our cost base in 3 broad categories: first, using AI and automation to improve productivity across Alphabet for operational tasks as well as the efficiency of our technical infrastructure; second, managing our spend with suppliers and vendors more effectively; and third, optimizing how and where we work. In the first quarter of 2023, we expect to incur approximately $500 million of costs related to exiting leases to align our office space with our adjusted global headcount look. This will be reflected in corporate costs. We will continue to optimize our real estate footprint.
Turning to CapEx. For 2023, we expect total CapEx to be generally in line with 2022, with an increase in technical infrastructure versus a decline in office facilities. Our ongoing investment in technical infrastructure is obviously a critical component of supporting our long-term growth opportunities.
Finally, I will point you to our earnings release in which we noted that we adjusted the estimated useful lives of servers and certain network equipment starting in Q1 '23. We expect these changes will favorably impact our 2023 operating results by approximately $3.4 billion for assets and service as of year-end 2022. Thank you. Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions.",1273

The first one around AI and sort of the cost of AI. I appreciate all the color about all the AI tools that are to come. I guess, first question is, how should we think about the potential impact on CapEx, and the higher compute intensity of these AI tools to come potentially impacting margins over the next couple of years?
And then the second one, Ruth, I really appreciate the conversation about long-term efforts underway to improve efficiency. How should we think about potential impacts of those efforts in '23 and in '24? Have you sort of run any sizes of what types of savings we could see roll through the P&L over that period?",119
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2023",2023-02-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3386.0,2730326.0,102339906.0,Answer,Ruth Porat,,Executives,7,"Thanks for the question. So starting on your question about AI and CapEx. As I think Sundar and Philipp both noted, AI is already incorporated in many of our products, products like Performance Max and Smart Bidding and Cloud, as Sundar said. It is more compute-intensive but also opens up many more services and products for our users, for creators, for advertisers.
That being said, we're very focused on further optimizing the cost of compute, and that's across all elements, data center, servers and our supply chain. So we're continuing to invest with a keen lens on the return on that capital. And as I indicated in opening comments, when we look at CapEx for 2023, we do expect it's going to be generally in line with 2022 with an important mix shift. We're increasing our investments in technical infrastructure. And that's not just for AI. That's to support investments across Alphabet, in particular in Cloud as well. And at the same time, we're meaningfully decreasing our CapEx for office facilities.
And then with respect to the overall efficiency opportunities, yes, very keen focus on the 3 areas that I noted, and one of the key elements of it is using AI and automation to improve productivity and efficiency of our technical infrastructure. We noted that we want to be focused and that we are focused on durable improvements to our expense base. And that's because if you go through the items, the work streams that we have in flight, they take longer to implement, execute. They're in process now, and they continue to build on themselves and continue to provide added upside as we go through time, which is why I indicated you would see more of an impact on 2024 than in 2023. But we're continuing to work through them.",302
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2023",2023-02-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3386.0,2730326.0,102339907.0,Question and Answer Operator Message,Operator,,Operator,8,And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with Nathanson (sic) [ MoffettNathanson ].,14

For Sundar and Philipp, you both mentioned the NFL in your remarks and the opportunities it opens up. Can you comment and help us define what do you see is that longer-term opportunity? Why is it so critical to have the NFL? Is this the first of many sports deals to be had? So anything to just help us why this is so important to you.
And then just, Philipp, you've said in the past about the scaling of monetization, YouTube Shorts. What are the sticky factors? What's taking time to really bring advertisers on? And what are some of the things you've seen in terms that you've solved to make this a more quickly monetizable product?",120
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2023",2023-02-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3386.0,2730326.0,102339909.0,Answer,Philipp Schindler,,Executives,10,"Yes. Thank you so much for the question. We think there is a lot of great opportunities to differentiate the user and creator experience with our unique capabilities. It basically means that every YouTube viewer who is interested in the NFL can now have 1-click access to the full offering of Sunday Ticket as an add-on package on YouTube TV subscription and as a stand-alone offering on Primetime Channels. This will be the first time that Sunday Ticket is actually available a la carte for fans.
On YouTube TV, we're building the ability for subscribers to, for example, watch multiple screens at once. And on YouTube CTV, we'll be adding new features specific to the Sunday Ticket experience like comments, chats, polls and so on. On the creator side, imagine all the innovative ways they can create with exclusive NFL content, behind-the-scenes event access and so on. And we're really excited to see what they'll do across long-form, shorts, live streams and more.
On your second question, on the Shorts side, as I said earlier, viewership is growing rapidly, 50 billion-plus daily views, up from 30 billion last spring. We're still pleased with our continuing progress in monetization. Closing the gap between Shorts and long-form is a big priority for us, as is, of course, continuing to build a great creator and user experience, which we're paying a lot of attention to. As on Shorts are now available, it gives you a bit of a sign for the progress. We have video action, app discovery, Performance Max campaigns. And via product feed, Shorts are also shoppable.
And again, we're the only destination where creators can produce all forms of content across multiple formats, across multiple screens and really with multiple ways to make a living. And Sundar shared just yesterday, we brought revenue sharing to Shorts via our YouTube Partner Program. Ultimately, our goal is to make YouTube the best place for Shorts and creators. And that's really what our focus is at the moment.",335

For Sundar, can you just talk more about how you can bring the AI products to market with the principles and integrity that you talked about, and how you can do that without kind of sacrificing quality or trust along the way?
And then, Ruth, clearly, the language around reengineering the cost structure in a durable way and everything that went along with it is different than what we've heard in the past. Is there any way at all to help us quantify how you're thinking about these efforts?",96
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2023",2023-02-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3386.0,2730326.0,102339912.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,13,"Thanks, Doug. On the AI side, it is a really exciting time. I think we've been investing for a while, and it's clear that the market is ready. Consumers are interested in trying out new experiences. I think I feel comfortable with all the investments we have made in making sure we can develop AI responsibly. And we'll be careful. We'll be launching more as labs products in certain cases, beta features in certain cases and just slowly scaling up from there. Obviously, we need to make sure we are iterating in public, these models will keep getting better so the field is fast changing. The serving costs will need to be improved.
So I view it as very, very early days, but we are committed to putting our experiences, both in terms of new products and experiences, actually bringing direct LLM experiences in Search, making APIs available for developers and enterprises and learn from there and iterate like we've always done. So I'm looking forward to it.",168
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2023",2023-02-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3386.0,2730326.0,102339913.0,Answer,Ruth Porat,,Executives,14,"And then on your second question, when we talk about being focused on delivering sustainable financial value, that obviously means that expense growth cannot be growing ahead of revenue growth. And we're focused on revenue upside as well as durable changes to the expense base to really ensure we have the capacity to invest in that growth. And clearly, the emphasis of revenue growth, there's a lot that's exciting ahead of us within Google Services, all of the AI advancements that are improving advertiser ROI and the search user experience and more broadly, as we've talked about across the key product areas.
And then very importantly, on expense growth, we have a very strong commitment to -- we keep emphasizing durably reengineer our cost base, and that will benefit all of the segments across Alphabet. And the key components, slowing the pace of hiring as a starting point, product prioritization across Google, as Sundar said, is key. Improving economics in hardware as we focus intently on the Pixel line and cost structure, then using AI and automation to improve productivity for operational tasks as well as for the efficiency of our technical infrastructure, where we have a number of work streams. Managing our spend, as I said, with suppliers and vendors and then optimizing how and where we work, and you saw part of that with the real estate consolidation, given the slower headcount growth.
All of those not only benefit Google Services but many of those similarly drive greater efficiency across Alphabet. And so as we've said, in Cloud, we remain very focused on the path to profitability. That's a revenue and margin driver. And then with Other Bets, we're similarly focused on investing sustainably. 
And so to go back to it, it's the durable nature of change in some of the elements that I've talked about here where work is ongoing, you start to see impacting in '23 but to really get full year run rate and the benefit of it, there is work ongoing. And that's why we've emphasized this notion of it comes in and then really you see the run rate in '24.",358

Sundar, for you, continuing on the AI theme, how do you think philosophically about capturing the opportunity set that you see in front of you, given all the investments you've made over the last 5-plus years that we've been talking about going back to a lot of Google I/Os versus potentially disrupting the user experience or the monetization arc in your existing product set and striking the right balance between the opportunity set and being disruptive to yourself when you think about looking forward over the next couple of years?
And then, Ruth, maybe just following on some of the questions and debates on the cost structure. Obviously, Other Bets is an area where the losses continue to be sort of higher than what some of us think from the outside looking in. But then you showed some improvement in the losses in the Cloud division this quarter. How should we be thinking about the rationalization of the cost structure and aligning costs with opportunity sets across some of the divisions of Alphabet when you think for the medium to long term?",187
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2023",2023-02-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3386.0,2730326.0,102339916.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,17,"Thanks, Eric. Look, I do think, first of all, we made such a foundational technology and we've been investing not just in terms of research but actually getting it all production scale-ready. We had already deployed. If you look at the impact, things like BERT and MUM have had on search quality, making search multimodal, driving the usage of products like Google Lens. I feel like we've been scaling up well.
In Google Cloud today with Vertex AI, we'd already been bringing AI APIs to enterprises, and they're on a pretty healthy growth path. So we do see secular opportunities ahead, both in terms of putting these APIs out, making sure every developer, every organization in the world can use it. And as I said earlier, we are in very, very early days, and I think there's a lot of room ahead.
In terms of Search too, now that we can integrate more direct LLM-type experiences in Search, I think it will help us expand and serve new types of use cases, generative use cases. And so I think I see this as a chance to rethink and reimagine and drive Search to solve more use cases for our users as well. So again, early days, you will see us be bold, put things out, get feedback and iterate and make things better.",223
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2023",2023-02-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3386.0,2730326.0,102339917.0,Answer,Ruth Porat,,Executives,18,"And then in terms of your question about Other Bets investment levels, so as we've talked about in prior calls, our goal for Other Bets is to use our deep technology investments to drive innovation with real potential for value creation. And at the same time, we are very focused on the overall pace of investment and the financial returns. And so what we're really looking at here are what are the opportunities for monetization and commercialization.
As I've said on prior calls, there is no monolithic approach across the portfolio, but we are very focused on whether -- what's the pace of investment opportunities for monetization and commercialization. And just a bit more with respect to the DeepMind move, to be very clear, we consolidate in Other Bets into Google only when that bet supports products and services within Google or for Alphabet broadly. And you saw us do that some time ago when we moved Chronicle as an example into combining with our Cloud business and really the cybersecurity offering that is now in Cloud, and that was very effective.
With AI, this is obviously an Alphabet strategic priority, and we see huge opportunity ahead, and DeepMind's research is core to that future across the product areas in the Alphabet portfolio. And so this reporting change reflects the strategic focus in DeepMind, the support of each one of our segments, and that's why I indicated that beginning Q1, DeepMind financials will be reported within our corporate cost segment.",250

Can you talk about the pressures there, volume versus pricing or CPCs? What's really driving the slowdown? It's kind of almost back to '09 recession levels. Just think about that.

And so that's why you've heard so many comments about the application of AI and what that means for the ongoing opportunity. You had a number of different questions in there. I think one was on volumes. In the 10-K that we'll be filing shortly, you'll see that for the full year 2022, CPCs were down 1% versus last year. And as we've talked about in prior quarters, the change in CPCs can reflect a number of different factors: geographic mix, property mix, all sorts of things.
Clicks were up 10% in 2022, reflecting a number of factors, including increased engagement, primarily on mobile devices and improvements in ad formats. But I think overall, we're really excited about what we see ahead. We're not going to predict the global environment. We did say the challenging backdrop is ongoing, and you can see that but we're very focused on what we can control. And I think most important and what we're really excited about here is innovation to help advertisers overall and our cost reengineering that really gets us to align this long-term sustainable value creation.",207

First of all, very, very pleased with how Pixel has performed through a challenging macro environment. Look, I think our computing portfolio is incredibly important. It's what allows us to -- for us to invest and drive innovation forward. You have to put it all together as a product and ship it. And I think it ends up playing a very, very big role in guiding the ecosystem as well.
And increasingly, I think users are thinking beyond phones and thinking through a holistic ecosystem. To give one example, us undertaking Pixel Watch and, as part of that, integrating Fitbit and bringing it to our ecosystem as well, partnering closely with Samsung on wearables. The combination is what has driven over a 300% increase in actives on Android watches ecosystem. So just to give you a context on that.
So we are very thoughtful about how we are approaching this area. And as Ruth mentioned, across all these areas, too, we are working to drive greater focus and cost efficiencies in the portfolio. Obviously, we work through a challenging supply chain environment as well as a challenging environment on the demand side. And so we'll continue focusing on improving all of this in a durable way.",208

And just talk through how that gets done. You had almost 40% growth in Google Cloud. The operating loss level stayed about the same from '21 to '22, so the growth is there. What are the factors that need to be solved in order to get pretty nice profitability out of that segment sort of anywhere akin to what Azure and AWS have been able to show over the years?",89

So as we've talked about on prior calls, with Google Cloud, we've really been investing ahead of our revenues, given the growth and the opportunity overall and the desire to ensure that we're equipped, able to support customers across segments around the globe. And so there's been meaningful investments to position ourselves to really have the momentum that the team has continued to deliver.
That being said, they are, as both Sundar and I have noted, extremely focused on the path to profitability and every element of that. And some of the items that I noted that benefit Alphabet generally most certainly are relevant here for Cloud as well, everything from our efficiency with our technical infrastructure, which we're very excited about, all the efforts that they're doing there and more broadly.
So this has been really to ensure, first and foremost, given the scale of the opportunity and the speed with which it's moving that we're positioned to be present with our customers, to provide them with the analytics, the skills, the capabilities that are needed to build for long-term growth. And we're at a position now where we've meaningfully closed the gap to profitability but still are working through as we continue to invest for growth while narrowing what this is on our march to profitability.",222

I'm pleased with our business performance in the first quarter, with Search performing well and momentum in Cloud. We introduced important product updates anchored in deep computer science and AI. Our North Star is providing the most helpful answers for our users, and we see huge opportunities ahead, continuing our long track record of innovation. 
On Cloud, we continue to be on a long and exciting journey to build that business. Cloud delivered profitability this quarter, and we remain focused on long-term value creation here. 
Today, I'll give an update on the 2 themes I spoke about last quarter: one, our advancements in AI and how they are driving opportunities in Search and beyond; and two, our efforts to sharpen our focus as a company. Then I'll talk about our momentum in Cloud and close with our progress at YouTube. 
First, the incredible AI opportunity for consumers, our partners and for our business. I've compared it to the successful transition we made from desktop to mobile computing over a decade ago. Our investments and breakthroughs in AI over the last decade have positioned us well. 
In our last call, I outlined 3 areas of opportunity: continuing to develop state-of-the-art large language models and make significant improvements across our products to be more helpful to our users; empowering developers, creators and partners with our tools; and enabling organizations of all sizes to utilize and benefit from our AI advances. 
We have made good progress across all 3 areas. In March, we introduced our experimental conversational AI service called Bard. We have since added our PaLM model to make it even more powerful. And Bard can now help people with programming and software development tasks, including code generation. Lots more to come. 
For developers, we have released our PaLM API alongside our new MakerSuite tool. It provides a simple way to access our large language models and begin building new generative AI applications quickly. A number of organizations are using our generative AI large language models across Google Cloud Platform, Google Workspace and our cybersecurity offerings. 
For years, we've been focused on making Search even more helpful. From Google Lens to multi-search, to visual exploration in Search, immersive view in Maps, Google Translate, to all the language models powering Search today, we have used AI to open up access to knowledge in powerful ways. We'll continue to incorporate generative AI advances to make Search better in a thoughtful and deliberate way. We'll be guided by data and years of experience about what people want and our high standards for quality. And we'll test and iterate as we go because we know that billions of people trust Google to provide the right information. 
As it evolves, we'll unlock entirely new experiences in Search and beyond just as camera, voice and translation technologies have all opened entirely new categories of queries and exploration. 
AI has also been foundational to our ads business for over a decade. Products like Performance Max use the full power of Google's AI to help advertisers find untapped and incremental conversion opportunities. Philipp will talk more about this in a moment. 
And as we continue to bring AI to our products, our AI principles and the highest standards of information integrity remain at the core of all our work. As one example, our Perspective API helps to identify and reduce the amount of toxic text that language models train on, with significant benefits for information quality. This is designed to help ensure the safety of generative AI applications before they are released to the public. 
We are proud to have world-class research teams who have been advancing the breakthroughs underpinning this new era of AI. Last week, I announced that we are bringing together the Brain Team in Google Research and DeepMind into one unit. Combining all this talent into one focused team, backed by the pooled computational resources of Google, will help accelerate our progress and develop the most capable AI systems safely and responsibly. 
On to my second theme, the company's sharpened focus. I spoke last quarter about our commitment to invest responsibly and with discipline and to find areas where we can operate more cost effectively and with greater velocity. We have significant multiyear efforts underway to create savings, such as improving machine utilization and finding more scalable and efficient ways to train and serve machine learning models. We are making our data centers more efficient, redistributing workloads and equipment where servers aren't being fully used. This is important work as we continue to significantly invest in infrastructure to drive our many AI opportunities. 
Improving external procurement is another area where data suggests significant savings, and this work is underway. And we are taking concrete steps to manage our real estate portfolio to ensure it meets our current and future needs. We'll continue to use data to determine additional areas for durable savings. 
Next, Google Cloud. I'm pleased with the ongoing momentum in Cloud. Our disciplined expansion of our product road map and go-to-market organization has helped to build one of the largest enterprise software companies in the world. We have consistently grown top line revenues and improved annual operating margins, and we continue to do so this quarter. Our growth has come from our deep relationships with large enterprises, a strong partner ecosystem and our product leadership. 
Over the past 3 years, GCP's annual deal volume has grown nearly 500%, with large deals over $250 million growing more than 300%. Nearly 60% of the world's 1,000 largest companies are Google Cloud customers, and many leading start-ups and millions of small and medium enterprises use Google Cloud. 
We have also built a strong partner ecosystem. Over the last 4 years, the number of Google Cloud Partner certified practitioners around the world has increased more than 15x. The largest global system integrators have built 13 dedicated practices with Google Cloud compared to 0 when we started. And today, more than 100,000 companies are part of our Google Cloud Partner Advantage program. 
Our growth is also driven by our product leadership. We are bringing our generative AI advances to our cloud customers across our cloud portfolio. Our PaLM generative AI models and Vertex AI platform are helping Behavox to identify insider threats, Oxbotica to test its autonomous vehicles and Lightricks to quickly develop text-to-image features. 
In Workspace, our new generative AI features are making content creation and collaboration even easier for customers like Standard Industries and Lyft. This builds on our popular AI Bard Workspace tools, Smart Canvas and Translation Hub used by more than 9 million paying customers. 
Our product leadership also extends to data analytics, which provides customers the ability to consolidate their data and understand it better using AI. New advances in our data cloud enable Ulta Beauty to scale new digital and omnichannel experiences while focusing on customer loyalty; Shopify to bring better search results and personalization using AI; and Mercedes-Benz to bring new products to market more quickly. 
We have introduced generative AI to identify and prioritize cyber threats, automate security workflows and response and help scale cybersecurity teams. Our cloud cybersecurity products helped protect over 30,000 companies, including innovative brands like Broadcom and Europe's Telepass. We are successfully integrating Mandiant with our products, including Mandiant Threat Intelligence and Breach Analytics. 
Our open approach to AI development, coupled with our industry-leading TPUs and best-in-class GPUs from NVIDIA, enable innovative companies to tackle any AI workload with speed and flexibility. AI21 Labs, Replit, Midjourney and many others build and train foundation models and generative AI platforms. We are the only cloud provider to announce availability of NVIDIA's new L4 Tensor Core GPU with the launch of our G2 VMs, which are purpose-built for large inference AI workloads, such as generative AI. 
Turning next to YouTube. Let me start by thanking Susan Wojcicki for her terrific leadership of YouTube for 9 years. She recently transitioned into an advisory role with Alphabet this quarter, with Neal Mohan, a long-time leader at Google and YouTube, becoming the new head of YouTube. 
Here are a few highlights from the quarter. YouTube Shorts continues to see strong momentum with Creators. Last year, the number of channels that uploaded to Shorts daily grew over 80%. Those posting weekly on Shorts saw the majority of new channel subscribers coming from their Shorts post. The living room remained our fastest-growing screen in 2022 in terms of watch time, and we are seeing growth and momentum internationally. 
On our subscription business, we rolled out several new updates to YouTube Premium. Premium subscribers can now queue videos on phones and tablets, stream continuously while switching between devices and auto-download recommended videos for off-line viewing. 
And we have great momentum around YouTube TV and YouTube Primetime channels. We have announced pricing for the NFL Sunday Ticket offering, which will help to drive subscriptions, bring new viewers to YouTube's paid and ad-supported experiences and create new opportunities for Creators. 
To close across the company, we are excited about helping people, businesses and society reach their full potential with AI. We'll share updates at Google I/O about how we are using AI across our products, including our Pixel devices and share some exciting new developments for Android. 
Thanks to our employees around the world who continue to work hard to advance our mission. After nearly 25 years, the work to organize the world's information and make it accessible and useful is as urgent as ever, and I look forward to the work ahead.

It's great to be here today. I'll kick off with Google Services' performance in the first quarter, then provide color into our key opportunity areas and then turn it over to Ruth for more on our financial performance. 
Google Services revenue of $62 billion were up 1% year-on-year, including the effect of a modest foreign exchange headwind. In Google Advertising, Search and Other, revenues grew 2% year-over-year, reflecting an increase in the travel and retail verticals, offset partially by a decline in finance as well as in media and entertainment. In YouTube Ads, we saw signs of stabilization and performance, while in network, there was an incremental pullback in advertiser spend. Google Other revenues were up 9% year-over-year led by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions revenues. 
Now let's double-click into the 3 areas I laid out last quarter where we see clear opportunities for long-term growth in advertising: number one, Google AI; number two, retail, which cuts across all of our ads products and services; and number three, YouTube. 
First, Google AI. I've said before, AI has long been an important driver of our business. Advancements are powering our ability to help businesses, big and small, respond in real time to rapidly changing market and consumer shifts and deliver measurable ROI when it's needed most. In Q1, we continue to innovate across our products. 
Take Core Search, for example. In targeting, we updated search keyword relevance using the latest natural language AI from MUM models to improve the relevance and performance of shown ads when there are multiple overlapping keywords eligible for an auction. 
In bidding, we improved our Smart Bidding models to bid more accurately based on differences in search ad formats. In other words, bid more effectively depending on how a user wants to engage with an ad. 
In Creatives, we opened our Automatically Created Assets beta to all advertisers in English. ACA generates text assets alongside your responsive search ads and uses AI to help reduce the amount of manual work to keep creatives fresh and relevant to users' query, context and to the advertisers' business. 
To then unlock Core Search further and maximize conversions across all of Google, we're actively helping more advertisers paired together with Performance Max. Advertisers who use PMax are, on average, achieving over 18% more conversions at a similar CPA. This is up 5 points in just 14 months, thanks to advances in the AI underlying bidding, creatives, search query matching and new formats like YouTube Shorts. 
I mentioned earlier that travel was a contributor to growth. In March, we launched PMax for travel goals. Now even the smallest hoteliers can benefit from the expanded reach of hotel ads in PMax, like family-run Corissia Hotels Group, who drove a 32% increase in revenue and a 26% increase in total direct bookings within just 1 month of using PMax for travel goals. There's more to come here as we add even more AI product features. Stay tuned for more at Google Marketing Live in May. 
Moving on to retail where we had a solid quarter. Our focus is on 3 pillars: number one, making Google a core part of shopping journeys for consumers and a valuable place for merchants to connect with users; number two, empowering more merchants to participate in our free listings and ads experiences; and number three, driving retail performance further with great ads products. 
In a macro environment of do more with less, our tools and solutions are proving that we can deliver value for retailers online and omnichannel and drive high-value customers even in challenging times. Caraway, a direct-to-consumer maker of cookware, use Target ROAS to uncap budgets and PMax to optimize and deploy spend across Google inventory for its Q4 Black Friday campaign. PMax drove a 46% increase in revenue and 31% jump in ROAS, leading to Caraway's best business day in history and a robust reinvestment in its AI-first strategy for Q1.
For omni-focused retailers, we recently rolled out store sales reporting and bidding in Performance Max for store goals. This is helping retailers go beyond just optimizing to online conversions to also optimize to their stores, reaching and bidding for high-value customers who are more likely to spend in store. 
Danish department store, Magasin, recently used our store sales solution to boost its omnichannel ROAS 128% versus online-only campaigns. Thanks to dynamic in-store values coming from its first-party data, including its high-value customers, Magasin can now, with confidence, measure the full impact of its online investments on both e-commerce and physical store revenue. 
Turning to YouTube. Creators fuel YouTube's success. Across long form and shorts, music and podcasts, vertical and horizontal, YouTube is where Creators are incentivized to make their best work, which means the best content, more viewers and more opportunities for advertisers. 
As I said last quarter, our creator ecosystem and multi-format strategy will be key drivers of YouTube's long-term growth. And to support this growth, we're focused on, number one, Shorts; number two, engagement on CTV; number three, investing in our subscription offerings; and number four, a longer-term effort to make YouTube more shoppable. 
First, Shorts. We're seeing strong watch time growth. Monetization is also progressing nicely. People are engaging and converting on ads across Shorts at increasing rates. 
Number two, connected TV. As Sundar said, we're seeing momentum globally. Viewers love watching YouTube creators and their favorite content on the large screen. Advertisers are leaning in. 
Zooming out more broadly for a second. Across YouTube, we're helping brands benefit from our expansive reach and drive the profitability they're looking for. In one of our largest marketing mix modeling studies to date, YouTube ROI is 40% higher than linear TV and 34% higher than all other online video, according to a customer analysis from January 2020 to March 2022 of Nielsen Compass ROI benchmarks across 16 countries and $19 billion of total media spend measured. This proves YouTube's ability to drive effectiveness at scale. 
Next up are subscription offerings. The goal is to be a one-stop shop for multiple types of video content across both ad-supported and Premium services. Our launch of multiview on YouTube TV and our first-of-its-kind a la carte access for NFL Sunday Ticket are 2 examples of how we're investing here. Expect more updates over the coming quarters. 
Number four, shopping on YouTube. It's still super early days. One highlight, last year, we brought shopping to more creators and brands by partnering with commerce platforms like Shopify. Now more than 100,000 creators, artists and brands have connected their own stores to their YouTube channels to sell their products. We're excited about the potential ahead. 
I'll close with an awesome example of how we're bringing the best across Google to our partners to accelerate innovation, Mercedes-Benz. In February, we announced a first-of-its-kind partnership to bring Google Maps platform and YouTube into future Mercedes-Benz vehicles equipped with its next-gen MB.OS operating system. Beyond enabling the luxury automaker to design a customized navigation interface, we'll also provide AI and data cloud capabilities to advance their autonomous driving efforts and create an enhanced customer experience. 
On that note, a big thank you, first, to our customers and partners for their trust and collaboration; and second, to all Googlers for all of their incredible work this quarter. 
Ruth, over to you.",1223
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2023",2023-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3454.0,2785595.0,103955304.0,Presenter Speech,Ruth Porat,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Philipp. Our financial results for the first quarter reflect continued healthy fundamental growth in Search and momentum in Cloud. As I go through the discussion today, I will reference some changes to our reporting and disclosures that are covered more fully in the 8-K we filed last week. I will conclude with our outlook. 
For the first quarter, our consolidated revenues were $69.8 billion, up 3% or up 6% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth on a constant currency basis. 
In terms of expenses and profitability, year-on-year comparisons are impacted by 3 factors: first, the $2.6 billion in charges we took in the first quarter related to workforce and office space reductions. We provided a table in our earnings release that shows the impact of those charges on cost of revenues and operating expenses. 
Second, the adjustment we made to the estimated useful lives of servers and certain network equipment at the beginning of 2023. As you can see in our earnings release, the effect for the first quarter was a reduction in depreciation expense of $988 million. 
Third, the shift in timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation awards from January to March delays the step-up in SBC from Q1 to Q2. This shift in timing does not affect the total amount of SBC over the full year 2023. 
Total cost of revenues was $30.6 billion, up 3%, driven by other cost of revenues of $18.9 billion, which was up 7%, the biggest factor of which was compensation costs associated with data centers and other operations and followed by content acquisition costs. 
Operating expenses were $21.8 billion, up 19%, with a significant impact from the charges related to workforce and office space reductions. Operating income was $17.4 billion, down 13%, and our operating margin was 25%. Net income was $15.1 billion. 
We delivered free cash flow of $17.2 billion in the first quarter and $62 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $115 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
Turning to our segment results. These were affected by 2 additional changes outlined in our 8-K filing. First, reflecting the increasing collaboration between DeepMind and Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets, as of Q1, DeepMind is reported as part of Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs. And second, beginning in the first quarter, we updated our cost allocation methodologies to provide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making. 
In our filing, we provided a recast of prior period results for the segment for these 2 changes. The highlights of the year-on-year performance of our segments that I will review reflect these recast results. 
Starting with Google Services. Revenues were $62 billion, up 1%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $40.4 billion in the quarter were up 2%. YouTube advertising revenues of $6.7 billion were down 3%. Network advertising revenues of $7.5 billion were down 8%. Other revenues were $7.4 billion, up 9%, reflecting primarily ongoing significant subscriber growth in YouTube TV and YouTube Music Premium. TAC was $11.7 billion, down 2%, primarily reflecting a mix shift between Search and Network. Google Services operating income was $21.7 billion, down 1%, and the operating margin was 35%. 
Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $7.5 billion for the quarter, up 28%. Growth in GCP remained strong across geographies, industries and products. Google Workspace's strong results were driven by increases in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had operating income of $191 million, and the operating margin was 2.6%. As to our Other Bets, for the first quarter, revenues were $288 million, and the operating loss was $1.2 billion. 
Turning to our outlook for the business. In terms of the operating environment, our results in the first quarter reflected ongoing headwinds due to a challenging economic environment, and the outlook remains uncertain. Foreign exchange headwinds have moderated, and we expect less of a foreign exchange headwind in the second quarter based on current spot rates. 
With respect to Google Services, within advertising, Q1 results reflect the resilience of Search with its unique ability to surface demand and deliver measurable ROI. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the revenue growth of Search was similar to last quarter. 
In YouTube, we saw signs of stabilization in ad spend on a sequential basis. We continue to prioritize growth in Shorts engagement where we are encouraged by progress in monetization. As to other revenues, in YouTube subscriptions, we are pleased with the significant ongoing subscriber growth in both YouTube Music Premium and YouTube TV. 
In Play, revenues were down year-on-year, primarily due to the continued impact of foreign exchange in APAC, although results have improved as we lapped the impact from our introduction of fee reductions last year. 
Turning to Google Cloud. Our investments in product innovation, our go-to-market organization and our partner ecosystem delivered strong results as customers across industries and geographies increasingly rely on Google Cloud to digitally transform their businesses. That being said, in Q1, we continued to see slower growth of consumption as customers optimized GCP costs, reflecting the macro backdrop which remains uncertain. In terms of operating performance, we remain focused on driving long-term profitable growth in Cloud while continuing to invest given the substantial opportunity. 
Moving to Other Bets. In the first quarter, we similarly worked to refine strategies and prioritize efforts across the portfolio, including reductions to head count. 
I will now walk you through an update on our efforts to reengineer our cost base, slowing the pace of operating expense growth while creating capacity for key investment areas, particularly in support of AI across the company. 
First, as discussed on the fourth quarter call, we have efforts underway in 3 broad categories: number one, using AI and automation to improve productivity across Alphabet for operational tasks as well as the efficiency of our technical infrastructure; number two, managing our spend with suppliers and vendors more effectively; and number three, continuing to optimize how and where we work. As we've noted previously, all 3 work streams are ramping up this year, and we plan to build on these efforts in 2024 and in subsequent years. 
Second, with respect to head count growth. The reported number of employees at the end of the first quarter includes almost all of the employees impacted by the workforce reduction we announced in January. We expect most of the impacted individuals will no longer be reflected in our head count by the end of the second quarter. In terms of the outlook for head count for the year, as we shared last quarter, we are meaningfully slowing the pace of hiring in 2023 while still investing in priority areas, particularly for top engineering and technical talent. 
In terms of our investments in AI, we are excited about the creation of Google DeepMind, combining the Brain Team from Google Research with DeepMind, with the goal to accelerate innovation and impact. Beginning in the second quarter of 2023, the costs associated with teams and activities transferred from Google Research will move from Google Services to Google DeepMind within Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs. 
Finally, as it relates to CapEx, for 2023, we now expect total CapEx to be modestly higher than in 2022. As discussed last quarter, CapEx this year will include a meaningful increase in technical infrastructure versus a decline in office facilities. We expect the pace of investment in both data center construction and servers to step up in the second quarter and continue to increase throughout the year.

First one for Sundar. Sundar, I guess as you think over the course of the next 12 months, I know you have a lot of new AI tools to show us, what new behavior changes or capabilities are you most excited about for users, developers and advertisers as these tools come out? 
And then the second one for Ruth. Could you talk to us about how much of the AI tools have you incorporated internally to sort of drive more productivity out of your engineers, your sales force, your G&A? Or is that sort of something to come over the next couple of years?",107
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2023",2023-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3454.0,2785595.0,103955307.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,7,"Thanks, Brian. It is an exciting time. I do think we see an opportunity across the breadth of what we do at Google to improve our experiences. Obviously, in Search, we have been using AI for a while. It's what has really helped lead Search and Search quality for the past few years using LLMs. We now have a chance to more natively use LLMs. And I think the main way -- and by the way, as I said in my remarks, we are going to be deliberate. We're going to -- our North Star is getting it right for users. So we'll iterate and innovate as we have always done. 
The main area maybe I'm excited by is we do know from experience that users come back to Search. They follow on. They're engaging back on stuff they already did. And so for us, to use LLMs in a way we can serve those use cases better, I think it's a real opportunity. Obviously, if it's YouTube, the chance to really improve experiences for Creators and consumers in terms of how the videos are viewed, et cetera, I think you can expect changes. Workspace, we already have changes rolling out, and it's an area where I think we'll see the biggest advances because I think productivity is a strong use case in which generative AI can help. 
And obviously, on Cloud, this has been an important moment to us, pretty much every organization is thinking about how to use AI to drive transformation. And so across the board, from start-ups to large companies, they are engaging with us. And so I view it as a point of inflection there as well. Ruth?",283

One is, as I noted, we have a number of efficiency efforts underway, and one of them is about using AI and automation to further improve productivity across Alphabet. That being said, we already have AI in a lot of what we do, for example, in the way we operate and run the finance organization. It's helpful in a lot of the analytics that we use. And one of the exciting things for us is the opportunity then to share that with Cloud customers. 
And Sundar just noted what we're doing within Google Workspace. We obviously all live on Google Workspace. And so that's another example of how we benefit internally from the productivity from AI, but it's also something that's available for users and enterprise customers more broadly. And then finally, one of the areas that we've talked about is the opportunity with our compute capacity and all that we've done there and the infrastructure innovation which, again, is helpful internally for what we do but on behalf of our customers.",210

Sundar, just as you think about integrating Bard into your Search products over time, can you just talk more about what percentage of Search queries you think would utilize large language model-type responses? And how should we think about the cost of running Search on these models relative to today? 
And then, Ruth, I was just hoping you could follow up on your comment on CapEx, maybe if you could help us understand the modest step-up in CapEx relative to 3 months ago.",91
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2023",2023-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3454.0,2785595.0,103955311.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,11,"Thanks, Doug. Obviously, we have launched Bard as a complementary product to Search. But we'll be bringing LLM experiences more natively into Search as well. I do think, first of all, we'll be rolling it out in an incremental way so that we can test, iterate and innovate. So I think we'll approach it that way. I think overall, I think it can apply to a broad range of queries. So I think I'm excited that it can allow us to better help users in a category of queries, maybe in which there was no right answer and they are more creative, et cetera. So I think those are opportunities. But even in our existing query categories where we get a chance to do some heavy lifting for the users and use AI to better guide them, I think you will see us exploring in those directions as well. It's early days, but I think there's a lot of innovation to come. 
On the cost side, we have always -- cost of compute has always been a consideration for us. And if anything, I think it's something we have developed extensive experience over many, many years. And so for us, it's a nature of habit to constantly drive efficiencies in hardware, software and models across our fleet. And so this is not new. If anything, the sharper the technology curve is, we get excited by it, because I think we have built world-class capabilities in taking that and then driving down cost sequentially and then deploying it at scale across the world. So I think we'll take all that into account in terms of how we drive innovation here, but I'm comfortable with how we'll approach it.",287

And I tried to point out that we're expecting a step-up in the second quarter, and that will continue to increase throughout the year. And as we discussed last quarter, AI is a key component. It underlies everything that we do. And we're continuing to invest in support of AI, support of our users, advertisers and our Cloud customers as we're commenting on here. And then as we talked about last quarter, the increase in CapEx for the full year 2023 reflects the sizable increase in technical infrastructure investment and, on the flip side, a decline in office facilities relative to last year.",127

Obviously, one of the dominant themes, and you touched upon it, is this client optimization theme that's going on broadly in cloud computing. Can you give us a little bit more of your perspective on where we are in terms of the optimization theme broadly in cloud computing as a headwind to either revenue growth or backlog growth compared to the tailwinds of broader long-term consumption growth and, possibly, the contribution of AI initiatives to cloud computing growth? 
And then second on YouTube, obviously, you've seen a lot of success with respect to engagement and consumption on Shorts. Can you give us an update on where we are on monetization in Shorts compared to the consumption you've already seen in usage shifts?",130

And so we saw some headwind from slower growth of consumption, with customers really looking to optimize their cost given that macro climate. I'll leave the forecasting to you on that.

We announced 50 billion plus daily views on the Q4 earnings call, up from 30 billion last spring. We're pleased with our continuing progress in monetization. As I said earlier, people are engaging and converting on ads across Shorts at increasing rates. Closing the gap between Shorts and long form is a top priority for us as is continuing to build a greater creator and user experience. Ads on Shorts are now available via video action app, Discovery and Performance Max campaigns and via product feeds. Shorts also are shoppable. 
Again, we're the only destination where Creators can produce all forms of content across multiple formats and screens with multiple ways to make a living. And as Sundar said, last year, the number of channels that uploaded to Shorts daily grew over 80%. And then in February, we brought revenue sharing to Shorts via our YouTube Partner program. Our sustainable revenue sharing model at scale remains pretty unique in the industry, and we continue to see strong creator adoption. So ultimately, our goal is to make YouTube the best places for Shorts viewers and Creators. And that's really what we're focused on right now.",205

It's important to remember. As far as I can remember, we've always been in a competitive environment for these deals. And while I can't comment on the specifics of any of our partnership agreements, what has served us well is always, first of all, building the best product possible, focused on giving value to users. 
And when we work with our partners, we work hard to create a win-win experience. And ultimately, partners end up choosing us because that's what their users want. That's always been what's helped Search be widely distributed. So I think it all starts with continuing to innovate and improve Search and making sure we are leading there. So I think we've always approached it very robustly over the many, many years, and I'm comfortable that we'll continue to be able to do so.",151

And so we have a number of work streams underway to, as we keep describing it, durably reengineer our cost base. And in particular, what we're excited about are long-term opportunities with AI and we want to make sure we have the capacity to continue to invest there in the other areas where we see long-term growth in Search and Ads, Cloud, YouTube, hardware. And so that underscores our efforts to build in additional flexibility. 
And as we have said repeatedly, we want to ensure that expense growth is not growing out of revenue growth, and that means driving revenue growth and really being as disciplined as we can on these various work streams that we've discussed earlier in this call and last quarter as well to improve our expense growth trajectory.",177

Sundar, you got the cost question on learning language models into Search. Can you talk about revenues? I think, on one hand, you'll see better relevancy and maybe better results with higher conversion. But on the other hand, there might be fewer areas for ads or fewer queries because people get answers more quickly. Are you optimistic on that transition? Maybe give us your thoughts there.
And then, Ruth, backing out the onetime charges, it looks like OpEx growth is now 8%, so real progress there. Could you give us a flavor of where you are, you think, in your optimization cycle?",110
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2023",2023-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3454.0,2785595.0,103955324.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,24,"So first of all, throughout the years, as we have gone through many, many shifts in Search, and as we've evolved Search, I think we've always had a strong grounded approach in terms of how we evolve ads as well. And we do that in a way that makes sense and provide value to users. The fundamental drivers here are people are looking for relevant information. And in commercial categories, they find ads to be highly relevant and valuable. And so that's what drives this virtuous cycle. 
And I don't think the underpinnings over the fact that users want relevant commercial information, they want choice in what they look at, even in areas where we are summarizing and answering, et cetera, users want choice. We care about sending traffic. Advertisers want to reach users. And so all those dynamics, I think, which have long served us well, remain. And as I said, we'll be iterating and testing as we go. And I feel comfortable we'll be able to drive innovation here like we've always done.",175

There was also a $988 million benefit from lower depreciation due to the change in useful lives, but that obviously is an ongoing benefit. And there was also, as we noted in our earnings release, a benefit from the shift in timing of stock-based compensation from the first quarter to the second quarter, so a little bit of complexity there. 
But at the core of your question, we remain extremely focused on these various work streams that we've talked about. It starts with the pace of hiring. It goes to the various work streams that both Sundar and I referenced around using AI and automation to improve productivity, all that we're doing with suppliers and vendors to be as efficient as possible, all that we're doing around optimizing how and where we work. You've seen some of those announcements this quarter beyond the workforce reduction, things that we're doing in, for example, office services, and we're executing against each of these various work streams. So our view is that there's more to do. And as we try to be clear, we're in execution mode. You'll see some of the benefit in '23, you'll see more of it in '24 and we're going to continue building against it beyond.",233

Philipp, we're trying to get under the hood on Search advertising and trying to understand changes in demand between sellers of goods and sellers of services. Can you give us any help looking at the service side? Has demand returned back to pre-pandemic levels? And then in terms of goods and e-commerce, have you seen a slowing of demand? Anything you can help us kind of put this -- level set it back to maybe pre-pandemic levels to understand services versus goods demand? 
And then for Ruth, on the terms of efficiency and being more diligent, how does the significantly higher cost of capital impact the way you're managing and evaluating the Other Bets assets? Anything there on how you may be rethinking some of the Other Bets? And what are you doing in changing some of the structures about the Other Bets assets?",153

You were breaking up. So I think I'm going to start and address what I heard as to the second question, as we're looking at higher cost of capital in this environment, how does that affect the way we're looking at Other Bets. Hopefully, we heard you correctly. It was crackling. Look, I think as we've talked about repeatedly, as it relates to Other Bets, our focus is to use deep technology to drive innovation, and we're very focused on the pace of investment and financial returns. That has been a consistent focus to generate attractive returns. And I think the core operating models and the long-term operating models are going to be the most relevant as we're looking at the returns we can generate. 
Yes, absolutely mindful of the higher cost of capital, but I think, at its core, we're looking at what's the value creation and the return on those. And as we indicated when we went through the reduction in force, we similarly worked across the Other Bets. And some of them, as they're on a path to ongoing growth, we were moderating what is the expense trajectory there as we're looking at what's the overall return on invested capital. And we're continuing to work on these to make sure that we're delivering value. And your point is an important one, that's part of a broader question about the underlying operating assumptions.",243

On the first part, again, it didn't come across quite clearly, but I hope I understood correctly. In Search, revenues grew modestly year-over-year, again, reflecting an increase in the retail and travel verticals, offset partially by a decline in finance and media and entertainment. So excluding the impact of FX performance, it was actually similar to last quarter. The ongoing performance of Search, notwithstanding the headwinds, reflects really Search's resilience with the, I'd say, ability of Search to surface demand and deliver a measurable ROI in an uncertain environment. 
I called out the key verticals in the quarter. There's really no additional color on other verticals. I'd say, maybe more broadly, what we saw reflects what's being reported elsewhere. And across the headlines, many companies are very focused on shorter-term profitability amidst this uncertainty and some pulled back ads budgets as well.",143

I think, Philipp, you talked about kind of a more of a pullback in network ad revenue versus Search and YouTube. Do you have any thoughts on why that was the case? 
And then Ruth, the Cloud business, even with the accounting changes, saw this very steady march towards profitability. You turned the corner now. You talked about growing the business for long-term profitability. But are there any reasons why we wouldn't -- why they shouldn't be sustainably profitable kind of starting from here as the business continues to scale? Or could it be that, that profitability could be wobbly for a while before it's sustainably profitable, that segment cloud?",116

So in network, really, it's a continuation of what we talked about last quarter. We saw the ongoing pullback in advertiser spend. And I would contrast that last quarter, we talked about both a pullback in YouTube and Network, and we were pleased that we saw the stabilization in ad spend on a sequential basis in YouTube. We still saw ongoing pullback in network, which tends to be a mix of businesses, as you know well. 
And then in terms of Cloud, I tried to make that clear in my opening comments as well. I think it's a really important question. We are very pleased with the Q1 results. And as both Sundar and I noted, we're intensely focused on all elements of the cost space and the long-term path to attractive profitability. At the same time, and I think at the core of your question, what we were trying to convey is we will continue to invest to support long-term growth, in particular, given the opportunities we see delivering AI capabilities to our customers. So as I've said in the past, you shouldn't extrapolate from quarter-to-quarter, but we are very pleased to be at this level and are continuing to focus on profitability and long-term value creation here.",220

So I'm curious, specifically with that consolidation, what are the product milestones that we should look out for related to that?

I'm quite excited by bringing the 2 world-class teams, I think, of both Brain and DeepMind. Their collective accomplishments in AI over the last decade have really set the stage for this moment, and so both getting access to pool talent so that they can work together in a coordinated way and definitely will help us pool our computational resources, too, which is going to be critical and will help us build. 
The core product is obviously building more capable models safely and responsibly and doing it -- taking into account all the capabilities our customers need, both on the consumer side and the cloud side and being able to iterate and getting that virtuous cycle going. So you already have seen us put out PaLM APIs, and we are incorporating PaLM across our products, but we'll continue that progress, and we'll keep you posted as we do.",149

I also talked earlier about the macro climate and how we've established we can really drive value for retailers, even in challenging times, whether it's online, off-line, both. We're helping them drive their business goals, meet customers wherever they choose to shop. Maybe a little more, some key trends here, retailers are increasingly focused on maintaining margins and driving ROI right now. PMax, Broad Match are key levers providing more incremental conversions, while insights on bids and budgets are really helping retailers identify opportunities for growth and efficiencies across our suite of products. 
I've talked at length on prior calls about omnichannel. Our local and omnichannel solutions are helping bridge the gap here between online and off-line by using AI to reach nearby shoppers, promote local inventory fulfillment options, optimize in-store visits and sales, for example. And then to help really retain loyal customers and acquiring new ones, we have YouTube app deep linking. And new customer acquisition goals in PMax are helping here, making checkouts easy with tools like virtual cards. And Chrome is obviously important. So those are just some of the key points. Overall, we're giving retailers really the best, I hope, AI-powered tools and solutions to maximize reach and ROI and really create a seamless experience, including, where possible, on the payment side for their customers, and this will continue to be our focus here.",252

We are holding our call from London today. It's an important hub for us, and I'm excited to spend time with our local teams, including Google DeepMind as well as leaders and partners from across the region. 
This quarter, we shared great progress at I/O, Brandcast and Google Marketing Live, and we are looking forward to Cloud Next in August. The momentum across the company drove our results this quarter. We delivered solid performance in Search and YouTube and ongoing strong growth in Cloud, where we remain focused on long-term value creation. And we continue our important work to operate more efficiently, creating durable savings to fund investments in our biggest priorities. 
Today, I'll talk about this momentum, including our continued leadership in AI and our excitement about the evolution of Search. At I/O, we shared how we are making AI helpful for everyone in 4 important ways. First, improving knowledge and learning. This is our seventh year as an AI-first company, and we intuitively know how to incorporate AI into our products. Large language models make them even more helpful models like PaLM 2, and soon, Gemini, which we are building to be multimodal. These advances provide an opportunity to reimagine many of our products, including our most important product, Search. We are in a period of incredible innovation for Search, which has continuously evolved over the years. 
This quarter saw our next major evolution with the launch of the Search Generative Experience, or SGE, which uses the power of generative AI to make Search even more natural and intuitive. User feedback has been very positive so far. It can better answer the queries people come to us with today, while also unlocking entirely new types of questions that Search can answer. 
For example, we found that generative AI can connect the dots for people as they explore a topic or project, helping them weigh multiple factors and personal preferences before making a purchase or booking a trip. We see this new experience as another jumping off point for exploring the web, enabling users to go deeper to learn about a topic. 
I'm proud of the engineering excellence underlying our progress. Since the May launch, we've boosted serving efficiency, reducing the time it takes to generate AI snapshots by half. We'll deliver even faster responses over time. We are engaging with the broader ecosystem and will continue to prioritize approaches that send valuable traffic and support a healthy open web. 
Ads will continue to play an important role in this new search experience. Many of these new queries are inherently commercial in nature. We have more than 20 years of experience serving ads relevant to users' commercial queries, and SGE enhances our ability to do this even better. We are testing and evolving placements and formats and giving advertisers tools to take advantage of generative AI. Philipp will talk more about how we are using generative AI in our ads products to better serve both advertisers and users. 
Second, we are helping people use AI to boost their creativity and productivity. One example is Bard, our experiment in conversational AI. Since launching in March, it continues to get better. We rolled out a number of exciting features and capabilities earlier this month. Bard is now available in most of the world and over 40 of the most widely spoken languages.
We also added Google Lens capabilities so you can take an image and ask all kinds of questions, turn it into code and more. This new feature has been really popular, and it's been great to see people sharing their experiences. Bard can now read its responses aloud, and you can adjust them for tone and style. We continue to see great interest in using Bard for coding tasks. 
On productivity, earlier this year, we introduced Duet AI in both Google Cloud and Workspace. It helps people collaborate with AI to code, write and get better insights from data and more. Today, more than 750,000 Workspace users have access to the new features in preview. 
Third, we are making it easier for others to innovate using AI. One way is by providing Google Cloud's high-performance infrastructure optimized for a range of generative AI models. It's being used by thousands of customers and partners to transform their businesses. I'll give an update on the cloud business in just a moment. 
Finally, we are making sure we develop and deploy AI technology responsibly so that everyone can benefit. Last week, we signed on to joint commitments with other leading AI companies at the White House, building on the principles that have guided our work for many years. To take advantage of the AI opportunities ahead, we have been sharpening our focus as a company, investing responsibly with great discipline and finding areas where we can operate more cost effectively. We have made good progress in data center machine efficiency, which will pay dividends as we continue to invest in AI. 
We continue to slow our expense growth and pace of hiring and ensure our teams are aligned to our highest priorities. This quarter, we reallocated a number of teams, including aligning Waze's ad sales with our existing business organization. We are combining various engineering efforts across core infrastructure and cloud. Products like Bard and SGE are being built by small, fast-moving teams that have been reallocated to these high-priority efforts. Overall, we are actively moving people to higher priority activities within the company, and we continue to optimize our real estate footprint for current and future needs. 
Next, Google Cloud. We see continued growth with Q2 revenue of $8 billion, up 28%, and operating profit of $395 million. Our AI-optimized infrastructure is a leading platform for training and serving generative AI models. More than 70% of gen AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers, including Cohere, Jasper, Typeface and many more. We provide the widest choice of AI supercomputer options with Google TPUs and advanced NVIDIA GPUs and recently launched new A3 AI supercomputers powered by NVIDIA's H100. This enables customers like AppLovin to achieve nearly 2x better price performance than industry alternatives.
Our new generative AI offerings are expanding our total addressable market and winning new customers. We are seeing strong demand for the more than 80 models, including third-party and popular open source in our Vertex, Search and Conversational AI platforms with a number of customers growing more than 15x from April to June. 
Among them, Priceline is improving trip planning capabilities. Carrefour is creating full marketing campaigns in a matter of minutes. And Capgemini is building hundreds of use cases to streamline time-consuming business processes. 
Our new Anti-Money Laundering AI helps banks like HSBC identify financial crime risk. And our new AI-powered target and lead identification suite is being applied at Cerevel to help enable drug discovery. Our generative AI capabilities also give us an opportunity to win new customers and upsell into our installed base of 9 million paying Google Workspace customers. I mentioned Duet AI earlier. Instacart is using it to improve customer service workflows. And companies like Extend are scaling sales outreach and optimizing customer service. Customers confidently choose Workspace because of the safety and security we provide their distributed workforces. 
Our AI capabilities are helping us differentiate core products like cybersecurity. We have integrated AI throughout our portfolio, winning organizations like Pfizer who are using Google Cloud to transform their security operations. Chronicle Security Operations suite with Mandiant fully integrated is helping customers stay protected at every stage of the security life cycle.  In the first half of 2023, we saw a 35% increase in incident response engagements compared to the same period last year. 
Finally, our AI capabilities are also expanding our partner ecosystem with hundreds of ISVs and SaaS providers such as Box, Salesforce and Snorkel and the world's largest consulting firms like Accenture and Deloitte. They've collectively committed to train more than 150,000 people on Google Cloud generative AI.
Turning next to YouTube. Earlier this year, we shared that revenues across YouTube products were nearly $40 billion for the 12 months ending in March. I'm really pleased with how YouTube is growing audiences and driving increased engagement. YouTube Shorts are now watched by over 2 billion logged-in users every month, up from 1.5 billion just 1 year ago. The living room remained our fastest-growing screen in 2022 in terms of watch time. We are reaching more than 150 million people on connected TV screens in the U.S. and seeing growth in momentum internationally. 
And on Subscriptions, there is good growth. Late last year, we announced over 80 million YouTube Music and Premium subscribers. Sign-ups for NFL Sunday Ticket kicked off in April, and we look forward to hosting our first football season on YouTube this fall. 
Finally, hardware and Android. Pixel continues to have strong sales momentum. We introduced new Pixel devices at I/O, including Pixel Fold, Pixel Tablet and Pixel 7a, and we've had a great response. Android 14, our latest OS, will incorporate our advances in generative AI to personalize Android phones. The Pixel and Android teams are working together to advance the latest devices. The Pixel Fold is a great example with its many hardware and software innovations. 
Before I close, you may have seen that we just announced some exciting news that Ruth is taking on the important new role of President and Chief Investment Officer. As our longest-serving CFO, she has helped guide the company through an amazing period of growth, a global pandemic and the ongoing economic uncertainty that has followed. I'm excited to continue to work with Ruth, who will lead our 2024 planning and remain as CFO while we do a full search for a successor. So it's business as usual now and no change in approach for the future. I look forward to seeing the impact Ruth will have in her new role, driving our investments, engaging with our stakeholders and creating opportunities for people and communities everywhere. 
To close, I'm energized by the pace of innovation and the momentum across the company. With 15 products that each serve 0.5 billion people and 6 that serve over 2 billion each, we have so many opportunities to deliver on our mission. 
Thank you to our employees around the world for their great work this quarter. Over to you, Philipp.",1731

Happy to be here with you all today. Let's jump right into our performance for the quarter. 
Google Services revenues of $66 billion were up 5% year-on-year. In Google Advertising, Search and Other revenues grew 5% year-on-year, led by solid growth in the retail vertical. In YouTube Ads, revenues were up 4% year-on-year, driven by growth in brand, followed by direct response reflecting further stabilization in advertiser spend. In Network, revenues declined 5% year-on-year. Google Other revenues were up 24% year-on-year, led by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions revenues.
Let's now take a few minutes to cover our 3 key priority areas. Google AI, Retail and YouTube, which I've laid out in prior quarters as clear opportunities for long-term advertising growth. I'll then turn it over to Ruth for more details on our financial performance.
Q2 was a big quarter for Google AI and our Ads products. I/O, GML and Brandcast were a testament to our deep commitment to building cutting-edge tools and solutions that help businesses navigate complexity in real time and deliver the results they need, all while improving the experience for users.
Sundar covered some of these innovations. I'll share more. It's worth reiterating that while generative AI is now supercharging new and existing ads products with tons of potential ahead, AI has been at the core of our Ads business for years. In fact, today, nearly 80% of advertisers already use at least one AI-powered Search Ads product. 
Our approach to AI in ads remains grounded in understanding what drives real value for businesses right now and what's most helpful for users. Advertisers tell us they're looking for more assistive experience to get set up with us faster. So at GML, we launched a new conversational experience in Google Ads powered by a LLM tuned specifically from ads data to make campaign construction easier than ever. 
Advertisers also tell us they want help creating high-quality ads that work in an instant. So we're rolling out a revamped asset creation flow in Performance Max that helps customers adapt and scale their most successful creative concepts in a few clicks. 
And there's even more with PMax. We launched a new asset insights and new search term insights that improve campaign performance understanding and new customer life cycle goals that let advertisers optimize for new and existing customers while maximizing sales.
We've long said it's all about reaching the right customer with the right creative at the right time. So later this year, Automatically Created Assets, which are already generating headlines and descriptions for search ads, will start using generative AI to create assets that are even more relevant to customer queries. 
Broad Match also got updates. AI-based keyword prioritization ensures the right keyword, bid, budget, creative and landing page is chosen when there are multiple overlapping keywords eligible. And then to make it easier for advertisers to optimize visual storytelling and drive consideration in the mid funnel, we're launching 2 new AI-powered ad solutions, Demand Gen and Video View Campaigns, and both will include Shorts inventory.
Sundar talked earlier about SGE and our early experiments with new ad formats. We're in active conversations with advertisers, publishers and partners to get their input on how to make these solutions work best for them and are excited to test and evolve this experience as we learn more. 
Let's pivot to retail where we had a good quarter. Profitability remains a top theme for retailers, so solutions like PMax that drive bottom line value continue to do well. We also continue to see success in helping businesses unlock efficient growth and deliver on their omnichannel goals. 
Take Ace Hardware, who tapped into AI-powered Search and omnibidding to capture increased seasonal demand leading up to Memorial Day. This drove increases across online sales, store visits and in-store sales, resulting in 87% year-over-year growth in Omni revenue from Google Ads and led to one of the largest revenue weeks ever for Ace store owners. 
Q2 also brought innovation on the consumer and merchant front. We've rolled out a new gen AI-powered virtual try-on tool that brings the fitting room experience online. Shoppers can try on women's tops across a wide array of models from brands like Anthropologie, Everlane, H&M and Loft. Rich, visual, engaging content is a win-win for both consumers and merchants. In fact, product offers with more than one image see a 76% average increase in impressions and a 32% increase in clicks. 
Our new Product Studio uses gen AI to help retailers create tailored, eye-catching imagery for free, and we are working towards optimizing for performance. We think this will be a game changer, especially for SMBs who can now create high-quality images to use both across Google and their own sites without spending a lot of time or money. 
As we continue to make Google a valuable place for merchants to grow their businesses and connect with users, Merchant Center Next is another win. We've seen 2x growth in the number of businesses using Merchant Center in the past 2 years. And we're now simplifying it by automating inventory management and giving a consolidated view of performance insights. Better tools means better growth for merchants and better experiences for users.
Moving to YouTube. I've said it before, I'll say it again. YouTube starts with our Creators, and it's their success and our multi-format strategy that will drive YouTube's long-term growth. In prior quarters, I've laid out how we think about this. Enabling our Creators to make a living on our platform with more formats and awesome tools leads to more content which leads to quality consumption of video content, another big focus of the team. And this leads to better opportunities for monetization and for advertisers to support this incredible ecosystem.
As we think about growth, we're focused on Shorts, Connected TV and our subscription offerings, all of which grew nicely this quarter. Let me double-click into Shorts and CTV. 
First, Shorts. Momentum remains strong. Watch time and monetization are moving in the right direction. Last year, we introduced ads on Shorts to help drive performance in direct response campaigns via video action, performance max and app campaigns. As of Q2, brand advertisers can start testing Shorts Ads in awareness campaigns. It's still early days, but we're excited by the results. 
Laneige, Amorepacific's #1 premium skin care brand, was an early adopter. It leaned into video reach campaigns and new creative over a 10-day test to drive a 21% increase in unique users reached from Shorts and In-feed, all in a more efficient CPM. 
Second, Connected TV. Substantial engagement by viewers and ROI for advertisers is driving monetization of the living room. We are very pleased with the growth we've seen and how we're delivering the reach, results and relevance that businesses are looking for at scale. 
At Brandcast, we announced 2 new ad offerings for streaming. First, 30-second unskippable ads are coming to YouTube Select, which is landing 70% plus of impressions on the TV screen. 30-second ads are a TV industry staple, and now YouTube is bringing our advanced audience capabilities and unparalleled reach to the format. We're also exploring new pause experiences so brands can drive awareness or action when you hit pause. 
Looking at YouTube holistically, according to our measurement partners, Nielsen, TransUnion and Ipsos MMA, YouTube delivers higher ROI than TV and other online video on average. Take the Hershey Company. As part of a multiyear partnership to optimize its YouTube strategy, Hershey's brands have been tapping into CTV, efficient AI-powered formats and made-for-Platform creative leading to YouTube becoming its #1 ROI driving media partner, producing a 65% plus increase in ROI from 2018 to 2023.
One last highlight that bridges the power of YouTube with our continued efforts to bring the best across Google to our partners. With Warner Brothers Discovery, we expanded our multiyear relationship across our entire Android ecosystem, including partnering on the launch of Max, a deepened, mutually beneficial relationship on Google TV, and plans to work together on new surfaces. YouTube's expanded deal for Max, inclusive of a Max NFL Sunday Ticket bundle on YouTube TV, also underscores our joint commitment to bring the highest quality content and experiences to our customers.
I'll close by echoing Sundar with a huge thank you to Googlers everywhere for their incredible passion and hard work and to our customers and partners for their continued collaboration and trust. 
Ruth, over to you.",1414

I'm very excited about the new role, and I look forward to it. 
So turning to the results. We're very pleased with our financial results for the second quarter, which reflect an acceleration of growth in Search and momentum in Cloud. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook.
For the second quarter, our consolidated revenues were $74.6 billion, up 7% or up 9% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. Total cost of revenues was $31.9 billion, up 6%, driven by other cost of revenues of $19.4 billion, which was up 8%. Growth here was driven by content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube subscription offerings, followed by hardware costs associated with Pixel family launches in the second quarter. 
As noted in our earnings release, the overall increase in data center and other operations costs was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in estimated useful lives we discussed last quarter.
Operating expenses were $20.9 billion, up 4%. Operating income was $21.8 billion, up 12%, and our operating margin was 29%. I will cover our expense and margin performance in our outlook. Other income and expense was $65 million. Net income was $18.4 billion. We delivered free cash flow of $21.8 billion in the second quarter and $71 billion for the trailing 12 months, reflecting improved operating performance as well as the deferral of certain tax payments to the fourth quarter of 2023 as noted in our earnings release. We ended the quarter with $118 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Turning to our segment results. Prior period results have been recast for 2 changes that we made as of the first quarter. First, DeepMind is now reported as part of Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs. Second, we updated our cost allocation methodologies. In the second quarter, we then combined the Brain team from Google Research with DeepMind to form Google DeepMind. Costs associated with the Brain team, which were previously included in Google Services, are now reported as part of Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs. We have not recast prior period results to reflect this additional change.
Within Google Services, revenues were $66.3 billion, up 5%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $42.6 billion in the quarter were up 5%, led by growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $7.7 billion were up 4%, driven by brand advertising, followed by direct response reflecting further stabilization in spending by advertisers. Network advertising revenues of $7.9 billion were down 5%. 
Other revenues were $8.1 billion, up 24%, reflecting growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues, primarily from subscription growth in YouTube Music Premium and YouTube TV followed by growth in hardware revenues primarily driven by the launch of the Pixel 7a in the second quarter. Finally, Play returned to positive growth in the second quarter. TAC was $12.5 billion, up 3%. Google Services operating income was $23.5 billion, up 8%, and the operating margin was 35%.
Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $8 billion for the quarter, up 28%. GCP revenue growth remained strong across geographies, industries and products. That being said, we saw a continued moderation in the rate of consumption growth as consumers optimize their spend. Google Workspace strong revenue growth was driven by increases in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had operating income of $395 million and the operating margin was 5%.
As to our Other Bets, for the second quarter, revenues were $285 million, and the operating loss was $813 million. The decrease in operating loss was primarily driven by a reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities related to certain Other Bets. 
Turning to our outlook for the business. With respect to Google Services, first, within advertising. We were pleased with the acceleration of Search advertising revenue growth in the second quarter. Our continued ability to generate sustained growth reflects our unparalleled engineering innovation that creates extraordinary experiences for users and capabilities for advertisers and delivered with the deep expertise of our go-to-market team. And in YouTube, we saw ongoing signs of stabilization in advertiser spending. We are prioritizing product focus on increasing quality consumption of video content with both Shorts and in the living room, which is translating into improved monetization.
Second, within other revenues. In our YouTube subscription products, the sustained, strong growth in revenues reflects significant subscriber growth. You may have seen that last week, we increased subscription prices for YouTube Music and Premium, which underscores the value of the products. Strong year-on-year growth in hardware revenues was due, in large part, to a timing change given the Pixel 7a was launched in the second quarter, whereas the Pixel 6a launch occurred in the third quarter last year. Looking ahead, the launch timing change will be a headwind to hardware revenue growth in the third quarter. Play returned to positive growth in the second quarter, driven primarily by a solid increase in the number of buyers.
Turning to Google Cloud. We are particularly excited about the customer interest in our AI-optimized infrastructure, our large language models, our AI platform services and our new generative AI offerings such as Duet AI for Google Workspace, although we are still clearly in the early days. At the same time, we continue to experience headwinds in the second quarter for moderation in consumption growth as customers optimize their spend. We continue to invest aggressively while remaining focused on profitable growth. 
In terms of expenses and profitability, we remain very focused on durably reengineering our cost base. Most evident to date are the actions we have taken to reduce the pace of headcount growth, including the workforce reductions we announced in the first quarter and a slower pace of organic hiring, in part given our focus on reallocating talent from within to fuel our growth priorities. 
A quick comment on the sequential improvement in operating margins in the second quarter. There are 2 factors to note. First, the benefit from an acceleration in search advertising revenue growth in the second quarter. Second, the vast majority of the charges related to our workforce reduction and optimization of our global office space were taken in Q1. Finally, as it relates to CapEx, in Q2, the largest component was for servers, which included a meaningful increase in our investments in AI compute. The sequential step-up in the second quarter was lower than anticipated for 2 reasons. 
First, with respect to office facilities, we continue to moderate the pace of fit-outs and ground-up construction to reflect the slower expected pace of headcount growth. 
Second, there were delays in certain data center construction projects. We expect elevated levels of investment in our technical infrastructure increasing through the back half of 2023 and continuing to grow in 2024. The primary driver is to support the opportunities we see in AI across Alphabet, including investments in GPUs and proprietary TPUs as well as data center capacity. With all that said, we remain committed to durably reengineering our cost base in order to help create capacity for these investments in support of long-term, sustainable financial value.

The first one for Sundar. Sundar, I'd be curious to learn about some of your early learnings and surprises around consumer behavior on how people are using Bard versus Search. And what new behaviors or consumer utility are you most excited about as you think about what Gemini could provide for people over the course of the next year or so? 
And then the second one for Ruth. Ruth, congrats on the new position. One question just about the durable expense comment. I think last quarter, you talked about the idea that expenses could grow slower than revenue in 2024. Is that still the right way to think about it? And just to confirm, does that include the impact of depreciation in those comments?",127
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2023",2023-07-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3409.0,2888308.0,106995404.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,7,"Thanks, Brian. I'll take the first part. It's definitely early days, but both across Bard and Search Generative Experience, feedback has been very positive from our users. I think we are definitely now able to serve, I would say, deeper and broader information use cases, which is very exciting. I wouldn't say surprised. So for example, people really using it to -- for coding, something we understood, but it's definitely on the new side. There's a lot of excitement around, we integrated Google Lens into Bard. We have known how big Google Lens can be. We see that in the visual searches we get and how much it has grown over the last 2 years, and so we've been doing this for a while. But definitely, that, in Bard, has been super well received. So which gives me a sense that as -- given Gemini is being built from the ground up to be multimodal, I think that's an area that's going to excite users. When I go back many years ago when we did universal search, whenever, for users, we can abstract different content types and put them in a seamless way, they tend to receive it well. And so I'm definitely excited about what's ahead.",207

We've been saying for some time that we are focused on revenue growth ahead of expense growth and achieved that for the first in some time, and that is cost of sales plus operating expense overall. And we do remain very focused on durably reengineering our cost base. There are a lot of stream -- work streams that are in flight, and I mentioned a couple of them in opening comments. This remains a major priority as Sundar and I both commented on.",101

Sundar, can you talk a little bit about elements of open source versus closed and things like custom silicon and how you're thinking about AI offerings broadly developing over the next couple of years and what you see as some of the key differentiation points that Google either through the cloud business or the consumer offerings are going to bring to market, and how we should think about differentiation playing out to a greater degree in AI in the years ahead. That would be number one. 
And then, Ruth, I'll echo Brian's congrats as well on the new role. Maybe both of you could talk to why this type of role might be important at this point in time for Alphabet? And Ruth, what you're looking to sort of drive into the organization from this new role as you move into it in the fall.",154

On the first part, obviously, a big topic. I would broadly say, the investments for AI, when you look at the type of deep computer science work, the talent we have worked hard to bring to the company and from the ground up, the infrastructure we have built, from the earliest days Google has been a company, we've thought about the switches in our data centers. Wherever we think we can do the best and get an advantage by innovating, we have chosen to do so. 
We have done that on AI, on the silicon side. But what's important to us is really stay focused on our users and customers and support all the innovations that's needed. So for example, with cloud, we've been -- we've really embraced open architecture. We have embraced customers wanting to be multi-cloud when it makes sense for them. So similarly, you would see with AI, we will embrace -- we will offer not just our first-party models, we'll offer third-party models, including open source models. I think open source has a critical role to play in this ecosystem.
Google contributes -- we are one of the largest contributors to -- if you look at  Hugging Face and in terms of the contribution there, when you look at projects like Android, Chromium and so on, Kubernetes and so on. So we'll embrace that and we'll stay at the cutting edge of technology, and I think that will serve us well for the long term. 
On the second part of your question, first of all, I'm very grateful and thankful to all the work that Ruth has done for the company. It's too invaluable to capture in words. I am super thrilled that she's going to continue on an impactful new role. And  the scale of our company, with the broad changes in technology, I think it's more important than ever before to engage on these issues globally at scale and advocate on the economic opportunity of the investments we make across Alphabet and Google. And I'm glad that she's going to continue as CFO. And so no changes there, and we'll take the time to find a successor, and Ruth will be closely involved, not just on that but also our long-range planning, including 2024. 
Ruth, anything to add?",386

We're excited about what they mean, setting the company up well to be able to invest for long-term growth. And so we're continuing to execute against those. And then I think Sundar summarized it well. We see technology can make such a difference in the lives of so many and there's lives of economies. And to be able to focus on the impact on economic growth and the opportunity for people, for organizations for countries, I think, is a privilege. I'm really excited about it, in particular, with this amazing company. And so focusing there as well as the investments that we make across Alphabet to drive economic growth globally across numerous sectors.",157

For Sundar, curious, how do you think about timing for more broadly integrating generative AI into Search? And more specifically, what are some of the things you'll need to see to do that? 
And then, Ruth, just on CapEx, the 2Q CapEx is lower than expected as you explained. Do you still expect modestly higher CapEx in '23 versus '22? And then I know it's getting a little bit ahead, but how should we think about kind of timing of that real estate and office optimization efforts through '23 and then also into '24?",101

While it's exciting new technology, we've constantly been bringing in AI innovations into Search for the past few years, and this is the next step in that journey. But it is a big change so we thought about from first principles. It really gives us a chance to now not always be constrained in the way Search was working before allowed us to think outside the box. And I see that play out in experience. So I would say we are ahead of where I thought we'd be at this point in time. 
The feedback has been very positive. We've just improved our efficiency pretty dramatically since the product launch. The latency has improved significantly. We are keeping a very high bar, and -- but I would say we are ahead on all the metrics in terms of how we look at it internally. And so I couldn't be more pleased with it. And so you will see us continue to bring it to more and more users. And over time, this will just be how Search works. And so while it's -- we are taking deliberate steps, we are building the next major evolution in Search, and I'm pleased with how it's going so far.",224

That's why we wanted to be really clear that we do expect elevated levels of investment in our technical infrastructure, and that would be increasing through the back half of 2023, consistent with the comments we've made previously that we expected 2023 to be higher given the slower start at the front half of the year and then continuing to grow into 2024.
And the primary driver of this, as you know well, is to support the opportunities we see in AI across the company, including the investments that we've already talked about, proprietary TPUs, all that we're doing with GPUs as well as data center capacity. And as we continue to see the pace of innovation accelerate, we just want to make sure we're positioned to address the opportunity across Alphabet.
And to your -- the other part of your question, when we look at real estate optimization, that's one of many work streams that are important when we talk about durably reengineering our cost base to create capacity for investments and support long-term sustainable financial value, and we're continuing to work against that.",244

We have obviously been focused on bringing this experience and making sure it works well for users. And it's very clear to me, first of all, as a user myself, there are certain queries for which the answers are so significantly better. It's a clear quality win. And so I think we are definitely headed in the right direction, and we can see it in our metrics and the feedback we are getting from our users as well.
And the thing that doesn't change with these experiences is that many -- a lot of user journeys are commercial in nature. There are inherent commercial user needs. And what's exciting to me is that SGE gives us an opportunity to serve those needs, again, better, right? Better. So it's clearly an exciting area. And as part of that, the fundamentals don't change. Users have commercial needs, and they are looking for choices, and there are merchants and advertisers looking to provide those choices.
So those fundamentals are true in SGE as well. And we have a number of experiments in flight, including ads, and we are pleased with the early results we are seeing. And so we will continue to evolve the experience, but I'm comfortable at what we are seeing, and we have a lot of experience working through these transitions, and we'll bring all those learnings here as well.",237

It is an exciting moment overall in Cloud because there is definitely a lot of interest from customers on AI, and they definitely are engaging in many more conversations with us. So I would say, without commenting on the short term, but when I think about it long term, I view the AI opportunity as expanding our total addressable market and allows us to win new customers. Scale of investments that we can directly bring to Cloud now. As I said earlier, we have over 80 models across Vertex, Enterprise, Search and Conversational AI, and we are taking all of them, translating it into deep industry solutions. So I'm excited about it.
Second, it gives us an opportunity to upsell and cross-sell into our installed base. So for example, if you think about Duet AI in Google Workspace now, it's a collection of all our generative AI-powered collaboration features. We can bring it and make it available to more than 9 million paying Google Workspace customers. Similarly, Duet AI in Google Cloud, again, allows us to go back to our installed base and engage in deeper conversations.
And finally, I think AI helps us differentiate our core products. For example, if you take a look at cybersecurity, we are deeply incorporating AI to drive profound changes there. So overall, I'm excited, and I view this as a long-term opportunity. And all the investments we are doing in AI across Alphabet, including the work we are doing in Google DeepMind and Google Research on Gemini and so on are directly applicable to Cloud as well. So excited about it.",271

Philipp, can you talk about the ad market? If you step back, you're seeing real signs now of weakness in linear TV, ad agencies, small and digital companies were all slowing, and the macro backdrop is definitely cloudy, yet you guys have accelerated your growth this quarter. What factors are you looking at do you see that would identify why you are growing while others are really struggling and slowing down?
And then Sundar, I think you spent over $100 billion on R&D over the past 5 years, and yet there's a narrative that it's so competitive and so expensive to compete going forward. Can you talk a bit about how you're visiting that R&D spend? Any near-term cadence updates you can give us for growth? And any factors that could change the growth going forward for research and development spending for you guys?",151

And look, if anything, I think 2 things. We are always committed to driving deep computer science research and innovation. That's the foundation on which the company is built. And taking that and applying it and building new products and services and generating value is the virtuous cycle. And so nothing changes in that fundamental thesis. 
We are definitely both, as Ruth mentioned, on AI investments, we are going to be committed to making sure we invest to realize the opportunity. But all the work we are doing on efficiency and optimization applies to on the AI side as well. And so we're bringing all that lens there so that we do this responsibly. But no overall changes in our philosophy or approach there. And maybe I'll let Philipp comment on the overall market dynamics.",147

Look, I can't comment on others, but our focus continues obviously to be helping customers through whatever uncertainty or complexity they're facing, and a lot of companies are focused on profitability, driving efficiencies, and they're carefully evaluating the effectiveness of their budgets. And our goal is really to help them maximize efficiency and drive strong ROI. 
And I think we have the proven AI-powered tools and solutions to actually do it. I called out Search and Other revenues being led by solid growth in the retail vertical. We talked about the DR and brand side, on the YouTube side. I think those are the key points I would make.",110

Look, this is a great question. AI is a foundational component that really allows us to help users, advertisers,  [ publishers ] and partners at scale. And we've been on a journey for years, right, to take the key components of advertising, whether it's bidding, targeting and creatives as well as innovation, frankly, in the core advertiser and publisher experiences and improve them dramatically through AI.
And Performance Max is an example of how all this comes together at scale for advertisers. They provide us with a business goal set of assets, and we can then take care of the rest to meet consumer demand and really deliver on advertiser ROI. And as you heard it at GML, we've seen over many quarters, we continue to build new AI features really on top of this.
I think I talked a bit in my prepared remarks about where we're taking some of our products from a gen AI perspective. And if you take a look at some of the things we announced there, it's fair to say, whether you look at our revamped asset creation flow in Performance Max, whether you look at Automatically Created Assets, whether you look at Product Studio and so on, then we're on a right path to deliver some really exciting new innovation in automated -- let me call it, asset creation in the broader sense.",231

Actually, I'll follow up on that last question, Philipp. You pointed out AI has been used to improve the advertising mousetrap at Google for many years. Do you view generative AI as just a material accelerant of your ability to improve return on ad spend for the millions of marketers who use Google? 
And if you think about where generative AI would have the most impact, could you peel it apart what's your guess now over the next couple of years where it's going to have the most impact on the creative -- on the audience creation, on the campaign optimization? Where do you think the most impact will come from generative AI just for all the -- your advertising customers?",122

And we're really helping advertisers here make better decisions, solve problems, enhance creativity. And I covered this earlier. For example, we launched a new conversational experience in Google Ads, the asset creation flow. In PMax, I mentioned the automatically created assets, the Product Studio and so on. 
When I talk to customers, they're very excited about AI and understandably have some questions. One of the top questions is, for example, what's the next best step I should take. And this is a key reason why we launched our Google Ads AI Essentials, which was a big announcement at GML. It's a checklist of simple steps customers can take right now to unlock the power of AI, and it has to do with the foundation of data and measurement. It has to do with taking action with our AI-powered products and really is a mindset shift to set up organizations for AI success. 
So those are just some of the examples. If you extrapolate those going forward, those are some of the examples where I see a lot of upside apart from the points that Sundar already mentioned.",207

I'm pleased with our business results this quarter, which demonstrates strong growth in Search and YouTube and momentum in Cloud. Google turned 25 in September, which offered an opportunity to reflect on our progress over the last quarter century and to look ahead to the opportunities enabled by AI we are so excited and confident about. 
Our product momentum continued this quarter, as you saw with Cloud Next made on YouTube and made by Google. It's all part of our focus on making AI more helpful for everyone, and we are making good progress across the 4 areas that we shared last quarter. 
First, improving knowledge and learning. This includes our work with the Search Generative Experience, which is our experiment to bring generative AI capabilities into Search. We have learned a lot from people trying it, and we have added new capabilities like incorporating videos and images into responses and generating imagery. We have also made it easier to understand and debug generated code. Direct user feedback has been positive with strong growth in adoption. In August, we opened up availability to India and Japan with more countries and languages to come. As we add features and expand into new markets, we are engaging with the broader ecosystem, and we'll continue to prioritize approaches that add value for our users, send valuable traffic to publishers and support a healthy open Internet. 
With generative AI applied to Search, we can serve a wider range of information needs and answer new types of questions, including those that benefit from multiple perspectives. We are surfacing more links with SGE and linking to a wider range of sources on the results page, creating new opportunities for content to be discovered. Of course, ads will continue to play an important role in this new Search experience. People are finding ads helpful here as they provide useful options to take action and connect with businesses. We'll experiment with new formats native to SGE that use generative AI to create relevant, high-quality ads customized to every step of the Search journey. 
The second area we are focused on is boosting creativity and productivity. Bard is particularly helpful here. It's a direct interface to a conversational LLM and we think of it as an early experiment and complementary experience to Google Search. Bard can now integrate with Google apps and services showing relevant information from Workspace, Maps, YouTube and Google Flights and Hotels. 
We've also improved the Google IT feature. It provides other sources to help people evaluate Bard's responses and explore information across the web. Earlier this month, we announced Assistant with Bard, a personal assistant powered by generative AI. It combines Bard's generative and reasoning capabilities with Assistant's personalized help. You can interact with it through text, voice or images. And in the coming months, you'll be able to opt in on Android and iOS mobile devices. Our collaborative tools in Workspace and YouTube are also part of how we boost creativity and productivity, and they are seeing great initial traction. 
Third, we are enabling developers, businesses and other organizations to build their own transformative products and services. For example, thousands of customers and partners are already using Google Cloud to capture the potential of AI, and we'll share more there in a minute. 
And fourth, we are building and deploying AI responsibly so that everyone can benefit. One area we are focused on is making sure people can more easily identify when they are encountering AI-generated content online, using new technology powered by Google DeepMind SynthID, images generated by Vertex AI can be watermarked in a way that is invisible to the human eye without reducing the image quality. Underlying all this work is the foundational research done by our teams at Google DeepMind and Google Research. We are excited to roll out more of what they've been working on soon. 
As we expand access to our new AI services, we continue to make meaningful investments in support of our AI efforts. We remain committed to durably reengineering our cost base in order to help create capacity for these investments in support of long-term sustainable financial value. Across Alphabet, teams are looking at ways to operate as effectively as possible focused on their biggest priorities. 
Turning next to YouTube, which saw solid momentum in both its ads and subscription businesses in Q3. NFL Sunday Ticket is now live in receiving excellent reviews. Fans love our multi-view feature, which can live stream up to 4 games on a single screen. We have heard positive feedback from our partners at the NFL about the new features and live stream reliability. This is a clear example of our ability to execute big partnerships with excellence and at scale. 
I'm really pleased with the growth and engagement on YouTube Shorts. We continue to work on closing the monetization gap here. Shorts now average over 70 billion daily views and are watched by over 2 billion signed-in users every month. At Made On YouTube in September, we announced new tools that make it easier to create engaging content. Dream Screen is an experimental feature that allows creators to add AI-generated video or image backgrounds to Shorts. And YouTube Create is a new mobile app with a suite of production tools for editing Shorts, longer videos or both. 
Next, Google Cloud. We see continued growth with Q3 revenue of $8.4 billion, up 22%. Today, more than 60% of the world's 1,000 largest companies or Google Cloud customers. At Cloud Next, we showcased amazing innovations across our entire portfolio of infrastructure, data and AI, workspace collaboration and cybersecurity solutions. We offer advanced AI optimized infrastructure to train and serve models at scale. And today, more than half of all funded generative AI start-ups are Google Cloud customers. This includes AI21 Labs, Contextual, Elemental Cognition, Writer and more. We continue to provide the widest choice of accelerator options. Our A3 VMs powered by NVIDIA's H100 GPU are generally available, and we are winning customers with Cloud TPU v5e, our most cost efficient and versatile accelerator to date. 
On top of our infrastructure, our Vertex AI platform helps customers build, deploy and scale AI-powered applications. We offer more than 100 models, including popular third-party and open source models, as well as tools to quickly build Search in conversation use cases. From Q2 to Q3, the number of active generative AI projects on Vertex AI grew by 7x, including Highmark Health, which is creating more personalized member materials. 
Duet AI was created using Google's leading large foundation models and is specially trained to help users to be more productive on Google Cloud. We continue expanding its capabilities and integrating it across a wide range of cloud products and services. With Duet AI, we are helping leading brands like PayPal and Deutsche Bank boost developer productivity, and we are enabling retailers like Aritzia and Gymshark to gain new insights for better and faster business results. In fact, companies are increasingly using AI for the purpose of finalizing data, and customers are choosing Google Cloud because we are the only large cloud provider with a unified platform to analyze structured and unstructured data. 
In Workspace, thousands of companies and more than 1 million trusted testers have used Duet AI. They are writing and refining content in Gmail and Docs, creating original images from text within slides, organizing data and sheets and more. These innovations enable us to provide new services and grow our base of 10 million paying customers including enterprises like Grupo Boticário, Unilever and Warner Music. 
We also integrated Duet AI across our cybersecurity portfolio to differentiate in the marketplace, providing generative AI-powered assistance in Mandiant Threat Intelligence, Chronicle Security Operations and Security Command Center. This reduces the time security teams spend writing, running and refining searches by 7x. We are the only leading security provider that combines frontline intelligence and expertise, a modern security operations platform and a trusted cloud foundation, all infused with generative AI, helping product customers and partners like BT, Jack Henry and Associates and CoverMyMeds. 
Turning to Hardware. We unveiled our new products this month. We introduced our new Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro and Pixel Watch 2 to very positive consumer feedback and reviews. Pixel is the fastest-growing smartphone brand in our top markets and the only one that grew in units sold year-over-year. Our portfolio of Pixel products are brought to life, thanks to our combination of foundational technologies AI, Android and Google Tensor. Google Tensor G3 is the third generation of our tailor-built chip. It's designed to power transformative experiences by bringing the latest in Google AI research directly to our newest phones. 
A new AI-powered editing feature in Google photos on Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro remote distractions, generate the best shot from multiple images and reduce distracting sounds in videos. Pixel and our third-party ecosystem are powered by Android. We just released Android 14 with more accessibility features. 
I also want to mention Chromebook Plus, a new category which provides the best of Chrome on great hardware with built-in Google apps and powerful AI capabilities. We also shared that Chromebooks will now get regular automatic updates for 10 years, more than any other operating system. 
In Other Bets, Waymo is onboarding more riders to its commercial ride-hailing service as it gradually adds over 100,000 people from its San Francisco waitlist. Austin will follow as its next ride-hail city. Wing and Walmart announced a new partnership to provide drone delivery service in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. 
Before handing over to Philipp, I want to thank our employees around the world who are working to create innovative products and provide great services to people and businesses who use our products. Philipp?",1632

I'll start with our performance for the quarter and then give color into the 3 key priority areas for ads, Google AI, Retail and YouTube, that we've identified on past calls as opportunities for long-term growth and advertising. 
Google Services revenues of $68 billion were up 11% year-on-year. In Google advertising, Search and other revenues grew 11% year-on-year led by solid growth in the retail vertical. In YouTube ads, revenues were up 12% year-on-year driven by growth in both brand and direct response. In Network, revenues declined 3% year-on-year. Google other revenues were up 21% year-on-year led by strong growth in YouTube subscription revenues. 
Let's start with Google AI. Recent dramatic advances in everything from foundational research models to LLMs to generative AI are improving our ability to deliver better performance and profitability for advertisers and more helpful, delightful experiences for users.
We covered many innovations last quarter after GML like our conversational experience in Google Ads, significant updates to Performance Max and new campaign types like demand gen. And as Sundar said, we're continuing to experiment with new ad formats on SGE. It's extremely important to us that in this new experience, advertisers still have the opportunity to reach potential customers along their search journeys. I'll highlight more ways we're innovating with the best of Google AI as we double-click into our core business. 
In retail, we had a great quarter. In a market where every dollar counts, our proven AI-powered solutions like Search and PMax are helping retailers drive reliable, strong ROI and meet customers wherever they are across the funnel. In Q3, we also started prepping retailers for what will be a long holiday season. Let me share some things. 
Number one, with the maximum number of days between Thanksgiving and Christmas and expectations for many micro peaks beyond Cyber 5, we're arming businesses with insights and planning tools, including opti score and Performance Planner to uncover new opportunities, plan budgets and targets to stay competitive and be smarter with their inventory and pricing strategy. 
Number two, consumer expectations are shifting, especially around price and convenience. We've seen 4x deals queries during the holidays versus other periods. 75% of users say they'll shop with those offering free shipping. Retailers are capitalizing on these trends with our differentiated merchant offerings like merchant promotions and fulfillment options. And we're making improvements to significantly boost the number of deals shown to shoppers in Search this holiday season. Look out for more in the coming days about new ways we'll help shoppers browse deals across the web this year. 
Number three, no surprise, omnichannel is the way to succeed. With our suite of omni product solutions, including local inventory ads, omni bidding and PMax for store goals, retailers, big and small, are capturing demand and incremental store budgets while engaging with high-value customers. 
Innovation continues across our shopping and merchant experiences powered by Google AI. Our virtual try-on tool for apparel launched in June and has been a hit with consumers and brands. Users engage with virtual try-on images at a higher rate versus regular brand-provided images. 
Product Studio is another launch from GML getting positive feedback in pilot mode. It is the best of gen AI to help businesses create unique and tailored imagery for free that they can then scale across their channels. We're seeing early merchant testers using it to seasonalize their content for the holidays. 
Let's shift to YouTube. It's worth repeating our intense focus on creator success, coupled with our multi-format strategy, are at the center of how we think about YouTube's long-term growth. Shorts Connected TV and our subscription offerings are key drivers here, and we're investing across each to solidify YouTube's position as the best place to create, the best place to watch and the best place to deliver results. 
Sundar mentioned watch time and engagement momentum on Shorts as well as our monetization progress. He also covered subscription growth and NFL Sunday Ticket. As for Connected TV, we continue to be the #1 overall streaming destination according to Nielsen. 150 million-plus people are watching YouTube on CTV screens every month in the U.S. 
Whether it's music videos, NFL Sunday Ticket, free movies shorts, a continuous stream of Mr. Beast or some other creator-led content, viewers want choice and variety, and we're giving it to them all in one place. And to help creators and advertisers connect with these billions of viewers across moments, screens and formats, we're bringing Google AI to awesome new creation tools and ad solutions. 
AI will do wonders for creation and storytelling. From Dream Screen and YouTube Create, which Sundar talked about, to features that audit up content in multiple languages, flip interim existing assets, remix and clip videos and more, we're just getting started. 
We're also helping brands break through its speed and scale across the funnel to drive results. Spotlight Moments launched last week. It uses AI to identify trending content around major cultural moments for brand sponsorship opportunities. There's video reach campaigns, which are expanding to in-feed and Shorts, and will be generally available in November. AI is helping advertisers find as many people as possible and their ideal audience for the lowest possible price. Early tests are delivering 54% more reach at 42% lower cost. And then with video view campaigns, AI is serving skippable ads across in-stream, in-feed and Shorts and helping advertisers earn the maximum number of views at the lowest possible cost. So far, they're driving 40% more views on average versus in-stream alone. 
Then for YouTube and other feed-based services, there's our new demand-gen campaign, which launched in April, rolled out worldwide last week and was designed for the needs of today's social marketers to engage people as they stream, scroll and connect. It combines video and image ads in one campaign with access to 3 billion users across YouTube and Google and the ability to optimize and measure across the funnel using Google AI. Demand gen is already driving successful brands like Samsung and Toyota. 
Before I wrap, one quick highlight on our close collaboration and commitment to our most important ecosystems and partners. In July, we launched Google News Showcase in the U.S., our curated online news experience and licensing program with more than 150 news publications, 90% of which are local or regional. Globally, over 2,500 news publications have signed on to News Showcase and the product is live in 23 countries today. Our commitment to open access to news and information remains strong. 
With that, I'll end with a thank you to our customers and partners around the world for their continued trust and collaboration and our Googlers everywhere for their incredible hard work and dedication. 
Ruth, over to you.",1128
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q3 2023 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2023",2023-10-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3000.0,2925176.0,107816925.0,Presenter Speech,Ruth Porat,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Philipp. We are very pleased with our financial results for the third quarter, driven by meaningful growth in Search in YouTube and Momentum in Cloud. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter, unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. 
For the third quarter, our consolidated revenues were $76.7 billion, up 11% in both reported and constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. In terms of expenses, total cost of revenues was $33.2 billion, up 7%, primarily reflecting other cost of revenues of $20.6 billion, which was up 6%. Growth here was primarily driven by content acquisition costs mainly for YouTube subscription offerings. 
As noted in our earnings release, the overall increase in data center and other operations costs was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in estimated useful lives we made starting in the first quarter of the year. 
Operating expenses were $22.1 billion, up 6%, reflecting the following: first, an increase in R&D expenses driven primarily by compensation; second, an increase in G&A expenses, reflecting the impact of charges related to legal matters; and finally, sales and marketing expenses, which were relatively flat to last year. 
Operating income was $21.3 billion, up 25%, and our operating margin was 28%. Other income and expense was a loss of $146 million. Net income was $19.7 billion. This reflects an effective tax rate of 7% in the third quarter from an IRS change related to the use of foreign tax credits, which had an outsized impact on the third quarter rate because the change resulted in a catch-up for prior periods. 
We delivered free cash flow of $22.6 billion in the third quarter and $78 million for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $120 billion in cash and marketable securities. As a reminder, our cash balance and free cash flow in the second and third quarters benefited from the deferral of certain tax payments to the fourth quarter of 2023. As noted in our earnings release, on October 16, we made an estimated tax payment of $10.5 billion related to this deferral, which will be reflected in our cash balance and free cash flow in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to segment results. Within Google Services, revenues were $68 billion, up 11%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $44 billion in the quarter were up 11% led again by growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $8 billion were up 12% driven by both brand advertising and direct response. Network advertising revenues of $7.7 billion were down 3%. Other revenues were $8.3 billion, up 21%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube nonadvertising revenues driven by subscriber growth in YouTube TV followed by YouTube Music Premium. TAC was $12.6 billion, up 7%. Google Services operating income was $23.9 billion, up 27%, and the operating margin was 35%. 
Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $8.4 billion for the quarter, up 22%. GCP revenue growth remained strong across geographies, industries and products, although the Q3 year-on-year growth rate reflects the impact of customer optimization efforts. Google Workspace also delivered strong revenue growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had operating income of $266 million, and the operating margin was 3%. As to our Other Bets, for the third quarter, revenues were $297 million and the operating loss was $1.2 billion. 
Turning to our outlook for the business with respect to Google Services. 
First, within advertising. After a period of historic volatility, we were pleased with the year-on-year revenue growth of Search and YouTube advertising in the third quarter. 
Second, within other revenues. In our YouTube subscription products the substantial growth in revenues primarily reflects subscriber growth. Looking ahead, a full quarter of NFL Sunday Ticket revenues as well as associated content acquisition costs will be reflected in Q4 results compared to only a few weeks in the third quarter. 
Play had solid growth in the third quarter driven primarily by an increase in the number of buyers. 
With respect to Hardware, there is a headwind to revenues in the fourth quarter, reflecting efforts to optimize the portfolio with tighter targeting of our go-to-market investments as well as the ongoing impact from the difference in launch timing for the Pixel 6A and 7A that we mentioned last quarter. 
Turning to Google Cloud. We are pleased with the ongoing customer engagement with GCP and Workspace and the potential benefit of our AI solutions, including infrastructure and services such as Vertex AI and Duet. We continue to invest aggressively given the significant potential we see while remaining focused on profitable growth. 
In terms of expenses and profitability, we're pleased with our operating performance. As we have repeatedly stressed, we remain focused on durably reengineering our cost base to create investment capacity to support our growth priorities, most important of which is with AI. We have a number of work streams in place. 
First, we are maintaining a slower pace of head count growth, reflecting product prioritization and reallocation of talent to support our most important growth opportunities. 
Second, we remain focused on optimizing our real estate footprint, including how and where we work to reduce our expense growth. As you can see from our earnings release, we incurred $207 million in accelerated rent and depreciation in the third quarter related to these actions. 
Third, we have engineering work streams underway to improve productivity across Alphabet. Given the magnitude of investment in our technical infrastructure, we have a superb team focused on efficiency of our operations there. We are also making progress in streamlining operations across Alphabet through the use of AI. 
Finally, there are ongoing work streams that are improving the efficiency of our spend with suppliers and vendors through our central procurement organization. And to be clear, across the portfolio of Other Bet companies, we have also been working to identify opportunities to create sharper focus and to operate more efficiently and effectively. 
With respect to sequential quarter-on-quarter trends, two further points. First, cost of sales in the fourth quarter will reflect both higher Hardware costs given Pixel family launches as well as increased CAC for YouTube as previously noted. Second, as usual, we expect sales and marketing expenses to be more heavily weighted to the end of the year, in part to support product launches and the holiday season. Finally, our reported CapEx in Q3 was $8 billion driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure with the largest component for servers followed by data centers, reflecting a meaningful increase in our investments in AI compute. 
The growth in reported cash CapEx in Q3 is somewhat muted due to the timing of supplier payments which can cause variability from quarter-to-quarter. We continue to invest meaningfully in the technical infrastructure needed to support the opportunities we see in AI across Alphabet and expect elevated levels of investment, increasing in the fourth quarter of 2023 and continuing to grow in 2024. 
In closing, we remain very excited about the opportunities ahead and committed to deliver sustainable financial value.

The first one, maybe just a little bit of a jump ball. There's somewhat of an investor debate about sort of the incremental return on capital to Search when it comes to AI. I know it's early, but are there any examples that you're seeing with SGE or Bard on higher utility, higher conversion rates, more engagement, just something to sort of show signal around the return that could come from these investments?
And the second one, Ruth, I know you've spoken a lot about durably reengineering the cost base. I think in the past, you've talked about how expenses could grow slower than revenue in 2024. Is that sort of still the high level way to think about it? Or is that potentially changing a bit as investments are continuing?",134

So overall, that's sort of a truism, as you know well, looking to grow revenues at a faster rate than expenses as we're focused on delivering sustainable financial value. And so that really takes us to the work streams, which I tried to tick through. Again, those remain the driver. They're the real priority. Those are the efforts that are going to enable us to expense growth. And it's moderated as possible while supporting the investment growth that is so exciting in front of us, in particular, around AI.",94

It starts with Search. And I've been pretty pleased with how the user feedback has been on SGE. We are rolling it out to more users. Through it all, we are making sure the product works well, and we are generating value for our ecosystem, and that adds transitions well. And I think I view this as, with AI, the opportunity to evolve Search and Assistant over the next decade ahead. And I think as we've always seen, when you continue to invest and build great experiences, you can get value on the other side. And I do think over time, there will be newer paths, just like we have done on YouTube. I think with the AI work, there are subscription models as a possible path as well. And obviously, all of the AI investments we are doing applies across Cloud, too, and I'm pretty optimistic about what's ahead there as well.",176

Sundar, you talked a lot about AI. I was hoping you could talk more about Gemini and how it will differentiate from other models some of the multimodal capabilities and what new experiences or agents do you think it could unlock and how we should think about timing? And then also just on Cloud, hoping you can talk about some of the factors there on the decel in cloud and just what you're seeing in terms of optimizations? And is there any sign of new workload deployments taking place?",96
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q3 2023 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2023",2023-10-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3000.0,2925176.0,107816933.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,12,"Thanks. Good questions. On Gemini, obviously, it's effort from our combined Google DeepMind team. I'm very excited at the progress there as we're working through getting the model ready. To me, more importantly, we are just really laying the foundation of what I think of as the next-generation series of models we'll be launching throughout 2024. The pace of innovation is extraordinarily impressive to see. We are creating it from the ground up to be multimodal, highly efficient tool and API integrations and, more importantly, laying the platform to enable future innovations as well. 
And we are developing Gemini in a way that it is going to be available at various sizes and capabilities, and we'll be using it immediately across all our products internally as well as bringing it out to both developers and cloud customers through Vertex. So I view it as a journey, and each generation is going to be better than the other. And we are definitely investing, and the early results are very promising.
On Cloud, maybe what I would say is, overall, we had definitely started seeing customers looking to optimize spend. We leaned into it to help customers given some of the challenges they were facing. And so that was a factor. But we are definitely seeing a lot of interest in AI. There are many, many projects underway now. Just on Vertex alone, the number of projects grew over 7x. And so we see signs of stabilization, and I'm optimistic about what's ahead.",251

Sundar, you guys led over a year ago, starting with Performance Max. And I wanted to know if we could get your updated thoughts on how AI might impact the broader advertising industry and how you're aligning Alphabet and Google's goals with AI and where it might take the advertising industry in the years ahead. That would be the first question.
And then about a year ago, Philipp and Ruth started talking about some of the brand advertising headwinds that YouTube was facing. As we start to lap those headwinds, how should we be thinking about a broad recovery in brand advertising versus elements of still headwinds that are being faced in the broader ad space, specifically with YouTube?",123
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q3 2023 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2023",2023-10-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3000.0,2925176.0,107816936.0,Answer,Philipp Schindler,,Executives,15,"So maybe I'd take the first one. We're very pleased with how Performance Max is performing. It gives advertisers really maximum performance across all inventory from, one, really AI-powered campaign, and it's probably the ultimate example of AI in action across our ads product. It's delivering excellent ROI. Those using it achieve like, on average, over 18% more conversions at a similar cost per action. So since rolling it out 2 years ago, we've continued to expand the features, give advertisers additional ways to steer how it works and do a lot of things like account-level negative keywords, other details here. 
We launched new life cycle goals, customer life cycle goals, we call them; a revamped asset creation flow that really helps business adapt and scale their most successful creatives. I think that's one to watch. We will also continue to build other new PMax features based on all the advertiser feedback we're seeing. So we're very, very encouraged by the progress here. 
Overall, maybe -- there was a second part to your question a bit, on what we're hearing from the customers out there. Look, driving ROI and efficiency is still top of mind for many, right? It's a rapidly shifting and still quite unpredictable consumer landscape out there. Our AI tools are very well received, AI, gen AI are top of mind for everybody, really. There's a ton of excitement, lots of questions about it. Many understand the value. Nearly 80% of our advertisers already use at least one AI-powered search ads product. And yes, we're hearing a lot of good feedback on, number one, our ads AI Essentials, which are really helping to unlock the power of AI and set up for durable ROI growth on the advertiser side, this is -- those are products like the foundation for data and measurement, things like Google Tech, consent mode and so on; and obviously, Search and PMax, we talked about it; and then all the gen AI products, all those different ones. So there's a whole lot of interest in those products, yes.",346

But very much to your question, yes, there was a stabilization in spending by advertisers. We're really pleased about that. We're particularly pleased about the ongoing performance in the Living Room and on Shorts. And as I said, that's both watch time growth and monetization. I'd say the other thing benefiting YouTube is the retail strength we talked about with Search, retail strength in APAC in both Search and YouTube. And that really began in the second quarter, continued in the third quarter, but that was another contributor. So quite a number of things going on. I feel good about the results the team was able to deliver here.",135

First, as we just think about the rollout of SGE across the user base, like how far along is that? And how do you balance the product rollout and consumer uptake versus monetization in that transition? 
And then the second one, also sort of generative AI related, how quickly are you guys finding new ways of optimizing whether that's shrinking model sizes, chip efficiencies or anything else? And do you think overall capital intensity of the business scales up or do you just find ways to do this more efficiently as usage scales? Anything you could share there would be great.",105
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q3 2023 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2023",2023-10-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3000.0,2925176.0,107816940.0,Answer,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,19,"On the first part about SGE, we are still in very, very early days in terms of how much we have rolled it out, but we have definitely gotten it out to enough people both geographically across user segments and enough to know that the product is working well, it improves the experience and -- but there are areas to improve, which we are fine-tuning. Our true north here is getting at the right user experience we want to, and I'm pretty comfortable seeing the trajectory. And we've always worked through these transitions, be it from desktop to mobile or from now mobile to AI and then to experience. And so it's nothing new. And I feel very comfortable that as we go through it, the strength of our teams, both on the organic side as well as at site, to drive the right experience for users, including ads, will pay dividends. And I think we'll continue to make improvements and make progress there. 
On your second question, at a high level, I would say, all through the -- we just celebrated 25 years. And of all the things I was proud about, when I looked at the strength of the work we have done across our infrastructure as a company, our technical infrastructure as a company, and various given stages, at a given moment in time when we adopted new generations of technology, we have looked at the cost of it. But then the curves, the efficiency curves, we have driven on top of it has always been phenomenal to see. And I see the current moment as no different. Already through this year, we are driving significant efficiencies both in our models, in training costs and serving costs and our ability to adapt what's needed to the right use case. And so I think we'll do everything that is needed to make sure we have the leading AI models and infrastructure in the world, bar none, and we'll continue driving efficiencies from there.",335

I think, in the broader context, you have to look at it as an overall YouTube subscription strategy. The great feedback we've gotten so far in the YouTube experience is very, very significant. People love the navigation. They love multi-view, they love the chats and the polls. And frankly, people are very happy with the lack of latency here. The #1 piece of concrete feedback the team has gotten is actually that people want the ability to pick their own games from multi-view, which is multi-view is the awesome feature we started rolling out on YouTube TV, that gives sense to the ability to basically watch multiple streams at once. And yes, overall, the teams are working hard to build a fantastic experience, and we are really trying to stay focused on getting our first season right and providing the best possible experience really for fans here.",167

Can you provide any color if there's been any pause in advertising around the Middle East conflict in October, anything we should be aware of for Q4? 
And then second, when we do think about the Sunday Ticket impact, I know you can't give us revenues or expenses, but overall, would that be a headwind to margins in Q4 or something we should be thinking about?",72
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q3 2023 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2023",2023-10-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3000.0,2925176.0,107816946.0,Answer,Ruth Porat,,Executives,25,"So look, on the first question, obviously, this is tragic. There are no words to talk about what's going on. And all of our focus has been on supporting our people there and how our products can be as helpful as possible in this very painful time broadly, and so nothing really to add.
And then in terms of the second question, Sunday Ticket, the only thing I tried to call out there is that clearly, this is the first full quarter of Sunday Ticket that is contributing overall to the subscription revenues that we see. That's in part of other revenues. Also, obviously, it is contributing to higher CAC in the fourth quarter. So we try to make that really clear. And as we look longer term, we expect to generate an attractive return over the life of the deal. We're continuing to invest in support of this and excited about the additional opportunities that come out of it, working with partners to deliver clips and other opportunities.
As we've said, we've heard positive feedback from our partners at the NFL about the new features and live stream reliability. And this is really a clear example of our ability to execute big partnerships with excellence at scale and really leverage a lot of the extraordinary magic at YouTube and across Google, and that's what we're excited about.",228

First, how do you think about the future structure of AI-driven Search capabilities? Will activity remain centralized in a search bar or will it be decentralized and present in many different applications, including on third-party applications? You alluded to Bard being integrated into multiple Google experiences earlier in the call.
And then the second question is, any update on the Chrome cookie deprecation plan to begin in 1Q '24? What have you seen so far based on your early testing of Privacy Sandbox? And what advertiser feedback have you received?",95

They always look for it in many, many different ways. We've given the product search example. People can directly go to Amazon, as an example, or come to Google. So if you zoom back and take an information view of the world, there's always been many different ways to get it. And part of our work we do in making Search be world-class and give users what they're looking for is so that we can get as much of that intent as possible. So I don't see that changing. With mobile, there were more ways people could get information, but we worked out to make Search work better in the mobile world. And similarly, a view with AI, there'll be many ways people get information, but it also offers us an opportunity in Search and in Assistant to take it to the next level and answer use cases, which we couldn't have done before, and expand the diverse set of needs where we are sourced. So that's how I see the opportunity ahead.",189

In the last several months, Chrome has really made significant progress on the Privacy Sandbox with APIs for developer testing, and they're now generally available in Chrome. Our ads team is testing these APIs. And as we shared back in April, the preliminary results of our interest-based ads testing showed that a combination of what we call privacy preserving signals and AI optimization actually provides positive results for businesses preparing for a cookie-less future.
We also recently announced that in Q1 of '24, we plan to deprecate third-party cookies for 1% of Chrome users, and this will support developers, obviously, in conducting their real-world experiments to assess the readiness and effectiveness of their products without third-party cookies. And we're overall encouraged by the ecosystem engagement on Privacy Sandbox. We'll continue to work with the industry and regulators in how these technologies can support the transition to, frankly, a more private web.",175

Ruth, you talked about these elevated levels of investments in Q4 and in '24. I'm sorry, were you referring to just CapEx or CapEx and total expenses? And then on the comments around stabilization in Cloud, is this something that you just started to see in the September quarter? Or had you seen that starting earlier in the year? And if you just started seeing it in the September quarter, would you have any thoughts on why you would have seen it, like Google Cloud would have seen it maybe later than some of the other hyperscalers?",100

I was trying to make the point that we are committed to meaningfully investing in CapEx given all the opportunities we see. We do continue to expect elevated levels of investment in our technical infrastructure. It will be increasing in the fourth quarter. And I talked about some of the difference in timing, muted timing, in the third quarter due to the timing of supplier payments and then tried to make it clear that we will continue to grow CapEx in 2024. Or more specifically, to your question, 2024 aggregate CapEx will be above the full year 2023. So that was the main one.
And then as it relates to Cloud, as Sundar said, what we're really excited about is the revenue growth does reflect healthy customer adoption across the portfolio, and that's infrastructure, data analytics and security.
