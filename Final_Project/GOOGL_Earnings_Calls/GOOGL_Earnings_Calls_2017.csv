29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2017",2017-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3518.0,1216446.0,49745648.0,Presenter Speech,Ruth Porat,,Executives,2,"Thank you. Our revenue of $26.1 billion in the fourth quarter underscores the continued excellent performance of our businesses globally. For the fourth quarter, our consolidated revenue grew 24% in constant currency versus 4Q '15, notwithstanding a challenging year-on-year comparison. 
Advertising revenue growth was driven by mobile search with ongoing strength in YouTube and programmatic. We also had substantial growth in other revenues from hardware, Play and Cloud. 
Our outline for today's call is first, I'll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet. Given the obvious seasonality in Q4, I'll focus on year-over-year changes in our results. You can find quarterly comparisons in the earnings release. 
Second, I'll review the results for Google and then Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with a summary of the full year results and our outlook. Sundar will then review our business and product highlights for the quarter after which we will take questions. 
Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Total revenue was $26.1 billion, up 22% year-over-year. We realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $202 million or $15 million after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to the prior period, our total revenue grew 24% year-over-year. 
Alphabet revenues by geography highlight the strength of our business around the globe. U.S. revenue was up 24% year-over-year to $12.7 billion. U.K. revenue was up 7% year-over-year to $2.1 billion, reflecting the continued weakness of the British pound relative to last year. 
In fixed FX terms, the U.K. grew 21% year-over-year. Rest of World revenue was up 24% versus last year to $11.3 billion. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 26% year-over-year. GAAP other cost of revenues was $5.8 billion, up 41% year-over-year. Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $5.5 billion, up 41% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, specifically costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, as well as hardware. 
The impact of our Q4 hardware launches is reflected in both revenues and cost of revenues. However, it's important to note that cost of revenues was also affected by approximately $320 million of one-time charges related to equipment and other adjustments, which were unrelated to hardware. GAAP operating expenses were $8.8 billion in the quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $7.3 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Year-on-year comparisons in part reflect the impact of the expenses from project milestones and Other Bets in 4Q '15 that we discussed last year. 
On a GAAP basis, operating income was $6.6 billion, up 23% versus last year. The operating margin was 25%. Non-GAAP operating income was $8.5 billion, up 24% versus last year. The operating margin was 33%. 
Stock-based compensation totaled $1.8 billion, up 29% year-over-year. Headcount at the end of the quarter was just over 72,000, up 2,100 people from last quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers to support growth in priority areas such as cloud, including the addition of employees from our Apigee acquisition. 
Other income and expense was $218 million. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 22% for the fourth quarter, reflecting the geographic mix of earnings and certain discrete items affecting our U.S. rate. Our effective tax rate for the full year 2016 was 19%. 
Net income was $5.3 billion on a GAAP basis and $6.6 billion on a non-GAAP basis. Earnings per diluted share were $7.56 on a GAAP basis and $9.36 on a non-GAAP basis. 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $3.1 billion. Operating cash flow was $9.4 billion with free cash flow up $6.3 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $86.3 billion, of which approximately $52 billion or 61% is held overseas. 
Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenue was $25.8 billion, up 22% year-over-year, which includes the impact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenue was $18 billion in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year. Year-on-year growth reflects strength in mobile search. YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView, including buying on DoubleClick Bid Manager. Network revenue was $4.4 billion, up 7% year on year, reflecting the ongoing strong growth of programmatic and AdMob, offset by the traditional network businesses. 
Other revenue for Google was $3.4 billion, up 62% year-over-year with strong performance from each of hardware, Play and Cloud. Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release. Let me remind you that these metrics are affected by currency movements.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $4.8 billion or 22% of total advertising revenue and up 20% year-over-year. The increase in both sites TAC, as a percentage of sites revenue, as well as network TAC, as a percentage of network revenue, reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. 
Total TAC, as a percentage of total advertising revenues, was up as a result of an increase in the sites TAC rate driven by the shift to mobile, which was partially offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites, which carries lower TAC. 
Operating income, excluding SBC, was $9.5 billion, up 19% versus last year for an operating margin of 37%. Google stock-based compensation totaled $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 29% year-over-year. Operating income reflecting the impact of SBC was $7.9 billion, up 17% versus last year. And the operating margin was 31%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $2.9 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities and data center construction. 
Turning to Other Bets. I'll cover results for the full year 2016 because it's most instructive to look at financials for Other Bets over a longer time horizon as discussed previously. Results for the quarter are in our earnings release. 
For the full year 2016, Other Bets revenue was $809 million, up 82% versus 2015, primarily generated by Nest, Fiber and Verily. Operating loss, excluding SBC, was $2.9 billion for the full year 2016, a slight decline from 2015. Including the impact of SBC, the operating loss was $3.6 billion for the full year, an increase of 4% over 2015. 
Other Bets accrued CapEx was $1.4 billion for the full year 2016, up 63% over 2015. Before I move to my conclusion, I'll quickly cover some specific changes to our past practices. 
First, we are making changes to our non-GAAP reporting. SBC has always been an important part of how we reward our employees in a way that aligns their interest with those of all shareholders. Although it's not a cash expense, we consider it to be real cost of running our business because SBC is critical to our ability to attract and retain the best talent in the world. 
Starting with our first quarter results for 2017, we will no longer regularly exclude stock-based compensation expense from non-GAAP results. Noncash stock-based compensation will continue to be reported on our cash flow statement, but we will no longer be providing a reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP measures that reflects SBC and related tax benefits. 
Second, we are shifting the timing of our annual equity refresh cycle for employees to the first quarter of every year. The next full year equity refresh will occur in the first quarter of 2018. Because the last full employee equity refresh occurred in the third quarter of 2016, we are providing employees with a one-time half grant in the first quarter of 2017. 
Overall, total SBC for 2017 will be roughly the same as it would have been had we maintained a Q3 refresh cycle. However, given the shift in refresh timing, they will not be the historical seasonal increase in SBC in Q3 and Q4. We do not plan any changes to our senior executive equity refresh, which occurs every 2 years with the next one planned for 2018. 
Third, to hedge our non-U.S. dollar earnings, we are moving from using options only to using primarily forwards. We believe they will be a more effective way to hedge earnings. We intend to continue to use options selectively. We continue to believe that constant currency revenue growth provides the best insight into underlying trends by isolating the impact of currency movements on revenue. We will continue to provide constant currency results for consolidated revenues as well as for revenues by geography. This will give you a view into the effects of currency movements on our revenue. 
Turning now to our full year 2016 performance and outlook. 2016 was simply a great year for us. Our extraordinarily talented employees worked very hard and successfully for our users around the globe. That commitment is reflected in the company's exceptional financial results. For the full year 2016, consolidated revenue grew 20% and excluding the impact of currency movements, grew 24%. GAAP operating income was up 23%. This performance is a testament to the ongoing innovation that is driving our success in mobile search, YouTube and programmatic advertising, each of which we believe has only begun to scratch the surface. We remain excited about the sizable opportunities that have not yet been tapped. 
Alongside these businesses, we are focused on growing additional revenue streams within Google over the medium and long term. In 2016, our other revenue line grew 41% on a full year basis, reflecting the growth in our Play, hardware and Cloud businesses. We see tremendous potential ahead for these businesses as well as in the continued development of nonadvertising revenue streams for YouTube. 
We're investing in our Cloud and hardware businesses as well as our newer nonad revenue sources for YouTube in order to accelerate their progress as major revenue drivers for Google in the next several years. We're also investing significantly in the machine-learning capabilities and next-generation computing infrastructure that will propel Google's growth over the longer term. 
For our Other Bets, we continue to calibrate the magnitude and pace of investment appropriate to their individual execution path. A couple of our recent announcements demonstrate our approach here. First, in December, WeiMo [ph] graduated into a stand-alone business within Other Bets. We did this because WeiMo [ph] achieved agreed thresholds on the path to commercialization in its technical and business model. WeiMo continues to excel at safety and has begun putting its new Chrysler Pacifica minivans on the road and is continuing to drive down hardware cost. Nest delivered an outstanding performance this holiday season with sales of key products more than doubling over the 2 weeks, including Black Friday and Cyber Monday. And just this morning, Verily announced that Temasek has agreed to invest $800 million for a minority stake in the company. Temasek's extensive experience with life sciences and health care companies and deep understanding of Asian markets, make it a valuable long-term partner for Verily. 
The internal transparency we've provided to our business leaders across the Other Bets and Google is helping us to allocate resources more thoughtfully across the opportunities that we see. We remain committed to managing for long-term revenue and EPS growth for dollars rather than margin targets while exercising careful stewardship over the amounts and pace of investment. 
I will now turn the call over to Sundar.",1930
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2017",2017-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3518.0,1216446.0,49745649.0,Presenter Speech,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Ruth. 2016 was a great year for Google and 2017 is shaping up to be even more exciting. This quarter was about the business firing on all cylinders and terrific progress across Google's newer areas of investment. 
Today, I'm going to talk about 3 things. First, the key trend powering Google today, machine learning and how it's improving our products and creating lots of opportunities. In particular, how it's underpinning our core mission of providing access to information for everyone, especially via the Google Assistant, which is off to a great start. 
Second, I want to talk about 3 of our biggest bets, YouTube, Cloud and hardware, where we are making great progress. And third, I'll discuss the great trends we are seeing across our platforms. Our vibrant computing platforms, Android, Chrome and Daydream, strong momentum in Google Play as well as our thriving advertising platform. 
First, machine learning and access to information. As I've shared before, computing is moving from a mobile first to AI first with more universal ambient and intelligent computing that you can interact with naturally, all made smarter by the progress we are making with machine learning. 
2016 was the year that this became central to who we are as a company and the products that we build. We had more than 350 launches powered by machine learning across areas like Search, Maps, messaging and Google Play. You have heard lots of these examples. Easier e-mail replies and inbox, better YouTube recommendations, the incredible cameras on our Pixel phones and smarter bidding for advertisers in AdWords. 
A centerpiece of our machine learning efforts is the Google Assistant, which allows users to have a natural conversation with Google to help them get things done across their experience. It's off to a great start. You can easily ask it to navigate home, tell you about your schedule for the day or even play trivia. We reached a milestone last month with the announcement of the Assistant developer platform called Actions on Google. It gives developers like Uber, SongPop and Headspace the opportunity to build conversations actions for Google Home, and we'll expand it even further this year. The Assistant is baked into our smart messaging app, Allo, which we expanded this quarter in languages like Hindi, Brazilian Portuguese and Japanese. 
This quarter, using neural machine translation, we have improved our translation ability more in one single leap than all our improvements over the last 10 years combined. We'll be rolling neural machine translation out across to more than 100 languages available in Google Translate in 2017 and also for all of our cloud customers through the Google Cloud translation API. 
And Google Photos, which as you know, has machine learning at its heart, continues to grow in popularity. Last quarter, we launched PhotoScan, which helps you digitize all of those old printed photos that are probably stored in a shoebox in your closet to keep them safe, organized and shareable. 
In February, we are hosting a summit where our machine learning team and other experts will discuss the future of the TensorFlow open source initiative and share some of their latest demos. 
Now I want to spend some time talking about 3 big bets, YouTube, Cloud and hardware. First, YouTube, which remains the premier destination for online video globally and is seeing tremendous growth. At the heart of YouTube success is its booming community of creators. Every single day, over 1,000 creators reach the milestone of having 1,000 channel subscribers. 
We are focused on 2 main areas of investment. First, creating the best video experience that's fast, personalized, searchable and that just works. We have rolled out many new features to the platform like 360-degree videos, mobile live streams and support for videos in virtual reality. In regions with limited connectivity, we introduced YouTube Go, which has transparency and control of data usage. 
Second, we are focused on delivering content that gives fans exactly what they want through offerings like YouTube Music, YouTube Kids and YouTube Red. We have 27 originals pairing some of the most popular YouTube creators with the biggest directors and producers in Hollywood. One of our new originals called This Is Everything: Gigi Gorgeous about the courageous journey of a transgender YouTube star, officially premiered at Sundance just a few days ago. The popularity of this original content has been successful in driving new subscribers and retaining existing ones, and we'll do more in 2017.
Second, our cloud business is on a terrific upswing. In 2016, we made huge strides building out our product offerings across all areas of Google Cloud Platform or GCP. We routinely hear from customers that we have now moved well-beyond table stakes, and we have truly differentiated offerings in 4 key areas: data analytics and machine learning, security and privacy, tools for application development and the ability to create connected business platforms leveraging our recent acquisition of Apigee. 
Our product advancements across all of GCP, in addition to our increased focus on how we work with the enterprise customers, have enabled us to accelerate growth with new Fortune 2000 customers while also inspiring our current customers to substantially expand their use of GCP. 
We've also enjoyed strong growth for G Suite, our cloud-based collaboration and productivity applications. G Suite achieved a significant new customer milestone last quarter. More than 3 million paying businesses are now using G Suite to collaborate smartly and securely in the cloud.
Our increased success with enterprise customers relates to the unparalleled security and data protection we can provide by offering entirely cloud-based solution that enables an extremely strong level of protection. 
For both GCP and G Suite, expanding our partner ecosystem continues to be a big focus. And last quarter, the team announced new alliances, including Intel, Improbable, Slack, Pivotal and Red Hat. Our customers and partners that are appreciating Google Cloud's dramatically accelerated pace of product rollout as well as our responsiveness to both their needs and aspirations. We look forward to showcasing customers, partners and all of Google Cloud at our next annual -- next user conference in March. Third, hardware. We introduced a new family of beautiful hardware devices in October that are made by Google led by Google Home on our Pixel phone, which featured a Google Assistant built in. We are thrilled with the reception as well as the really happy customers we saw over the holiday season. 
In particular, Google Home was a very popular present that many people opened on Christmas morning. We are committed to this for the long term as a great way to bring a beautiful, seamless Google Experience to people. The early signs are promising, and you can expect us to see us expand our offerings thoughtfully. We'll also continue working closely with our ecosystem partners to create the best experiences for our users. So those are 3 of our biggest bets. We are also continuing to push the platforms that are powering our business and our partners' businesses. First, our computing platforms and second, our advertising platforms. 
Building powerful open platform has always been core to Google and our platforms like Android, Chrome and Daydream are creating more innovation, more choice for users and more opportunities for partners. This was on full display at the CES show. There we saw partners like nVidia and AirTV introduce new media players based on Android TV and Casio and New Balance shared their latest Android Wear smart watches. We also work closely with Samsung on a new generation of Chromebooks, called the Samsung Chromebook Pro and Plus, which are getting great buzz. And then VR, we recently worked with partners like Huawei and ASUS and others to introduce even more new Daydream-ready devices. You see this is just a start, and there's a lot more coming from our great partners across these platforms in 2017, and we'll continue working hand in hand with them to provide the best experiences for our users. 
We're also investing in ways to help developers succeed using our platforms. Last week, we announced that we are acquiring the fabric mobile app development platform. This will work alongside our Firebase platform to help developers build better apps and grow their businesses. Since we launched Firebase at I/O, developers have created over 1 million Firebase projects. That's incredible momentum. Google Play helps bring our platforms to life on mobile and beyond and its experiencing great momentum. As a piece of trivia, do you know what 2016's top movie was on Google Play? I'll provide the answer in a second. 
Play had a great quarter with continued growth in our top markets as well as in emerging markets where users spend grew by more than 70% year-over-year in countries like India, Mexico, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. As the content hub across our growing platforms, the Play team is working hard to help users get the most out of their devices through apps, games and premium content. In Q4, the Play Store launched on Daydream. Android apps became available on Chromebooks, and we announced that the Play Store will soon be coming to Android Wear. The platform is also benefiting significantly from machine learning. We recently introduced a new Google Play music experience that makes music streaming smarter and easier to use with better recommendations and playlists. And the answer to my trivia question, the top movie in 2016 was Deadpool. 
Lastly, I quickly touch on the highlights across our growing advertising businesses. I'm so pleased with the terrific partnerships we have continued to grow this year. We work incredibly closely and deeply with agencies, marketers and publishers worldwide. These relationships owe a lot to the hard work of our fantastic business teams around the world. 
Our mobile properties like Search, YouTube, Maps and Google Play are where people turn when they're actively engaged. They are the prime time in the mobile era. We had another successful holiday season where we saw 2 clear trends. First, this was the year that mobile shopping went truly mainstream that shoppers using phones as a door to the store to locate nearby retailers, find promotions and comparison shop. 
We recently introduced promoted places in Google Maps, helping advertisers stand out with branded location icons, showing promotions and live updates of popular time's right when someone is looking for it. Gap, Inc. is one example of a company that understands the importance of connecting with consumers on mobile devices. In December, they increased their U.S. mobile search ad spend with us. And as a result, they saw about 4x the map -- mobile traffic to their U.S. e-commerce sites compared to December of last year. 
Second, we saw the season that measurement really matters and advertisers want reliable ways of understanding where their sales and traffic are coming from and how their campaigns are working. We saw increased use of our popular store visits technology over the holiday shopping season, helping businesses understand how online ads bring customers into their physical stores. In less than 2 years, store visits has helped advertisers measure over 3 billion store visits globally. 
Now turning to our thriving video ads business led by YouTube. Marketers are seeing terrific success this year. Air France used YouTube's TrueView video ads in order to reach valuable business travelers and new customers around the world. By showing engaging videos, highlighting the unique experiences of Air France, they saw more than 100 million views throughout the campaign. Turner Sports, partnered with YouTube and DoubleClick for NBA Opening Night, tried a new way to reach France for the start of the season. We helped them deliver real-time video ads with behind-the-scenes pregame footage uploaded immediately into a YouTube TrueView ad campaign. Thanks to the campaign. They were able to reach 19 million more people across the web [ph] with 17% left in ad recall. Speaking of DoubleClick, many news publishers who are using our Accelerated Mobile Pages are now plugging into our ad exchange to drive revenue. We are thrilled that most publishers are getting higher click-through rates and effective CPMs with their AMP pages. 
Before I end, I want to highlight one area that I'm really proud of were Google is truly leading the way. As you know, our data centers from Oklahoma to Chile to Finland enable our services to be blazing fast, and they are what makes it possible for Google Photos to offer unlimited storage. But to do all this, they use lots of energy. 
In 2012, we set a long-term goal to reach 100% renewable energy for our operations. In 2015, we procured enough renewable energy to cover 44% of our total. And in 2016, we increased it to more than 50%. I'm really proud that we will reach 100% renewable energy for global operations in 2017. This is great for the environment and with the renewable energy costs declining, it's a huge win for our business results, too.
With that, I want to thank the Googlers around the world who help make this another exciting quarter. Over to you, Ruth.",2180

As I said in my opening remarks, I do think we are seeing tremendous momentum with our partnerships team and how we are approaching. There were a lot of new alliances, which I talked about. So now we have teams dedicated to partnering with GSIs and we have a team focused on technology partnerships, too. 
On the GSI front, we announced a new alliance with Accenture last September to create industry solutions for a number of industries, including retail. So for me, I think, overall, everywhere I look at, we are establishing a world-class enterprise team. Partnerships has been a big focus and have seen progress there. 
I think as I said in my remarks overall, 2017, I expect to have a lot of momentum because we have moved well beyond the table stakes. Now we are really competing on areas, which we think we have differentiation. I talked about data analytics and machine learning, security and so on. So I think we are well positioned. The momentum when we look at the numbers internally and as well as the traction we see in competitive situations, I definitely think we're going to have a great year.

And we have a comprehensive strategy. We do want -- we invest in it for the long run. We are improving our computing experiences with machine learning. We expect to be there for users across the device ecosystem. And we're also building things like Google Play to work across all of this, so that users can have one coherent experience.

One was in cost of revenues. I noted that equipment costs were elevated by some one-time charges. And so there was some pressure there.

Again, Ruth, on that $320 million one-time charge, is there any more detail you can provide on that? It seems like a relatively sizable amount. And then, Sundar, if you could talk a little bit about Voice Search, particularly in the home and in the car and the importance of getting devices out in the marketplace? And the challenge I'll throw to you is it looks to me like Google devices are being outsold 10:1 or something like that in most -- in a lot of homes. And it doesn't -- it's immaterial now, but you could see 5 in years that there is a new voice search interaction interface and it's not Google in the home.

I think it's a very natural way for users to interact. We think it will be one mode. Users will have many different ways by which they interact with computing. And for voice, as you pointed out, we expect voice to work across many different contexts. So we are thinking about it across phones, homes, TVs, cars and trying to drive that ecosystem that way. And we want Google to be there for users when they need it. And even with Google Home, we just launched it in Q4. We had a very strong quarter there. And we are going to invest a lot in it over 2017. It's very early days. When I look at what it would take to Voice Search well, our years of progress we have done in areas like natural language processing comes into play. And I think there's a lot of work ahead to make all of this work well for users. And this is the core area where we invested in for the very long term. And so I feel very comfortable about how this will play out in the future.",199

We're really pleased with the ongoing strength we have there, as we've talked about on prior calls. It's largely driven by video, primarily TrueView, with a strong contribution from DoubleClick Bid Manager. And we are continuing to invest significantly in the business given the importance of supporting the ecosystem of content creators through partner payments, marketing, YouTube Originals, YouTube Spaces. We're broadening the platform. We're investing in the requisite infrastructure given machines and bandwidth required. And Sundar elaborated on some of the upside we see there on the non-ads side. And really, the point I was trying to stress consistent with Sundar's comment is we've got the non-ads momentum here on the YouTube side and we're also seeing tremendous momentum with cloud, which we're excited about and the hardware are investing behind those. So those continue to build out the revenue streams as we're looking in the near to medium to long term.",168

Now I would encourage you to think about it as from a user standpoint, they are looking for information, looking to get things done. The voice queries are one part of the total journey they are on. So when we think about something like the Google Assistant, we think about this is an ongoing conversation with our users across different contexts. So they may ask a question on voice later when they pick up their phone. They want continuity. So we think of this is an end-to-end thing. And all of this means users engage more, more with us, more with computing and look for more information and I think the trends we see are positive. So we think about it from a long-term perspective.

The first one, just to go back to YouTube. Appreciate the color around the content. I would be curious to hear about how you think philosophically about partnering with more premium content players to maybe drive even higher engagement and even better YouTube experience. And then the second one, you've kind of stepped back at your mobile search business in the verticals, the innovation you had at retail and then travel with shopping and Hotel Finder. I guess I'd be curious to hear about where you see the biggest potential for more improvements in certain verticals for an even more relevant and higher search results.",108

We are trying to connect creators with users, form a community. And so we work hard to bring more premium content. We already work with TV networks and their individual shows, whether it's the late night show like James Corden or Jimmy Fallon, afternoon shows like Ellen, sports programming like NBA and NFL. For example, sports is one of the most popular verticals. We have hundreds of sports partnership in place. And so we'll continue to invest that and drive the premium content there. On the second one, if -- we do look at the end-to-end experience, we look at what are the kinds of tasks which users are trying to get done, mobile raises the bar. We want to provide those deeper experiences for users. And so I generally think local is a big area. We have strong assets there with Maps. And so we think about how we can improve the local experience a lot more for users. So for example, within local areas like dining, we work closely with our partners to make that better. So we can get it at a pretty granular level and we try to hit all the areas. And so I think you'll see progress in all these areas over the next few years.",228

So is there anything you could highlight on ad format?

I think video advertising I think it's in very early days. We see whenever we -- are at the innovation phase and advertiser response to all these new formats has been really positive. So for example, a bumper ad, our second video format the that we launched is already being used by thousands of accounts, including major brands like Universal Pictures and Netflix. On your question around how we think about the experience across screens. It's really important to understand users consume YouTube across screens and so they experience consistent experience. And similarly from an advertising standpoint, we want that to be thoughtful for users, more element across screens as well. And so that's the context in which we do this. We give users control over the access experience, but I do think as part of these changes, advertisers can get more detailed insights from their YouTube campaigns across devices, so they can better understand the impact of their marketing campaigns. So I think it's early days, but I think it's the right direction, and I think we will see good traction from it.",212

And then for Ruth, you mentioned programmatic drove the network numbers -- revenue growth this quarter.

I wouldn't extrapolate from it. As you know, there can be some seasonality and Q1 is typically lower than the fourth quarter. I think the main point is that the programmatic business continues to be a strong contributor with significant growth reflecting the ongoing advertiser adoption just given the overall efficiency of programmatic and improved targeting and the benefit of inventory growth. And so the story is pretty much unchanged. We continue to see the growth in programmatic, offset by declines in the more traditional businesses. And when you're looking at the quarter-over-quarter, you're continuing to see things like the impact of policy changes and timing of product launches. But I just think that there were a number of things that went well this quarter. Q3 was a bit lighter, so that's been flatter, the quarter-over-quarter comparison but I wouldn't extrapolate from this.",170

And how you think about that versus the potential disruption that having your own handset at a bigger scale could cause in the Android ecosystem? Do you think this is something that should get meaningful market share without disrupting the ecosystem? And then second follow-up related to this would be on the Pixel phones with Google Assistant having been built uniquely into the core of the experience, is there anything you're learning as the usage of that increases? Is it driving a step-function increase in engagement with the hardware and software integration?",119

I think it's really important when you work on a platform, you have to drive it forward so we've always done by putting out the state-of-the-art, and I think it especially gets important in the vision we have for computing, where users are going to use it across many different contexts. And so to do that end-to-end experience, it spans devices, so I think it's important for us to work at the intersection of hardware, software and services. And so that's how we think about it. And I think we invest a lot more in our ecosystem. And I mentioned earlier, I'm incredibly excited at the lineup we have for this year from our partners. So we do both and we're very thoughtful about it. I think the scale at which we are doing it shows it's working. And I'm confident we'll be able to strike that balance well. In terms of Google Assistant on the Pixel along with how Search works, I think definitely, it gives us a way to iterate and move faster and make sure it's working better for users. Our thesis is that as we make it easier for users to have Google at their fingertips across what they are doing and including many modes whether it be typing or asking Google a question, we find that it overall benefits. And so it will be a long-term trend, but I think our early results show that our intuition is right there, and so we'll continue approaching it that way.",261

But -- so I'm wondering how you view your own instant apps as well as products model operators to let consumers try apps either in a messenger product or in a [indiscernible] environment. Do these innovations present an opportunity or a challenge for you at a play franchise? And secondarily, it seems like the recurring theme in your prepared remarks is how AI's making the consumer products better. Is there anything you can share in terms of how maybe making monetization better?",115

You need an ecosystem to -- you need the apps and services ecosystem to work cohesively across all of this. And that's what I like about how we are approaching Google Play. And you saw us this quarter see Google Play work beyond Android phones, they're coming to Chromebooks, they work in Daydream, they work in Android Wear. And so it's an end-to-end thing which works well. That's the most important thing so that as the user, you know whether you're engaging with a game or a TV show that you can reliably get it across your computing experience. And we'll adapt, and I think we will drive innovation simply to go where what's right for users and developers. And so be it instant apps or driving better HDMI[ph] experiences. We invest in all of that, and I think we'll move it all forward. On your second question about how machine learning and AI is improving our monetization, it definitely -- I mean, just like we had many, many launches last year which involved machine learning being incorporated across Google, including our monetization products. Our monetization teams at Google have always been at a cutting edge of what I would call up as machine learning techniques from early days on, and -- so they are doing it. It is early days now, but I think we already have really new insights. And so we'll bake it in over the course of the year.",271

And users have an identity, they have preferences and so, for example, think about it from a user standpoint if they don't like one particular ad or they don't want to see an ad from a particular advertiser. They want it to work across that experience, across that cross-device experience. So we think about it that way.

We don't start the year thinking our plan is to increase ad coverage or something like that, right. We are -- we have many experiments in the pipeline. We see how user behavior is evolving and in conjunction with that, we evolve our ad experiences. For example, as people use mobile, scroll more, et cetera, the user behavior changes and we adapt to that in a very, very disciplined way. So last year, you saw us maybe increase coverage in certain way. For example, in desktop, we removed ads on the right-hand side. And so we take a very holistic approach to these things.

29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2017",2017-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3553.0,1216626.0,49754015.0,Presenter Speech,Ruth Porat,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Ellen. Our revenues of $24.8 billion in the first quarter demonstrate our broad-based strength globally, with revenues up 22% year-on-year. In constant currency, our consolidated revenues grew 24% versus 1Q '16.
Growth in advertising revenues was again driven by mobile search with ongoing strength in YouTube and programmatic. We also had substantial growth in other revenues from Play, hardware and cloud.
Our outline for today's call is, first, I'll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet. Given the obvious seasonality in Q4, I will focus on year-over-year changes in our results.
As a reminder, I will review our results on a GAAP basis, which includes stock-based compensation for operating income, net income and earnings per share. Second, I will review results for Google and then Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take questions.
Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Total revenues were $24.8 billion, up 22% year-over-year. We realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $304 million, or $87 million after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to the prior period, our total revenues grew 24% year-over-year.
Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography. As you can see in our press release, we've enhanced the geographic split to give you more insight into our businesses around the world. We are now reporting our revenues in 4 regions: The U.S.; EMEA, namely Europe, Middle East and Africa; APAC or Asia Pacific; and other Americas, which encompasses Canada and Latin America. To help you with the transition to our new geographic reporting, we're also sharing the U.K. revenues for this quarter. These groupings align more closely with how we manage our businesses, and also with the major currencies that affect our results. The results by region highlight the strength of our business around the globe.
U.S. revenues were up 25% year-over-year to $11.8 billion. EMEA revenues were $8.1 billion, up 13% year-over-year. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 19%. U.K.-reported revenues continue to reflect the ongoing weakness of the British pound, with revenues up 5% year-over-year to $2 billion on a reported basis, yet up 16% in fixed FX terms. APAC revenues were $3.6 billion, up 29% versus last year and up 26% in fixed FX terms, reflecting strength of the Australian dollar and yen. Other Americas revenues, which include results from Canada and Latin America, were up 34% versus last year to $1.3 billion. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 29% year-over-year, with fixed FX growth reflecting strength in the Brazilian real.
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, were $9.8 billion, up 28% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $5.2 billion, up 34% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, specifically costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation; and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube; as well as hardware-related costs, reflecting the continued strong performance of our new Made by Google product line.
Operating expenses were $8.4 billion in the quarter, up 15% year-over-year. Year-on-year comparisons in part reflect the change in the timing of our annual equity refresh cycle with a half-year grant in Q1, which enables us to move to a single annual compensation cycle. As discussed last quarter, this affects the timing of stock-based compensation, but does not affect the overall size of the SBC expense for the year. The year-on-year increase is therefore more sizable in Q1 and Q2 compared to previous years, with less of a year-on-year impact in both Q3 and Q4.
More specifically, stock-based compensation totaled $2 billion, up 34% year-over-year. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 73,992, up 1,939 people from last quarter. The growth in consolidated headcount was somewhat muted by an internal reallocation of people from Fiber to Google. Consistent with prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers.
In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount growth was in cloud, consistent with the priority we place on this business. Operating income was $6.6 billion, up 23% versus last year. The operating margin was 27%. Other income and expense was $251 million. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. 
Our effective tax rate was 20% for the first quarter, net income was $5.4 billion and earnings per diluted share were $7.73. Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow.
Cash CapEx for the quarter was $2.5 billion. Operating cash flow was $9.5 billion with free cash flow of $7 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $92.4 billion, of which approximately $55.7 billion or 60% is held overseas. Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment.
Revenues were $24.5 billion, up 22% year-over-year, which includes the impact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $17.4 billion in the quarter, up 21% year-over-year. The biggest contributor to growth again this quarter was mobile search, reflecting the secular shift to mobile due to the greater utility of smartphones for users and advertisers, but obviously, also benefiting from our focus on continuously enhancing features and functionality.
YouTube revenues continue to grow at a significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising. Network revenues were $4 billion, up 9% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing strong growth of Programmatic and AdMob. Results benefited from a slower rate of decline in the traditional network business than in prior periods, although it continues to be negatively affected by both the ongoing shift by advertisers to programmatic and our ongoing policy efforts.
Other revenues for Google were $3.1 billion, up 49%. Last quarter, we talked about our bigger investment areas, and you can see the strong momentum here, reflecting contributions from each of Play, hardware and cloud.
Specifically, Play benefited from both broad-based app strength, but also from all the work we have done in areas such as direct carrier billing, which helps more people globally access and buy their favorite apps and games on Google Play. Hardware continues to have strong growth and remains an important area for us with our family of products extending geographically. Google Cloud continues to drive sizable growth, with Google Cloud platform remaining one of the fastest-growing businesses across Alphabet.
Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $4.6 billion or 22% of total advertising revenues, and up 22% year-over-year. The increase in both sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenues, as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenues, reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC.
Total TAC, as a percentage of total advertising revenues, was up year-over-year as a result of an increase in the sites TAC rate driven by the shift to mobile, which was again partially offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites, which carries lower TAC.
Google's stock-based compensation totaled $1.9 billion for the quarter, up 40% year-over-year. Operating income, including the impact of SBC, was $7.6 billion, up 22% versus last year. And the operating margin was 31%.
Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $2.4 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities and data center construction.
Turning to Other Bets. For the first quarter, Other Bets revenues were $244 million, primarily generated by Nest, Verily and Fiber. Operating loss, including the impact of SBC, was $855 million for the first quarter. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $170 million, primarily reflecting a reduced investment in fiber due to the pause in expansion we announced in 3Q '16.
Let me conclude. First, we benefited from our team's innovations that continually enhance our advertising business as evidenced by the ongoing growth of sites revenues. On a dollar basis, the increase in sites revenues reflects the healthy growth in mobile search. As we discussed in prior calls, even though mobile revenue growth requires an increasing investment in the mobile ecosystem in the form of higher TAC, our strength in mobile search is adding meaningfully to profit dollars.
Second, the strong performance in our advertising business allows us to take bigger bets within Google to fuel the growth of additional revenue streams, including those from cloud, hardware and YouTube subscription offerings.
Cloud is one of our most important strategic priorities, given the scale of opportunity in a rapidly evolving sector and the fact that the requirements for success align with many of our strengths. We will continue to invest here for the long-term opportunity.
Similarly, hardware remains an exciting growth opportunity for us, and you've seen the early indicators again this quarter.
Finally, in Other Bets. We're determining the size and pace of investment appropriate to each bet given their stage of development and achievements against milestones. We expect to increase near-term investment in certain areas while continuing to calibrate the pace of investment in others as they move along a path to commercialization. For example, as I hope you saw earlier this week, Waymo announced it has commenced the trial of its self-driving cars in the Phoenix area. Waymo also announced it is expanding its fleet of minivans to support this trial. These actions reflect the tremendous accomplishment of our team over many years, leading with safety and now beginning to bring the experience to consumers.
I will now turn the call over to Sundar.",1623
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2017",2017-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3553.0,1216626.0,49754016.0,Presenter Speech,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Ruth. It's been a terrific start to the year. This quarter was notable for the fantastic momentum across our products, advances for the Google Assistant, the launch of YouTube TV and lots of new features launched at our Google Cloud Next event. 
In the next few weeks, there's much more to come. We'll host our annual developer conference, Google I/O; our advertising event, Google Marketing Mix; and our YouTube upfront, Brandcast. I hope you'll join us.
Today, I'll discuss 3 things. First, how our continued investments in machine learning are fueling innovation across Google, and particularly, how it's helping drive our core mission of providing access to information for everyone. Second, progress in 3 of our biggest bets: YouTube, cloud and hardware. And third, our platforms, such as Android and our advertising platform, which power businesses and computing experiences around the world.
Now turning first to machine learning and access to information. I'm really happy with how we are transitioning to on AI-first company. The Google Assistant is one of our first steps towards that future. This quarter, we brought the assistant to your wrist with Android Wear 2.0, announced that it will soon come to Android TV and began rolling it out to hundreds of millions of people with Android phones running Nougat and Marshmallow.
We also continued to announce new integration partners for the Google Assistant, so you can now ask it to do things like dim the living room lights. Stay tuned for more to come.
Advances in machine learning are helping us make many Google products better. One example from this quarter is the launch of parking predictions in Google Maps. Beyond that, we continue to set the pace in machine learning and AI research. We introduced a new technique for training deep neural networks on mobile devices called Federated Learning. This technique enables people to run a shared machine-learning model while keeping the underlying data stored locally on mobile phones.
DeepMind is bringing AlphaGo to China in May, pairing AI with the world's best players at the Future of Go Summit. And it's very exciting to see the incredible things that developers and researchers are building on the TensorFlow platform. There are more than 6,000 GitHub projects and counting.
Search remains the heart of our mission to make information available to everyone, and we are laser-focused on making search even better. In March, we introduced tappable shortcuts in Google search to help you easily access topics you care about like sports, entertainment and weather. And earlier this week, to improve our results further, we introduced algorithmic ranking improvements as well as easier ways for people to provide direct feedback in auto complete and featured snippets.
Last week, we made big improvements to one of our longest-standing and most-loved products, Google Earth. It's really beautiful and easy to use. Now you can experience breathtaking locations in virtual reality, like the top of Table Mountain in South Africa.
Moving on to 3 of our biggest bets, YouTube, cloud and hardware. First, YouTube, where we continue to see extraordinary growth and opportunities. People around the world are watching more content on YouTube than ever before.
In 2016, we passed a big milestone that continues to grow. Every day, users watch over 1 billion hours on YouTube. YouTube continues to be the most popular destination for online video globally, and we are focused on building awesome experiences. This quarter, we announced YouTube TV, which offers live TV from major broadcast and cable networks, a cloud-based DVR without storage limits and streaming on all of your devices. We have launched in 5 cities so far, and the positive feedback from customers has been really incredible.
Our destination for family and kids content called YouTube Kids also recently celebrated its second birthday. There have been more than 30 billion media views in the app to date.
Next, our growing cloud business. Our Google Cloud Next conference in March was a great opportunity to highlight core areas of differentiation for GCP, like new security products and the recognition that we had the highest cloud availability in 2016 according to CloudHarmony. It was attended by 5x as many people as last year.
We also demonstrated new machine-learning services and announced our acquisition of Kaggle, the largest community of data scientists focused on machine learning and AI. We introduced dozens of new products, including Spanner, a database optimized for distributed computing that can reliably update data across multiple data centers, and our G Suite team introduced a major expansion of our collaboration platform with Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat.
To give you a taste of the kinds of large enterprise customers and partners we are now working with across GCP, we were joined onstage by major companies like HSBC, Home Depot, Schlumberger and SAP as well as large new G Suite customers including Colgate-Palmolive.
We continue to see tremendous momentum in education, where our products are leading the industry, thanks to their simplicity, security and low cost. Chromebooks are now used by more than 20 million teachers and students, and more than 70 million people actively use G Suite for education.
Over the last several months, we have noticed a change in the types of conversations that Diane and her team are having with customers. Increasingly, we are being asked to partner for mission-critical projects and full migrations, moving data from on-prem data centers to the cloud. We are seeing a meaningful shift, and this momentum is resulting in a fast-growing business. On to our next big bet, hardware.
Last year, we debuted a beautiful new family of hardware devices, including the Pixel, Google Home and Google Wifi, bringing together the best of Google across hardware and software. We are finding that people who buy products like Pixel and Google Home are not only incredibly happy with their purchase, but also are very likely to recommend it to others. Sales continues to be strong, and we are actively working to bring these great devices to more people around the world. Just a few weeks ago, we announced that Google Home and Google Wifi are now available in the U.K.
Speaking of Google Home, last week, we made it possible for up to 6 people to connect their accounts to one Google Home. And thanks to our leading voice recognition technology, it can recognize who is speaking to it. It's really a game changer.
And finally, we are continuing to invest in our computing and advertising platforms. Our platforms have had great success over the years, creating incredible user experiences as well as real opportunities and economic success for partners, creators and developers around the globe. To illustrate, in the past 3 years, in Europe, the Middle East and Africa alone, we paid out more than $15 billion to our publisher, creator and app developer partners. That's across AdSense, YouTube and Google Play. And it doesn't even include device sales by many hardware partners who build on Android. There's tremendous momentum in the Android ecosystem, as evidenced by the great reception of the beautiful Samsung Galaxy S8. We'll have much more to say at I/O next month.
In March, we introduced the first developer preview of Android O, featuring improvements for battery life, notifications and picture-in-picture display. The Android platform is also seeing great growth in emerging markets. In 2016, nearly 300 million new users adopted Android devices from countries like India and Brazil.
We also announced the public launch of Android Wear 2.0 with 2 new flagship watches from LG. And thanks to partnerships with major brands like TAG and Fossil, there will be more than 20 different Android Wear watches available this year, doubling the number from last year.
Our virtual reality platform, Daydream, which debuted almost a year ago, continues to gain traction with more devices and more great content, like VR Video. More than 50% of time in Daydream is video consumption, and YouTube VR is Daydream's #1 app by time spent.
Lastly, I'll talk about the highlights and trends we are seeing across our growing advertising business, where there are still enormous opportunities. As you can see from our results, we continue to experience remarkable growth worldwide. Not only are existing advertisers choosing to spend more as they see the value of our ads, but many more businesses around the world are just getting started on our ad platforms, from India to Brazil and many more.
Our momentum continues to be driven by the shift to mobile. Our great properties like Search, Maps, YouTube and Google Play, are the prime time for the mobile world, where people are actively engaged and interested. We have increased our investment in machine learning in our advertising business with efforts like Smart Bidding, where our systems predict the performance of an ad and adjust advertisers' bids in real-time to maximize their results. Two areas where we are seeing particular strength are retailers and app developers.
Mobile has transformed the shopping experience. In the past year, local shopping queries have increased by 45% and the number of retailers that provide us with their local inventory feeds has doubled. Our investments in innovative ad formats, improved targeting and better measurement are really helping retailers, who see us an ally in their corner. Brands like Williams Sonoma have seen a 70% increase in mobile sales year-over-year, with Google's mobile shopping ads playing a big part.
Secondly, developers use us to help their app stand out from the crowd. Thanks to our app-installed advertising products, developers have already driven more than 5 billion app downloads. Our flagship product here, Universal App Campaigns, allows developers to easily promote their apps across Google Search, Play, YouTube and the Google Display Network. It incorporates machine learning to improve campaigns and drive great results for advertisers. We recently announced new innovations at the Game Developers Conference, including an interactive playable app format in Universal App Campaigns that lets users play a lightweight version of your game right in the ad. It's really effective in driving installs from engaged users.
Now on to our growing media advertising business. Brands love the reach and engagement that they get across YouTube, along with the effectiveness of formats like TrueView skippable ads and our new Bumper ads, which are snackable 6-second videos that drive incremental reach and frequency. We recently did research on more than 120 Bumper ad campaigns, and the data showed that they drove a significant lift in brand awareness and ad recall.
Under Armour used both Bumper ads and TrueView together to promote a new product launch recently, resulting in double the lift in product interest among people who saw both ads compared to those who only saw the TrueView ad. We work incredibly hard to get the -- to create the best environment for brands on YouTube. The cornerstone of our offering is Google Preferred, which allow brands to advertise against the top 5% of our content.
We also announced new safeguards for advertisers through a combination of updated ad policies and enforcement, new default settings around where ads can appear, improved controls for advertisers and third-party brand safety reporting. Brands and agencies understand how hard we work to create the safest possible environment. We do this while also being very careful to ensure YouTube's innovative creators can earn money to support their unique and popular content.
We've been actively engaged in conversations with clients about the new tools and controls we are providing, and we are having very productive discussions ahead of Brandcast next week.
Finally, programmatic advertising. As market has continued to shift to its programmatic ad buying, our DoubleClick platform makes it easy for them to effectively reach the right audiences. We've been focusing on making more inventory available to more advertisers, especially premium inventory.
For instance, we recently expanded our Programmatic Guaranteed reservation product to advertisers globally. And we made traditional TV inventory available to buy in DoubleClick Bid Manager. So that's a run-through of some highlights for the quarter. Thanks to every Googler for making Google such an exciting and inspiring place to work every day.
Over the last few days, we have had Take Your Child to Work Day at Google, which is one of my favorite events of the year. We have had thousands of excited screaming kids running around the Googleplex, which is how I feel some days, too. What motivates us at Google is building the technologies that will be central to all of their computing experiences, to give them opportunities to learn, to be heard and to succeed.
And with that, I will hand it back over to Ruth.",2108

Can you just talk more about the go-to-market strategy for GCP and how you plan on building up the reseller channel there going forward? And then, secondly, Sundar, on Waymo. I was curious on some of your thoughts, I know it's early, but on the timing for Waymo to become commercially viable. And then what are the key guideposts and requirements along the way?",78

So we are thrilled with the progress we have made there since Diane arrived, building out world-class sales, marketing and engineering teams. The heavy lifting, I would say, is around how we meet the enterprises in the market. We have reorganized, so we have one face to the customer. So it's not just sales reps. We've been thoughtful about how we have built out the entire go-to-market organization. So we created 2 new areas that customers can now take advantage of. One is the office of the CTO, which helps customers solve difficult technical problems. And the second is our Advanced Solutions Lab, where customers can get help for machine learning experts. And on top of that, now, we have a phenomenal support team that helps keep customers' applications up and running. So I think what we have done, our approach is One Google. When a customer signs up for Google Cloud, they get more than GCP and G Suite, they have access to the ads and analytics teams, YouTube teams and resources within our organization. So I think it's coming along quite well.",206

We started with safety. We remain a leader in safety, and we continue to view that as the foundation for success. And at this point, we're exploring many options, enabling ride-sharing, personal-use vehicles, logistics and deliveries. And we also see opportunities to work with cities to address public transportation. So the announcements that we made this week are a continuation of the progress the team has made. We do have a strong relationship with Fiat Chrysler, increased our car order given the opportunity. They have been our primary partner to date. But to note, we're in active discussions with others around the globe. And then I think, importantly, the trial in the Phoenix area is something that's been in the works for some time, and we do look forward to that trial. So it's still in the early days and we're excited about the upside from Waymo.",178

I mean, Next was -- having them in Google I/O many, many times, I was surprised to see the scale and growth of Next from even last year to this year. We had 5 many times as (sic) [ 5x as many ] people. I think everyone really appreciated seeing large customers, very sophisticated customers, like HSBC, eBay, Colgate-Palmolive, et cetera, discussing use of Google Cloud, GCP. Along with Diane, I did follow-up lunches with a set of people. And so the feedback has been very positive. People sense our commitment to the area. They understand the pace at which we are investing. They see that we have committed to machine learning and AI at a deep level. They appreciate how we are open sourcing things. Fei-Fei's talk was extraordinarily well received. They are noticing the acquisitions we are making of Kaggle and AppBridge, a couple of acquisitions which happened around that time. So all that, all those details, I think, clearly made an impact. I just spoke about the go-to-market progress. And I think that's beginning to get traction as well. In general, I think there is a very strong recognition that we have pivoted to being a deep enterprise company and conversations are very strategic. We are engaging at the highest levels within companies. And so overall, I can see qualitatively the momentum there. When we are in the middle of deals, we find we are very competitive and there are areas where our customers perceive us as best-in-class already. So it's been exciting to see.",261

I wanted to know, what have you seen in terms of consumer adoption of Google Assistant, whether at the Pixel level or the Google Home level? What does it give you in terms of sense in how people want to interact with the Assistant, what it might do in terms of putting artificial intelligence capabilities down to the consumer level and improve consumer experiences over the next couple of years?",78

I mean, Pixel is a good example because I think it's the place where we do the leading work here. And how we presented Google Assistant in the Pixel, well received, both qualitatively in terms of consumer feedback we get, quantitatively in terms of how we see people using voice, how we see people interacting with overall Google Assistant and search better. So we find that when we drive the Assistant experience well, it works overall in helping people engage with Google at a broader level. It's always surprising to us, all they said. Even with search, every single day, we see so many new types of queries. When you bring the Assistant in the mix, you start getting even more different types of queries. And queries are more casual, more conversational. And so over time, I think it starts breaking down the barriers to computing people have, and that's what makes it very, very exciting. Now artificial intelligence will help us push all that further. Just to give an example, we will make text to speech much, much better over time. Yesterday, we announced our neural machine translation is launching in 9 new languages. So all that starts accruing to the Assistant and I think will overall improve the consumer experience pretty dramatically. We'll talk about all this a lot more at Google I/O. So stay tuned.",231

Sundar or Ruth, there was some press about the -- some of the pushback or some of the controversy around content and advertising and monetization of that. Are those technical problems that can be solved over time? Or is it just the magnitude of the volume of content and trying to keep bad content off the site, however that's defined, and keep it from being monetized? Is that just -- is that an ongoing technology challenge? Or did you only already find a solution? And do you see any material impact to advertisers' budget interest with YouTube? And then if you could also comment briefly on Google Maps. This is one of those massive properties that you've owned that's highly used by almost everybody. And I think the monetization to date has been really de minimis. Is there anything that's changed for you in terms of your thought about the ability to monetize Google Maps over time?",168

We have taken it pretty seriously, and we are taking significant steps. And obviously, as part of doing that, we brought new technical solutions into place. Machine learning is a great example of it. It helps us enforce -- as we improve our policies, it helps us enforce it better. And we are in early days. So as machine learning gets better, I think we'll be able to do all of this even better and create that virtuous cycle. Overall, I'm pretty confident at the rate at which we have made progress. And we are going to continue investing a lot here. It is super important to us that this ecosystem works well. It matters for advertisers. It matters for content creators. And so we take that responsibility very seriously. I would say advertisers have clearly noticed all the improvements we have made. Our conversations with them are very, very positive. And so I'm pretty optimistic about how we'll continue to make progress here. On Google Maps, your question is -- it's a good question. I get surprised that for a property, which we had launched many, many years ago, even now that it's showing strong growth, especially in emerging markets. Maps is an integral part of your mobile phone. And as we get more -- as users get more interested in the real world around them, with AR and so on, I think Maps will continue to play a bigger role. We take a long-term view. It's already impacting monetization very significantly for us with local search. So today, when you use Google, a lot of the information we are able to do is because of Google Maps. But I'm sure you've noticed changes within Google Maps over the past few months. If you open Google Maps, you're traveling or you're out on a Friday evening, we start surfacing a lot more interesting information about what you can do, places to eat and so on. So those are beginning to get good feedback from users. And I think that gives us opportunity to add value there over time as well.",363

Today, we have many touch points. Obviously, people, we reach out to SMBs. They want to get listed in Search and in Maps. AdWords Express has been a big part of how they want to advertise on our platforms. We obviously provide things like Google Apps to SMBs. So we have a lot of touch points. And internally, we are beginning to do a much better job of reaching out and having a more thoughtful go-to-market approach. I think there's a lot more work there. But the rate at which we are seeing advertisers, small and medium businesses, on our platform has been growing very, very strongly as well. So indications are that it's already currently working at scale. We have millions and millions of SMBs on our platform, and the number continues to grow very well.

I've been happy to see the evolution in our shopping experiences. Retail, overall, also happens to be an amazing category for us from a Google Cloud standpoint. So in some ways, we are developing deeper partnerships with retailers around the world. And so as we start doing that, and I think as we get a better understanding of their inventory and the data, how we can translate all of that into our core experiences is a bit of the work ahead.

First, this morning on the earnings call, WPP's CEO, Sir Martin Sorrell, noted that the company is being very responsive, I think, were his words, to some of the recent concerns that we had talked about earlier in the Q&A. We've also seen some official policy changes, things like that. I'd be interested, Sundar, to hear a little bit more about some of the softer outreach that you may be doing, thinking of Philipp Schindler's team, maybe the agency relations team and how your people are reaching out and connecting with their clients, especially as you go into Brandcast. And then the second follow-up on YouTube was, I'd be interested to hear your updated thoughts on the role of the YouTube Spaces. I think Ruth's prepared comments on CapEx mentioned some investments in production equipment, I don't know if that is related to that or something related to cloud, but it does seem that the Spaces remain an important part of YouTube and continue to grow, and I'd love to hear an updated view on them.",185

One of the things I've noticed is depth of relationships we have with our advertisers was very evident to me as we went through this over the past few weeks. I would estimate, I think, Philipp Schindler's team has probably made literally thousands and thousands of calls, in-persons conversations. And I think that deep relationship is what allowed us to respond thoughtfully. And I think the feedback from our partners were very positive and constructive, and I think we are evolving overall to a better place. And so I think, to me, that shows the long-term investments you make in these relationships, et cetera, plays -- plays well at times like these. And Brandcast is, again, an important touch point. And the excitement out of Brandcast, both internally and from our partners, all has the right indications for us. On YouTube on Spaces, I visited the YouTube Space. I took my family to the YouTube Space in New York and we had a lot of fun. Our creators love these spaces. They are something we are thoughtfully building out. They have a good return on investment for us. But we are very thoughtful about it. And I don't think that's a major factor in any of the CapEx we talked about here.",224

And the CapEx, when I talked about production equipment, we were talking about machines, and that was the primary driver here. We're investing more in machines, given both our growing requirements and the higher cost of the new generation of machines and accelerators. So that will be more expensive in the short term, and we are continuing to build our inventory, but it does increase performance and, we believe, reduce total cost of ownership in the longer term. Just to clarify that on CapEx.",86

Or do you think there's still a lot to go on search monetization or coverage? And then from Ruth, obviously, so many areas you can invest in. You could cut price on cloud. You could really ramp up engineers in the core or cloud. Just a lot you can do. And just how does the management team think about balancing profitability versus driving market share and long-term growth?",111

So that -- and with the Assistant now, too, just exposes a whole new surface area. And so I think there's a lot of innovation ahead. In terms of monetization, I think about it. It still looks like there is a lot of -- for example, if you just look at retail, 90% of retail is still offline. So there are many, many secular trends like that which we look at and we see a huge opportunity to help connect users to the information they are looking for. So structurally, I do think we still have lots of both innovation and growth ahead for the long term, and that's how we think about it. Maybe to Ruth on the second part.",146

When we look at the ongoing momentum that you're seeing here in sites revenue, it really does go to innovation. No one change tends to drive results. It's really the combined benefit of all that we're doing across the franchise, continuing to invest in the business and the benefits that we see there. And that's the way we look at it, is we have tremendous opportunity continuing in mobile search and in YouTube across the business there. And as we're looking at these newer opportunities, all that we're doing in cloud, in hardware, YouTube subscription businesses, we analyze each one of those individually, working very closely with the leaders and the milestones that are established there. We do very much across the business have an operating principle that too many resources and too few can lead to suboptimal decisions and execution. And so what we're looking at over a multiyear period is the pace of innovation that's appropriate, given the sizable opportunity. But the key point, and I've said on so many different calls, is that we remain focused on long-term value creation. And we're excited about the growth opportunities, not just within Google, but across Alphabet, with all that we're doing in Other Bets. And so we're looking at these, again, individually over a multiyear period, looking at milestones and appropriately calibrating the pace of investment that is logical. And at the same time, we continue to have a focus on enhancing efficiencies where we can. But overall, as I keep saying, our main priority remains revenue and profit dollar growth.",277

I love -- I think the product is really intended for the YouTube generation. It's really great to see a take on how to consume TV, which is mobile-first for that generation. And I think -- I've been using the product and enjoying it. And I think that gives us -- as we rethink that experience and make it work better and scale it up, I think it's -- your question is valid, the delivery of ads on TV has also not evolved at the same speed as the delivery of ads and media content on the Internet. So I think -- we think we have a significant opportunity to improve that experience, and especially for advertisers to be able to think across all these surfaces. So I think there's a lot of opportunity, but I think we have -- we are very focused on the consumer experience first. On your second question around longer-term impact. Look, these types of issues are not new for us. Over the past many, many years, as we build services, scale it up on the web, constantly, things evolve. We adapt to it, be it from spam and e-mail or how we do search ranking and all the efforts we put into it. These are the classes of problems our engineers are really, really good at working. These are large-scale system problems, and especially with machine learning and AI over time, I think we can really put in the right systems in place. And our teams work very thoughtfully with the external ecosystem at our advertisers, agencies and partners. And I think that balance will help us get it right for the very long term.",292

Ruth, sites TAC as a percentage of revenue grew sequentially and year-over-year. I totally understand that mobile search is contributing meaningfully to the profit dollars. But as we look at the sites TAC as a percentage, is there a quarter or is there a point in time looking forward where that sort of elevated TAC growth rate will anniversary or fall back into line with sites revenue growth as a growth rate? Is there anything you can do to proactively manage that TAC growth? And then for Sundar, on YouTube, as the competition out there for video content really intensifies, to what extent is YouTube providing more favorable economics to its content creators in order to ensure that YouTube remains the leading platform, and importantly, in a lot of cases, an exclusive platform for your most popular channel?",147

And the other factors include the mix of paid versus organic as well as changes in partner mix or agreement terms. And when we look year-over-year, the primary driver of the increase is, very much to your question, the strength in mobile search, and we do expect sites TAC to increase as a percentage of revenues. But again, our focus continues to be on growing profit dollars. And I think the main point is we're very pleased to have a very strong business in a rapidly growing area, and that's benefiting our profit dollars even as the TAC percentage increases.",153

I think there are a lot of factors which are working well. So for example, when we recently invested in original shows, we find that like over half the time people spend watching originals is on their mobile phones. They find that creators who are featured in originals experience a significant boost in YouTube subscribers and watch time on their main channels as well, often from new fans. So all of this shows us that -- the enthusiasm which is there for the platform, how creators can do unique things which are different from what they can do on other platforms. And I think that's what gives us the differentiation here. And in these areas, we are just getting started, and so there's a lot more to come.

When I broadly look at VR and AR, I think there are -- I think all of us clearly understand the potential, and technically, we are making the breakthroughs that are needed.

And so we are engaging at that level with the early adopters, and that's where Daydream is working well. We are learning how to write great content on top of VR. YouTube, Google Earth VR, they use tilt brush, these are all great examples. So we -- and underlying technology-wise, be it all the kinds of sensors and tracking you need to do, the machine learning and AI you need, things like voice recognition, everything, it's just a computing evolution. And so everything we are investing today in machine learning and AI, as well as what we are doing in our computing platforms, transitions well. So I think we are already well positioned to play this. And so I think we'll thoughtfully approach it and we'll approach it more holistically.",263

Our revenues of $26 billion in the second quarter demonstrate the ongoing momentum in our businesses with broad-based strength globally. Revenues were up 21% year-on-year and up 23% in constant currency.
Advertising revenues benefited from the strong performance in sites, which was led in particular by tremendous results in mobile search with a strong contribution from YouTube. Healthy growth in network revenues was driven by our programmatic business. We also had substantial growth in other revenues from Cloud, Play and hardware.
Our outline for today's call is, first, I'll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet focusing on year-over-year changes. I will review our results on a GAAP basis, which include the impact of stock-based compensation.
The European Commission fine of USD 2.7 billion is reflected in our GAAP results with the fine displayed as a separate line item for clarity. In order to assist with comparing this quarter's results to prior periods, we are also providing operating income, net income and EPS results that exclude the impact of the fine. The fine is not reflected in our segment results.
Second, I will review results for Google and then Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take questions.
I will start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Total revenues were $26 billion, up 21% year-over-year. We realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $364 million or $361 million after the benefits of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to the prior period, our total revenues grew 23% year-over-year.
Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography. You can see that our performance was strong in all regions. U.S. revenues were up 23% year-over-year to $12.3 billion. EMEA revenues were $8.5 billion, up 14% year-over-year, reflecting weakness in the British pound and the euro. Revenues were up 21% in fixed FX terms.
APAC revenues were $3.7 billion, up 28% versus last year and up 27% in fixed FX terms. Other Americas revenues, which include results from Canada and Latin America, were $1.4 billion, up 31% versus last year in both reported and fixed FX terms.
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, were $10.4 billion, up 28% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $5.3 billion, up 27% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, specifically: costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation; content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube and hardware-related costs.
Operating expenses, including the impact of the EC fine, were $11.5 billion. Excluding the impact of the EC fine, operating expenses were $8.8 billion in the quarter, up 18% year-over-year. Year-on-year expense growth reflects the change in the timing of our annual equity refresh cycle from the third quarter to the first quarter of each year.
As discussed previously, this affects the quarterly pace of stock-based compensation in 2017 but not the overall size of the expense for the year. In order to transition to the new timing, we made a onetime half year grant in Q1 of this year, which is reflected in elevated year-on-year expense growth in Q2. As a result, stock-based compensation totaled $2 billion, up 33% year-over-year. 
Headcount at the end of the quarter was 75,606, up 1,614 people from last quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount additions were once again made in cloud for both technical and sales roles consistent with the priority we place on this business.
Operating income was $4.1 billion. Excluding the impact of the EC fine, operating income was $6.9 billion, up 15% versus last year, and the operating margin was 26%. Other income and expense was $245 million. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.
Our effective tax rate was 19.5% for the second quarter. Net income was $3.5 billion and earnings per diluted share were $5.01. Excluding the impact of the EC fine, net income was $6.3 billion and earnings per diluted share were $8.90.
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $2.8 billion. Operating cash flow was $7.4 billion with free cash flow of $4.6 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $94.7 billion, of which approximately $57.9 billion or 61% is held overseas.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $25.8 billion, up 21% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenues were $18.4 billion in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year. The biggest contributors to growth again this quarter were mobile search and YouTube. Network revenues were $4.2 billion, up 13% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing strength of programmatic and AdMob. Other revenues for Google were $3.1 billion, up 42% year-over-year. We have been talking about our bigger investment areas within Google, and you can see the momentum here, reflecting contributions from our newer revenue streams again this quarter on top of the ongoing strength in Play.
Specifically, Cloud continues to benefit from the ongoing investments in our go-to-market and products efforts. Hardware continues to grow at a healthy pace year-on-year with the extension of our product line geographically, particularly Google Home and Wifi. The dollar impact to growth was more muted than in prior quarters, reflecting seasonality.
Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $5.1 billion or 22% of total advertising revenues and up 28% year-over-year. The increase in both sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenue as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenues continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Total TAC, as a percentage of total advertising revenues, was up year-over-year as a result of an increase in the sites TAC rate driven by the shift to mobile, which was again partially offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites, which carries lower TAC.
Google stock-based compensation totaled $1.9 billion for the quarter, up 40% year-over-year. Operating income, including the impact of SBC, was $7.8 billion, up 12% versus last year, and the operating margin was 30%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $2.8 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities and data center construction.
A couple of Google reminders for the third quarter. Headcount additions tend to be seasonally high in Q3 because that is when we bring on new graduates. In addition, please keep in mind that our marketing costs are typically weighted more heavily toward the back half of the year due to the holiday season, particularly as we promote our Made by Google line of hardware products.
Let me now turn and talk about Other Bets. For the second quarter, Other Bets revenues were $248 million, primarily generated by Nest, Fiber and Verily. Operating loss, including the impact of SBC, was $772 million for the second quarter. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $151 million, primarily reflecting a reduced investment in Fiber due to the pause in expansion we announced in 3Q '16.
We're pleased with our progress across Other Bets. A couple of updates. Nest continues to drive ongoing product expansion such as our recent introduction of the indoor security camera, Nest Cam IQ, as well as geographic expansion, both of which support its position as the leading brand in the connected home.
In life sciences, in addition to our progress at Verily, Calico has focused its efforts on the basic mechanisms of aging and 3 aging-related diseases representing the leading causes of death. Calico has established more than 20 active collaborations with other life sciences companies and academic institutions.
With Loon, we recently demonstrated the technology in Peru by successfully delivering basic Internet connectivity to tens of thousands of people affected by the tragic floods there. We worked in partnership with the Peruvian government and Telefonica.
And our progress with Wamo continues nicely as is reflected in the rider program in Phoenix and our recently announced partnerships with Lyft and Avis.
Let me wrap up. Almost 2 years after the creation of Alphabet, we see the benefits of our focus within Google and Other Bets and are pleased with the opportunities we have for sustained revenue and earnings growth. We are obviously very happy with the ongoing strength in ads revenue, particularly in search. Our compelling secular trends continue to drive user adoption and engagement with mobile devices. Our engineering and machine learning acumen enables us to build better experiences for users and advertisers.
We continue to see increasing contributions from our growing non-ads revenue businesses. Play continues to be a strong contributor. In addition, we have been making big bets within Google focused on cloud, hardware and subscription businesses in YouTube in order to better serve customers while also building additional and differentiated revenue streams. These businesses are consistent with and complementary to our core capabilities and leverage our infrastructure, distribution and engineering.
We believe we have a compelling runway here. Longer term, we see great opportunity in the businesses we are building in Other Bets. These businesses reflect the incredible engineering talent across Alphabet, most notably in machine learning.
Our revenue growth and Alphabet's structure give us both the opportunity and confidence to invest in our businesses for the long term. We are doing that while being very deliberate about the focus, scale and pace of investments and remain committed to being conscientious in our use of all resources. We're increasing investment in areas where we see the most potential, scaling back in others and sharpening our organizational effectiveness to make the most of the resources available.
Thank you, and let me now turn the call over to Sundar.",1683
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2017",2017-07-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3270.0,1250843.0,50681631.0,Presenter Speech,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Ruth. We had a phenomenal quarter. Google continues to lead the shift to AI-driven computing. We are working to make this incredible technology available to everyone around the world. It's our focus on infusing our products and platforms with the power of machine learning and AI that's driving our success.
Today, I'll spend time talking about the areas where we are confidently investing for the future: first, the incredible momentum we are seeing in some of our core products powered by machine learning; next, an update on 3 of our most promising bets, YouTube, Cloud and our hardware businesses; and I'll conclude with the strong performance of our computing and advertising platforms.
To start, our core products and the AI powering them. Google has always been about using deep computer science and insights to solve some of the world's most complex problems. People are no longer only using a keyboard, mouse and multitouch but are also using emerging inputs, like voice and camera, to ask questions and get things done in the real world. We are seeing this in the way people interact with the Google Assistant, which is already now available on more than 100 million devices since launching last year, and there's more to come since we released an Assistant SDK that'll enable a wide range of new hardware devices, which will include the Google Assistant.
We now have more than 70 home automation partners on the Assistant on Google Home and phones, including Honeywell, Logitech and LG, so you can do everyday things around the house using your voice.
At Google I/O, we announced Google Lens available later this year. Lens is a set of vision-based computing capabilities that can understand what you're looking at and help you take action based on that information. So for example, if you saw a poster for your favorite band, you would be able to take a picture and get relevant information and buy tickets to their next concert.
In Search, a great feature we launched this quarter in the U.S. is job search to make looking for a job easier for everyone no matter what line of work you're in. Many of these products that make people's lives easier are being powered by machine learning. One focus area for us this quarter has been enabling our machine learning algorithms to learn and improve our products much faster.
One such research initiative, Auto ML, enables us to pursue approaches to automate the design of machine learning models. Our ability to rapidly deploy the best machine learning in all of our products enabled us this quarter to launch all sorts of new smart features to help moderate comments, such as smart replies in Gmail and improved translations. We rolled out new machine learning features in Google Maps, YouTube, Gmail and Google Photos, which now has more than 500 million monthly users who back up 1.2 billion photos and videos every day.
I was also pleased that DeepMind's AlphaGo team was in Beijing for the Future of Go Summit, where AlphaGo played against of the #1 world player, Ke Jie. Since playing AlphaGo, Ke Jie has been on a 20-game winning streak. He has said playing AlphaGo has fundamentally changed his understanding of the game. It's remarkable to see AI have such a profound effect on one of the world's oldest, most strategic games. It can have the same impact in so many fields from medicine to science to energy usage and more.
Now let's move to some of our biggest bets. First, YouTube. YouTube now has 1.5 billion monthly viewers, and people watch, on average, 60 minutes a day on their phones and tablets. That's incredible, and it helps thousands of passionate video creators make money. The fastest growing stream for YouTube is in the living room. YouTube watch time on TV screens has nearly doubled year-on-year. This quarter, we unveiled 6 new ad-supported YouTube originals from celebrities, including Ellen DeGeneres and Kevin Hart and YouTube creators like Rhett and Link. Advertiser feedback on these new shows has been extremely positive. Last week, our live TV service, YouTube TV, added 10 new metro areas across America, tripling the markets where it's available in just 4 months.
And to our next big bet with great momentum, Google Cloud. Google Cloud Platform, GCP, continues to experience impressive growth across products, sectors and geographies and increasingly with large enterprise customers and regulated sectors. To be more specific about our momentum with big customers, in Q2, the number of new deals we closed worth more than $0.5 million is 3x what it was last year.
Responding to the growth in existing and new customers around the world, we continue to invest in data centers to provide them the fastest, most reliable service. We opened new Google Cloud regions in Northern Virginia, Singapore, Sydney and London.
We also continue to build out our partnerships. In Q2, we announced an expansion of our partnership with SAP and a new partnership with Nutanix to integrate their products with GCP, so customers can run workloads in hybrid environments on prem and in the cloud using containers and Kubernetes.
Now let's talk about our hardware business. Sales of our new family of hardware continue to be encouraging, and we are making good progress bringing these devices to more people. Google Home is now available in 4 countries: the U.S, Canada, Australia and the U.K, and we have announced it's coming to France and Germany in early August. The Pixel phone continues to be really popular, and Google Wifi just launched in Canada, Germany and France to growing revenues. Every day, I hear of people who love this product and how it has made Wi-Fi work much better in their homes.
Shifting gears, our computing and advertising platforms are driving great results for our partners. There are now more than 2 billion monthly active Android devices around the world. It's really humbling so many people choose Android. We are seeing a number of hardware makers launching devices to positive reviews, including the Samsung Galaxy S8 and the LG G6.
At Google I/O this quarter, we gave developers early access to Android O, which will focus on vitals like battery life and performance. And Google Play continues to be a vital distribution platform for developers. An incredible 82 billion apps were downloaded from Google Play in the last year alone. That's 11 apps for every person on Earth. We continue to work on the next generation of computing platforms, virtual and augmented reality. By the end of this year, there'll be 11 Daydream-ready devices on the market from manufacturers like Samsung, LG, Motorola and ASUS.
Turning to our advertising platforms. Here too, machine learning is critical to helping advertisers and app developers analyze data in real time to reach consumers with more useful ads and measure campaign effectiveness.
At Google Marketing Next this quarter, we launched Google Attribution, a comprehensive measurement tool that allows marketers to measure the impact of their campaigns across devices and channels all in one place with no additional cost. We also launched new ad formats and bidding features in universal ad Campaigns to help developers grow their user base across Google Play, Search, YouTube, Gmail and the Display Network. At Google I/O in 2016, we announced we had driven 2 billion app installs. Today, that number is more than 5 billion. That's amazing growth.
With 90% of transactions still happening offline, we want to help consumers find what they are looking for in brick-and-mortar stores. Our store visits technology is instrumental in understanding customer behavior that starts online and ends in-store. Today, our store visits measurement is the largest program of its kind, and we have now measured over 5 billion store visits in 17 countries. This quarter, we also brought local ads and store visits measurement to video.
Speaking of video, we are seeing continued success with Bumper ads, our 6-second ad format. Both brands and viewers love the format as it's the ideal length to capture attention. L'Oreal, Hasbro, Xbox, Clinique and Neutrogena have all seen great success with Bumpers.
And Google Preferred continues to grow. We now have hundreds of brands buying Google Preferred in the U.S., nearly triple the number since it launched 3 years ago. We are not just helping large brands. We are also helping millions of small businesses get online and grow.
Every month, Google helps drive 100 billion visits to business websites and creates more than 3 billion direct connections between businesses and their customers. These interactions drive huge economic opportunities and growth for small businesses.
Last month, to increase these opportunities, we launched an easy way for millions of small businesses to create a free, simple mobile-optimized website. Small businesses can do it on a mobile phone in under 10 minutes using the listing information already available on Google Search and Maps.
And finally, helping publishers grow their revenues remains a huge focus for us. We are using the power of automation and machine learning to improve our auction algorithms for publishers. Both the improvements we have made since 2016 are generating 15% more revenue for publishers using DoubleClick AdExchange.
Those are the highlights from the second quarter. This week will be another highlight for me. I'm going to Africa for a Google for Nigeria event to announce new products for Nigeria and Sub-Saharan Africa. I'm looking forward to seeing firsthand how technology and Google's products can make a real difference in people's lives.
I want to express a very sincere thank you to every Googler who worked tirelessly this quarter to bring all of our technology and products to the world. And to everyone listening, thank you, and I hope you are enjoying starting the week off with us. And now back to Ruth.",1637

When I think about, we have -- we're very focused over the long term to making sure the Assistant can actually help people get things done in the real world. And so obviously, when you think about it from that standpoint, local becomes important. Over time, just like when the transition happened from desktop to mobile, people's bar for what they expect increased. They wanted more answers. They wanted more immediate gratification, right? And that's a continuum, and I think you'll see the trends. And so over time, we are laser focused on making sure we can deliver against those experiences. And I think local and their particular strength over time, both in terms of the expertise we have built in local as well as our investment in Maps is hopefully paying off.",138

I was just hoping you could help us understand at least qualitatively how core margins for the advertising business are trending within the Google segment. And then, Sundar, just on the cloud business, I know you talked about 4 new regions being built out. Can you just talk about your strategy in building out that cloud infrastructure, how we should think about it in terms of building out extra capacity or whether it's more in line with near-term demand?",83
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2017",2017-07-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3270.0,1250843.0,50681638.0,Answer,Ruth Porat,,Executives,10,"Thanks. So starting with your margin question. Look, as we've often said, we're focused on revenue and operating income dollar growth and not on operating margins. We have strong positions in healthy, growing areas and are adding really exciting additional growth areas. And that's what we mean when we discuss driving long-term revenue and earnings growth. To get a little more specific, the gross margin this quarter obviously reflects our product mix shift, and although the cost of sales is higher as a percentage of revenues, these costs are associated with high-growth product areas that enable us to create value for all of our stakeholders. And then on the OpEx side, the second quarter reflects a number of factors. First, I think, really, to your question on an over time point, you can see the impact of the timing shift in the equity refresh, which we discussed previously. Now as a reminder, that does abate in the back half of the year, but you can see it here in the second quarter. And then what you're also seeing in OpEx growth is the investments in areas that we've spelled out. So for example, in R&D, you can see the impact of the headcount increases in our priority areas, particularly cloud and machine learning, and marketing spend similarly reflects the strategic priority areas we've delineated, particularly hardware and YouTube subscription. But as I said in my opening comments, we're increasing investment in areas where we see the most potential. We're scaling it back in others. We're focused on organizational effectiveness to make the most of all of our resources, and all of that really underpins the goal to sustain both revenue and earnings growth over the longer term.",287

And can you share with us any updates on the go to market and kind of how you feel about where you've come over the last year? But even more importantly, what do you need to do to get it where you need it to be over the next 12 months?",96

Also, I'll take Doug's question on the infrastructure, too, and do it together since they are related to cloud. Overall, when we think about our infrastructure, obviously, we are serving cloud as well as our internal products, which are seeing tremendous growth as well. In terms of serving cloud customers, we are world class in availability and being reliable, and those are things we want to stay best in class. So we're clearly planning for that and planning ahead for our infrastructure, and we have been consistently doing that. And Heather, in terms of your question about workloads and stuff, we are actually seeing quite a diverse set of use cases across sectors and industries and geographies. And so I would say the breadth of what we have seen has really surprised me. In terms of go to market, I shared an update on it last quarter. Not sure there's much more interesting to add. We are continuing to do it well. We are scaling up, and all the teams and the structure Diane has put in place is beginning to work well. And we are continuing to hire and scale all of this up as quickly as we can.",204

First, one on TAC. Ruth, the factors that cause -- have been causing TAC to rise seemed relatively structural, the outsized growth of mobile and the rise of programmatic. So there's no particular reason to think that we should see anything other than gradual increase in TAC as a percentage of both O&O and network revenue going forward. So are there any reasons why that wouldn't be the case in the next year or 2? And then, Sundar, I thought one of the more interesting innovations or that was -- that kind of came out of Google I/O was visual search. And could you just talk about the -- maybe a little bit the roadmap for that or the extent of which -- how long it will take us actually to see that broadly in the market and what you think the appetite -- or how do you think that will change the way people search for products in the future, the ability to also search visually through your phone?",175

We've talked about them over time. The primary driver again this quarter, as you note in your question, was the strong growth in mobile and the fact that more mobile searches are subject to TAC. But the increase in sites TAC year-over-year, I think what I would stress is it really provides another lens on just how strong our mobile business is. There are other factors that affect the TAC rate, including the mix of paid versus organic traffic as well as changes in partner mix and agreement terms. But I think the main point of your question here is we do continue to expect sites TAC to increase but our focus remains on growing profit dollars. And I'd go back to my comment. We're just really pleased with the strength of our mobile business, which is benefiting profit dollars even as the TAC percentage increases. And programmatic, kind of a very similar answer, which is we're pleased to have a strong position in the growing area.",183

But we'll mainly start getting it in the hands of our users in Q4. I think early days, we want to make sure it works well for use cases where it can and bet on the long-term trends in computer vision as we make progress there. I also think there are cases where pulling out a phone and looking at it is a bit cumbersome, and so over time, as form factors emerge, where it's more natural for you to look at and input that into computing, it'll get used more. Overall, for humans, the way they see, visual input is a very high bandwidth way of communicating, and so it's important that we bring that in computing. So long run I'm very bullish on it, but we're going to roll this out slowly and thoughtfully.",165

So we've always taken that long-term view. And everything we do, be it store visits, which we did a while ago or more recently at Google Marketing Next, we talked about Google Attribution as well. So all that starts adding up and I think pushes in this right long-term direction. And there's more work to be done. But I think as users use everything across multiple products and devices in a thoughtful way, I think making all of this work well, we see it as a opportunity ahead of us.",142

The first one, you've talked about micro-moments throughout the course of the year, micro-moments on mobile. I was wondering, could you give us a couple of examples of micro-moments or search verticals where you've really seen an increase in your monetization over the last year? And Sundar, as you look out across all the search verticals, what are the 2 biggest 1 or 2 use cases you still see to improve the overall relevancy of search results and potential monetization?",83

So these are all very, very specific things. I mean, all of these cases we have found, we've been able to impact the experience for both users and advertisers. So I think that applies generally broadly. In terms of all the verticals, I think there are a lot of opportunities. Local has been an area of strength for us. We have seen a lot of traction. And I continue to think, as a vertical, given the assets we've built up over the years, we can continue to invest more and do better for our users.",149

First is you mentioned you had a 15% yield improvement on publisher yields for -- through DoubleClick from machine learning. Is there a comparable stat inside of Google on an operated search or YouTube: after implementing machine learning, you saw yield improvement of X? I'd be curious to hear that. And then the second question is, as we look out into the future and you guys mentioned 2 billion Android actives at I/O, and you just mentioned 11 apps per user in your prepared remarks, if Google is forced to unbundle their own apps from Android in the future, what's the strategy to ensure that Maps and YouTube and Search get distribution and Android doesn't kind of go the way of China in other markets?

On machine learning, we definitely -- machine learning, we've been using it on Search. RankBrain has become one of the important signals in addition to the many other signals in Search and so definitely has had an impact. Same on YouTube across-the-board. I don't have any specific metrics to give, but we definitely are seeing impact, and we think we are in early days of the impact we can see. In terms of Android, we are obviously thoughtfully building Android out and scaling it out, and we offer our apps as part of it. OEMs get to distribute other apps as well. We think it's a very open market, open ecosystem, works well for everyone involved, and I expect that to continue. And a lot of our products which are successful on Android happen to be successful outside of Android as well, including on the Web. These are products generally used by billions of users. And by now we have worked hard to earn that trust and scale, and so I'm confident we can continue scaling those up.",185

I think we are evolving Maps to be a lot more beyond just driving directions, and users are responding to it. And I think we are in the process of making all that work better. And also, we have also focused in terms of what we see as local opportunity within search as well. But we'll continue testing and evolving.

First, I'm wondering if you could comment at all on the Cloud business profitability, medium or long term, how you're thinking about that. Second, I'll go ahead and take a shot at the EC decision lately. It clearly is material for financials. How are you thinking about approaching that decision? And does that impact any of your other advertising businesses as far as innovation? And then finally, any thoughts on verticals that were really strong this quarter that supported the organic revenue growth?",87

Just add a bit more color on Cloud. We're clearly excited about the opportunity we have here, and it does continue to drive sizable revenue growth as I said in my opening comments, as did Sundar, and we are seeing momentum in the business. I think the comment that Sundar made about the number of new deals over 500,000 increasing 3x year-on-year gives you an indication of the momentum in the business. It's obviously not a financial forecast, but it does display the traction we're having with cloud in the market. And GCP remains one of the fastest growing businesses across Alphabet. G Suite continues to have strong growth. So we're really pleased with what that means for both the longer-term trends and the profitability. We do believe that from the many years of investment we've already made in things like technical infrastructure and security, which operate with tremendous efficiency, that provides us with a benefit. But near term, we're investing meaningfully in sales and engineering service, support, continuing to expand out regions to make sure that we're delivering the best experience for our enterprise customers. And that's what we're really focused on. In terms of -- I think your second question was the EC. There's really not much of an update there. We're still early in our analysis of the decision and the right next steps, and we do have time to notify the commission of proposed remedies as well as to implement changes. The main thing is we're very focused on helping users and advertisers and are reviewing our options. It's an ongoing legal matter, so there's not much more to comment on that one.

In terms of -- I think that what you're trying to get at here on what are we seeing in particular with sites revenue, and there's not any one thing to call out, whether it's by vertical or steps that we're taking. And that's really what I would point you to more. I think it's an important point that we're very excited about the opportunities here given both the underlying secular trends broadly with mobile. Sundar's talked a lot about that. But also, all that we're able to layer on top of it just given the engineering acumen here, and we talked about this on prior calls, it's true again here this quarter that no one change has been driving the results. And so what you're seeing is the combined benefit of a number of changes we've made.

Data, of course, is a key differentiator in digital advertising. I was hoping that maybe could talk about how you've changed your use of Google Search data in -- recently in areas outside of search and how that is or might impact the effectiveness of advertising on channels like YouTube and others outside of search. And then, Ruth, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned tremendous growth in mobile search in the quarter. I think that's a more emphatic statement than in the recent quarters.

You can see it in each one of the regions here. U.S. continues to deliver strong growth engagement across products. If you look at EMEA, on a fixed FX basis, up 21%. You can see the same in APAC. The same in other Americas. So yes, there is broad-based strength across geographies. And I think, as -- I'm not calling out one particular area because the -- what you're seeing here is the secular trend. I've used that term a couple of times now.

But since store visits measurement was announced 3 years ago, advertisers have measured over 5 billion store visits globally. And I think we are just -- we have just barely scratched the surface. At our Marketing Next in May, we announced that the store visits measurement will also allow for YouTube TrueView campaigns, and we'll be rolling out store sales measurement in the coming months. So advertisers can actually measure in-store revenue in addition to store visits delivered by search and shopping ads. So we've had good proof points. Advertisers who have used it -- for example, Virgin Holidays used it, factored in-store sales measurements and they realized their search campaigns generate double the profit compared to looking at online KPIs alone.

It was up nicely again this quarter, up 42% year-on-year, and that obviously includes the impact of FX. It's obviously a mix of businesses, including some of our bigger investment areas, most notably Cloud and hardware. And as I said at the outset, Play continues to perform really well. I think if you were asking about the quarter-on-quarter sequentially, you noted, we're talking about a mix of business that have different characteristics. And to state the obvious, Play is more hit driven. It's highly seasonal. Hardware is also seasonal.

So we think about making sure our services reach as many users as possible, and so we are working on that as well.",145

So for Sundar or Ruth, within cloud, could you talk about your view of G Suite's enterprise penetration right now, kind of key drivers of adoption longer term and if you view it as a potential differentiator for Google Cloud versus other large competitors? And then within YouTube, 60 minutes per day of viewing on phones and tablets isn't obviously incredible at that scale. Any thoughts on kind of what could drive further material viewing or engagement growth over time?",82

And we are seeing real strong growth on mobile, and we are seeing real strong growth for YouTube on emerging markets as well. And we are seeing real strong growth on television. So if I look at YouTube on mobile, on emerging markets, on larger screens, they all look like newer opportunities, and so I think there's a lot more growth ahead. And on cloud, I think you have kind of answered it. Obviously, we see differentiated strengths in machine learning, data analytics, security and reliability. And the combination of not just GCP, G Suite working together with GCP, we are seeing increasing win rates and adoption across enterprise customers. And I also think all the investments we are doing in terms of broadening our ecosystem, including the newer partnerships with the companies I mentioned earlier, that should begin to pay off, and overall, the return on investment from the hiring and region expansion we are doing. So I think we are set up incredibly well, and I look forward to the momentum ahead.",196

29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2017",2017-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3213.0,1325076.0,53197864.0,Presenter Speech,Ruth Porat,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Ellen. We had a terrific quarter. Revenues of $27.8 billion were up 24% year-on-year and also up 24% in constant currency. Advertising revenues benefited from strong performance in sites, which was powered by tremendous results in mobile search. Healthy growth in network revenues was again led by our programmatic business. We also benefited from substantial growth in other revenues from Cloud, Play and hardware.
Our outline for today's call is, first, I'll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet focusing on year-over-year changes. Next, I will review results for Google and then Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take your questions. 
Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Total revenues were $27.8 billion, up 24% year-over-year. We realized a positive currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $255 million or $64 million after the impact of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to the prior period, our total revenues grew 24% year-over-year.
Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography. Performance was strong in all regions. U.S. revenues were $12.9 billion, up 21% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $9.1 billion, up 23% year-over-year in both reported and fixed FX terms. APAC revenues were $4.2 billion, up 29% versus last year and up 31% in fixed FX terms. Other Americas revenues were $1.5 billion, up 33% year-over-year and up 32% in fixed FX terms.
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, were $11.1 billion, up 28% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $5.6 billion, up 25% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, specifically: costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation; content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube; and hardware-related costs.
Operating expenses were $8.8 billion, up 11% year-over-year. The year-on-year expense growth in part reflects the change in the timing of our annual equity refresh cycle from the third quarter to the first quarter of each year. As discussed previously, this change in SBC grant timing affects the quarterly pace of stock-based compensation in 2017 with elevated year-on-year expense growth in the first half of the year but benefits the year-on-year comparisons for Q3 and Q4. 
Stock-based compensation totaled $1.8 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 78,101, up 2,495 people from last quarter. As in prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers.
In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount additions were once again made in Cloud for both technical and sales roles, consistent with the priority we placed on this business. Operating income was $7.8 billion, up 35% versus last year, and the operating margin was 28%.
Other income and expense was $197 million. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 15.6% for the third quarter. Net income was $6.7 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $9.57. 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $3.5 billion. Operating cash flow was $9.9 billion with free cash flow of $6.3 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $100.1 billion, of which approximately $60.5 billion or 60% is held overseas. 
Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $27.5 billion, up 23% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $19.7 billion in the quarter, up 23% year-over-year, led again by mobile search, complemented by desktop search and strong performance from YouTube. Network revenues were $4.3 billion, up 16% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of programmatic and AdMob. Other revenues for Google were $3.4 billion, up 40% year-over-year, fueled by Cloud, Play and hardware.
Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $5.5 billion or 23% of total advertising revenues and up 32% year-over-year. The increase in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenues as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenues continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was up year-over-year, reflecting an increase in the sites' TAC rate, which was modestly offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites.
The increase in the sites' TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points. Google's stock-based compensation totaled $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 2% year-over-year.
Operating income, including the impact of SBC, was $8.7 billion, up 29% versus last year, and the operating margin was 32%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $3.6 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities and data center construction. 
Let me now turn and talk about Other Bets. For the third quarter, Other Bets revenues were $302 million, primarily generated by Nest, Fiber and Verily. Operating loss, including the impact of SBC, was $812 million for the third quarter. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $77 million, primarily reflecting a reduced investment in Fiber due to the pause in expansion we announced in 3Q '16. 
We're pleased with our progress across Other Bets. A couple of updates. Nest continues to drive ongoing product expansion with a number of notable launches, including the Nest Thermostat E, which is offered at a lower price point than the Nest Learning Thermostat. Nest also announced a home security solution that includes the Nest Secure alarm system, Nest Hello video doorbell, the Nest Cam IQ outdoor security camera and corresponding software and services.
Waymo continues to expand its geographic presence and announced this morning that it will commence winter testing in Michigan to build on our progress to date addressing the challenge of autonomous driving in cold weather, particularly with snow, sleet and ice. Michigan is the sixth state where Waymo is testing its self-driving vehicles. Over the last 8 years, Waymo's cars have self-driven in more than 20 cities. 
With Loon, we were pleased to announce just last week that the team is collaborating with AT&T to deliver emergency Internet service to the hardest-hit parts of Puerto Rico.
Let me close with some observations on the quarter and our longer-term outlook. First, in terms of revenues, results this quarter again reflect our relentless focus on innovation, which is growing our advertising revenues. I frequently highlight our culture of innovation. In that regard, the most important point is that we are data-driven with an extraordinary team of engineers, product managers and designers who constantly challenge assumptions and run thousands of experiments annually to enhance user and advertiser experiences. 
This approach enables us to find new opportunities given that the way consumers seek information continues to evolve. Our teams work relentlessly to anticipate and adapt to the expanding capabilities of both software and hardware. 
Further, our culture of innovation is building our nonadvertising revenue streams in Cloud, Play and hardware. Earlier this month, for example, we launched our expanded line of hardware products, bringing the best AI software and hardware together and building on the first generation of Made by Google products we introduced last year. Longer term, we remain excited about the opportunities in our Other Bets with ongoing progress.
Second, with respect to profitability. We continue to remain focused on long-term dollar growth versus margins. Pressure in our total cost of revenues reflects our product mix shift with a number of our higher-growth businesses also carrying higher cost of revenues. 
In our advertising businesses, TAC continues to increase as our highest growth areas, mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. We expect sites TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of sites revenue. As we frequently stated, we remain focused on profit dollar growth, and these areas are additive to our growth.
The other cost of revenues associated with our nonadvertising businesses is also affected by product mix. In the fourth quarter in particular, the impact of our growing hardware line will be more accentuated given the early stage of this business and the holiday seasonality. On operating expenses, we remain committed to investing to support our growing product areas. 
The more modest OpEx growth in Q3 reflects both the timing of stock-based compensation and the timing of sales and marketing spend with the reality that not all investments fall neatly into a single calendar quarter.
In particular, we're committed to sales and marketing investments in Q4 for the important holiday season. The most significant uptick in marketing will be to support our new expanded hardware line, which was just announced at the beginning of the fourth quarter. In addition, we are investing to support YouTube and our other platforms.
Third, as to CapEx, we continue to invest to support business momentum, including increased compute power from machine learning, which is an asset across Alphabet, as well as to support cloud, search and YouTube growth. 
In conclusion, a great quarter. Thank you, and let me now turn the call over to Sundar.",1566
29096.0,"Alphabet Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2017",2017-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3213.0,1325076.0,53197865.0,Presenter Speech,Sundar Pichai,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Ruth. We had another great quarter. I've been really proud of the progress this quarter, launching popular new products and continuing to grow our business in new areas. It's been particularly exciting to see our early bet on artificial intelligence pay off and go from a research project to something that can solve new problems for 1 billion people a day. Even though we are in the early days of AI, we are already rethinking how to build products around machine learning. It's a new paradigm compared to mobile-first software, and I'm thrilled how Google is leading the way.
Consumers can already experience how AI allows them to interact with computing more naturally than ever before. Computers are adapting to people rather than people needing to adapt to computers. Fundamental to this experience is Google Search and Assistant. We introduced Assistant last year, and it continues to get better every day, helping people get things done in the real world. Walmart and Target have recently integrated with Google Home, which means you can order everyday items from them much more easily. 500 million people now use the machine learning smarts of Google Photos to manage and share their memories. The 1 billion-plus people using Google Maps now get thoughtfully contextual information like how to find parking where they are going. 
And businesses are seeing how AI can help them grow. Our open-source software, TensorFlow, is allowing anyone to use machine learning to solve problems even in industries like agriculture. Researchers recently used TensorFlow to make smartphones able to identify disease in cassava plants, a major food source in the developing world. We made TensorFlow open-source and free because we fundamentally believe in creating computing platforms that developers can customize and build on. 
I'm really pleased with the way our computing platforms, like Android and Chrome, have continued to grow, enabling great experiences for people all over the world and powering devices for more than 1,000 brands worldwide. This quarter, we released the latest operating system, Android 8.0, and released the preview of ARCore, which brings augmented reality to existing Android phones. Last week, we announced a partnership with Samsung to bring ARCore to all Galaxy devices.
Even though it's been an incredibly busy few years and technology is moving rapidly, at our core, we remain an information company. Our mission, to provide useful information to people in every corner of the world, is unchanged. We care deeply about the quality of information we provide and constantly work to get this right. As technology evolves, we have to evolve with it to ensure quality information can flourish. 
Our teams are making a big effort to support journalists and other people who produce high-quality information around the world. We are supporting publishers as they decide the right approach to free articles and subscription content. We are moving away from First Click Free to a more flexible model of content sampling, and we are working with publishers to build a frictionless payment solution for subscriptions that can help them grow revenues and find new readers.
As new threats arise, we are committed to protecting journalists and media organizations from hacking and denial-of-service attacks. For example, we just launched the Advanced Protection Program for Google Accounts, which is designed to protect the accounts of those most at risk of targeted attacks, including journalists and other public figures.
To wrap up my overview, I'm thrilled with how Google is solving big problems and making products that billions of people use every day. 
Now let's review our 3 big bets, starting with YouTube. YouTube continues to see phenomenal growth as the premier global destination where people go to watch video. Three of the key areas we are focused on are: strengthening the existing community; continuing to drive growth and expanding our subscriptions business.
On the community side, we are helping create meaningful interactions that bring creators and fans closer together. This quarter, we launched a new feature that lets viewers share videos directly in the app. So the minute you see a video from a creator you love, you can share the fun with friends and family. 
We're also seeing significant growth in other areas. As I mentioned in the last earnings call, YouTube now has over 1.5 billion users. On average, these users spend 60 minutes a day on mobile. But this growth isn't just happening on desktop and mobile. YouTube now gets over 100 million hours of watch time in the living room every day, and that's up 70% in the past year alone. 
We are continuing to invest in new subscription-based monetization models. YouTube Red, our first foray into the subscription market, is on track to release over 40 original shows this year, and YouTube TV, our live TV subscription service, continues to expand into new markets. It now covers 2/3 of U.S. households and is available in 50 metro areas. 
Now on to Google Cloud. We continue to make progress winning over enterprise customers. Customers tell us they are switching to Google Cloud Platform because of our prowess in data analytics and machine learning. Our commitment to being an open platform with tools like Kubernetes, which runs in both cloud and hybrid environments and our leadership in security. 
Just yesterday, we announced a new partnership with Cisco. We are collaborating on an open solution that gives customers an easy approach to their cloud, enabling them to run apps that span both on-prem environments and Google Cloud Platform. G Suite, our collaboration and productivity applications, are leading the industry. We have made improvements to Drive, Docs and Gmail, launching new features to help teams work better together. Nielsen recently moved to G Suite and said it's a great productivity and collaboration tool for their modern workflows.
All of these things are driving momentum with customers and partners. Companies like Kohl's, PayPal, Rolls-Royce Marine in Europe and popular messaging app, Hike in India, moved to Google Cloud. We also announced a new partnership with Marketo and expanded our relationships with Pivotal and VMware. To support our growing global customer base, we introduced 2 new regions in the quarter in São Paulo and Frankfurt and continue to grow our go-to-market team. 
Next, our hardware business. Earlier this month, we launched our second-generation family of Made by Google hardware products built with AI at the core. Last year, we focused on building the foundation to launch a line of devices made by Google. This year, we are focused on bringing together the best AI software and hardware to give people a great user experience. For example, the new Google Home Max is a smart speaker powered by the Assistant. It has AI-based smart sound, which adapts the audio experience to the user's environment, context and preferences.
The new Pixel 2 has the world's best smartphone camera and a useful feature where you can summon the Google Assistant by just squeezing the phone. To get these devices in people's hands, we are also focused on scaling our go-to-market strategy. We are investing more in marketing. We are launching in more countries, and we are offering these devices in more retailers, and we are already seeing results. Preorders of Pixel on Day 1 this year were more than double what they were last year. 
Also, this quarter, we signed a deal with HTC in Taiwan that will help accelerate our hardware business by bringing on a team of talented engineers. This deal lays the foundation for our continued efforts next year.
And our advertising platforms continue to drive greater sales for our partners. While mobile has given rise to an unprecedented amount of data and complexity for advertisers, we think that machine learning will help it make -- will help make it easier for advertisers to reach consumers. But even as we give advertisers incredible scale and reach across our ad platforms, we know consumer attention is scarce. That's why we are pleased YouTube ads continue to deliver the highest viewability rates in the industry. YouTube now has a 95% ad viewability rate, which is significantly higher than the average 66% viewability rate of other video ads. 
We continue to see the industry shift to 6-second Bumper ads and saw great adoption this quarter from brands like Bayer, Ben & Jerry's, Louis Vuitton and [ Walmart ]. 
And Google continues to be the platform of choice to help small business owners get online and grow their business. On our last earnings call, I mentioned the free website builder for small businesses. During the quarter, more than 1 million small businesses used it to build websites, helping many of them get online for the first time.
We also introduced local posts, which allows small business owners to easily post their latest updates like upcoming events, special offers and new arrivals right on Google Search and Maps. 
Our commitment to both large and small advertisers shows how we build products that all businesses can succeed at. That mission also has a geographical dimension, and I wanted to say a word about the momentum we are seeing in Asia. Our revenues are up significantly in the region, driven by great results we are driving for existing and new advertisers. That holds true across developed markets like Japan and emerging markets like the Philippines and Vietnam, all of which have seen the number of active advertisers grow by 25% or more in the past 12 months. And this growth is bringing tremendous benefits to our partners there. In the past 3 years, we have paid out more than $24 billion to our publisher, creator and app developer partners in Asia-Pacific. 
And to help millions of people, we are building products specifically designed for local markets in Asia. In India last month, we launched Tez, a mobile payments and commerce app that already has more than 7.5 million users who have made more than 30 million transactions. I'm really excited about the potential this brings for India's mostly cash-based economy.
As I said at the start, it's been a great quarter for Google. Just 2 weeks ago, I was in Pittsburgh launching our new Grow with Google initiative, which provides digital skills to millions of people and economic opportunity to countless businesses. It was amazing to see firsthand the transformative impact that information is having in schools, in the workplace and for local business. 
As I said then, I remain a technology optimist not only because I believe in technology, but because I believe in people. 
I want to thank all the Googlers who continue to work so hard to advance our mission and to help people everywhere. Thank you.",1779

Wanted to understand better your ambitions in e-commerce as a marketplace or a platform and how that might also feedback into the advertising business.

We are very excited about the partnerships we are getting here with large retailers, and we're seeing traction globally. We have obviously partnered with them through our advertising products.

Sundar, you talked about the APAC. You called out Asia, and I -- we noticed that, too, that year-over-year growth rate was higher than -- was the highest at least since you've been disclosing it. And you provided some of the whats, but any whys behind why that growth is accelerating? Is that something that has just naturally reached the tipping point? Is there something different that Alphabet, Google has done in Asia to accelerate that growth? And then, Ruth, can I ask you? You talked about the factors driving TAC, and you mentioned changes in partner agreements. Is there any way you could give us any more color? Did you just renew some major partner agreements and there's nothing of that magnitude into next year? Or should we just assume that this is just part of operations? There was nothing major [ reason ], you can have major ones coming up? Just something that -- help us qualify. I don't think you had used that language before what that indicated.",174

Largely, I think we've been laying a foundation for a very, very long time. Our products are very heavily used there. And so we worked hard to build a user base, and then the mobile translation is -- mobile transformation is a secular shift there. That's definitely driving accelerated growth, new -- and it creates a virtuous cycle. We see new advertisers coming on. We are investing more in Asia as well in addition to our go-to-market themes. We are building out great product and engineering teams. That's what has led us to improve core products like Search, Maps, YouTube, et cetera, to work better in those regions. And we also launched region-specific products like Google Tez in India. So I think overall, that's creating a good virtuous cycle, and I'm looking forward to having more momentum there.",141

As I indicated in the opening comments, there are a couple of drivers here. One is changes in partner agreements. And I think the main point is we're very pleased with our strong partnerships across the mobile ecosystem. And the other was the ongoing shift to mobile, which we've talked about a lot, and the fact that it carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points. I think the most important point is what you're seeing is we have a very healthy mobile business, search business, and it is growing substantially. And our focus remains on long-term revenue and profit dollar growth.",112

First, Ruth, you talked about the ongoing advertising innovation, and it's pretty clear that, that's happening in mobile, which seems like it probably accelerated in the quarter. So I was hoping you could comment on that. But then also, how do you think about where you are in terms of optimization on mobile relative to desktop? And then just second, on YouTube. I was hoping you could comment on the extent which you're seeing marketers return to the platform post the brand safety issues of 2Q. And for a few of those who may not be back on yet, what are they looking for to fully return?",110

And that was the point of giving you a bit more color here. We are really pleased with the momentum in the business, excited about the opportunities we have given the ongoing strong underlying secular trend, but wanted to give you more color on what do we mean by a culture of innovation. And that's really why I tried to go into a bit more about the rigor of the process. And one of the key points is that we do have the opportunity and we anchor this in data. We're constantly challenging assumptions. We're running a lot of experiments to enhance user and advertiser experience. And the approach continues to be productive, especially because the line of inquiry evolves as user behavior evolves. And so what users wanted in the earlier days of smartphones when screens were smaller is obviously very different from expectations users have today. Each quarter, the ads team introduces more than 100 enhancements out of a much larger pool of assumptions that they've tested. Machine learning is at the center of our processes and systems, and we do remain excited about the potential. Desktop, I commented on. We are pleased with the ongoing strength of the business. It delivered solid revenue growth that remains an important form factor for certain, more complex tasks. We've talked about that in prior quarters, things like planning vacations or assessing insurance options. And so I think with the strength here underscores the importance of the desktop for many users in many tasks, notwithstanding the growing utility of mobile for users. And then in terms of YouTube, I think you asked it well. We've been doing a lot to protect the ecosystem and do the right things for advertisers and users and content creators. And the overwhelming majority of advertisers never left. And those who did, many are already back on the platform.",343

And I guess, in particular, how do you think about maintaining Google's lead as the way we search changes and as we see increasing adoption of these voice-enabled digital assistants in the home? And part of this, I guess, I'm also wondering about is, how do you think about your relationships with the partners? And if the device space broadens out, does your leverage with the partners change?",83

Voice -- and it's important to remember, voice is one input. When we -- when you look at how customers interact, they obviously are interacting more and more naturally, seamlessly across a set of screens, computing works and context for them. And even when they ask voice queries, the response always what they need is not voice alone. Think about walking into a store, and if you could only ask using voice and the person has to reply in voice when I was in the store. So that model applies. So we expect a lot of continual experiences across screens, across modalities. So it's a big opportunity. I think it's opening up newer ways in which we are working with partners. I spoke earlier about the kind of experiences we are now able to drive at Walmart and Target, which we couldn't have done a year before, thanks to voice, how we are using it in the Google Assistant and how we are driving these partnerships. So there's a lot of excitement about how we can do all of this differently. So we are using this as a good way to rethink everything we are doing with the caveat that voice tel, overall, is an emerging category compared to how users use our products. So there's a lot of room ahead.",227

I'd like to maybe discuss a couple of your growth businesses. First, on Cloud. Maybe you could talk about some of the wins you're seeing and why people are initially choosing Google and the momentum there. And then secondly. On the hardware business, it feels a little confusing on what your real goal is there. Is that to build a real independent, separate hardware business? And how the Android relationships are going around that?",75

Effectively, we are seeing strong momentum, and we already hear from customers that we have outstanding technology. So the reason we win deals, in many cases, is because we have superior technology. And people also see the room ahead, thanks to our lead in machine learning. And that's an area where I think we'll continue to drive advantage. The main area where we need to get better is to scale our go to market and be in more places to effectively get more customers, and we are doing that a few different ways. Diane and team have really scaled our global sales force. But more importantly, I think we are striking a lot of important partnerships with leading technology vendors to scale and reach more customers. And so we did a partnership with Cisco that we announced, or in this quarter, we also teamed up with Pivotal and VMware. And earlier the year, you saw us partner with SAP. Now all of this help customers more easily run their apps, both on prem and in the cloud. And we are doing this all in an open way with Kubernetes. So that's the overall strategy, and I think that's really beginning to pay off. And you will see us scale across all these dimensions for cloud in the year ahead. In terms of hardware, we are very seriously committed to making hardware. A few reasons. Hardware is -- the intersection of hardware and software is how you drive computing forward. And historically, hardware has been maybe a single-device business. For a long while, it was PCs and then maybe smartphones. But you're clearly entering an era where you're going to have different types of computing experiences. And so to do that and to stitch it all together across, I think it's important we thoughtfully put our opinion forward. We're equally committed to working with the ecosystem, and we provide the same basis on both sites, be it Android or Chrome. And it's going really well, our close partnership this quarter across a set of Android partners. You see great momentum at the recently launched Samsung Note 8. We announced ARCore on Samsung devices. So we have strong momentum there as well. So we are committed to pushing forward hard on all these areas.",385

It's just a philosophical question on TAC. So as the mobile search market matures, particularly the Western markets, the question is, why does Google feel like it needs to pay any TAC to partners at all? Is the lesson that you learned from the Firefox desktop partner loss a couple of years ago was that you didn't lose any revenue and you stopped paying TAC on that agreement? Why wouldn't the same logic apply to mobile search if not now, at some point in the future?",95

We've been doing distribution deals for our search for well over a decade, and I've personally been involved all the way from the toolbar and the Chrome days. So by now, first of all, we want to construct a win-win construct. So we always want a construct in which we do better and our partners to better. And so doing TAC well aligns us in that way. And historically, it's driven a lot of growth. And so it's a model we understand. We understand the key economics behind it. And so we are very thoughtful about how we drive it forward. So we are driving it forward in a way in which we know it's going to give strong both revenue and earnings growth.

A little bit on growing Alphabet's multi-app ecosystem. Sundar, how do you think about the strategic importance to drive Chrome and Google Assistant app installs and user growth on non-Android mobile platforms? Maybe talk about how you evaluate, how you're doing there so far. And then bigger picture. You have made large and exciting investment and growth opportunities across Google and Other Bets.

And be it Search or Gmail or Google Photos or Chrome, we work hard to drive it across all platforms. Obviously, some products, the ability to make it work well on other platforms versus our native platforms, there are differences. And so we understand that. It's partly why we are very committed to driving success on our platforms, both through the ecosystem and our hardware efforts as well. So we think about it holistically. But you'll continue to see us put a lot of effort into other platforms as well. For example, over the past couple of years, I think we have meaningfully improved our products on iOS, as an example. On the other part -- or maybe, Ruth, do you want to give color? I will just say at a high level, we drive our investments because we think about it from a user perspective first. We see areas where there are clear user problems, and we think about whether we can use computer science on our technology advantage as Google and Alphabet to give a differentiated offering for users. So -- and we do that, and then we think long term. But that's how we deal about it. Maybe Ruth can give more color there, too.",237

A lot of the things that we're doing are multiyear investments. And that's why we stress repeatedly that we're looking at what are the long-term needs and opportunities that we can be addressing. If we're doing that well, we're delivering long-term revenue and earnings growth. And those investments need to be seeded early for them to continue to grow and flourish around the globe, whether that response to the first question on what's going on in APAC or across Alphabet more broadly.

So across the 2 companies, we saw win-win construct by which we could bring the team and the IP and other assets related to the Pixel business in-house. And it also allows HTC to focus better on their phones and the other products they're working on. So it just made a lot of sense to do it. And I would also think about the overall capability we are getting, not just to make phones, but as we get into other product categories like Google Home, VR and so on, right?

Bringing that kind of a seamless experience on to TV, when you think about something you want to watch, making it seamless. And so improving that process, I think, is really what people positively comment on. Other things are being able to personalize it, bringing our machine learning-based recommendations over time.

Almost all e-commerce providers, like, are really interested in, like, cloud for obvious reasons. So we see tremendous traction by which we are -- we can talk to them about cloud. They're already advertising partners. They're beginning to work with us much more closely on driving a seamless shopping experience. We're working on payments.

And as we add new modalities, it really drives a better experience for them. Google Lens, there's a long way to go. But today, as humans, visual input is really big for us. It means a lot higher bandwidth than everything else. And so bringing back to computing, I think, is a really important step in advancing how users can process information. And so I see that as an important step. And thanks to machine learning, we'll be able to do these things a lot more powerfully. All of this I think, overall, adds to the search experience. And so I view that as all incremental, but it'll play out slowly over many years. And so we see this as a big opportunity ahead, and we are investing for it.",160

We feel -- we're really pleased with the sites revenue growth, the performance in mobile desktop and YouTube. I think if you just go down to the big categories, network revenue also was quite strong. I think one thing to add there is programmatic continues to be a strong contributor, generates significant growth. We've talked about that on prior calls given all the ongoing advertiser adoption of programmatic buying, and AdMob continues to see strength here. What you're also seeing here is the traditional AdSense businesses. And overall, the pace of advertiser migration to programmatic affects this business kind of quarter-on-quarter as well as the policy changes that we've talked about in prior quarters. And those factors were less of a drag in the last couple of quarters. So you actually saw nicer revenue growth year-on-year here as well. It's up 16%.

And also, more importantly, the ecosystem, which it's built around. So for example, if you take e-commerce, the kind of models that are emerging in these countries are also a bit different. So I think we see a way to look at these markets with a lot more thought and address them for the opportunities that they have, not just apply our global products there. So I think that's what led us to do Google Tez in India, and we'll thoughtfully look at the opportunities in that region and invest a lot in the years ahead.",131

It's obviously a mix of businesses. And as we've talked about, we have very strong growth in each of Cloud and hardware that was tempered by slightly slower growth in Q3 for Play, reflecting what's the hit-driven nature of that business of gaming. But again, I feel really pleased with the progress, momentum that we're seeing in the various businesses. And I guess, the only other thing to note is obvious seasonality on the hardware as we move into the fourth quarter here.",101
