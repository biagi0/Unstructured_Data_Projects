I'm very happy with our results. Google had a very strong quarter with revenues up 25% year-on-year, 9% quarter-on-quarter, and we blew past the $10 billion mark for the first time. Pretty exciting. 
Looking back on 2011, I am most excited by the fact that we significantly improved our velocity and execution, my priority when I became CEO in April. With Google+, we shipped on average a new feature every day since we launched in June. That's more than 200 updates in total. And those things include a bunch of new Hangout features. In fact, David Beckham just did a great Hangout with his fans here this morning. We launched circles in Gmail and + Pages for businesses and many, many other things. 
I'm also pleased to announce that there are over 90 million Google+ users, well over double what I announced just a quarter ago on our earnings call. Engagement on + is also growing tremendously. I have some amazing data to share there for the first time. + users are very engaged with our products. Over 60% of them engage daily and over 80% weekly. 
As I said last quarter, Google+ is much more than the individual features themselves. It's also about building a meaningful relationship with users so that we can dramatically improve the services we offer. Understanding who people are, what they care about and the other people that matter to them is crucial if we are to give users what they need, when they need it. 
Take last week's Search announcement, which I'm really excited about. We've now included personal results in Search. So you can easily find information like photos and + posts that are super relevant to you, as well as the people you care about or are interested in. You can even restrict all personal results or easily view Google in the world mode just as you would have before. I really like it, and I encourage all of you to try it out, too. 
Each of improved execution and velocity is focus. There are so many opportunities for Google today. But to make a real impact in the world, we need to make hard choices about where to focus our efforts. 
Since we last spoke, we've announced that we're closing 12 of our products, including Buzz, Knol and Friend Connect, integrating a whole bunch of others into features of existing products. This means that we can double down on the really big bets we had made like Android, Chrome, Gmail, Display and YouTube. And I'm pleased to say this big bets are really paying off. We're seeing extraordinary velocity, the kind of velocity we only we can dream about. Android is, quite simply, mind-boggling. 700,000 phones are lit up every day. And I'm pleased to announce 250 million Android devices in total, up 50 million since our last announcement just in November. In just 2 days over the holiday weekend, 3.7 million Androids were activated. And today, we're announcing over 11 billion downloads from Android markets. Wow. Ice Cream Sandwich, which is the new Android release in October, is by far our best build yet. And our exciting new phones. I simply love my Galaxy Nexus. Superfast, it's great for photos, has an amazing 720p screen. 
Chrome is on fire, too. It's a wonderful example of kind of beautifully simple, intuitive experience that really improves users' lives. People thought we were crazy. Who wants another browser? It turns out a lot of people wanted to get to web quickly and securely, and we've got an amazing, fast-growing fan base all around the world. 
From the start, Gmail had security, accessibility. Get all your emails from anywhere on any device. An insane storage. That made it a winner with consumers, businesses and education. From an internal beta project 8 years ago, I'm proud to tell you today that Google Gmail now has more than 350 million active users, and it's growing rapidly. That [indiscernible] said, our merging high-use project -- products can generate huge new businesses for Google in the long run, just like Search, and we have a ton of experience monetizing those old [ph] products over time. Take Display. We brought the science of search to the art of the Display, creating a business that our latest figures show has now reached an annualized run rate of over $5 billion. 
I have some exciting new numbers also for the DoubleClick Ad Exchange, spending is up over 130% year-on-year, and the number of buyers and sellers have both more than doubled over the same period.  I'm very pleased with the advertising on YouTube. TrueView gives users much more choice over what they watch, and advertisers only pay when someone watches their ad. 
It's not just in advertising that we're doing well. Enterprise is doing great with over 5,000 new customers signing up every day. In fact, last week, we signed our biggest ever deal, about 110,000 users at BBDA, one of the world's leading banks. All of our experience says that well-run technology businesses with tremendous consumer research, make a lot of money over the long term. 
Now all of this is made possible by the exceptional people that work here. I've always believed that you attract the best talent by working on things that matter in the world and creating a great workplace environment. People want to feel part of the family even when they're at work. So I'm super pleased that Google topped Fortune 2012's Best Company to Work For list, which was published today. We've taken the #1 spot 3 times now, more than any other company. I want to thank everyone at Google for all their hard work that has made this possible. 
Let me finish up by saying that 2012 promises to be a fantastic year. We're still at the very, very early stages of what technology can do. By building a meaningful relationship with users, we can start to offer  them, just what they need, exactly when they want it. Everyone here at Google is super excited about our work today and what the future holds. It's great to be here. Thank you for taking the time to join us today, and I'll now hand over to Patrick.",1065
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2012",2012-01-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3700.0,208952.0,12269195.0,Presenter Speech,Patrick Pichette,,Executives,3,"Thank you very much, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us again. Like Larry, I'm also very happy with our results. Google had a strong, a really strong quarter, in fact, with revenues up 25% year-over-year, crowning a year of disciplined investment, strong growth and actually great operational and financial performance. 
Let me go through these financial results, then I'll turn it over to Nikesh and Susan for more commentary on our operating performance. So let's jump right in. 
Our gross revenue grew 25% year-over-year to $10.6 billion, 9% quarter-over-quarter growth. By the way, it's worth noting that although currency rates had an immaterial impact year-over-year, they, in fact, had a negative impact on revenue quarter-over-quarter. In fact, if we applied last quarter's exchange rates to our Q4 revenue, these would have been roughly $240 million higher. So FX is a key component here. Google website revenue was up, in fact just shy of 30% year-over-year to $7.3 billion and 8% quarter-over-quarter with strength across most major geographies and verticals. Our Google Network revenue was up 15% year-over-year to $2.9 billion and 11% quarter-over-quarter. It's important to note here that the Network revenue was again negatively impacted by the search quality improvements we made early last year, and also that the momentum in our Display business continues, something that Susan will talk about in a few minutes. Our other revenue was up 50% year-over-year to $410 million and 6% quarter-over-quarter. Our global aggregate paid click growth was very strong, up 34% year-over-year and 17% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate cost of click growth was down 8% year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Remember, too, that this is an aggregate number, which includes both google.com and our AdSense properties. On this, it's important to look at CPCs and clicks together. There are numbers of factors that affect each, again something that Susan will address in the next few minutes. 
If we turn to our geographic performance, the U.S., U.K. and rest of worlds all were growing at strong pace, reflecting in our result. In our earnings slides, which you can find in our Investor website -- Relations website, you'll see we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits from our hedging programs. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations. 
Revenue from the U.S. was up 22% year-over-year to $5 billion. Our non-U.S. revenue accounted for 53% of our total revenue, or $5.6 billion, up 28% year-over-year, which includes a modest $25 million benefit from our hedgings program. The U.K. was up 21% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. 
Let me now turn to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $2.5 billion or 24.1% of total advertising revenue. Other cost of revenue was $1.2 billion, excluding stock-based compensation of $77 million. And finally, operating expenses, which excludes stock-based compensation, totaled $2.9 billion. Our stock-based compensation totaled $459 million, and the increase year-over-year in OpEx was primarily due to payroll, increased advertising and promotional spend and legal and professional services. As a result of all this, our non-GAAP operating profit was $4 billion in Q4, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 38.2%, a strong margin performance that gives us the confidence to continue to fully fund our strategic growth areas in Search, Display, Mobile and apps. 
If we turn to headcount, it was up approximately 1,100 for the quarter, and we ended the year roughly at 32,500 full-time employees. Our effective tax rate was 22% in Q4, and this reflects the mix of earnings between our domestic and international subsidiaries, but also an impairment charge for Clearwire, which is not [ph] deductible for tax purposes. 
Let me now turn to cash management. In other income and expenses, our line was minus 18, which is a large negative variance, in fact over $300 million quarter-over-quarter. This reflects a couple of things. First is the impact of our significant FAS 133 expense from hedging program, which accelerated the expense of our portfolio this quarter now that this portfolio is much deeper in the money. In addition, as I mentioned, we took an impairment charge for Clearwire. And so for more details on our OI&E, which changed quite a bit this quarter, again please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website. 
Our operating cash flow was very strong at $3.9 billion, just shy of $4 billion. Our CapEx for the quarter was $951 million versus last quarter at $680 million, and remember that the majority of our CapEx spend was related to facilities and production equipment. And as a reminder, I wish to continue to make -- we'll continue to make significant CapEx investments, and these have shown to be lumpy from quarter to quarter depending on when we're able to make these investments. In consequence, we're very pleased with our free cash flow, which was $3 billion. 
So in summary, with such a strong performance, we continue to be optimistic about investing in our growth agenda. Let me now hand it off to Nikesh, who'll cover more of the details of our sales performance for the quarter. Nikesh?",861
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2012",2012-01-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3700.0,208952.0,12269196.0,Presenter Speech,Nikesh Arora,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Patrick. I will now provide an update on our business activities. We've had an excellent quarter, good growth over the holiday season. Robust [indiscernible] growth on Black Friday and Cyber Monday has led to strong performance across our product portfolio and $10.6 billion in revenue this quarter. Let me talk first about how our sales team have driven the introduction of innovative ad products that delivered impressive results for our advertising customers and outline performance by region. And finally, a few highlights from our marketing and partnerships teams. 
First in Search. Our core desktop Search maintained robust growth as we continue to help our customers grow their businesses. Beyond our robust core growth supporting online sales, we're increasingly helping our advertisers to use Search for branding, as well as something interesting, which is driving in-store sales for them. For instance, by using the power of data insights, we collaborated Carrefour in France to analyze over 2 years' worth of data demonstrate how 1 euro invested in online ads helps deliver almost EUR 8 of in-store sales. We expect to promote these kinds of programs further in the coming quarters. Additionally, we saw similar success in the study with SFR mobile, France's second largest mobile carrier, where we demonstrated a 20% marketing ROI for off-line sales resulting from online advertising. So our Search business continues to be strong. 
Let's move on to Display. As Larry mentioned, we're continuing to see great revenue growth. Our investments have really paid off in the last few years. Display has now reached an annualized run rate of over $5 billion as we engage with multiple advertisers and get tremendous support from our agency partners. What is particularly satisfying is how we're able to drive this growth as a consequence as of our continued investment in innovation with products like Ad Exchange and new ad formats like TrueView. I'm sure Susan will talk a lot more about these. All these are resulting in more efficiency and in revenue for both of us and our publisher partners. On the sales side, we have continued to align our teams, now the combined Display and Search sales, to help meet the needs of our advertising partners. We continue to activate the Display ecosystem of agencies, advertisers and other publishers. Advertisers like Ford, GM, Electronic Arts, L'Oreal and their agencies continue to see the efficiency of online branding and move more and more of their marketing spend towards our products, to Google Display Network and YouTube. For example, at L'Oreal, we demonstrated that online advertising is far more efficient than television as our new formats in YouTube, which include TrueView in-stream, in-slate and in-search have provided significant reach for their branding campaigns with millions of impressions, great click-through and efficiency gains. 
Let's move to Mobile. We had another record quarter for mobile advertising as mobile search continues to surge across all platforms. The number of our clients who are using mobile within their campaigns continues to grow rapidly. For example, Mali [ph] Hotels of Spain with 350 hotels in 35 countries, they use mobile search campaigns to support their mobile e-commerce activities. As a result, Mali [ph] has experienced a 60% increase in visitors for mobile devices, and their mobile-driven bookings have multiplied by 12 in 2011. 
We also worked hard to develop the Mobile ecosystem. This quarter, we kicked out -- kicked off the go mobile campaign in the city of Mobile, Alabama, where we helped hundreds of customers build their mobile sites for free, starting a program that will inspire, educate and empower businesses to continue to go mobile. 
Let's move to Enterprise. As Larry mentioned, we are seeing great traction in our Enterprise business, both with large partners, who tend to be early adopters and future looking, and in many small businesses who see Google Apps as a comprehensive and quick solution. We now have more than 5,000 customers signing up to Google Apps every day. As Larry mentioned, BBDA was the first major bank to go Google with Apps. Costco, one of the world's largest retailers, has also gone Google. In addition, in Q4, we signed government deals with the states of Maryland, Utah and 5 top universities, including Berkeley, Harvard and Michigan. 
Let's move quickly to country performance. From a regional perspective, we continue to see strong performance in the Americas. However, generally, country growth rates are flat or softened slightly partly due to comparisons with a very strong Q4 in 2010. North America saw slight decreases from preceding quarters. Year-to-year growth rates, however, [indiscernible] remained robust boosted by a strong holiday season. In particular, Cyber Monday led the way as the biggest day of the quarter. Western Europe was broadly stable as the U.K., France and Italy held steady, while Spain accelerated slightly for the third quarter in a row. However, revenue growth in Germany slowed this quarter. Our key emerging countries continued to see rapid growth across all of our product areas. 
Let me switch gears to marketing and partnerships. Our marketing and partnerships programs continue to provide strong foundations for the growth of our business. You may have seen many of our initiatives on Google+ this quarter, in addition to the Hangout with David Beckham Larry mentioned. Our sales teams have helped our customers create over 1 million Google+ pages, as Larry pointed out, including Global brands such as Toyota, Zaphos and The New York Times. Additionally, we continued the momentum of our Get Your Business Online program. In 2011, this program has helped bring hundreds of thousands of businesses online across the world. And we got 100,000 businesses to come online in 20 countries in Q4 alone. Last quarter, we expanded internationally to India, Sweden and Malaysia, as well as domestically to additional states like Michigan and New York. 
Our partnership team continues to drive great results with our partners. We renewed 35 of our direct search partner deals, and our long-standing Search distributor deal with Mozilla was renewed as well. These and other efforts helped our syndicated Search revenues accelerate in Q4 as we saw the full impact of large deals and fast growth of 3 partners. 
In closing, Q4 was a great quarter for us, finishing a strong 2011. We're excited to continue serving our customers, partners and users in 2012. And before I hand over to Susan, I want to give a shout-out to our business teams around the world and our partners in product and engineering for these great results. I will now turn over to Susan, who will discuss product performance this quarter. Thank you.",1101
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2012",2012-01-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3700.0,208952.0,12269197.0,Presenter Speech,Susan Wojcicki,,Executives,5,"Thanks, Nikesh. Larry mentioned last week's launch of Search, plus Your World. And I'd like to start by talking about that a bit more. 
Google Search has always been about finding the best results among billions of web pages. And until now, those results have been limited to the public world of the Internet. What we added last week was the ability to search your own world, including Google+ post photos and profiles relevant to you, all from the same search box. 
Let me give you a few examples of how this transformed my searches. Last week, I searched on CES, the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, to find out more details about the show. In addition to the public results, my search magically included pictures my friends and colleagues had taken while at the show, as well as products they thought were interesting to share. In addition to seeing all the standard news for CES, I was able to get a much more personalized view of the show. This weekend, I also searched on Yosemite since I was thinking about our summer plans. In my results, I was able to see pictures my friends had taken while in Yosemite and posts about interesting things to do there. There was even an article from my mom that she had shared with my family circle, warning us not to get too close to the waterfalls. 
Turning now to ads. We continue to improve ads quality, and we launched about 20 improvements this quarter. Patrick mentioned that paid click growth was very strong this quarter and that CPC has declined. It's important to look at clicks and CPC metrics together since more clicks can often lead to decreases in average CPC and vice versa. When we make ads quality or format changes, CPC and paid clicks may be impacted differently. For example, when we introduced sitelinks, we saw an increase in clicks. But the additional clicks were on lower-CPC ads, which reduced the average CPC. Many of the ads quality changes in Q3 increased paid clicks at lower CPCs, and they were revenue positive with good user and good advertiser metrics. These ad quality changes from Q3 had a cumulative effect on Q4 metrics. Another important and key driver of the change in CPC growth was foreign exchange. And lastly, there are mix effects with Mobile and emerging markets. 
Moving on to new ad formats. These new formats now appear on about 30% of queries that show ads. Product Listing Ads, which include prices and pictures of products, saw a lot of success over the holiday season. Traffic to consumer sites from Product Listing Ads was up over 600% year-on-year. This quarter, we expanded Product Listing Ads so they can show up to 5 products, which was great for holiday shopping. We are also working to make it more efficient for advertisers to use AdWords. Many businesses have a large and dynamic catalog of products, and it can be time consuming for them to select the keywords and the CPCs for each product. So this quarter, we beta-launched Dynamic Search Ads, which generates the ads automatically based on what's on a customer website. This enables businesses to advertise a lot more of their products, and our system can also monitor the advertiser's available inventory and show ads only for what is in stock. For small local businesses, we ramped up AdWords Express. This product lets businesses get up and running with a campaign in just a few minutes. Customer sign-ups have more than tripled in the past 6 months. We now offer AdWords Express in the U.S., U.K., Germany and France, and we are trialing it in several other countries. 
In Display, which now has reached a $5 billion annualized run rate, as Larry mentioned, we're creating a comprehensive solution to buy and sell display ads across many types of digital media, such as desktop, video and mobile. One key driver of growth has been our success in audience buying. This technology enables marketers to deliver ads to specific audiences across the web, such as in-market hybrid car buyers or adventure travelers. Many audience buyers purchase via the Ad Exchange, which now has customers in 26 countries and is growing very rapidly. We also expanded to video and mobile inventory on the Ad Exchange. And on the Google Display Network, we're also growing audience buying. From Q3 to Q4, the number of active advertisers using interest category marketing increased over 60%. And that was from an already large base. By understanding users' interests, we've been able to serve much more relevant and useful ads to our users. 
Our success in Display has also been driven by brand advertisers, with video formats being an important factor. Our TrueView in-stream ads give users the option to skip the ads. This means that users who see the ads are more likely to be interested in those products, and advertisers are incented to create compelling ads. View rates range between 15% and 45%, and the people who choose to watch those ads are highly engaged. Over 60% of our in-stream ads are now skippable. It's an increase of over 4x since the beginning of the year. We now serve TrueView video ads across the Google Display Network and on YouTube Mobile. 
I'd also like to give a quick update on Offers, which has been bringing online users to off-line stores and services. Offers are now live in over 30 cities, and we're starting to feature national offers from partners like REI, JetBlue and Toys ""R"" Us. We expanded our collection of deals to include offers from partners so that users get a wider variety and partners get access to a broader user base. 
And lastly, among the many launches that we did in the quarter, I'd like to highlight one project we did called Memories for the Future. This site compares before and after Street View photographs of the areas affected by last year's tsunami in Japan. We drove thousands of miles so that future generations can see what happened. Thanks all for your time. Now back to Patrick.",1024

But I would say the 2 biggest factors this quarter were FX as well as the changes that we had made, their ad quality or format changes, which increased the paid clicks and again were revenue positive, advertiser positive, user positive. But those clicks, as I explained, may be lower CPC like in the example that I gave in my script with sitelinks. So those were the 2 factors.

I guess first for Nikesh. It looks like international, excluding the U.K. revenue price load, the most kind of sequentially. I was wondering if the macro economy played at all a role? And if so, any sense of magnitude there? And then secondly, for Susan, with respect to the $5 billion Display run rate number, there's obviously a lot of stuff that goes in there between YouTube and Mobile and the ad network.

So first, we will not -- we don't provide the TAC rate on the blended. And you're right that, I mean, if you think of the big properties that are in there, right, so you will have the GDN, we'll have YouTube, right, we’ll have all of the additional elements of our Display business, which includes the Teracents and then all of the other optimizers but also the AdMob on mobile. So that's the kind of key elements of it. But we do not -- we don't kind of comment on the details of the blended TAC on them. On the economy, look, we had actually quite a solid Q4 performance, and we're really pleased of our revenue growth. I mean, even despite the FX issues -- so you have to separate the FX issues from the economics fundamentals of our business. And performance in Europe was actually quite healthy despite the environment that we got there. And that's driven by the secular shifts of off-line to online continues, and the secular shifts of more mobile continues. So from that perspective, right, obviously, we don't control the economy, we don't control exchange rates, but we're actually quite pleased with the performance that we've had internationally in addition to the U.K. and the U.S.",223

If you look at our growth -- first of all, you're right that FX played a part. You also have to remember that last year at this time, right, we had such a strong comp.

And so from that perspective -- and if you also look at our mix between our own Google websites versus all of our network, I mean, our core properties continue to be actually very strong.

There was no one individually that actually affected things, but it just so happened that the changes we made drew more attention and caused an increase in paid clicks.

And those were changes that we made in Q3. There was no, I think, one significant one that drove the metrics. Or like this quarter, we made 20 different changes. Last quarter, we made something similar. And it was the combination of those different changes. Now it's important to remember that we rolled those out over the course of Q3. And so that meant that if we rolled one out at the end of Q3, that you wound up seeing that impact in Q4 period. And so there was a cumulative effect. But again, there was not any one big one. It was the sum of a bunch of other changes. And those changes that we wind up making are changes that may make the ads more readable, they may be more visible, they're UI treatments or quality changes. They're a bunch of different things that make it more visible so that users are noticing the ads. And we see those as positive. We measure the metrics, how do our users respond, how do our advertisers respond. And they are revenue positive.",213

Another way to think about this is in many quarters, we would have a bunch of them that would actually move down the CPC, a bunch of them that would have moved up in [ph] click. It just happens that in the latter part of this year, they kind of all moved one way, which is not neither good nor bad. It just happens that the quality team and the advertising teams actually have kind of unearthed these type of opportunities. So it's a bit of circumstantial as well.",90

First of all, I think, Larry, early on you referred -- you talked about shuttering a couple of products and then doubling on key products that are showing some quite bit of success. I guess can you speak to are you still innovating across new products around the consumer? And anything that's not tied to advertising as we look ahead? Second question, can you talk about -- I guess when you look at mobile distribution costs in general, do you envision a scenario where mobile distribution costs stay about where they are today?

I think we -- I didn't mean to imply in any way that we're stopping innovating. And I think we will continue to launch new products in new areas and things that aren't necessarily advertising supported, as we have been doing for a while. And I'm very excited about that. But we may not launch 100 such things. We may launch a few of those such things over the next few years. I think we'll try to make sure we're more concentrated in our efforts to make sure we're producing really amazing products for our users and for our customers that are really well thought out and work really well. And so, I mean, we've put a lot of effort into those things.

Many consumers get their mobile applications from Google directly on their devices. Some people get them through our distribution partners, and some people get them through our carriers.

Patrick, on the hedging program, you had $134 million loss on the expenses of getting the hedges, but you only made $25 million and it was a pretty volatile quarter. Do you have a lot of backlog saved up for next year in profits? And is this working the way you want? And then maybe for Larry, obviously CPC growth is really accelerating. Can you explain why that's good for Google and why you think you're going in the right direction? The mix seems to be a big controversy, but obviously you're making these changes. Can you really explain the positive benefit to the user experience or to the company?",114

Our hedges -- so the cost that we accelerated is actually relative to the entire portfolio of hedges that we have that spans over 18 months forward. So what -- think of it as a complete program that extends 18 months out and -- of which think of it like a bond ladder, right, with a lot in the short term and -- less in the long term. All of those hedges, right, you have to mark to market. And when you have to mark to market, they're so much in the money. Then you have to actually accelerate your expensing of them. So you're absolutely right that today as we stand or as we close our books on the 31st, right, they signaled about the weakness of the euro because the euro had lost quite a bit in the quarter and relative to our portfolio. So we would -- if things stayed exactly the same, right, we wouldn't reap a lot of benefits in the coming quarters and wouldn't have those expenses because we took them all in one shot. So I hope that makes sense. And it's really tied to FASB 133 that doesn't allow you to just do it pretty [ph] early.",227

I think -- and I don't have the detail here, quarter or whatever, but I do think that CPCs -- do vary a fair amount, and we're not surprised by that. There are lots of product changes that we can make that can increase CPCs or decrease CPCs and kind of have a -- or an inverse effect on the number of clicks and sort of not change the actual dollars spent, for example. And that's not that surprising because we can do things that -- in product changes that affect people’s attention to ads that Susan mentioned or that affect the quality of the conversions that advertises receive. They might receive better quality clicks, or they're -- or those -- each CPC that they got that's more likely to convert into  what they care about. And so we are constantly optimizing all those things across a number of different product areas and ad placements and everything else. And our advertisers are doing the same, and the algorithms are also doing all that. So I think in any healthy economic -- economy, like we have of advertising, we're going to see variation in the different factors we use to measure it. And I'm not surprised by that.",219

I mean, one additional thing I'd like to say about the increase in paid clicks is the increase in paid clicks, in a lot of ways, is a proxy for where the ad is useful. Do the users find interesting enough to click on them? Do we have enough advertisers who served ads? So an increase in paid clicks shows that our advertising system is working, that we have more advertisers, we have more clicks. And as Larry alluded to, there are many, many different variables that go into it, but an increase in paid clicks is something that we see as a sign that our advertising system is in demand and it's healthy.",115

29096.0,"Google Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2012",2012-01-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3700.0,208952.0,12269251.0,Question,Scott Devitt,,Analysts,59,"I'll ask about paid clicks and their relationship to CPCs. There's a third-party data that suggest that paid clicks continue to grow faster than free clicks. And so the 34% paid click growth that you reported, it would seem to make that fairly accurate that there's a mix shift that's occurring in favor of paid versus free. And with search quality improvements as the driver of this potentially, it would seem that advertisers would be paying more for better distribution, yet CPC is down. So if you were to look at your business on a same distribution basis normalized for mobile and increased ad coverage and all the other potential drags on CPC, I'm just -- the question is a simple one. If you look at advertisers, are they paying more or less on a unit basis for distribution?",140
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2012",2012-01-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3700.0,208952.0,12269252.0,Answer,Patrick Pichette,,Executives,60,"I think that -- let we make 2 statements on this. The first one is that we shy from talking about -- anything about specific which is third-party data, because typically we find there are so much errors and methodology issues with them. I think that we're seeing -- what we have clearly seen this year once again, right, is more holiday shopping happened online this year again, right. Nikesh talked about, right, record Cyber Sundays and Fridays that are black. And, I mean, all of these things have hit record year -- this year again, and we're seeing again a transition of off-line to online. I think that Susan's last point is really the critical point, which is as we're moving and exploring formats that really work well for both the advertiser and the user, you should see a symptom which is more clicking. And that's exactly what we see. And if there's a slight pressure on the CPC as a consequence of it, but overall we get a better result, right, that's actually a pretty healthy environment and an innovative one. And then -- and just again, as we mentioned and as Susan said, it happened that in Q3, we had just a number of them that just went one way. And I wouldn't read any data points in that as saying that that's the future or that it will not revert back to others. It's -- that's just the nature of experimentation in our systems.",248

I have actually a couple of questions for Larry on Google+. Last quarter, I think you referred to it your as social lair. And I guess I almost think of it like Google's -- it's like your social operating system, I guess, to a certain extent. So I'd love to get your vision on how you think G+ can improve engagement across all your properties. And then the second question would be, identities that are on Facebook and Twitter, do you think ultimately those firms will open up the data stream and we could see even richer results with clearly Facebook- and Twitter-like information?",112
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2012",2012-01-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3700.0,208952.0,12269255.0,Answer,Larry Page,,Executives,63,"Yes. I think we see -- as I mentioned in my opening remarks that we see really engaging with users on -- really deeply understanding who they are by getting them the right things that make sense for them and so on. It's really, really important. And I think we are at the early stages of that, and Google+ is a big part of that effort. If you look at some of the things we've done, I think that if you look at in Search, you can do a search now and get somebody's name and have that name really appear as a chip in the search. And that means that it's no longer a string that you're searching for, it's actually a real person. That notion of identity is really a deep, deep part of what we're doing. And it's an example of how we can make all of our products better by really understanding people. So we definitely think about that. There's a reason why we called it Google+ in that way. I think -- and so I think you're -- you've got the right idea in general about that. I think that -- I think with other big companies, other big companies that work on social data and so on, I think we've seen very much general tendency to wall that data up and to wall the card in and not make the data available. Where we have publicly been able to access the data -- for example, in Search, we've provided a lot of third-party social data in Search, and we love doing that and we'd love to have more such data. But in general, I would say companies generally have been walling that data up, and we'd love to be able to use more of it.",301

Susan, on Google Offers, quick question there. Given Google [ph] and LivingSocial’s early success in this space, it seemed like scale is an advantage in the local and national deals area. Is there any reason why Google is only in 30 markets to date? It seemed like you've got all the merchant relationships that you need. So is there something else that's preventing a broader rollout? And then a follow-up for Nikesh on Europe. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that Germany was a little weak in the quarter. Can you give us a little color on which verticals? Was it travel, retail, finance? A little color on the verticals that were weak. Or was it broad-based?",123

So as there are more markets and as it makes more sense for us over time, then we will roll out more markets. But I do think that there is -- it's very important to understand what's working in a specific market and in a city and perfecting that and really understanding the dynamics that make sense for us for the success of that city.

We've seen that. And then in different markets, different verticals have been special in terms of the -- the U.S., we had – education, we had health. So there have been different vertical performances around the world. And Germany has been a market which has been doing really well for us in the last few quarters. So part of it is we're running up against some very, very tough comps versus last year. But it was general sort of weakness across the board.

First, I remember last year in the fourth quarter there was a pretty big change that you guys made on the quality side, which I think you mentioned a bit on the prepared remarks. Wondering if that -- how much of a headwind that was relative to the fourth quarter of this year. If there's a way you could sort of quantify that. And second question is the hiring rate that you guys have made, 1,100 people, this quarter. Wondering -- that's a bit of a slowdown from the previous quarters in the past. Wondering if there was something there to look into.",107

On the first one, we mentioned it because we thought it was material. It was such a big impact last year. We don't comment on the specifics, but it was sufficiently material that that's -- you're absolutely right that it created a headwind for us this year. No doubt about it. And that's why we mentioned it.

So I was wondering that based -- if based on your early test, is that a product that you're planning on doubling down on? And if so, what is the path to wider adoption? And second, on MMI, I know the deal hasn't obviously closed yet. But just given the size of that transaction, it certainly has the potential to really change Google's growth and margin profile pretty significantly, which is a big concern to many. So at a very high level, Larry, I was wondering if you could maybe just talk about your commitment to be a principal in the handset business. And if so, how does -- how do you avoid channel conflicts with the partners?",130

So I can talk a little bit about Google Wallet. And so as Larry has mentioned a number of times, we want to focus on products that people use every day. So products that are core. And all of us use our wallet every day. And we think that's a big opportunity for us. So we are continuing to invest in our Wallet business. And we see a lot of opportunity.

I think that -- and able to track the business separately. So that should not be an issue. We've been very clear that Motorola's obviously going to remain a licensee of Android, and Android will remain open. And when we announced the deal, we really said our strategy is working with different manufacturers on lead devices is going to continue. And Motorola will bid with -- just like any other OEM for those devices. So that process will be unchanged. And obviously, I think we have done a great job managing our partner ecosystem. That's a difficult thing to do, and I think we do it quite well. And I expect we're going to continue to do that well with Motorola. And obviously, it shows our commitment to Android in making sure that we have the freedom to innovate and as do all of our OEMs.",174

So the Google will continue to be very clear in terms of its performance and transparency to investors. Motorola will also, on its own, be very clear and transparent to investors. And just before we close the call, just a reminder to everybody, as the headcount question that was asked a minute ago reminded me. As we launch into Q1, it's important to remember that there's a lot of expenses. As people kind of think of resetting their models, it's really -- I just want to remind everybody because every year we go through this, that the employer taxes and 401(k)s and all of the things that launch into Q1 typically get reset. And so I just want to give a friendly reminder to all our -- the people that have financial models out there to make sure that -- to take that into consideration because it surprises everybody every year. So rather than get another surprise at the end of Q1, I just thought I'd remind everyone. On that note, I think it's really -- I'd love to, once again on behalf of the 4 of us here, thank profusely our Googlers. I mean, they do an amazing job and, as we said, landing a great quarter, crowning a terrific year and really well set for an absolute exciting year for 2012 and look forward it.

Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining the call today. It's great to be here with all of you. I'll talk about our new class of stock at the end of my remarks, but first, I want to focus on our performance. We had a very strong quarter with revenue up 24% year-on-year at $10.6 billion. Since becoming CEO again last April, I've pushed hard to increase our velocity, improve our execution and focus on the big bets that will make a difference in the world. Google is a large company now, but we'll achieve more and do it faster if we approach life with the passion and the soul of a startup. This has involved a lot of cleanups. We've given many of our products including Search a visual refresh. They now have a more consistent look and feel. When we've closed or combined over 30 products, we have so many opportunities that without hard choices we end up spreading ourselves too thin and don't have the impact that we strive for.
Creating a simpler and more intuitive user experience across Google has been another important focus. I have always believed that technologies should do the hard work, but just takes scheduling and communications, so users can get on with what makes them happiest, life. Our products work seamlessly together so people don't have to navigate Google to get stuff done. 
Chrome for Android, which launched this quarter, is a great example of this kind of simplicity we're shooting for. It does mean switching between devices painless. All of your tabs are there across your desktop and Android, you can even click the back button on a different device and it just works. Just try it out, it's a great experience. 
It's the same with Google Play, which we also shipped this quarter. You can now access all your movies, your books and apps and games from the web or from your Android device, no cables, downloading or syncing required. We spent years working with partners to get all of this great content. So it's really exciting to see it brought together in a beautifully simply way that people can enjoy.
Now Google+ is truly at the heart of our efforts to create a simpler, more intuitive experience for all of our users. You should think of it in 2 parts. One is just our social spine. Once you're logged in and have upgraded to Google+, you're just using one Google, not a series of disconnected products. It's still early days, but with over 120 Google integrations to date -- Google+ integrations to date, we're on the right track. And your user experience on Google just gets better. You can see friends' recommendations when you're using Google Play and you don't think about that as Google+, but it just comes from that infrastructure. And we're seeing a positive impact all across the web. Google users can now recommend search results they like, a goal we’ve had ever since we started the company.
The other part is the social destination, which is accessed on your mobile client or on plus.google.com. This social destination part grew from a base of 0, not starting with all Google users like the part I was previously talking about, and is growing quickly. In fact, we see impressive engagement in fast growth here. It's just not all of Google. We are starting up a new community. 
We're excited about the amazing speed with which some people have amassed over 1 million followers, and I have just been lucky enough to pass 2 million. I get high-quality feedback on the public post I make, which I really enjoy. And every day we make Google+ better. Just yesterday, we took another big step forward with a beautiful new UI for Google+. And the new customizable navigation driven in that redesign makes it much easier to access your favorite apps. There's better discoverability for Hangouts and you'll love the larger images that you see across that interface. 
Now last time, there's a bit of confusion over the metrics I gave about Google+. I want to be clear about these 2 parts of Google+ and the fact that we have made great progress on both parts. As you would expect, the social spine is proportional to Google and all of the usage across Google. And Google’s pretty big. And well over 170 million people have now upgraded to Google+. 
So to summarize, there are 2 parts to the Google+ experience: the part that is the social spine, and the other part that's the social destination part of Google+ exclusively. Both of these are growing fast, but the social destination part of Google+ is growing as a new product with very healthy growth.
I'm also excited by our big bets. We have some amazing new products that were seen as crazy when we launched them, but now have phenomenal usage. They can easily pass the toothbrush test. They're important enough that millions of people use them at least once or twice a day. Chrome has over 200 million users. Our Display business has reached an annualized run rate of over $5 billion and 850,000 Android devices are activated every day. And YouTube just keeps on growing. These are just staggering even by Google standard. They had over 800 million monthly users uploading over an hour of video per second. I'm incredibly proud of these achievements. They wouldn't have been possible without an amazing team of Googlers and the long-term focus with which we are able to run the company, which brings me to this afternoon's announcement about our stock.
Now throughout our evolution from being privately held startup to a large publicly listed company, we have managed Google for the long term and enjoying tremendous success as a result, especially since our IPO in 2004. The founders, Sergey and I, really hoped but we did not expect that Google would have such significant impact. And that this progress has made us even more impatient to do important things that matter in the world. Our enduring love for Google comes from a strong desire to create technology products that enrich millions of people's lives in deep and meaningful ways. To fulfill these dreams, we need to ensure that Google remains a successful growing business that can generate significant returns for everyone involved.
When we went public in 2004, we established some clear well-publicized expectations for investors around our governance. We wrote a couple of things in our original founder’s letter, I just want to read here. ""New investors will fully share in Google's long-term economic future, but will have little ability to influence its strategic decisions through their voting rights. And we are creating a new corporate structure that is designed for stability over the long-time horizons. By investing in Google, you're placing an unusual long-term bet on a team, especially Sergey and me.""
I wanted to quote all that because these are the clear well-publicized expectations we established for investors. And while this decision was controversial at the time, we believe with hindsight it was absolutely the right thing to do. Eight years later, these still -- statements are still remarkably accurate and everyone involved has realized tremendous benefits. 
Given Google's success, it's unsurprising this type of dual-class governance structure is now somewhat standard among newer technology companies. In our experience, success is more likely if you concentrate on the long term. Technology products often require significant investment over many years to fulfill their potential. For example, it took 3 years just to ship our first Android handset and then another 3 years on top of that before the operating system truly reach critical mass. These kind of investments are not for the fainthearted. 
Long-term product investments like Chrome and YouTube, which now enjoy phenomenal usage, were made with a significant degree of independence. However, day-to-day dilution from routine equity-based employee compensation and other possible dilutions, such as stock-based acquisitions, will likely undermine this dual-class structure and our aspirations for Google over the very long term. We have put our hearts into Google and hope to do so for many years to come, so we want to ensure that our corporate structure can sustain these efforts and our desire to improve the world.
Today, we announced plans to create a new class of nonvoting capital stock. These shares will be distributed via stock dividend to all existing stockholders. The owner of each existing share will receive one new share of the nonvoting stock, giving investors twice the number of shares they had before. Effectively, a 2-for-1 stock split, something many of our investors have long asked us for. These nonvoting shares will be available for corporate uses like equity-based employee compensation that might otherwise dilute our governance structure. 
In November 2009, Sergey and I published plans to sell a modest percentage of our overall stock ending in 2015. We are currently halfway through those plans and we don't expect any changes to that, certainly not as the result of this new potential class. We both remain very much committed to Google for the long term. It's important to bear in mind that this proposal will only have an effect on governance over the very long term. In fact, there's no particular urgency to make these changes now. We don't have an unusually big acquisition planned, in case you are wondering.
Investors and others have always taken a big bet on Sergey and me, and that bet will likely last longer as a result of these changes. We are honored that so many of you have put your trust in us and recognize the tremendous responsibility that rests on our shoulders. We think this is a good thing because users rely on Google to produce and operate amazing technology products and to safely and responsibly store their data. That is our passion. 
Thank you very much, and I will now hand over to David to explain some of the more technical aspects of this proposal.",1675
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 12, 2012",2012-04-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3690.0,314595.0,15302190.0,Presenter Speech,David Drummond,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Larry. So first of all, I wanted to say that we'll be filing a proxy statement soon, which will have more details about today's proposal. But for now, I want to give a few broad strokes. 
First off, as Larry said, what we announced today is basically a 2-for-1 stock split, and here's how it works. What we're doing is creating a new class of stock, Class C. That new stock will have equivalent rights to our existing Class A and Class B stock, except it will have no voting rights, and it will also be issued through a stock dividend on all Class A and Class B shares. So after the dividend, a stockholder who currently owns one share of Class A common stock with a single vote will continue to own that share plus one share of Class C capital stock that does not have a vote. Our existing Class A shares will continue to trade as they do now and the new class C shares will also be listed, so stockholders will be able to trade those shares, the class C, just as they can with the Class A shares today. 
Now one thing to emphasize, because all stockholders will be treated equally and will receive one share of Class C for every share they now hold, everyone, including Larry, Sergey and Eric, will retain the same voting interest they had immediately prior to the dividend. And it's also important to note that as part of this, Larry, Sergey and Eric have all agreed to subject their shares to a transfer restriction agreement. This agreement maintains the same link between their voting and economic interest that exist today.
So if any of Larry, Sergey or Eric sell or transfer their nonvoting Class C shares, there's a stapling provision in the agreement that requires them to either sell an equal number of Class B shares or convert an equal number of Class B shares into Class A shares. Now the stapling requirement will end when their ownership levels fall below certain thresholds. So the basic thing to understand here is that the stapling provision is designed so that subject to these thresholds, the votes held by the founders and Eric will be reduced proportionally as their economic interest in the company declines.
Now a word about the process we used. Our Board of Directors carefully considered this proposal to create a new class of stock before reaching a decision. The process the board followed was robust and the deliberations were extensive. Back in January 2011, the board established a special committee comprised of independent non-management board members to consider this new class of stock or other alternatives. The committee met on numerous occasions over the 15 months that the special committee considered the proposal and that, that was separately from the board. The committee recommended and the board unanimously approved today's proposal.
In terms of next steps, the proposal’s subject to the approval of a majority of the voting power of Google's common stock and they'll vote together as a class that will happen at our Annual Meeting on June 21 of this year. Given that Larry, Sergey and Eric control the majority of voting power and support the proposal, we expect it to pass. Following that, the board will set a record date for the dividend to move the process forward. 
So for more detail on the proposal, you can find the Founder's Letter that Larry and Sergey issued this morning as well as a postscript from me on our Investor Relations site. And as I said, next week, we'll file a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC, so you'll have even more details about today's proposal. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Patrick to talk about the quarter.",635
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 12, 2012",2012-04-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3690.0,314595.0,15302191.0,Presenter Speech,Patrick Pichette,,Executives,4,"Thank you, David. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Well, closing this first year with Larry leading Google as CEO, all of us at Google feel a renewed sense of velocity, focus and optimism in our Q1 operating, but also financial results are a good reflection of this spirit. 
So let's jump right into the financials. Our gross revenue grew 24% year-over-year to $10.6 billion, 1% quarter-over-quarter, and our Google websites also grew. Revenue grew 24% to $7.3 billion, with strength across most major geographies and verticals. Google's Network revenue was up 20% year-over-year to $2.9 billion, 1% quarter-over-quarter. And Network revenue was still negatively impacted by the search quality changes we began to make a year ago in late February, otherwise known as Panda. Other revenue was up 56% year-over-year to $420 million and 2% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate paid-click growth was very strong, just shy of 40%, up 39% year-over-year, and up 7% quarter-over-quarter. Aggregate cost-per-click growth was down 12% and down 6% quarter-over-quarter. 
So given the recent trends in CPCs and clicks, allow me to spend a bit of time today addressing this. The most important thing for you to understand is that our business is healthy. We believe that shifts in CPC and paid clicks taken independently really do not reflect the fundamental health of our business. Now allow me some details on this. In general, we attribute these trends to a combination of really 5 core factors. Those include FX, and then there's 3 mix effects. For example, the mobile versus tablet versus desktop shifts, emerging markets versus developed markets shifts and even the basics of google.com versus our network. And then finally, ads quality changes which is also a huge factor. So as you can see, it's a complex set of dynamics with multiple variables at play. 
Many in the financial community have tried to isolate or often I hear pick one of these among these factors as the primary driver for CPC or click trends. Some even say it's about -- all about mobile. Others suggest that it indicates weakness in demand for Google advertising. Well, on the latter point, I want to be very clear that that's not the case. One important signal we have for advertiser demand is bidding behavior. And in fact, our advertisers’ bid continue to be very strong and are growing.
So the dynamics around CPCs and paid clicks are just simply very complex because of all of these big factors and change continually. So trying to pick a horse, so to speak, just doesn't make sense. We internally track all these factors with the help of a number of statisticians, economists and engineers who dig into all these details on an ongoing basis. So we won't go into that level of detail every quarter, but again, the key thing to understand is that we believe that shifts in CPC, or paid clicks taken independently, simply don't reflect the fundamental health of our business, which we believe is actually very healthy. If anything, the recent lower CPCs present a great opportunity for advertisers to get an even better return on their ad spend. And lower cost, better ROI attract advertisers and thus, this is good for Google for the long term as well. So enough said on CPCs and paid clicks. 
Let's just turn to geographic performance. The U.S., U.K. and rest of world are growing still at good pace as reflected in our results. In our earnings slides, which you'll find on our Investor Relation website, you see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and rest of world that showed the impact of FX and the benefits from our hedging programs. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.
Our revenue in the U.S. was up 22% year-over-year to $4.9 billion. Our non-U.S. revenue accounted for 54% of our total revenue or $5.8 billion, up 26% year-over-year, which includes modest $37 million benefits from our hedging program. The U.K. was up 19% year-over-year to $1.2 billion. 
Let me now turn to expenses. Our traffic acquisition costs were $2.5 billion or 24.5% of total advertising revenue. Our other cost of revenue was $1.2 billion, excluding stock-based compensation of $74 million. And finally, operating expenses excluding SBC again, totaled $3 billion. SBC totaled $482 million for the quarter, and the increase year-over-year in OpEx was primarily due to payroll, increased advertising and promotional spend and professional services.
So as a result of all this, our non-GAAP operating profit was $3.9 billion for Q1, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin slightly above 37%. These robust margins give us the confidence to continue to fully fund the strategic growth areas such as mobile, Android, YouTube, Chrome, all the areas that Larry talked about. And Nikesh will go into more details of these initiatives in a minute. 
Turning to headcount, which was approximately 610 for the quarter, and we ended up the quarter with roughly 33,077 employees, full time. Our effective tax rate was lower this quarter, 18%, and this reflects the mix of earnings between domestic and international subsidiaries and hedges and also some capital gains offset by carried over capital losses.
So now let me turn to cash, cash management. Other OI&Es or other income and expenses was $156 million for the quarter, positive, and it reflects a higher realized gain on our investments, offset somewhat by lower interest income and by the impact of our FAS 133 expenses from our hedging program. For more details on OI&E, once again, I refer you to the slides that accompany us on our IR website. 
Operating cash flow was very strong, $3.7 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $607 million versus last quarter at $951 million. The majority of our CapEx spend was related to production equipment this quarter, as well as data center operations and facilities. And as a reminder, we will continue to make significant CapEx investments, and these have shown to be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, mostly depending on when we're able to make these investments. So in total, very pleased with our free cash flow, $3.1 billion. 
Let me close with my usual reminder that our revenues typically exhibit seasonality in the first half of the year, while our expenses do less so. So it's just a forewarning for everybody who's kind of tuning their models. 
I'll hand off now to Nikesh who will cover in more detail our business performance in the quarter. Additionally, since Susan, who is typically on the call, is on a well-deserved spring break with her family this week, Nikesh will also cover some of the product highlights, primarily in Ads. 
With this, I'll turn it over to Nikesh.",1122
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 12, 2012",2012-04-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3690.0,314595.0,15302192.0,Presenter Speech,Nikesh Arora,,Executives,5,"Thank you, Patrick. I will now give you an update on our business activities. As Larry and Patrick have mentioned, we had another quarter of excellent performance, resulting in $10.6 billion of revenue this quarter. Our results are actually reflective of 3 major trends that are happening in the online advertising space, so let me just touch upon those. 
First, we're seeing a big move to solutions. Our clients and partners more and more want complete solutions that work across all screens: desktop; mobile, tablet; and in the future, television. And also work with all kinds of formats, whether they're search, display or video ads. It's like having individual solutions for different devices and formats. So we're driving our teams to sell solutions across the entire marketing funnel. From building brand awareness to conversions, we are converging our teams of over 8,000 people to setting these complete solutions in 60 countries, making us one of the largest online solutions player. 
Secondly, the big trend is we're seeing a breakthrough on brands. More than at any point in the last decade of online advertising, we're at a point where major brand advertisers, from movie studios to CPG companies, are finally looking to digital media as a central part of their marketing efforts. We are making huge progress. YouTube has gone from an interesting ad buy to key buy for brands. In May, we'll be hosting our first upfront for brands and agencies, showcasing the latest channel content and opportunities for marketers, something television has been doing forever. We will do that for YouTube in New York. 
And third, we're beginning to see a trend on cross-media measurement. Social advertising has always been highly measurable, and we have been leading the industry in extending the measurability, not only in Search, but in Display, Mobile and live video. We are actually taking that one step further and trying to move that measurability into offline sales. Our experience is that businesses may allocate experimental budgets to new areas, but they invest serious money only when they can measure the results. We are rolling our best-of-breed measurement technologies so all clients can measure their ROI, whether their goals are online conversions, brand lifts or just the ability to compare offline and online media. 
Let's talk about some specific product areas. Search, our Desktop Search business has maintained robust growth with strong traction with our top partners around the world even in the face of economic uncertainties that we've been noticing in Europe. I think search advertising has broken through that sound barrier of being an online channel, which now finally proven to drive in-store sales. For example, we partnered with IKEA in Italy in a study showing that each click on a paid search ad generates $7.60 of revenue. And then interaction with paid search in conjunction with television drives 20% of contribution to sales. And there's a lot of room to improve on that, but it's a cut clear demonstration of how online advertising is no longer just restricted to online sales but also having a huge impact in the offline world. 
Last week, we launched a range of features to improve location targeting so that marketers can reach users by zip code or have their physical location show up more prominently in their ads. 
In sales, I want to highlight Google Analytics, which is an unsung hero. Over 10 million marketers and websites globally use Google Analytics to measure the effectiveness of their online presence in real time. From large e-commerce sites to small blogs, that means that our technology is at the heart of over 10 million businesses, helping them get the most out of the Web. 
Last quarter, we made several important improvements to Google Analytics, helping marketeers to measure the impact of the traffic from across over 400 social networks. I didn't even know there are 400 social networks. 
Let's talk about Display. On Display, we saw a robust revenue growth as our clients continue to see the value of integrated advertising solution in driving business results. For example, we signed a deal with Unilever in Brazil for a campaign that ran across all Google properties, including YouTube, Search, Google Display Network and Gmail. We also recently partnered with leading sportswear company, Reebok, to develop a global display campaign across YouTube, Mobile -- YouTube and AdMob -- and mobiles, YouTube as well. 
On the platform side in Display, we continue to make progress. We are now the leading platform provider for agencies and publishers to help drive their business using display advertising. We are focused in building unified buying and selling platform that helps them manage their advertising across all media much better than they have been able to in the past. 
Our good relationships with our clients are helped by rapid product development and innovation. Last quarter, we launched the Google Display Network app in AdWords, which makes it easy for all AdWords clients to build, monitor and find display campaigns across millions of sites in our network. This is helping bring the world of search and display even closer. 
Let's take a minute to talk about YouTube. As I mentioned, YouTube is an amazing success story. It's gone from an interesting buy to an obvious buy. Our watch paid sales have accelerated, particularly in key emerging countries, but also in mature ones. Today, most of our in-stream ads in YouTube are skippable, while our TrueView ad format, which is fast becoming an online video standard. It's great for users and it's great for advertisers. For example, the U.K. mobile operator O2 is actively now using YouTube to support their brand launch. They're using several YouTube products, including TrueView YouTube Mobile. They even live stream the New York -- sorry, the New Year Eve's concert from the O2 arena in London globally in YouTube. 
In addition to this, we're also rolling out our 100 new original channels in YouTube, featuring top talents like Jay-Z, Madonna, Tony Hawk, as well as innovative new media companies and YouTube's new own successful partners. We think YouTube is fast becoming the platform for the next generation of talents, which is great because we're also seeing initial success selling the sponsorship for these channels to large advertisers such as Toyota, Unilever, GM as all in anticipation of the big upfront event coming up in May. 
Let's change gears and talk about mobile. Mobile is quickly becoming a backbone of many clients overall advertising strategies and has huge headroom to grow. We continue to innovate with our product offerings with a number of new tools for advertisers. One development we're particularly excited about is our new enhanced click-to-download formats. This format in Search helps marketeers and developers promote apps. These things help improve ROI to provide users with more relevant download information about apps such as star rankings, pricing, et cetera, and all this happens right in the ad creator [ph]. So we keep actively working to help develop the mobile ecosystem from enabling mobile commerce to empowering local businesses. 
In Q1, we began to scale our GoMo campaign, which is our Go Mobile campaign. This initiative helps businesses get more and more assertive and set up great mobile websites so they can keep driving traffic to those websites and expand their businesses. We've done these efforts across the world in North and South America, in Europe, in Asia and Africa.
Moving beyond advertising. Our Enterprise business also saw excellent progress as large organizations and small businesses continue to see the value of Google Apps as a cost-effective and feature-rich productivity suite. Some of our top customers to go Google in Q1 include global pharmaceutical company Roche, more than 90,000 users; the State of Colorado, which announced they intend to move 26,000 employees and users to Google; also the University of Pennsylvania and Rome have gone Google. Not only that, small business adoption of Google Apps is on fire, with SMB signups almost doubling in the past 6 months. So we're happy with the business and we're happy with the way Enterprise continues to progress. 
Let me go back and show some more color on the country performance, as Patrick also talked about. From a regional perspective, we saw generally stable performance in the Americas. We saw a sustained traction in most parts of Europe and we saw acceleration in Asia, all this was driven by strong performance from our long tail Sense sales channel. Growth in North America was steady and this certainly was boosted by seasonal events such as Super Bowl, Valentine's Day, tax season. Canada was a little slower. Of course, Western Europe was robust in spite of the macroeconomic conditions. We continued seeing good growth in the U.K. Germany, France and Italy grew slightly less quickly than before. We saw strong acceleration in Asia. Japan grew faster this quarter, led by successes again, in our small and medium client base.
Let's talk about marketing and our partnerships business. Our marketing and partnership teams continue to support the fantastic growth we've seen this quarter across all of our business lines, products and services. We continue to roll out initiatives to support of Google+, which Larry talked about. We rolled out our That's the plus campaign with spots airing during the Grammys, the Oscars. Google+ and Hangouts are getting great traction. We have President Obama, we have Governor Romney, they both conducted very successful Hangouts in the platform. Even NASCAR held a Hangout ahead of the Daytona 500. But the most interesting was Seaview Survey, it had underwater Hangout live from the Great Barrier Reef. It's amazing to be able to see our great products like Hangouts be so successful. I recommend that all of you try Hangout soon. 
As Larry mentioned, we also launched Google Play, which provides users one place to find, enjoy and share apps, music, movies and books instantly anywhere across the Web and on the Android devices. To support the launch, we are on a 7 days to Play promotion, offering discounts and apps and media, and our YouTube video has received over 3 million viewers to date. Our partnership teams also kept its great work, supporting our products by being very close to our partners. For example, we launched Google Street View in Russia, which lets users walk around the historical centers of Moscow and St. Petersburg. And we are also thrilled that this quarter our Google Cultural Institute help bring Nelson Mandela's archives online. We expand our successful art project to include new museums from the Getty Museum in L.A. to the museums in Paris and Qatar. Project now provides access to more than 30,000 ultra-high resolution images, paintings, sculptures and photographs in 151 museums and other institutions in 40 countries. 
So in closing, I think Q1 was an excellent quarter. It has led us off to a very good start for 2012. We look forward to continuing to serve our users, customers and partners for the rest of 2012 and beyond. Also, I want to say thank you to all the Googlers and our global business team, all of our partners in the product and engineering teams that allow us to make these wonderful things happen and allow us to continue to drive the business. 
With that, thank you, and I'm going to hand you back to Patrick.",1893

First for Patrick. You mentioned the headcount growth was only about 600 this quarter. That's obviously slower than what you saw in 2011. Should we -- is this roughly the pace we should expect for 2012 or were there perhaps some timing factors? And then secondly for Larry, you talked about Google+ unifying the Google product. So when you think about things like Google Wallet and Offers, the mobile strategy maps, do you think of these as individual products or are they part of perhaps a broader local strategy? And if so, how do they fit together?",100

So look, I think that the headcount fluctuations, you'll remember last year when Larry said that we were at what was the kind of the edge of what was tolerable. And look, this short-term variability is actually the very best proof point that we don't manage kind of quarter-to-quarter and try to smooth things out. It just happens that in the first quarter, at this time of year, it's a bit different than when you come back in Q3 when you have all of the graduate students that actually start with us, so there's a bit of fluctuations there. So I wouldn't read that much into the numbers, but we're basically continuing to push on plan for hiring for this year.",140

I think we're working very hard, and I've talked a lot about this to make our Google experience be more unified and feel like one great experience for people. And many of the products you mentioned, Google Wallet, Offers, Maps, I mean, they apply kind of across many of the things we do. And so I think you'll see better integration of those products over -- through the rest of our products has already exist with Wallet, for example, across many different parts like Google Play and so on. And I think you'll see that increasingly happen over time just as we make these experiences better. They'll come up when you expect them to come up and when they make sense for users.

First, in terms of appealing to major brands, and Nikesh I think you talked about how you're seeing major brands engage more with YouTube and other assets. Could you talk about how you're trying to go after those dollars? Are there new things that you're doing now that you weren't doing 2 years ago to kind of accelerate that momentum? And then just real quickly on the mobile CPC issue. Can you just comment again on over time, over what period of time you would expect mobile and desktop CPCs to merge or do you think that's a realistic expectation? What would cause that to happen or not?",111

In terms of what we're doing differently, as I mentioned, YouTube has gone from being an interesting place where brands to be to being a must-buy. So we're seeing tremendous demand for inventory, which is brand related. And for the most part, the online world in the past has been more performance related i.e., people wanted to get some transactions, they wanted to get more people to their website. Now they're seeing the benefit of using the Web for brand affiliation and for brand recognition. So we are beginning to have a different sales pitch with the large brands, which is oriented towards them coming and getting their brands seen a little bit, and YouTube is a phenomenal tool in that regard, which acts sort of like an anchor property. Then we're able to package our demographic base inventory around the Google Display Network, around YouTube and actually get the brands to engage in the large campaigns, which can run the millions of dollars. This was a capability we couldn't have a few years ago because the inventory didn't exist or the demographic tools didn't exist. So clearly, this is a new space and a new sort of pitch to our brand advertisers. As I said, we are trying to light this up across our sales force around the world in 60 countries.",246

So Mark, I think that this one is -- think of it as so much upside for us because essentially mobile is exploding in query growth and the formats themselves are just adapting already a lot and from a relatively crude base to so much more in the future. So that you're absolutely right that right now they don't monetize as well because we're kind of in what search used to be in 2002, 2003, 2004. So as these formats kind of continue to get better and better, we'd expect much better performance on them.",107

I'll add something, Mark. I think the mobile CPCs -- I mean, people always spend their most effort on the major -- whatever the major source of traffic or revenue is, and those are growing really quickly, albeit currently, obviously, there's more on desktop. I think over time as a reverse, and I think that the ability to kind of on your mobile to do local kinds of transactions, to really easily communicate with people and to do the kind of capabilities you have on your mobile device. And the fact that you spend most of your money locally, I think that over time that may actually reverse and the CPCs action may get better. But I think we're very bullish about that. We're making a lot of investments in that area, in things like Offers and so on and Wallet. And we're very, very excited about the potential there, and also Click-to-Call and other things that we do. So I think, for example, it's a lot easier to call someone from your mobile than it is from your computer right now. And so if that's how you're relying for transactions, actually mobile CPC should be higher for that. So I think you just haven't seen the focus on it and we're moving more and more focused on to that, both on our sales side and our customers are moving focus onto that, but I'm very, very bullish on that.",243

Without getting into too much detail, at a high level, what types of projects is Google working on that would really surprise us? And are you remaining committed to the 70/20/10 rule where these noncore areas might get only 10% of the investment? And then separately, just on the google.com TAC, please, that continues to increase as a percentage of Google revenue. Is most of that coming from payments to mobile partners? And given the growth of mobile, should we expect that to continue to increase meaningfully?",117

Look, on TAC, if you look at our percentages -- as a percentage of revenue year-over-year, I mean it's basically stable. I mean, it moves a little bit here and there and you have partner mix and FX mix between mobile and others, but it's not actually changing in any dramatic way. So what you have to see in there is just the regular mix of both traffics and partners that come in and out all the time as well, so that I wouldn't read too much into that. I'll let Larry answer the real sexy question.",121

I should have, that's a good addition. So we definitely still see a -- most of our resources should be going to our core businesses, which really Search and Ads and a few of those things I mentioned that's really fallen to that core, I think. And then there's 20% kind of near things and maybe another 10% on the really speculative things. Through our whole history, we've really struggled this and have 10% kind of on the speculative things. Generally, it's much lower than that. I think the real thing that's needed on those projects is some management. Those take up bandwidth. You saw our announcements of Google Glass last week, which I was very excited to go out. You've seen the driver with his car kinds of things. And it does our take our executive time to deal with those things and so on, and so I think that's the real investment we make rather than being huge amounts of dollars on those kinds of things generally. We've got a limited number of things we can do. As I've been saying, we've been trying to focus. So trying to make sure that we have the right speculative bets as well as the right bets we're making on our core products and so on. And I'm pretty excited about our ability to do that. And I think it's hard coming from the outside because I mentioned in the letter I published today that Android took 3 years, plus 3 years kind of to really get to where it is today. That's 6 years, and you all haven't seen android, right, for those 6 years. We've seen it for those 6 years and we really invested in it. It's not so much money at the earlier stages, but attention. And that's an important, I think, discipline for the company to have.",323

I think that you have a combination of international factors. You have a combination of new formats. Ad formats drive a lot in terms of paid clicks. If you think of even the sitelinks' extensions that we've -- like we have a new generation of sitelinks for this quarter, right? This is a perfect example of a product where by adding additional lines that are more targeted, so instead of having just kind of, trucks or -- and then you go down into the second layer, right, you have less CPC for that additional sitelinks. But if it's a better ad, people click a ton more on them. So it is really all of those 5 factors that actually drive them. And that's why we're continuing to kind of be pretty happy with the health of the net effect, which is real growth. Certainly, internationally, I mean it also -- you can see our mix between international and non-international. And that's driving it as well. So you have all these factors at play. And we're pretty happy with what we're doing there.",205

We don't give the breakdown of our U.S. cash. We do it kind of irregularly, so we haven't done so of late. We have -- we continue to have a very strong cash balance, both U.S. and international. You'll notice, if you go into the details of our cash balance and on our balance sheet, right, we have just slightly under $2 billion of sec lending programs. So when you really, really look at our net cash balance, you got to take that sec lending out because it's on both sides of the balance sheet. But for the rest of it, incredibly healthy cash balance, both domestic and international. And Nikesh, do you want to give a quick update on the mobile CPCs and their mix?",134

I mean, again, I'm not going to talk about specific of the TAC on mobile. But as you know, we get people using our devices both organically as well as through our distribution partnerships with carriers and OEMs. And typically, the OEMs and carriers participate in some of the economics that are on the Android marketplace or Google Play and some of them participate in the economics around Google Search just the way we would do syndication on the Web platform, which you do with many partners around the world. We have similar deals on the mobile front. I think in the mix, it comes out. This sort of washes out and it sort of adds up into our number which we show in -- our total number of green desktop and mobile. But mobile is no different from the way the desktop business operates out there.",148

I think the -- this is Larry, and I think it's a very good question. And I think one of the things actually had in my remarks when I took out was to talk a little bit about Search and just enough time to put it all in. And I actually covered the question you're asking. I think one of the most amazing things I think we can do today that we couldn't do even a few months ago is to really -- I have this friend Ben Smith, right, who's a person at Google. He has kind of a common name. Now when I do a search actually, it finds the right person and it puts him in the search box. So for the first time, the search box isn't really doing searching a string, just the sequence of letters. It's actually searching for that person that I know. Now it's not, obviously not all the searches you do, but being able to search for people well is important. And knowing -- having real feedback from users about what they like and don't like and things they're sharing and so on is very useful for search. And we have a lot of those signals already, but we can always use more signals. We can always use better relevance and we can always use more data to generate that. So I think it is very important. I think it's not -- think social data about identity and ability to easily share things with other people and comment on them and things like that is a basic utility for people in all of our products. And that's where I was talking about Google+ really working across all of Google for identity and sharing and notification and other things that it does really well. So that all applies to Search and I think it's important for Search. I think search is going to change a lot. We're going to make it a lot better over the next 5 or 10 years as it's changed a lot in the past. And it will include a bunch of those signals and a bunch of other things as well.",371

And for the time being, we really believe that, that strategic asset has a ton of value.

And we think that's an important component of what we're doing. I think there's also -- obviously, there's been a lot of success on some lower-priced tablets that run Android, maybe not the full Google version of Android.

And then Patrick, obviously, higher in CapEx in Q1 this year, a lot lower than Q1 last year. Can you tell us if you factor in your revenue growth when you make that spending decision, your outlook?

Look, it's lumpy because there's just timing decisions, right. We would -- there's probably a few areas where we would have like to actually make investments in Q1 and for a bunch of logistics reasons or otherwise, we couldn't. And so -- and you'll notice that's why there's kind of like $350 million difference between Q4 and Q1. And you should just expect it to be lumpy and that's just the nature of -- data centers are kind of big and clunky. And when you buy some piece of real estate, it's big and clunky. So there is quite a bit of variability into it. But we're -- again, I wouldn't take any one data point to start making a trend out of. So it's tough for, but I think that you can see we're committed to capital. If you look at the last couple of years, we've really made kind of significant investments and we'll continue to do them because it's a real strategic asset to us as well.

We don't get very many new operating systems, kind of only a few in my lifetime, and I think they're pretty important. And I think Android's really about increasing the pace of innovation, usage of mobile devices and our ability to get a great user experiences out to our users, which I think we're doing a great job of. I mentioned over 850,000 devices per day are going out. And it's important to remember we're very early stages of that like we've only -- I'm amazed the computer that I'm carrying in my pocket is as good as the one I had a few years ago on my desktop. And I think we're only at the very, very early stages of what's possible with those devices. And I'm excited about a whole bunch of things we're doing in that area. We already mentioned kind of things like I said I'm very bullish about CPCs will improve on mobile over desktop due to all those capabilities. And so I think the benefits we get from Android are a lot. I mean, obviously, we have great integration with our products and Search and Google+ and photo uploading and there's a hundred things that we do really well on Android that benefit us across the board and across our users across the board and our products across the board. And I think that's going to continue to be the case. And I think it does lead to better economics for us too because we're providing amazing experiences for people that are well integrated and work well and they demand.

I think the -- I mean, like I said, I think it's an important area. I think your computing experience, obviously, if you have an Android phone or use Google a lot online or you care about all those things in terms of your experience. And so I think you're thinking about your user experience. You're thinking about across all the devices use. I think people are going to get a lot more devices. We see kind of a convergence between all the services on those devices. And right now, I feel like each device you got is kind of a hassle the deal with and you're thinking about each individual device and all the issues with it. And I think that's not really right. I think you're going to have a pretty unified experience and a great experience from a user point of view and you won't have to manage all these devices.

So they way we think about it is that we try and go ahead and get more and more advertisers to see the benefit of online advertising and the solutions that we offer. So as more and more advertisers come into the auction, it drives the price up of the auction for both large and small advertisers. And the way to think about it is that there's a price as we talked about CPCs and paid clicks, but it's really the third variable that goes into it, how many advertisers can we bring into the auction and how many various things can we get them interested in, whether it's mobile, whether it's YouTube, whether it's Display, whether it's Search. So there has been a lot of effort we have put in from our end, both to get more small business online. We've been adding GXBO campaigns around the world where we get small businesses online. We've also been cleaning up our signup flows for our adverts products, which is a self-served product where really small business can sign up. We have been working on getting people to have more mobile sites and getting people out in the mobile campaign. So effectively, it's a lot of effort towards getting more and more advertisers into the ecosystem. And as that happens around the world, you will see seasonal patterns or some sort of spikes when we work harder on small businesses in one quarter in certain parts of the world. But eventually, it all benefits the auction and we see the trend over time ends up working the same way for large and small advertisers.",306

It seems like even though as you're shifting to mobile, you have this presumably double-digit pricing step down for CPCs. But in the Display world, certainly, that pricing difference could be even more dramatic. In some cases, by half or 2/3. Prices getting cut on that shift to mobile. And so you guys at Google have the unique ability to compare and contrast the difference in price between like Search and Display and how the 2 are monetizing relative to desktop. And so any color on that comparison would be appreciated because I think there are folks out there that have a view that actually Search, core Search, monetizes better on that shift to mobile than Display does, and I would love to just understand that better.",138

So what we're striving towards is advertisers are interested in ROI. Advertisers actually are not interested in whether they're on the mobile product, the Display product, the Search product on the Web or the Search product on mobile. So what we are fast converging towards is we're basically sitting down and understanding ROI targets of our advertisers. And then we have immense amounts of inventory at our behest, whether it's mobile inventory, on Display or Search or desktop inventory or even inventory to our network. And what we are trying to work towards is being able to dynamically allocate across these various products, what allows them to get the maximum ROI. In that case, they are sort of -- they don't really care about whether they got that transaction to happen off one platform, one format or the other. So that's what we want to aspire, and that works really well in performance advertising because there is a specific objective the advertiser has. On Display, on brand, it works slightly differently, obviously, because you're talking about CPMs. But generally, that's the way to think about it. In the long term, we think mobile will monetize better. And we usually don't see the difference happening on Display and Search as you alluded to. Larry, you want to add something?",236

So please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases, as well as the supplementary slides that accompany the call. This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website later today. 
Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we'll make today may be considered forward-looking including statements regarding Google's future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.

Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results. 
Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this call, such as operating income and operating margin, are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation. We have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. 
With that, I will turn the call to Patrick.",310
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2012",2012-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3615.0,328503.0,15879681.0,Presenter Speech,Patrick Pichette,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Willa, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. So -- well, this is a special call, as we enter into a new chapter in our history at Google here with our recent acquisition of Motorola, and with it comes a new set of financial information for all of you, both at the consolidated, but also at the segment level. 
So speaking of Motorola, it's worth noting that given the recent close of the transaction, we can expect this specific segment of our financials to continue to show some accounting variability. So for example, this quarter, it's a stub period, so meaning, it only reflects the results since the acquisition date rather than the full quarter. And as a result of the close, we did a number of accounting adjustments typical for such transactions. So we'll try to do our best to answer your questions on this call, and our Investor Relations team will also continue to support the analyst and investor community during this transition. 
So now let's quickly cover our consolidated result, as well as segmented reporting for both Google and Motorola. Our gross total consolidated revenue grew 35% year-over-year to $12.2 billion and 15% quarter-over-quarter. So again, please remember that these total consolidated numbers include a stub period for Motorola. Additionally, there was a significant year-over-year currency headwind in Q2. In fixed FX, revenue would have grown to 39% year-over-year instead of 35%. Google, on a stand-alone gross revenue, grew 21% year-over-year to $11 billion and 3% quarter-over-quarter. Our Google website revenue was up 21% year-over-year to $7.5 billion and 3% quarter-over-quarter, which trends across most major geographies and verticals. Google Network revenue grew 20% year-over-year to $3 billion and 2% quarter-over-quarter. Our other revenue line grew by 42% year-over-year to $439 million and 5% quarter-over-quarter. It's again worth noting that in fixed FX, our revenue would have grown 25% year-over-year. 
Motorola grew revenue for the stub period since May 22 at $1.3 billion. Our mobile devices revenue for that period was $843 million, encouraged by the strength of the North American Verizon franchise, driven by the RAZR MAXX sales, although we've seen also weaker revenues that were driven by the declining international sales of feature phones and mid-tier smartphones. The home business revenue was $407 million. 
So the core metrics of Google's stand-alone business continue to perform very well against the backdrop of a somewhat difficult global economic environment. Our global aggregate paid click growth was very strong, up 42% year-over-year and also up 1% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate cost-per-click growth was down 16% year-over-year and up 1% quarter-over-quarter. And please remember that the currency headwinds also, obviously, had a quite negative impact on the CPCs in Q2. 
Turning to geographic performance of Google stand-alone business, the U.S., U.K. and rest of world are growing at a good pace as reflected in our results. In our earnings slides, which you'll find in our Investor Relation website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits of our hedging program, so please refer to those slides for those exact calculation. 
Revenue from the U.S. was up 20% year-over-year to $5 billion. Our non-U.S. revenue accounted for 54% of our total revenue or $6 billion and was up 22% year-over-year, which includes an $81 million benefit from our hedging program. The U.K. was up 20% year-over-year to $1.2 billion. And in fixed FX term, in fact, the U.K. grew 23%. Coming back to an aggregate level for the total consolidated business, other cost of revenue was $2.3 billion in Q2. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $3.3 billion, which excludes stock-based compensation and charges related to the severance and benefit arrangements in connection with the Motorola acquisition of $652 million. Our non-GAAP operating profit was $4 billion in Q2, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 32.3%. 
For stand-alone Google, our traffic acquisition costs were $2.6 billion or 24.7% of total advertising revenue. Our other cost of revenue was $1.3 billion, and that's excluding SBC of $82 million. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $3.1 billion, also excluding SBC of $470 million. 
Finally, non-GAAP operating profit was $4 billion in Q2, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 36.4%. This continued strong margin in our stand-alone Google business segment gives us the confidence to continue to fully fund our many strategic growth areas, such as Mobile, Android, YouTube and Chrome. Obviously, Susan and Nikesh will go into more details of our initiatives in a minute. 
At Motorola, our non-GAAP operating expenses, including cost of revenue for the stub period, were $1.3 billion. And keep in mind that intangible amortization of expenses and the step-up costs attributed to standalone Google and Motorola are included in these non-GAAP measures. And as a result, the non-GAAP operating loss at Motorola was minus $38 million in Q2 resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of minus 3% for that specific segment. 
Headcount increased roughly 21,500 in Q2. Obviously, Google itself added about 1,200, while the remainder of this number includes the Motorola employees who joined in the acquisition. In total, the consolidated company ended the quarter at around 54,600 employees -- full time employees, that is. 
Our effective tax rate was 19% in Q2, and that reflects not only the mix of earnings between domestic, international subsidiaries and our hedges, but also capital gains offset by carried over capital losses. 
Let me quickly turn to cash management. Other income and expenses was $254 million for the quarter, which reflects gains related to a divestiture of our business, offset somewhat by lower interest income and by the impact of our FAS 133 expenses from our hedging program. For more details on OI&E, please again refer to the slides that accompany our call on our IR website. 
Operating cash flow was very strong at $4.3 billion for the second quarter. CapEx for the quarter was $774 million versus last quarter at $607 million. The majority of our CapEx was spent really related to production equipment, facilities and land purchases. And obviously, we're pleased with our free cash flow, which was $3.5 billion. 
So now let me hand it over to Nikesh, who will cover more details of our business performance in the quarter, then Susan will cover our product highlights, and then finally, we'll open up the lines for your questions. And please note that Nikesh and Susan will discuss only the stand-alone Google business and not cover Motorola. 
So let me turn it over to Nikesh.",1096
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2012",2012-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3615.0,328503.0,15879682.0,Presenter Speech,Nikesh Arora,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Patrick, and hello, everyone. Our business had a very strong quarter, as you've heard, with over $11 billion in revenue. 
I'm going to talk about 3 broad themes today: First, how our recent big bets in the ad business are coming together into integrated platforms. I think digital advertising is really in defrag mode. Secondly, we'll take a look under the hood at how our investments in Search advertising and ads quality are helping our Search business accelerate. And third, we're going to talk a bit about our enterprise business, which I believe is reaching a real tipping point. Then I'll discuss some ways we are driving success for our customers and some marketing highlights. 
So first, our big bets. In about 4 years, DoubleClick has gone from strength-to-strength at Google, now it is the foundation of our Display business. This quarter, we announced DoubleClick digital marketing, the first modern ad platform for the modern digital world. This was the biggest ever overhaul of our DoubleClick ad platform. It is used by thousands of agencies and marketeers, and we manage billions in marketing spend across the world on this platform. It now spans the best of display, rich media, exchange buying, search and measurement. 
Two of our recent Display acquisitions, Teracent and Invite Media, which both grew by over 50% last year, are also seamlessly integrated into this platform. At the same time, Admeld, which we acquired, is helping provide publishers control, flexibility and more revenue opportunities. 
Our Display platform helps direct response and brand [ph] marketeers navigate the whole web. For brands, this quarter, we unveiled the Brand Activate initiative, a series of measurement and planning solutions baked directly into our platform, with our partners building an online measurement for GRPs, or gross rating points, and a way to measure vehicle impressions. Effectively, what we want to do is we want to drive more and more advertising dollars in the brand space, and this platform's going to be an effective way for us build to that. Recently, in Cannes, at a big advertising festival, creative agencies loved Project Re: Brief. This was one of our demos of the possibilities of how, in modern digital marketing, you can use multiple media formats to make advertising successful. That is quite a change from 2004 when our 4-line text ads weren't quite as exciting. 
Another big bet that's part of our integrated solutions is YouTube. I think in 2007, it was when newspapers frequently said YouTube is groping for an effective business model. I think we can declare we found our model. The YouTube now unites the world through video, from the human rights channel launched this quarter to a Pew study confirming YouTube as a major global news platform, and for the first time, YouTube will be powering NBC's live streaming of the Olympics in the U.S. while also live streaming the games in London to 64 territories around the world. 
Daily account sign-ups have doubled year-over-year and users uploading over 72 hours of video every minute. This quarter, we released a new YouTube app for Android, helping users to find videos and follow channels from a mobile or tablet device. We believe YouTube is now a proven winner for the whole video ecosystem. Thousands of partners are making 6 figures, and we're proud to work with major record labels and Hollywood studios on this platform. 
In fact, earlier in May, we threw an incredible digital upfront event, Brandcast, highlighting our YouTube programing partners. Slightly over 1,300 clients attended. Some of the world’s biggest advertises were there, and they're making significant commitments on YouTube, including people like Unilever, AT&T and American Express. If you're counting, that's 5 successful acquisitions, well integrated, and helping us succeed in the advertising space. 
The sixth is AdMob, which helps power our mobile ads, both across Android and iOS and other mobile platforms in the future. AdMob was integrated this quarter into AdWords. This has further turbocharged our ability to provide in-app advertising. That's more 1 million advertisers with 300,000 mobile apps and 350 million devices at their fingertips. 
The growth of the businesses with mobile websites is stunning. Last quarter, we rolled out GoMo, which is short for Go Mobile. That initiative was rolled out in 8 new countries, including Germany, Japan and Brazil. Mobile-friendly websites are vital for modern businesses and very important for our mobile Search business. In less than 1 year, the number of AdWords advertisers with mobile sites have doubled. 
Another major upgrade to Google Analytics was made for mobile apps and a new AdMob SDK for developers started out an awesome quarter. For us, mobile is like desktop was in 1999. Smart marketers are creating great ROI and we are developing native ad models that generate results for them. For example, we've had 15 million monthly calls for our click-to-call format exclusively available on mobile devices in the U.S. 
Let's talk about my second theme, the secret sauce of Search advertising. This quarter showed why we are so optimistic about Search's continued growth. You know about some factors that drive Search, they were all moved to digital media and new Search ad formats. But I think we often underestimate one factor that you don't often read about, the amount of effort our product engineering teams put into the quality and precision of our ads, and that just keeps getting better. This quarter, we made 72 quality improvements and launched greater option transparency for Search advertisers. Effectively, what this does, it improves the relevance of our ads and making it more useful to consumers. It drives better results for our partners, clients and advertisers, and it helps improve monetization. Imagine if every single Search ad was the perfect answer, that drove a conversion for the customer. I think that's the objective that our teams are aiming for. 
In Q2, our improvements included better triggering of site links in ads and improved ad rotation system, better geographical targeting, expanded match for key word variance and a whole host of other improvements. As an example of benefits of these changes, the advertiser is taking advantage of new close variance feature, an exact and phrase matching, are seeing roughly a 2% increase in clicks on average.
Let's talk about the third theme. Let's acknowledge where we are in our Enterprise business. I think it's become clear for us that we have a serious, small but growing business, which is going to be a future growth engine for Google. I hope you read this week about a company who said competition was 50% more expensive than Google and not as cool. That company is now a $200,000 a year Google Apps customer. Companies, schools, governments worldwide are moving to the cloud faster than ever. More than 5 million businesses have now gone Google worldwide, with traction amongst large organizations even such as the U.S. Department of Interior, Fairfax Media in Australia, et cetera. I think it's fair, you can't fake a commitment to cloud computing, and we've invested to build and scale the business that has gone from upstart to upper crust. Thousands of businesses switched to Google Apps from our competitors every day. 
Recently, we've launched products like Google Drive, Google Maps Coordinate, as well as the ability to edit documents off-line and in a whole range of mobile devices and tablets. That just shows you the pace of innovation that Google is bringing to the business technology. With over 1 million active applicants of App Engine and the recent launch of Compute Engine, our cloud platform, that makes Google's infrastructure directly available to developers and businesses. 
Let's change gears. Let's talk about countries and how our performance was across the world. Across all products, growth in the Americas and Asia was steady relative to the first quarter. The U.S. and Canada remain strong, Southern Europe slowed slightly as it was hampered by poor macroeconomic and overall ad industry conditions, notably Spain. On the other hand, performance accelerated in Europe driven by the U.K. Our clients span a full range of industries that are making the web work for their business. Let's take a few examples, take the hotel and travel sector. In France, we worked with Accor to revamp and improve their Search investment allocation across 23 countries. In Denmark, top traveler site, Momondo shifted some of their TV budgets to YouTube and other Google branding solutions. 
We're particularly proud about our achievements in the automotive sector from Detroit to Bavaria. This quarter's highlights included a contact with Tesla and a marquee deal with Audi to embed Google Earth in all of their cars. In Canada, we partnered with Ford around online video content and GM and Toyota is investing significantly in YouTube. 
Switching gears to our agency partners, they are leading the charge in the digital era. I think we have the best relationships with agencies around the world than we've ever had before, and we are being able to move those relationships to real partnerships that allows them to work with their customers to make the web work for them. I'm particularly proud of the work this quarter with our agency partner, Starcom MediaVest Group, to develop a global joint account planning project to gross 50 top accounts. We launched a digital training curriculum covering Google products and digital trends, and we are able to train over 8,000 people. 
Both these sectors are good examples, but our partnerships permeate all industries and across all countries. Spanish health insurance, Sanitas, made a major investment in Search, and that has become our most efficient channel for customer acquisition online, accounting for about 25% to 30% of their new customers. 
In France, Danone is working with us on a global initiative across our Display and YouTube products, so is U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturer, Shire, Intel and China shows AdMob for a cross-platform campaign on Android and iOS because of the reset Admeld provides them and the seamless solutions we offer. And in Sweden, H&M is using Google+ social extension for Search advertising. Not only does it increase traffic, but it also gives them a large number of engaged followers. They've increased their click-through rate in AdWords because of that by an average of 22%. 
Let's talk briefly about marketing. Marketing is a key focus for our consumer products. And speaking about Google+, our marketing team continues to do a phenomenal job supporting our investments there. That's the plus campaign that's now in the U.S., U.K., Japan and Germany and is helping connect communities in Google+. Just this quarter, we organized Hangouts with diverse groups from Sir Richard Branson to the NBA to UEFA. As I mentioned, the Cannes Lion Festival, I'm particularly proud, not only are we providing great marketing solutions to our partners and our customers, our own marketing team received 2 Grand Prix awards, one for Project Re: Brief where we worked with Coca-Cola to take an old ad and make it relevant to the digital media space; and two, for our U.K. Voice Search campaign. But not only that, they brought back 25 additional awards, 5 golds, 8 silvers, 12 bronze, our own mini Olympics. That's our marketing team showing that innovation permeates everything we do. 
I'll leave you with 2 final examples that show the diversity of Google's partnerships. In France, this quarter, we move forward with a commercial relationship with SNE, which effectively represents French publishers to put out-of-print books into Google Play for Android. This helps user more easily access this material and enables publishers to generate additional revenue for their content. And second, from the sublime French literary tradition to the even more sublime Doodle 4 Google contest. Our U.S. winner was Wisconsin's second-grader Dylan Hoffman, who in May beat a record 114,000 school children from 48 states. His school earned a $50,000 technology grant and Dylan's doodle graced the Google homepage for a day. 
I think Dylan is not listening to this call, but if he is, he's had a pretty successful second quarter as well. So congratulations and thanks to Dylan, his family and his school from Googlers all around the world, and thanks to all the Googlers that allowed us to have such a wonderful quarter. 
I'm going to hand over to Susan now.",2051
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2012",2012-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3615.0,328503.0,15879683.0,Presenter Speech,Susan Wojcicki,,Executives,4,"Thanks, Nikesh. We also had a busy and productive second quarter for all of our consumer products. Let me start with Search. Our goal is to deliver technology that just works. Larry has described the perfect Search engine as something that understands exactly what you mean and gives you back exactly what you want. We've made a start towards more intelligent Search thanks to the Knowledge Graph, which understands real-world things that are defining characteristics and their connections to one another. 
Our Knowledge Graph currently includes more than 500 million things, people and places, more than 3.5 billion facts about them. This includes entities like landmarks, celebrities, sports teams, works of art and a lot more. By summarizing related content all in one place, people not only find what they're looking for, but they also make unexpected discoveries. 
For example, I was making plans this weekend, so I searched for the movie, The Dark Knight Rises. From the Knowledge Graph results that showed up on the right-hand side of my Search results, I was able to find out that the movie's coming out tomorrow, some information about the film and which actors star in it. Since I didn't recognize all of the actors, I clicked on the photos displayed, and I was able to see biographical information, as well as other movies they had been in. The Knowledge Graph results also showed me related movies that other people had searched for. I discovered a number of movies, including movies scheduled to come out later this year and next year, that I also want to see. 
The Knowledge Graph also works great on mobile. If you Voice Search for Julia Roberts' movies on your phone, you will see a list of her latest films in the Search results. And if you're running an Android device with Jelly Bean, our latest Android release, Google will actually say the list of movies back to you, powered by the Knowledge Graph in addition to giving you the traditional Search results. 
Also on Android, we introduced Google Now, a feature that intelligently brings you the right information at the right time just before you even ask for it. For example, one morning last week, Google Now told me that my commute would take 15 minutes longer than normal based on current traffic. All my excuses for being late are now gone. I didn't have to do anything. The information just showed up as a notification. Google Now also shows me other things I may care about like weather, driving directions to my next appointment, cool places nearby, flight updates and scores for my favorite sports teams. 
As you can see, we're serious about providing more intelligent results. We're moving beyond a Search engine that just matches strings of words to one that understands the people, the world the way people do. Just as the Knowledge Graph connects real world things, Google+ is a social spine that is starting to connect everything across Google. With the new Google+ local feature, accessible from desktop and mobile on Maps, Search and Google+, users can find and share nearly 100 million places and local businesses like restaurants and museums. Users can make decisions about where they want to go based on Zagat scores, summaries and reviews from friends and people they trust who are on Google+. Once they've decided where to go, they can use the new Events tab in Google+ to plan their activity and to share photos and comments before, during and after the event. 
We've also redesigned the Google+ app for both Android and iOS, and we recently announced a Google+ experience for Google -- for Android tablets and the iPad. More users are now accessing Google+ for mobile devices than from desktops. To date, 250 million users have upgraded to Google+, meaning they've signed up for Google+ and created a profile. We're excited about this momentum, but we know it's still early days as people build a community on Google+. 
Moving on to shopping. This is another area where we're helping people more quickly turn their intentions into actions. In May, we announced a new commercial model built on Product Listing Ads. It's called Google Shopping, and our transition to the new model will be complete in the fall in the U.S. By having a commercial relationship with merchants, we believe consumers will see more reliable and up-to-date information about prices and product availability and merchants should receive higher-quality traffic to their sites. 
We're also experimenting with new commercial formats on google.com that have product summaries and larger product images. These new formats are clearly labeled sponsors, and they help shoppers more easily find and compare different products or refine their searches by brand or product type. Try searching for camping tents to see an example of these new results. Users can find special offers and deals with Google Shopping and can shop with confidence when they see a Google-trusted store badge on a retailer site. 
On the platform side, we have a lot of key announcements and launches at our Google I/O developer conference. Let me give a quick summary of the highlights. We announced 1 million new Android devices are being activated each day with more than 400 million devices now activated worldwide. We showed off Jelly Bean, our latest version of Android and the Nexus 7, our tablet that's built for Google Play. More than 20 billion apps have been downloaded from Google Play. We announced that Chrome has 310 million users worldwide, which is up from 160 million last May. We brought Chrome for Android out of beta, and we introduced Chrome for iOS, which became the most popular free app in the Apple App Store within hours of its availability. 
We launched our new infrastructure service product called Google Compute Engine, which lets developers and businesses run Linux virtual machines on the same infrastructure that powers Google. Google Documents became editable off-line, and we announced Google Drive for iOS. Drive is a place to create, share and store all your content. It's available even without an Internet connection. And it functions across Windows, Mac, Android, Chrome OS now iOS. 
We released 3D cityscapes in Google Earth for mobile, announced that travelers with an Android device can now access off-line maps of more than 150 countries and expanded our Street View maps, our Street View feature in Google Maps to provide panoramic imagery in more than 3,000 cities across 40 countries. 
And then, of course, there was Sergey's surprise demo of Google Glass with a live video Hangout with skydivers wearing Google Glass and jumping out of an airship nearly a mile above downtown San Francisco and then landing on the roof of the I/O conference center. To see this demo for yourself, you can search on project glass demo on YouTube. I definitely recommend this video.

First, on Motorola. The comments at the time of the acquisition was that it would be accretive. Do you still feel that, that asset can be, and any thoughts you would give us, as to how you would make what has been pretty consistently a loss-leading asset that's Motorola mobile, how you make that accretive? And then a product question on Search, and what do you find in terms of the appetite with the interest in Voice Search? Google's had a Voice Search capability for a while, but as you've noticed, over time have people more interested in using that less the quality of that versus whatever regular Search? How interesting do you think that is as a growth area for Google in the future of Voice Search?",131

On the question of Motorola, look, we're totally excited about this opportunity that we have at Motorola. And our management team has been there only a few weeks. Clearly, everybody should expect some changes at Motorola that we have already talked about in the public domain. And when we said -- Dennis and the management team is there resetting and retooling it. But we have nothing really to announce right now. I think we have to let them do their work, but I can tell you, there's a palpable excitement in MMI for all the employees but also for the plans. So I just want to come back, Mark, to your point on accounting. If you actually took out the accounting issues that were related to closing the transaction, whether it'd be the stub period, the amortization of intangibles and some of the adjustments that were related to the acquisition, in fact, on the mobile side, they didn't have a -- they had a pretty stable and good quarter. There's a lot of accounting noise on the data side, so I think it's going to take 1 or 2 quarters before all that noise comes out. Susan, do you want to comment on the Voice Search?",223

Yes, so I mean Voice Search has been an area that Google has been investing in for a number of years. We believe like we have really good technology here because we've invested for so long on this. And as I mentioned, in my -- when I talked beforehand, now with the Jelly Bean release, we have the ability not only to ask a question, but also to have the answers given back to you. And so I definitely recommend that you test that out. It is very powerful, and we think in the right circumstances, users will want to -- some users will want to type and some users will want to have voice. And so in the circumstances where they do, we've developed a really amazing technology that is leading edge on that.",136

You talked a little bit about some of the accounting noise, Patrick, and it doesn't sound like it's finalized yet, but I was wondering if you could give us a rough sense of the purchase price allocation in terms of the hard assets versus goodwill versus other intangibles so we can sort through some of that noise. And the second part is, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the Motorola Home business in terms of how that fits in, if you guys consider that strategic.",102

So on the details of the purchase price, we haven't given in terms of the asset and obviously, the IR team can follow up with you on that. But in -- I think in our disclosures, the press release and the like, you will see, like for example, intangibles was $30-some million in the case of Motorola and $32 million, I believe, for Google, just on intangibles. So it gives you a sense of the numbers for the stub period. As it relates to the home business, I mean, again, a bit of the same story that I told Mark prior, which is, we've just got into the place, and we are in the process of evaluating every business of MMI and every division of it. So it's a little bit too early for us to comment on big changes right now, so I just need a bit of patience for us to complete our homework as we've been there just for a few weeks.",166

On mobile, have you conducted any studies on the impact of mobile adoption on Search query demand by end-users? Any do you have a perspective on what portion of mobile queries are incremental versus cannibalistic for handsets and tablets? And on YouTube, I think 1 or 2 quarters ago, Nikesh referred to Google Analytics as the unsung hero of the business.

I mean, we've spent a lot of time looking at that to try and understand how those 2 different types of devices and how those searches interact with each other. And this is very complicated, but I will say, we believe that mobile searches are mostly incremental. For example, on weekends, when users are out and about, we usually see a rise in mobile activity. And then when users come back on Monday, we see a rise at desktop. So although it's not a 1 for 1, we do believe that they are mostly incremental.",97

If you're talking about performance advertisers, they're able to look at ROI on YouTube versus other performance media on the online space. I guess I wanted to just say when you're talking about brands, because brand is not just about the online space, brand is also about the television space. And we've done some very exciting things with single-source panels where we work in Germany with thousands of users and try to look at advertising effectiveness and efficiency, not just on YouTube and online video, but also compare that to television. And we're incorporating that into our analytics and our sales pitches to show how the ROI is available on YouTube.

It's got a lot of really compelling features from security being very fast, and we continue to expect to see growth just because of the users using it for the different features that are -- make it a really great product. From the other things, the self-driving cars and Google Glass, I mean, those continue to be projects that, from a headcount perspective, are very -- are small.

You've previously referenced the talent war last year increased cash compensation by 10%. I was just wondering, given the transition of a number of companies that you compete with for talent and to the public markets, could you just give an updated view on the cost and availability of talent in the valley? And then secondly, on the last 12 months basis, Google's generated $12.5 billion in unlevered free cash, so you now have an 8% unlevered free cash yield, and you're generating cash at a run rate that equates to about 30% of the current cash position.

We continue -- and I know that I sound a bit like  a broken record on this, but on a very regular basis, we actually debated with our board. And our cash position is really a strategic asset to us given all of the innovation that's happening and all of the options that are available to us. I mean, it has been such a -- you just take Motorola, which we just closed, I mean, it was a real strategic asset to us to actually be able to pounce. So we haven't changed our position in terms of share repurchases or our dividends or any of the others for the time being, which does not mean we don't evaluate. We do take a good look at it. We just think that it continues to be a strategic asset for us, and so that's why we haven't changed our position of yet. In the case of the talent, I think that the valley continues to be hot. I mean, it is a hotbed of innovation. There's a lot of need for that talent, especially at the very high -- the engineering front, and we're delighted by our strategy. I mean, we continue to see really benchmark levels for our retention purposes, and we continue to attract the very best talents. So for us, it is an absolute strategic asset again for the company. I mean, Googlers, the engineers that are here and the sales people, and they really make a huge difference to the velocity of the company. So the valley has not changed. It continue -- despite everything else that's going on in the world out there, the valley continues to be absolutely hot, and we're so pleased to have seen our strategy pay out so well.",307

Well I think the good news is that we're seeing phenomenal growth in the mobile queries across the board, whether it's tablets, whether it's mobile phones, whether it's geographical or where we are seeing phenomenal amounts of mobile queries across the board. I think, as I said, mobile is, right now, where Search was in 1999. We had a situation where Susan's team was doing phenomenal product innovation to keep driving more and more efficiency for the advertisers. We were working with advertisers to get them to get better landing pages, better sites, get them to understand truly the opportunities on the mobile space for example. You can make phone calls, so we have a product called Click-to-Call. Now the Search takes on a whole different meaning because there's a better conversion when people actually click and make phone calls. So, yes, we are seeing mobile CPCs are healthy, and we expect them in the long term that they will continue to be healthy and sort of follow this trajectory that Search has followed. More inventory, more effectiveness, more ROI for the advertisers, better pricing in the market. In terms of your second question with Nexus 7, I think we have made tremendous amounts of headway in the content space. We have a lot, lot of content in Google Play. We're working very closely with the music industry, with Hollywood studios, et cetera, to get more and more content to the platforms. And I think given that there are models out there where other people are offering content to the platforms, it is becoming pretty standard that you can have the ability to offer content to the end user. And we are making tremendous amounts of progress across the board.",296

Just one more thing I would add, Doug, on your question about the mobile CPCs and the percentage that are bidding is, a lot of our campaign structures are set up so that when an advertiser participates and they bid, they actually bid -- they can set up one campaign and it can run across everything. And we adjust those prices dynamically for them. We have -- it's called smart pricing, and so some advertisers do bid specifically on mobile and then some advertisers have bundled campaigns, and we adjust those prices.

So TAC, it's really a mix, right? It's -- obviously, TAC reflects a mix of different distribution methods that include toolbars, Chrome distribution, mobile distribution and also, obviously, the AFS business as well. So there's the -- if you look at our revenue mix between Google properties and network, right, network was attached stronger so that will drive TAC as well. And then mobile is also one of these contributing factors. So we don't break down all the specifics, but it's not only mobile. I mean, we have a number of factors that are at play here.

Southern Europe, we saw a slight dip, as we think it is hampered both by pure macroeconomic conditions and overall ad industry concerns. Spain was a notable sort of lowlight or highlight depending on which way you look at it in that conversation. On the other hand, performance accelerated for us in Northern Europe, driven by the U.K. And U.K. has been a little depressed over the last few quarters, so it is finally coming back and sort of we are seeing strength there again. In terms of your question around the sectors, I'd say travel has been strong pretty much across-the-board in the U.S. and the U.K. and around the world. Auto was strong in the U.S. for us. Health care has been strong in the U.K. And generally, across the world, we've seen strong sort of performance both in finance and local, and we are seeing more and more sort of excitement and enthusiasm in sectors like CPG and entertainment given the shift of brand. But I'd say, this is a snapshot in time, and these things change quarter-over-quarter.",227

Just if you can help us with the order of magnitude, the drivers of the divergence that we continue to see between CPCs and volume. In the past, you've talked about -- of course, mobile is one of those drivers, but then FX, we have a sense of that property mix, emerging markets and ad quality changes all, driving that. So I was wondering if you guys could give us like a order of magnitude of how important each of those few drivers were in the quarter and then how we should think about those will trend -- trending going forward, if we should expect that divergence to normalize, or should we actually expect it to continue to diverge? That would be helpful.",128

And you can't have a good earnings call if you don't talk about CPC, so here we go. The CPC is an important metric for us. But if you'd take that independently, it's not necessarily a reflection of the fundamental health of our business. This quarter, I'd say the biggest impact on CPC was actually FX. I mean, we have 4 or 5 factors that impact CPC, but the biggest impact this quarter was FX. We have clearly an impact of mobile versus tablet versus desktop. We have an impact of emerging versus developed markets and what's happening from a macroeconomic point of view. As we talked about, we have an impact of google.com versus network. So as we see TAC or you see network playing a bigger role, it impacts CPC. And then finally, as quality changes, it also impacts CPC. But I'd say this quarter, the impact has been felt because of FX. But from a positive perspective, we see any time there's a change in CPC, which is more attractive for the advertiser, that allows the advertiser to get a better ROI. So, for us, it's an opportunity for the advertiser.",204

We have -- I mean, we think that there's a lot of things that are really important about offers, the way it's a local business, it works with both small and large business. It's got -- it's very -- there's a lot of user interest in it. So it is an area that we're continuing to invest in. We are also -- as we continue to develop it, our business model continues to evolve. And for example, we're putting -- we're working with a lot of the different offers and providing distribution for them in addition to generating our own offers with our own sales team, so -- but it continues to be an important area for us, and we will continue to invest in it in the cities that we are currently operating in.",148

29096.0,"Google Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2012",2012-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3615.0,328503.0,15879735.0,Answer,Nikesh Arora,,Executives,56,"I think as I said, we are seeing phenomenal amount of growth in the mobile query space. And it's a consequence of more devices. It's a consequence of more adoption of tablets around the world. It's also a consequence of people getting more and more comfortable with their devices and using them more often. So with the number of questions you answer on the AdMob, so AdMob just got completed in early June. So it's a bit early to say we're seeing acceleration. But generally, our performance throughout that integration has been very strong, and we've effectively had a very -- what we've done about 6 months ago is we took all of our sales efforts, and we took our specialist mobile salespeople and we had them train all of our sales forces around the road. So that, in fact, has even contributed more than just that integration part, but we think the integration is just going to turbocharge that effort and, hopefully, continue to help us drive mobile. And mobile's going to be here for a while, I think. It's a fact of life for us now. So we are -- mobile is sort of becoming as core as desktop Search was. So we're making sure that all of our salespeople around the world are fully equipped and working with every advertiser, not just 1 million to make sure that people can see ROI in both mobile and desktop simultaneously.",241

How important do you think it is for ultimate mobile monetization to actually control the whole experience on the device? And given that you got sort of all sorts of different competitors, some who subsidize evidently, some obviously selling full-priced hardware, software combos, what do you think the right mix is for Google? And when do you think you'll sort of sort this out and be a little bit more declarative in the market with your intentions?",99

Thanks again for your question. And as I said, mobile is very, very important. I think it's better to go back and think about what's happening in the marketplace. And we’ve said we are very committed to mobile. It's evident in our commitment to Android and our ecosystem, as well as our Motorola acquisition. So we believe that mobile is very, very important and critical to the future. Now I know it seems a little complicated when you look at the different competitors and how you talked about subsidies, et cetera. We simplify that by focusing on how do we provide the best experience to the user. Providing the best experience to the user is, in fact, really working really hard with Andy Rubin's team on Android, making sure he's creating the best experience for the end-user. And in that process, he works with the best OEMs in the marketplace to make sure that the combination of hardware and software allows for the best experience to be delivered. I think, for us, what's important is to get that experience delivered, and we will work with whatever industry models are out there. Either we work directly with operators to try and make sure that happens in the hands of the end-user, and more often than not, we work with OEMs to see how we can get the best-of-breed experience in the hands of the end-user. And I think that's what we're going to be focused on. So I think that's quite declarative in terms of our intentions.",264

And so we are in the process of rolling it out. We think it will be rolled out -- we expect probably completed around the Q4 time frame. And we are working really hard with all the merchants to get them all on board, and again, we think this is actually really good for both the merchants and the users. We actually don't refer to this as paid inclusion, just -- because that actually is a term, from the people who've been in the industry for a really long time, of meaning putting in paid things into the Search results in a non-marked way. And we're very, very clear when we show this, we do mark everything very clearly as sponsored. And again, we believe that actually moving to this model is good for both users and for the merchants.

So after the call -- so this is for your second question, Jason.

Yes, so, we -- overall, we've been really pleased with the growth that we've seen. We talked about the 250 million accounts that we have -- Google+ accounts. And I do think it's also really important to remember that Google+ just celebrated its 1 year anniversary. We actually celebrated it at I/O, and so we see the Google+ account growth as going really well. We think that one of the most important things is that when you have a Google+ account, you have the ability to share. And we've talked about Google+ being the social spine across all of our products, the ability to make all of our products better, not just the stream, which is an important part, but also for example, your Search experience. So that if I have a friend, a friend went to a hotel and +1 that hotel, if I'm going to that same location, I would be able to see that information at the time that I'm doing that search. And so we have many, many use cases where we think being part of Google+ will be a better experience. And so we're working across the board to make sure that our products are integrated. We have a number of integrations across the products, probably local was the most significant one that we did this quarter, and we find that having those integrations by making the products better also drives more usage of Google+. So, yes, thank you, Jason. That was an important question.",251

Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us. It's great to be on the call today and to share our progress since we last spoke 6 months ago. As you can hear, my voice is still hoarse, so I'll keep my remarks reasonably short. 
I'm sorry for the scramble earlier today. As our printers have said, they had sent out the release just a bit early. We had a strong quarter. I'm really happy with our business. Revenue was up 45% year-on-year, and at just 14 years old, we cleared our first $14 billion revenue quarter, not bad for a teenager. 
Today, we live in a world of abundance, abundant information and abundant computing. Most of us carry at least one device all the time every day. In fact, many of us feel naked without our smartphone. And not [ph] surprising, mobile search queries and mobile commerce are growing dramatically across the world and when we use these devices interchangeably, depending on our situation. I switch between my Nexus phone, my Nexus 7 tablet and my new Chromebook that we just announced today, many times every day. 
While this abundance causes disruption, it also creates amazing opportunity, and Google is super well placed to take advantage of these disruptive opportunities. Why? Because our Search query volumes have grown this quarter as measured year-over-year, and we are seeing tremendous innovation in advertising, which I believe will help us monetize mobile queries more effectively than desktop today. Indeed, our mobile monetization per query is already a significant fraction compared to desktop. In short, as we transition from one screen to multi-screens, Google has enormous opportunities to innovate and drive ever higher monetization, just like Search in 2000. 
Now we took a big bet on Android back in 2005. We believe that aligning standards around an open-sourced operating system would drive innovation across the industry. Most people thought we were nuts. Today, there are over 0.5 billion Android devices, 0.5 billion, with 1.3 million more being activated every day. You should all run out and buy the Nexus 7 tablets for $199. It's had rave reviews and recently won Gadget of the Year from T3, the gadget experts. You'll love the integration with Google Play. It's an amazing device. 
This time last year, I announced that our run rate for mobile advertising hit $2.5 billion. That seemed like a pretty big number, even for Google, but now, when we built up additional mobile revenue from users paying for content and apps in Google Play. Including these new sources grossed up, I can announce our new run rate for mobile is now over $8 billion. That's quite a business. 
We have so many opportunities today that unless we prioritize, we spread ourselves too thin. Last month, we sunset another 19 products. We've now closed or have combined 60 products and features in the last year, and we've put a ton of energy into ensuring that our remaining products work really well together. Because as screens multiply, it's more important than ever we converge our services. 
Users want one consistent beautiful and simple Google experience. Technology should do all the hard work, liberating users to get on with the important things that matter in their lives. And the screen independence is at the core of our strategy. Take Chrome and Android, for example. We only launched in February, but the experience is already amazing. When you're using Chrome, switching devices is truly painless. All your tabs are there, ready to go. Search on your desktop and the result is right there on your smartphone. You can even click the back button and it just works. And as more users upgrade to Google+, it's now over 400 million. Users are enjoying amazing experiences across devices, like instant photo upload. 
In the same way, we want to make advertising super simple for customers. Online advertising has developed in very device-specific ways, with separate campaigns for desktop and mobile. This makes arduous work for our advertisers and agencies and means mobile opportunities often get missed. But while we're working to significantly simplify the campaign experience, working very hard on that, advertisers should be free to think about their audience, while we do the hard work of dynamically adopting their campaigns across devices. I'm very excited about this. 
I talked at the start about the abundance of information. In the early days of Google, you would type in a query, we return 10 blue links and you move on fairly happily. Today, you expect more. You expect Google to understand deeply and you expect us to turn your intentions into actions in the blink of an eye. If you search for Tom Hanks movies, chances are you want movies with Tom Hanks. And thanks to our Knowledge Graph, that's what we show now, right from the results page. Clean, fast and organized.
And if you're shopping, say, for UGG boots, we now give you pictures, details about the different boots, prices and information about the local inventory, again, right from the results page. Clean, fast and organized. There's much more we can do to get you the right information at just the right time. 
You might have a really important event in the city, perhaps a first date, and the traffic is bad. You need to leave early to avoid being late. Or maybe, you just landed in a new country and you're at the airport ATM, trying to figure out how much cash to withdraw. Google Now, which we launched on Android in June, gives you all that information and more automatically, with 0 effort required on your part. 
Still early days, but these kind of tips and recommendations are super powerful. They really save users time and hassle. This is why I'm incredibly excited about the opportunities ahead, given our expertise in Search and mobile and our track record in monetizing high usage products. 
Every day, I wake up and I'm delighted that opportunities keep growing and that we're birthing to our users great products that are defining the future. It's a truly exciting time to be at Google. 
And now, we'll hear from Patrick some details about our quarter.",1034
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2012",2012-10-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3915.0,380773.0,18192796.0,Presenter Speech,Patrick Pichette,,Executives,4,"Thanks, Larry. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Overall, we're very pleased with the growth trajectory of our business this quarter, and this, in fact, despite significant currency fluctuations in many of our international markets. So for example, if currencies had remained constant year-over-year, our consolidated revenue growth would actually have been 6% higher. On a positive note, our U.S. growth continues to be strong, and as Larry noted, we had a great quarter on the product front, gaining traction in a number of critical areas. 
So before I dive into the financials, I just want to give you a bit more detail on the new $8 billion annual mobile run rate that Larry mentioned. The new run rate is different from the one we gave you a year ago, and more specifically, last year, it included only our gross revenue from mobile ads, but this year, in this new number, we also added the gross revenue from the mobile sales of Google Play content. And finally, it also includes the consumer spending on the Play apps. 
So with that -- and now, why don't I just jump in to our financial performance? Our total gross consolidated revenue grew 45% year-over-year to $14.1 billion and that's also 15% quarter-over-quarter. Google stand-alone revenue grew 19% year-over-year to $11.5 billion, 5% quarter-over-quarter. In that, our Google website revenue was up 15% year-over-year to $7.7 billion, 2% quarter-over-quarter, with strength across most major geographies and verticals. Our Google Network grew 21% year-over-year to $3.1 billion and 5% quarter-over-quarter. And our other revenue grew 73% year-over-year to $666 million, 52% quarter-over-quarter, and this driven by the Nexus 7 sales. 
Were it not for these currency fluctuations, Google's standalone revenue would actually have grown 24% year-over-year. As Larry mentioned, Google's standalone business continues to perform very well. The dramatic growth in our new devices is driving mobile queries and clicks. And although it's early days, some of our existing ads have better monetization in desktop already today and we're confident that this transition opens a whole new space for innovation and new formats and future monetization. 
Turning to MMI, Motorola gross revenue was $2.6 billion. The mobile device division revenue for that period was $1.8 billion and the home division revenue was $797 million. Look, we're really pleased with Motorola's progress in its first 150 days. As indicated on our public filings, our team has made a lot of operational changes. We harmonized and narrowed the product portfolio. It's been streamlining of software operations and we scaled back the markets in which we operate. With that said, we're just at the beginning of the Motorola-Google story, and we should expect, as I mentioned before, results from this segment to be quite variable for quite a while yet. Remember that we inherited an entire product pipeline where hardware and business cycles are typically in a 12 to 18 months. 
At Google, our aggregate paid-click growth was very strong again this quarter, up 33% year-over-year, 6% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate CPC, or cost-per-click, was down 15% and down 3% quarter-over-quarter. But once again, please remember that currency headwinds also had a significant negative impact on our CPCs in Q3. In fixed FX terms, aggregate CPC would've been down only 8%, almost half the 15% and down only 1% quarter-over-quarter. 
Turning to geographic performance of Google's standalone business. We continue to see robust performance in the U.S., the U.K. and Japan. On the other hand, we felt the continued impact of the economic situation in Continental Europe, where we've seen pressure in sectors like travel and retail. In our earning slides, which you can find on our Investor Relations website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits of our hedging program, so please refer to those slides for the exact calculations. 
Revenue from the U.S. was up 23% year-over-year to $5.4 billion. The U.K. was up 16% to $1.2 billion, which includes $6 million of benefit from our hedging program, and in FX terms, in fact, the U.K. grew 20%. The non-U.S. revenue, excluding the U.K., accounted for 42% of our total revenue, or $4.9 billion, up 15% year-over-year, but in fixed terms, in fact, was 26%. And all this includes a $56 million benefit from our hedging program. 
So let's come back now to an aggregate level for total consolidated business. Our other cost of revenue was $3.6 billion in Q3, excluding our stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $3.9 billion, which again excludes SBC and the restructuring and related charges recorded in our Motorola business, and our non-GAAP operating profit was therefore $3.8 billion in Q3, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 27%. 
For Google standalone, our traffic acquisition cost were $2.8 billion, or 25.5% of total advertising revenue. Our other cost of revenue was $1.6 billion and that excludes $103 million of stock-based compensation. The increase year-over-year in this other cost of revenue was driven by data center costs, equipment costs and including costs associated with the sales of the Nexus 7, and finally, content acquisition costs. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $3.2 billion, excluding again, SBC of $585 million, and finally, our non-GAAP operating profit was $4 billion in Q3, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 34% for Google standalone. Lastly, many of you have asked for the depreciation, amortization expense on PPE for standalone Google, which was $465 million for this quarter. 
If we flip to Motorola, our total non-GAAP operating expenses, including cost of revenue, totaled $2.7 billion for the quarter. And keep in mind that intangible amortization expenses attributed to the standalone Google and Motorola are included in these non-GAAP measures. As a result, the non-GAAP operating loss at Motorola was $151 million for Q3, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 6% for that segment. 
Let's switch over to headcount. For the consolidated business, it decreased by roughly 1,000 in Q3. Standalone Google added about 1,800 people, and remember that historically, we often see some seasonal effects on the hiring in Q3, as folks that we hired in the spring and early summer actually start working in September. In total, the consolidated company ended up the quarter around 53,500 full-time employees. 
Our effective tax rate for this quarter was 22% in Q3. The changes from last quarter reflects the mixed shift in earnings between the domestic and international subsidiaries and our hedges, but finally, fewer capital gains offsets versus last quarter. 
If you allow me to turn to cash management, OI&E, or other income and expenses, was $62 million, which reflects the continued impact of our FAS 133 expenses of our hedging program, but also fewer capital gains versus last quarter. For more detail on OI&E, again, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website. 
Operating cash flow was very strong, $4 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $872 million, versus last quarter's $774 million. The majority of our CapEx spend continues to be related to production equipment and facilities-related purchases. All this actually delivers us a free cash flow, which was $3.1 billion, which was -- we're quite pleased. 
The success of our product really gives us the confidence to continue to fund the strategic growth areas, areas that Larry talked about, such as Search, YouTube, Android, Chrome, and as always, we continue to show our discipline, making the tough calls on products that just don't live up to our expectations. In Q3, we've seen a number of these decisions, including the sunset of our Google TV ads as an example. 
So with that, I'll hand it off to Nikesh, who will cover more detail on our business performance in the quarter. And after his remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. Nikesh, here's to you.",1313
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2012",2012-10-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3915.0,380773.0,18192797.0,Presenter Speech,Nikesh Arora,,Executives,5,"Thank you, Patrick. I'd like to reiterate what Patrick said. Our business had a strong quarter, with $11.5 billion in Google standalone gross revenue. I want to talk to you about our focus and progress on 4 major trends that are actually helping drive our business growth: First, a trend Larry already talked about, the rise of the multiscreen consumer. This is creating huge opportunities for us, especially in our advertising business and focus on video and mobile. 
At the moment, everybody thinks about the online world as divided into desktops and mobile. Larry shared the amazing $8 billion run rate and we believe in the medium term, these screens will continue to diverge, but our advertising opportunities will converge to allow our marketeers to run common campaigns across all these screens. Our teams have been putting the same focus on mobile and video in the last few quarters that we brought to display a few years ago, and it's rewarding to see it bear fruit. 
We've intensified training for our sales teams across the globe, integrated sales tools -- so we can really bring our customers mobile, video, Search and Display as a cohesive solution. We're also educating our advertisers through initiatives like Go Mobile, to ensure they have the right creative [ph] and landing pages to make mobile truly work for them. 
However, we feel the progress we've made is just the very first step in the journey of monetizing many screens Larry talked about. As we develop advertising that can take advantage of the context that consumers use this many screens, we expect to continue to see better monetization. As we help marketeers reach consumers closer to the point-of-purchase, the opportunities will only get bigger. 
We're already seen glimpses of this. Take T-Mobile, who used location-based mobile ads to drive people nearby into their stores, and in their words, win the last 10 feet. They achieved a clickthrough rate of about 13% in one of the very successful strategy. These rates are 3x to 4x of what you would see without using some of these context. And our click-to-call ads work because consumers can respond by contacting an advertiser immediately from the ad, but generating approximately 20 million phone calls per month for clients through our various call products for advertisers. 
The second trend, which I'm excited about is it's not just the context that matters, but also our ability to deliver more precise answers to consumers, something also that Larry talked about. We're working very hard on this. Larry talked about Google Now and Knowledge Graph. It's exciting to see how that even makes opportunities for us happen, as Search becomes smarter in a commercial environment. We can do a better job of connecting marketeers with consumers in the moments that matter, irrespective to what device they're using. For example, we're pleased that as of yesterday, Google Shopping completed its transition to a fully paid model based on Product Listing Ads. Now we're providing product information, pictures, pricing, local inventory information for over 1 billion products from tens of thousands of merchants and over 100,000 sellers. 
So the new Google Shopping experience, Adorama, one of the U.S.'s largest photo retailers and mail order suppliers, saw their Clickthrough rate jump by 176%, and the conversion rate went up by 100% in June, as compared to a year earlier. 
Using the same technology that powers our Knowledge Graph, we'll provide even better answers for Google Shopping in other areas where users want to make a purchase. We're going to reduce the number of steps from Search to transaction, making the online experience even more valuable to consumers and marketeers. 
The third trend, which I'm excited about, is that we're actually making real headway amplifying offline brand campaigns and online media. We have a unique approach that helps advertisers succeed across media. We allow them to use and leverage the attributes of each media and adapt their campaigns for online success. YouTube, energized by new professional content and display, are the core of this business, helping clients increase awareness, increase favorability and also drive engagement. 
In addition, we also continue to make progress in our end-to-end technology platform to help advertisers of all sizes succeed with display advertising. Today, our top partners in the agency world, and very large advertisers and publishers, are using a consistent technology stack. The number of impressions that we've been able to pass through Ad Ex and by platforms have doubled over the last year. We're also working on creating more video premium inventory with our channel strategy in YouTube, as more and more viewers move to online video, we expect more and more brands will do the same. 
Our brand business is actually creating quite a buzz in the industry because we have great media and our solutions really work. For example, in YouTube, we looked at about 92 different ad campaigns, the sales impact. We found that, on average, spending in YouTube was approximately 2.4x more efficient than the equivalent television spend. We have 200x more video advertisers than the average U.S. television network. And our TrueView format, in which advertisers only pay for ads that users watch, has really taken off. We have twice as many advertisers using TrueView as last year. That's a very important statistic, but like any good brand marketeer, the best way for me to tell you a story is to actually show it. So let's see what 2 of our leading brands have done this quarter. 
We launched the YouTube Gillette Football Club with Procter & Gamble in Europe. We've created global brand platforms with Gillette that will reinvent the way people watch football online. Their campaigns have generated over 30 million video views. We're working with Coca-Cola on their vitaminwater branding effort. We've partnered to build a strategic music program leveraging YouTube as a platform to anchor, distribute and syndicate the video content. 
It's particularly exciting to see that over 100 brands now have over 1 million followers in Google+, including ESPN, PlayStation, Ferrari, H&M, Burberry and Toyota. 
Last trend I want to talk about, is the trend of cloud computing and the Enterprise. Our Enterprise business continues to thrive. We saw especially great traction in retail and educational sectors this quarter, with Dillard's, Kohl and Office Depot all using Google Enterprise products. In education, there are over 20 million students, faculty and staff now on Google Apps, including Princeton, Virginia Tech, and even the Philippines' Department of Education, which has over 600,000 users. With the recent launch of Google+ for Enterprise customers, organizations of all sizes, including Kaplan and Banshee Wines, are starting to use our Hangouts and other tools to work together and get things done from anywhere. 
In addition to all these trends, our marketing team continues to do an excellent job. We launched a global cross product initiative to bring the 2012 Olympics to our users worldwide. YouTube streamed the games live to 64 countries. Also, YouTube was the official live streaming provider, with over 1 million hours of live content for the Democratic and Republican national conventions. 
And we passed yet another milestone just this week, when YouTube broke its own record to reach more than 8 million concurrent live streams of Felix Baumgartner's record-breaking leap from space with the Red Bull Stratos mission. 
So with that as an update, I'm going to hand you back to Patrick.",1238

The international kind of Rest of World organic growth was 26%, pretty strong, but down from 29% last quarter. So was there any incremental weakness that you saw?

Can you talk about what's driving up those investments?",81

Nikesh and I are pointing at each other. Yes, on the marketing expense -- listen, I think what you see is the impact of the support for the Nexus 7 that we launched in Q3. Otherwise, everything was pretty much in line with what we would expect. We just got such a great review of the Nexus 7. We wanted to support it in the market, and that's the biggest delta you'll see in that number. In terms of the market, I'll hand it over to Nikesh for his commentary.",93

I'll take the question about the strategy and product listings. I think we're just really excited about providing a better experience for our customers. When they search for something, I mentioned UGG boots on the call, you search for that, I think you should get a well-organized set of product information, ways to buy it and really have a great experience there. And we see our ability to do that on the ads or monetized product listings side is really helping us provide a better user experience and provide a better advertiser experience. So I'm very excited about that. I think we're still in early stages of that. We just launched about yesterday really and we still got ways to go.

Mobile Searches are really strong. What's happening with desktop searches? At some point, it's probably reasonable to assume that they flatline. Have we already reached that? And on the expense side, if we just look at core Google, it looks like margins are coming down, but if you did roughly $200 million maybe in Nexus revenue and if you really sold those devices at cost, then margins are actually better than they've been in 2 years. Which is the more accurate interpretation?",85
29096.0,"Google Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2012",2012-10-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Alphabet Inc.,3915.0,380773.0,18192812.0,Answer,Patrick Pichette,,Executives,20,"Actually, on the -- let me start with the margins then I'll answer your first question. On the margins, you actually have a couple of effects this quarter. One of them is clearly, as you said, the cost of the Nexus that will flow into our other cost of revenue. But also, it's the first time that you have the full quarter effect of the amortization of intangibles from the Motorola transaction. So that is also another big kind of lever that actually kicked in. And it should be noted, just for the financial community, that the amortization of intangibles for Motorola flows to both the Google segment and the Motorola segment in different proportions. So again, it's pretty tough. As I promised you that we'd have a lot of kind of noise in the data, I think that, that's a good set of indication. And for the first one, why don't I let Larry give a few comments on the issue of mobile?",164

I think we're really starting to live in a new reality, one where the kind of the ubiquity of the screens helps users really move from Intent action much faster and more seamlessly. And I think this will create a huge new universe of opportunities for advertisers where they can focus on platform. Focusing on platform-specific queries won't make as much sense, because advertisers will be dynamically adapting across a whole bunch of different devices to reach the right audiences at the right time. And that's kind of how we're thinking about it and I alluded to changes that we'll make to our ad system to improve the advertiser experience and the user experience around that. And I also think that we're just seeing tremendous growth in the Android, which really obviously we have tremendous ability to influence and to improve the user experience, to add location, to notify you of things. As I mentioned around different kinds of noncommercial experiences, if we can notify you of commercial experiences as well. So I think that's a really big and great opportunity for us. And I also said that monetization on mobile queries right now is a significant fraction of desktop. So we're kind of living the both -- best of both worlds. We're able to move our existing ads and our existing monetization over to mobile and we're also able to really innovate using Android and our strength of having ads on other mobile platforms and really move advertisers and consumers into a new world. So I think we're uniquely positioned to get through that transition and to really profit from it. So I'm just incredibly excited about that.",291

If you run a website with proprietary high-quality content today and had to choose a protocol to add metadata about this content, why wouldn't the clear choice be the Open Graph protocol instead of RDF or one of its variables?

The second question is, what do you think of the future of vertical search? And why is that, that there are sites that specialize in a set of verticals such as travel and local that seem to do a better job than Google today? And is this going to change over time and what happens with vertical search?",137

I think if you -- I'm not an expert on the protocols you're talking about. I think in general, we made a huge investment in Knowledge Graph and really understanding in detail about everything. And that's a major effort for us and we'd obviously love to have other people help us with that. I think it's been a little bit of a challenge in the past to get all the labeling aligned and all those things. I think we have a big part to play in that. We're absolutely very excited about that and I think we're going to do a lot of work in that area and I think we're doing well in that space. Vertical searches, you asked about, I think, our goal is always been to get you to the right place. But we also -- to do that, we need to really understand in detail your context, what you need, what's really going on with that information, if it's airline tickets, where are the flights between, what do they cost. It's products, someone selling, we need to know how much they cost to get it and what the shipping is and so on. So I think anyplace we can get that information accurately, we can present it to our users. We're very happy to do so. In general, we found that we needed to really build more of that experience in order to provide a really high-quality experience to our users, but again, we're always hoping also to working with partners.",260

Larry, there's a lot of this talk about Internet use on mobile devices, but switching gears a little, I was wondering if you could talk the potential for Internet access on television screens and how Google might benefit from that? And then Patrick, just 2 quick housekeeping questions on Apple. One, is 100% of the TAC that you pay Apple recognized in the google.com TAC line? And then on IOS 6, there's a seemingly small change in the default search bar where it now says the word search, where as it used to say Google. How does, if at all, that change the economic relationship between Apple and Google?",126

I mean, obviously we -- we're excited about television, television screens, displays and we have been for a while. We've had Google TV as a product for quite some time. I use it, I love it. I think it's great to have a real browser available in your television and easily access YouTube and all those kind of things. YouTube is integrated on many, many devices from DVD players and so on, to game consoles and things like that. So we obviously are working hard to get distribution for YouTube, for Chrome and for the Internet as a whole on television screens, as well as our own products and we're very excited about that. I think we're obviously still in the early stages of that. It's not that everybody has a great user experience and we'll work hard to make that happen.",149

On your question of the default, I mean, all of it is, is nothing's changed, right? I mean when you use -- we're a great partner with Apple, we're a great partner with many of them. And in doing so when you do a search, I mean, we have a great -- the fact that they've changed from Google to Search is still kind of ran by our engines.

Can you just, Patrick, talk a little bit about the other drivers? I think everybody assumes that the bulk of the down 8% is mobile, but I know there are other factors driving that down 8%. So if you can just kind of give us order of magnitude, emerging markets and so forth, if possible? And then secondly, on allocation of your sizable free cash flow, and on your cash balance, Patrick, in the past, you've talked about reviewing and considering capital returns at the board level. And at the same time, you've talked about your cash balance being a strategic asset for Google. Just wondering if you could give us an update on yours, on Larry's, the board's thinking, on allocation of capital and use of your cash balance.",146

And in fact, I think people have a tendency just to harp and assuming that it's automatically mobile. And if you look through our results, right, just to kind of point to a few areas, if you look at our mix between our Google properties and our network, our network grew quite a bit again this quarter and that would drive a lot of TAC as well. So and again, that's the reason why I kind of want to educate and tell -- and remind everybody that just all of these mix effects, whether it'd be mobile, versus tablet, versus desktop, but also emerging market versus developed markets and also our google.com versus network. And that we haven't even talked about the changes in our ads quality, which actually can change quite a bit as well. So I think that, that matters a lot, and I think that it's really important that we understand that all these mix effects are actually playing -- are at play there in the CPCs. So rather than -- and that's why we don't give -- if we start giving down all the breakdown, right, it's just endless. So for us, the real issue for us, is what really matters is they're going down. But on the flip side of that, right, given all these mix issues, what we really see is our paid clicks going up at a pretty healthy rate, at 33% again this quarter, which actually gives you a sense of people are engaged, people are using our products. It's really about this transformation of multi-devices, and the fact that there is a little bit less CPC is not a concern compared to all the offside that we see on the other side. On the issue of our cash and capital balance, I think you get the same answer, and maybe Larry wants to kind of chime in if he wishes to, but we just review this on a constant basis. We ask ourselves the question, what are -- is there real options for us actually to use the cash from a strategic perspective? And we've come to the conclusion that it is a real strategic asset for us right now with the ability to pounce. And so we think it's prudent to actually manage our capital structure the way it is as we speak.",407

Patrick, I'll start out with yours first. Can you give us an idea of the run rate that you're talking about, the $8 billion for mobile? Can you give us an idea of what that is on a kind of same-store sales basis. You gave us the $2.5 billion run rate last year. What is the mobile advertising piece? I think that's something people are really interested in, so x the stuff from Google Play. The follow-up question I had for you was, what's the margin profile on the Google Play content revenue that you're recognizing? And then the question for Larry is, I guess just in listening to Mark Mahaney's question, I was wondering in this new reality you mentioned in response to his question, how does Google Fiber play into this vision to have your content and search capabilities go across multiple screens?",155

We just wanted to kind of give you a sense of proportion. A point that's important is, of the 3 categories I gave you, ads continues to be the bulk of it, the vast majority of it. And then, on the case of the Google Play, it's important to note from a modeling perspective that everything that's content, that is whether a book, a movie content, is actually booked on our books on a gross basis. Everything that is tied to apps is booked on a net basis. But it's still a huge kind of number in all cases. So without giving you -- I just want to give you that so that you don't start thinking that there's actually $8 billion that is booked to revenue in our results that you see, but in fact, 2 of the 3 are there. The third one is done on a net basis just because of our accounting rules, so -- and the vast majority is still ads.",194

First, just been following up on Scott's earlier question. We saw a deceleration in Google properties and then an acceleration on network sites, but hoping you could talk about a little bit beyond the U.S. and international mix. Is there anything else that you would attribute those dynamics to? And then secondly, you talked a lot about multiple screens and the ubiquity of devices. How concerned are you that in a mobile world, behavior is different and we're living in more of an app spaced environment and Google might not be that starting point for people on mobile devices?",106

Thanks, that was a great question, Doug. I'll take the second one first. I think a lot's been made of that, and I don't think that's really true, kind of apps versus Search. And we obviously have a great position in apps. We have the Android Play store, which has a huge number of apps, and I think that those experiences are great experiences and there are some things that are better than them about the web, there's some things that are better than the web other than apps. I think over time, if we do our jobs right, you'll have the same capabilities in both places. You'll have Search ability in apps. You'll be able to, more easily, go to apps the same way you would go to web pages and so on. And so I think those differences will emerge or be reduced anyways over time. I think we obviously have a strong position in both. So I'm not so worried about that. I think that there's obviously innovation that goes on in mobile and we talked a little bit about all the different context and location you can have on mobile. The, fact that you're always carrying a device with you, and those things are very powerful. But you want all that when you're on desktop as well, or on the web. You want that same information. And so what we want is a seamless experience that goes across both mobile and desktop and TV, or whatever screens you have, and that's what we're building. I think that we're going to see tremendous growth in these things. The other point I'd make is that there's a small -- relatively small number of people right now that have Chrome on their mobile devices. And I find Chrome on my mobile device is like the same as having a desktop computer a year ago or something. I mean it's an amazing experience. You can buy things, it remembers your credit card numbers. I mean it's a very, very easy, great experience. That's been -- that's rolled out to a relatively small number of people, but it will be increasing quickly. So I guess just seeing all those trends, I think it's a tremendous opportunity for us and I don't think people are really thinking about it correctly now. So Patrick, do you want to cover the detailed question?",400

Look, just to reiterate that our Google websites, our revenue was up and with strength across most geographies and most verticals. I mean, obviously, you've heard Nikesh talk about there's -- we can't control the economy in the short term, so if there's a country that is slowing down a little bit, then we clearly kind of see it in the results as well because Google's actually a pretty good predictor of the present as our economist, Hal Varian, kind of reminds us. But -- and then on the Google Network, I think we're just -- we're really pleased with -- it's skewed slightly more to the U.S. but really pleased with the performance overall with all of our networks that's been performing well.

As I mentioned Google TV for a while, I think recently kind of YouTube transitioned for me maybe a year ago to be a really -- something that could keep me entertained for hours on the TV. It can play back lots of really high quality, highly exciting things, that are now kind of tailored for me, I have my channels and so on, and I think we have tremendously increasing YouTube usage. It continues to grow like crazy and we've had increasing monetization as well, which causes people to put more content on it and to monetize it worldwide. Kind of in the blink of an eye, you could put something up. Sort of with the recent video with the horse dancing -- Gangnam Style. I'm watching, it has 400 million views now -- sorry, 500 million now, I'm out of date. And that kind of thing to really just flip the switch, turn it on, get a worldwide distribution. And sort of almost without doing any work, if you're a provider of this content, it's an amazing thing. And I think that's how we see the future we're just going to continue to grow that. YouTube is going to be available everywhere, on your mobile, on your TV, on your desktop, whatever, wherever you want, just kind of keep track of the kinds of things you're interested in and really provides you an amazing experience and provide a great experience for the advertisers. TrueView is exploding, which gives us high-quality ads from an end-user standpoint because they can skip them if they want, so it encourages ads that are actually entertaining, not annoying, and that's been working. We're making money with that and it's growing like crazy as well. So I couldn't be more excited about all that.",307

As far as the emerging markets and Android, I think we're very excited about the fact that Android is becoming a very successful platform in many markets outside the U.S., not just the U.S. I think in terms of what drive -- I'm not sure if your question is about faster growth of Android or faster growth of monetization on Android platforms. I think in both of them, we're seeing the adoption in various markets, where OEMs are producing Android devices on the bleeding edge and doing a phenomenal job of working with operators in those markets and distributing them. So we think that will continue because Android is providing to be a great platform for innovation for all the OEMs. In addition to that, as more and more people use mobile devices, I think we've talked a lot on this call about how as mobile devices are being used, we're seeing increasing query growth and we're seeing our various new ad formats and ads where we bring context into account is actually helping us monetize. So I think both those trends are going in the right direction, and hopefully, that provides more opportunity for us.",198

So Richard, just 2 points. One is, it's been interesting in Q3, the U.S. dollar has really weakened versus a whole host of currencies. So typically, you have one currency that goes down, another one is more stable. We've really seen it across the board, it just happens with the macroeconomic trends, again, something you can't predict. So it's been across the board. And without giving you the details of how it flows to margin, it is fair to say, and we've already talked in the past that our operating expenses are skewed to the U.S. I mean Mountain View is the headquarter, and so from that perspective, it has some effect, as well. So I think you can navigate through this. So it was definitely a significant impact for this quarter.",137

And then maybe some detail on the hedging program. This is one of your worst year-over-year hedging -- I'm sorry, one of your worst year-over-year FX impacts down $500 million and yet you get a $62 million benefit and I think you disclosed the cost was $124 million.

I don't know the details of like particular queries on mobile versus desktop, but I can tell you, I think, like, for example, in travel, we bought ITA Software for a sizable amount because we thought it was important to provide a better experience there. When you type cities and you want an airline ticket, you actually need that detailed information. And so I think I'm not worried about any of that to the extent we provide a great and amazing user experience for people. However, they're looking for all types of different kinds of information. And as long as we're providing, again, that very detailed, very organized set of results for people, I think that translates across all of your screens just fine.

Look, I think that it's interesting, your question, Justin, but let's remind ourselves of a couple of points because I think our FX program has actually delivered amazing value to shareholders: One is, we don't hedge revenue, we hedge profits, and we hedge a number of kind of major currencies like the euro, the pound, the Canadian dollar, a few others, which is the core of our program. So -- and not only that, but actually, our hedge program is set and designed for long-terms, kind of 18 months, as a risk reduction strategy and doesn't necessarily correlate in any way, shape, or form for a 3-month kind of timeframe in our financial results. And it's really also built to make sure that, because you've got a cost benefit ratio there of making sure that it's set for big dislocations. So if it's a small variance in the short term, you're not going to get as much benefit as the big dislocations. So for all these reasons and then what I've mentioned a bit earlier, which is we've seen actually FX across a whole slew of currencies this quarter, which the smaller currencies just added up and we don't hedge for them today. That's what kind of ended up in the puzzle. So we are constantly looking at our forecast and if it makes sense, we'll actually throw in new currencies going forward. So that's been the story on FX, but I wouldn't read in any way, shape or form that it hasn't performed well. It's performed very well. So why don't I turn it back over to Nikesh for the last question?",285

And as we said, we have 1 billion products that are in there. So as we [indiscernible], Larry talked about getting more precise information, we believe that users, when they search, they come exploring on the web when they have a better idea what they're trying to buy, they start expressing intent by being more precise with what they ask for. And we believe being able to show product listing ads gets us closer to intent, because when somebody types a Nikon D800, then we know they're looking to buy or looking to get more information about a specific product, and the fact that we can show them reviews, pictures and pricing information gets us closer to action. And we believe in the medium term that's going to create more monetization and a better monetization for us as opposed to having just 10 blue links or ads, which send them to other websites. So I think that's going to have a good impact in the medium term. I don't think I'm going to comment whether that has an impact on Q4 or not.",211

Would you give us a rough sense of how long it could take to close the bulk of the gap between desktop and mobile monetization? Is this a matter of quarters, or years, that we'll see that come together? And then maybe just on -- you made a quick comment on travel weakness last quarter. I think you said travel was strong across the board. And then you came back today and said it sounds like that was a weaker category. Just anymore color on the weakness of travel?",98

We have kind of a policy of not talking about the future, so I think it's been generally a good policy. I tend to be very impatient and I think, to kind of reiterate what I said. I think that we're positioned well, very, very well, and uniquely well because we have already a very significant fraction of the monetization on mobile, and that's a great start and we're working on changes of how we do things. We've been investing in this space for a long, long time, right, so our mobile monetization is not 0. It's a very significant number as we tried to [indiscernible] with the $8 billion number. And I think that -- so we've got a good pace there and I don't think that -- I don't think the things we need to do are that huge to get us in a very good spot and I think we have the opportunity to be at a higher monetization than we were -- than where we are now, with some innovation, which we're good at doing. Like I said, I'm very impatient and I think that the other point I'd make I guess that I haven't made already, I think that advertising -- advertisers, our ad system requires they spend some effort to deal with mobile in general. I think advertisers -- mobile until very recently has been a relatively small percentage of the advertising spend for most advertisers. I think that's starting to be no longer the case, right, and that's happening relatively quickly. And I think advertisers will also react to that, and you'll see them invest more effort in targeting those users, running ads for them and so on, which will obviously benefit our monetization there. So I think we have a lot of trends working for us. So I am not worried about this in terms of our business at all. I think it's more of an opportunity for us because we're better positioned than most other companies. I guess it's your all's job to estimate short-term impact. But like I said, I'm quite impatient.",357

I mean, obviously there's a couple of factors in there. One of them is, clearly, there is seasonality in travel. So obviously, that's always an impact quarter-over-quarter. And then, as we read the same news you read about Europe or other parts of the world that are in different economic situations, you will notice that if you kind of track Google trends and you go and mine into the data, you'll see that some sectors are performing better, others are not. And as I mentioned in my commentary at the very beginning, travel and retail has been somewhat weak in Europe, just given their situation. So no real surprises there, Brian. Thank you for your question. 
Just before we close, I just want to take 10 seconds on behalf of Nikesh, Larry and myself, thanking -- and the amazing work of our Googlers, all of our employees, all our partners. What an amazing last 90 days it's been both at Motorola and Google. And I'll let Larry close with the last words of -- before we turn it over to Jennifer to close the call.",193
