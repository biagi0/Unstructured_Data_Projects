And good morning and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is Craig DeYoung, Vice President of Investor Relations at ASML. Joining me today from our headquarters here in Veldhoven, The Netherlands, is Mr. Peter Wennink, our CEO; and Wolfgang Nickl, ASML's CFO. The subject of today's call is ASML's 2015 fourth quarter and annual results. 
Before we start, I'd like to take a brief moment to address some questions from previous calls about our Q&A queue. The process is -- you'll be advised that the Q&A starts upon the operator's instructions at the opening of the call, and not before. Therefore, there's really no value in calling in too long before the call starts in an attempt to get into the queue. [Operator Instructions] The length of the call will be 60 minutes. The call will be broadcast and is being broadcast live over the Internet at asml.com. And a replay of the call will be available on our website for approximately 90 days. 
Lastly, before we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that comments made by management during the conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meanings of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of these risk factors, I encourage you to review the safe harbor statement today contained in today's press release and presentation found on our website at asml.com and in ASML's annual report on Form 20-F and other documents as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter Wennink for a brief introduction.",270

For Q4, our net sales came in at EUR 1.43 billion. This included system sales of EUR 881 million, of which Memory represented 44% and Logic represented 56%. Service and Field Option Sales came in strong at EUR 553 million. This part of our businesses grows continues strengthened by strong demand for Holistic Lithography options, high-value upgrades and a growing installed base. Our gross margin for the quarter came in at 46%, slightly above the guidance. R&D expenses came in at EUR 273 million, and SG&A expenses came in at EUR 90 million, essentially as we guided. 
For the full year, our net sales reached a new record of EUR 6.3 billion, which is up 7% from the prior year and includes over EUR 2 billion for field options and services. Gross margin for 2015 was 46.1%, up from 44.3% in 2014. Our basic earnings per share for 2015 were EUR 3.22, up 18% year-over-year. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Quarter-over-quarter cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments grew from EUR 2.68 billion to EUR 3.41 billion, driven by strong free cash flow which was impacted by a significant amount of customer prepayments on orders received. In Q4, we repurchased shares worth EUR 141 million, bringing the total amount for repurchased shares in 2015 to EUR 565 million. 
Regarding the order book. Q4 bookings came in at EUR 1.2 billion, 31% above our Q3 bookings. Strength in memory bookings continued to be notable, with a significant growth in our foundry bookings, leading to a strong and nicely balanced backlog across all industry sectors of approximately EUR 3.2 billion. 
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations and guidance for the first quarter of 2016. We expect continued healthy memory shipments, supported by a strong backlog. Our Service and Field Option Sales will be around the EUR 500 million mark again. We expect relatively modest Logic shipments in the first quarter of 2016, leading us to guide Q1 revenue at approximately EUR 1.3 billion. As indicated at this time last quarter, we do, however, expect our logic customer to take shipments in Q2, which will start the ramp of 10-nanometer, and as a result, we expect Q2 sales to increase significantly from Q1. Based upon expected customer and product mix, a lower sales volume forecast and lower field option sales, we expect gross margin for Q1 to come in at around 42%. 
R&D expenses for the first quarter will be about EUR 275 million, and SG&A is expected to come in at about EUR 90 million, both roughly the same as the previous quarter. Our annualized tax rate for 2016 is expected to increase to around 13% based upon a change in tax rules that transfer some tax benefit into R&D credits. 
Peter will talk more about our 2015 EUV accomplishments and 2016 key performance targets shortly, but I would like to make a few points regarding 2016 EUV shipments and explain a bit further the current and expected situation related to EUV revenue recognitions. We've completed 3 EUV shipments in 2015 and started the shipment of a fourth system before year-end. One of the 3 systems was recognized in revenue during 2015. The other 2 systems that shipped and the 1 system or shipment we started should lead to a revenue of about EUR 110 million in the middle of 2016, with the balance booked in 2017. For 2016, we expect to ship between 6 and 7 EUV systems. The 2016 shipments will be a combination of NXE:3300, 3350 and 3400 going to both Logic and Memory customers. As a reminder, we will continue to guide expected revenue timing on additional EUV systems as they ship. 
And finally, but certainly not without significant importance, ASML paid EUR 302 million in dividends in 2015 and we purchased 6.3 million of our own shares for EUR 565 million, providing a total cash return to shareholders of EUR 867 million during the year. 
In 2016, we are proposing to our Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on April 29 to increase our dividend by 50% to a level of EUR 1.05 per ordinary share. Today, we have also announced the plan for an additional EUR 1 billion of share repurchases over 2016 and 2017, on top of the remaining EUR 500 million from our prior program. 
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Peter.",742
388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2016",2016-01-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3647.0,919706.0,39191740.0,Presenter Speech,P. Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Wolfgang. As Wolfgang highlighted, we concluded a financially very satisfying year. Expectations for the first quarter sales are approximately EUR 1.3 billion, reflecting continued shipments for 28-, 16-, 14-nanometer logic capacity additions, albeit at a relatively low level; and shipments to memory customers consisting of a mix of advanced and more mature system types. While first quarter sales are expected to be relatively moderate, we clearly see, as Wolfgang said, a significant increase in combined system and service sales in the second quarter, largely driven by system shipments for the initial ramp of advanced 10-nanometer production processes at our logic customers. 
While it is still a bit early to say anything quantitatively about 2016, we do see trends and developments that we believe are worthwhile mentioning. In memory, as evidenced by the fourth quarter bookings and our current backlog strength, our customers have indicated that their system demands will continue throughout the first half of 2016 at levels roughly equivalent to those of Q4. Although we expect the 2 DRAM fabs will continue to install some additional tools, largely meant to support the next DRAM node, we also believe that 2016 shipments to this application will be down versus a strong 2015. 
On NAND, we believe that the capacity expansions will be focused on 3D NAND applications. With the announcement of the conversion of a Chinese fab to 3D NAND that is now largely supported in our current backlog, we expect a flattish level of NAND systems revenues versus 2015. 
One additional memory development that appears to be worth following is the introduction of the cross-point architecture. While the full opportunity extent of this new memory architecture is still under evaluation, its potential seems significant and could, therefore, become important to our business as the advanced processes anticipated in this application are quite litho-intensive. 
As for logic, it has now become clear to us that the introduction of the advanced 10-nanometer node ramp is progressing well and the continued and clear customer commitment to ramp this node starting in Q2 2016. The speed and initial size of this ramp can be explained by the value proposition provided by significant shrink of this node versus the 16- and 14-nanometer node. The ultimate spend levels for logic in 2016 will depend, amongst other things, on both the level of end demand and the rate at which our customers will be able to execute their ramp and it's, therefore, too early to accurately predict this today. For field options and services, we see continued strength in 2016 and this should show growth previously estimated to be in the range of 10%. 
On the product side, ASML continues to focus R&D spend on lithograph tools that are essential to ramp all of the current and advanced processes. With the growing litho challenges of complex and costly multi-pass patterning, our recently launched TWINSCAN NXT:1980 DPV immersion scanner with significant improvements in all key performance metrics, started volume shipment last quarter. And now with its widespread acceptance, it is ramping at a rate greater than any other advanced system in our history. 
Our Holistic Lithography products continue to gain acceptance at leading-edge customers, who are using our full suite of immersion process window enhancements and process control solutions to optimize yield at their most advanced product nodes. Holistic Lithography products are now extending also into EUV processes, with customers evaluating our EUV source mask optimization software for the development of their 7- and 5-nanometer technologies. 
And finally on EUV. As most of you are aware, our 2015 focus has been on improving EUV stability, availability and productivity, the key performance metrics that drive new technology adoption. In several recent public presentations, our customers have clearly recognized our EUV progress in these areas. In a 4-week customer-run manufacturing readiness test at production conditions, we've seen 15,000 wafers exposed, with comparable results achieved using the same power configuration at multiple customers. 
On the raw productivity side, we have a new system configuration, the NXE:3350, that has demonstrated in our factory more than 1,250 wafers exposed in a 24-hour period. Six out of 8 systems at customer sites have achieved 4-week average system availability of greater than 70%, with 1 system reaching the 80% mark. However, the worldwide average is currently still lower, indicating that performance stability in the entire installed base needs to be further improved. We believe that our 2016 performance targets of 1,500 wafers per day and 80% total system availability are achievable and will, therefore, be aggressively pursued over the year -- over the course of this calendar year. 
Now with that, we will be happy to take your questions.",777

So I'm just wondering what level of visibility do you have. What could be the magnitude of, I guess, the snapback? And the reason I'm asking is, I think if I just take your bookings in the fourth quarter and if I add maybe EUR 0.5 billion in service sales, then it looks like we should be well above EUR 1.6 billion. So I'm just wondering if that's the right ballpark, and then I have a follow-up.",87

So we'll leave it at that today, but it's all underpinned by a strong ramp in 10-nanometer. And we also said that memory will be throughout the first half at the Q4 levels. So I think you can approximate it from there pretty well.",76

And then, just a quick one on the gross margin. So I think the Q1 guidance is probably below where most people think it would be, even if we look back at quarters with similar revenue run rate. So I'm just wondering broadly what are the reasons. And should we kind of expect that if we do see the recovery in demand and revenue for the second quarter, that we should sort of settle back at the 47%, 48% level that, I think, we've become used to. And that's obviously before EUV.",93

First of all, there are no structural changes in the sense that you should be worried that pricing came down or we have any cost issues. This is purely a function of lower volume at one, and then more so a change in mix between products and customers. And then also, within the Service and Field Options, the Service is a bit higher when compared to Field Options, which come at higher margin. And then you can also read that when we say foundry, it's lower, and memory is higher. Foundry tools are usually in richer configuration going to the customer. Now if you want to look at Q2, [ph] we won't give you an exact number, but when you consider that the volume will go up and the foundry shipments will go up, and it's 10-nanometer, it will be pretty nicely configured tools, you'll know in which direction the margin will go.",162

My question would be, Peter, on the memory market. You've said that you're going to have a flattish trend in the first half in the memory market. Do you see this into the second half substantially correcting? Or you don't have visibility at this point into the segment. Secondly, I have a quick question on EUV as well. I mean, clearly, EUV is progressing much better at this point in terms of throughput than you've given some of the statistics. What time frame do you see EUV actually being built for production volumes?",99
388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2016",2016-01-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3647.0,919706.0,39191749.0,Answer,P. Wennink,,Executives,13,"Okay. On the memory market, like I said in the introductory comments, we have very clear visibility given by our customers, also evidenced by our bookings that we received during the fourth quarter on what we are going to ship in the first half, which is focused on also the introduction of the new DRAM nodes. So you could say it's clearly a technology transition that is driving the shipments in the first half. We don't have that visibility yet on the second half. This is our current thinking. I can only give you some indication of what was said by some of the market -- no, research analyst firms. They expect, and if they are right, then 25% bid growth for next year would mean about flat wafer capacity year-on-year 2016 versus 2015. So that means that if the initial shipments of the technology tranches happen in the first half, then the second half will be lower. There are no capacity additions needed. How much lower? That's a bit too early to say. But clearly, first-half technology trend and transitions in the second half, probably a lot less. On EUV throughput, yes. And on -- we've made good progress. We've agreed with our customers the targets for 2016, and we have confidence, good confidence that we're going to get there. You have to look at 2016 as, I would say, the last phase in the EUV introduction of where our customers are developing their next nodes for which they're planning their production output in 2018 and '19. So if the last phase of the development node and the qualification of those architectures that we will see in 2018, '19 hitting the market, that means that 2017 will be the year where we will start to see the start of the EUV shipments for production, and they will be used in 2018, and that will accelerate throughout 2018. So 2017, we'll see the first start to make sure we can do -- customers can do the output in 2018, which will accelerate in 2018 further on. So that's nothing different than we said, I think, last quarter. So no change from that respect.",363

So I just wondered if you could talk about 10-nanometer ramp now you've got maybe a bit more visibility around that. Should we still be thinking about 10% fewer wafer starts between the 20, 16, 14 nodes and the 7, 10 nodes. But also a 40% to 50% lithography intensity increase.

It's, basically, that's the assumption on the 10% that we still work with. We don't have any other data. I'll comment on that a bit later also. The 40% litho intensity, yes, that's with node on node. That's still what we think is a realistic number. On the node-on-node wafer capacity reduction, the 10% is still what we are using. You have to bear in mind that starting from the 20th nanometer node, we see those nodes extending a lot longer than what we saw in the past. And you've been around a long time, so you know that between 5 and 10 years ago, nodes had a 2-year life. And then the previous nodes stopped. NXT node came and lasted about 2 years. And almost all logic customers moved in that same time period, which is less the case today -- or not the case today. We see initial acceptance of a new node being driven by the leading-edge customers, and they install rather swiftly and rather fast, quite a significant amount of capacity. And then you see the other customers in that segment, you could say the second-tier customers, following later. And it's also what we see today. The 28-nanometers are still being shipped even in Q1 of 2016, which is more than 4 years after the initial introduction. So you see quite a bit -- you can see kind of a camelback in the first phase of that node, and then a much longer tail, which also makes it more difficult for us to say how much will the wafer capacity for that node be, yes? We assume 10%, but over time, we'll -- it needs to be proven, whether this is the correct number.",290

So you really should not go past 16 and 14 from a litho pitch point of view to 10 -- but really 20 to 10. And that's a big shrink. And as you know, shrink has a big impact on the cost per bit. So it is driven by cost per bit. And for some customers, actually, it's also value, just putting more functionality on the same square surface. That's what's driving it.",100

And then also, we're extending into IDM, not only for foundry but also IDM on 10-nanometer, which will be the remainder of the year, will drive the remainder of the year. Now if you just look at the size of that ramp -- and the ultimate size for this year is always a bit difficult to predict in the 3rd week of January, so we're very early in this year. If you look at that -- what customers are telling us, there's going to be a significant ramp and will be driven by the leading-edge players, not so much by the followers, which will follow on -- I said it in an earlier -- as an answer to an earlier question, which will probably have a much longer tail. But the initial ramp-up we are seeing will be significant, and that causes us to state that the 2016 Logic market for us will be significantly higher than 2015.",181

But it's very important that when you start planning your production, that availability is critical. So the 80% availability target is what we agreed with our customers. This is what we are, at least, following. And I also like to refer to our presentation where you can see that. On productivity, quite interesting. One of our key customers, in a question that was asked recently on whether 500 wafers per day would be sufficient for them to go into production, assuming a reliable or a, I'd say, good availability of the tool, but the answer was yes, they would use it. So you can draw a conclusion from that answer, that is not so much now about the productivity. It is about availability. So this is what we are really focusing on this year.",156

The 10-nanometer ramp is predominantly outside China, if you refer to China. When we see -- the Chinese logic or foundry market clearly focusing on the nodes before 10. So it's -- the 28-nanometer node is still relatively strong in China but also very clear indications of the move to 16 and 14. And that is where we see Chinese foundries going. The -- like I said, the 10-nanometer ramp will be outside China. 2017, it's a good question. I think it's too early for us to say everything about 2017. I think what we'll have to go through is the next 2, 3 quarters of the initial ramp, which we have a pretty decent visibility of.

The equipment reuse is, as always, it appears to dominate some of our discussions lately, but it's always been there, yes? And large IDMs have always done this. That is -- it's a very sensible way to manage your capital efficiency. Now with tool prices going up to where they currently are, advanced DPV price is at EUR 50 million, there's more and more focus of our customers on capital efficiency. And the reuse program, which we have designed by adapting the architecture in such a way that we can upgrade from one node to the other and with little intensity going up with about 40% node on node. And there's a very clear drive of our customers to say what part of my installed base can we upgrade to the next node? That's called a reuse. That doesn't cover the 40% litho intensity at all. It just covers part of it, yes? And we have had situations whereby reuse is -- let's say, upgrades were planned on a previous node but never happened because the previous node extended longer than the original planning. So it's nothing new. I think it's going to be part of our business going forward, very healthy part. If you think about an extensive upgrade from a 1950 to a 1970, for instance, it's a EUR 20 million-plus upgrade with decent margins, which is good business for us, helps us increase our Services and Option sales business and it helps to -- our customers to manage their installed base. So I think it's going to be part of our business going forward. It might be new to some of our peers, but it isn't to us because our tools have always one of the most expensive in the customer fab. So it's here to stay and it's good.",304

I mean, we -- first of all, we told you that while we are in this transition period where we can recognize not when the tool leaves our factory, we will give you guidance as we ship the tools. And I said we shipped 3 tools last year, and -- of which only 1 recognized. And then on top of that, we started the shipment of another tool. Of the 2 tools that shipped and have not recognized last year, and the tool that has started to ship, from these 3 tools together, you should expect approximately EUR 110 million in revenue. And that will be somewhere in the Q2, Q3 midyear time frame. And the balance of the revenue will likely recognize in 2017. Now that's the starting point. And then we also said that we'll ship more tools this year. And those, of course, will -- we also told you there is, for instance, 3,300 per month then -- which we'll recognize faster because we have the -- recognition rules are different because we just need to demonstrate that we can print the wafer. So there's more to come, so you've got to bear with us as we make the shipments. And lastly, I'll say, also, that we will start to see some Service revenue in the EUV field. We already had some last year. Our total revenue was about EUR 100 million or so, and only a little over EUR 60 million came from Systems. So you'll have to bear with us, Amit.

My understanding is you had both your IDM customers and your foundry customers are going to insert EUV at the 5-nanometer node, so not the next one but the one after. Is that also how you see the world from where you are? And then maybe on this 5-nanometer node insertion, how much visibility do you have today on how heavy an insertion it is going to be?

What is most important -- and that's what we should focus on, is whether you call it 5, or whether you call it 7, yes, our customers, our leading-edge customers make it very clear to us that they will start their -- the output of their chip architecture that needs EUV, yes, whether that's 5, or whether that's 7, I don't know how they call it, and I don't care, yes? That when they need EUV for output, it's 2018 starting, '18, '19, which actually means that our shipments for production purposes need to start in 2017.

Wennink,,Executives,70,"Yes, we have visibility -- reasonable visibility from our customers. But it actually leads us to believe what we said in the past that the first year of volume ramp -- and as you know, with the lengthening of the nodes, we discussed it a couple quarters ago, everything about 6 to 12 months later than we thought about a year ago. But we believe that the initial year of the production shipment will be a dozen or so tools, and then this will double every year that we move on. So we're still -- all our simulation models still show the same thing. So the first year of the production shipments is about a dozen tools, and then it will double the year after that, and double the year after that. [indiscernible] right model.",135

From the direction in the second half is, Logic will be a bigger part of it. Directionally, margin goes up. Of course, we don't know the exact volume yet, so we can't describe that volume effect. But directionally, you're right. One caveat, with a concentration of EUV revenue recognition in the quarter, you will see some distortion. But when we get to that bridge, we will explain to you how that works and show you the margin without EUV as well.",94

Just another one on EUV. In terms of the -- sort of looking at the milestones you're targeting for this year, I'm just trying to understand sort of roughly when we might be able to sort of get a better idea as to how you're making progress. You seem to be in a bit of a gap at the moment. Clearly, the customers have the 3300 tools installed and running, and those are a lot of the metrics you're talking about. The 3350s are there or on their way. So when can expect to see some of the first news on the 3350 tools at the customer site? Is SPIE too early? Or is it going to be a bit later than that?",126

As you pointed out, the 3350 is really the tool that has the improvements on it, that will give us the 1,500 wafers per day and the 80% availability capability. Now those tools are just starting to ship. They need to be installed. The installation only takes a quarter or 3 months, which actually makes it too late for any, let's say, significant information on the SPIE conference, which is in February. So it will be around midyear. That's what you need to focus on.",90

And then just a sort of quick follow-up. I mean, you've highlighted the 6 to 7 tool shipments, EUV tool shipments this year. Can you give us any sense as to when those are coming?

Wennink,,Executives,76,"Well, they're starting to leave the facility this quarter, the first one. So it will be throughout the year. There will be tool shipping every quarter. And as to revenue recognition, Wolfgang already said it. He gave some clear guidance for the revenue recognition of the tools that we shipped last year And one that was in the process of shipping towards the end of the year. Now the 6 to 7 tools that we'll ship in this year, there will be some revenue recognition. Of course, there's a 3300 in there, which will very likely 2 of them, could be, which will book revenue. And also on the 3350s, it depends on the commissions or the order conditions where we can take some revenue already in 2016. So that's why Wolfgang said it's the minimum. And there's very likely going to be EUV revenue of that in the course of the year.",153

And maybe if you could give us some details about the laser which was used, if it was 120 watts or a different laser source for EUV. That's the first question. The second question is, I know it's a bit cheeky, but it's good to announce the EUR 1 billion share buyback, but why not more given the progress made by EUV adornment [ph] and your confidence in the 2020 target of EUR 10 billion revenues?",123

Well, this is just another layer. We have a very clearly stated financial policy that, as we evaluate what our minimum cash needs are, then we service the dividend first, that we want to have at least stable, preferably growing.

Well, we haven't installed it yet, running it at the customer sites, so it would a bit difficult to give you an answer there. It's too early. Also to the question of -- there's an earlier question, when are we going to see data on availability and where  the spread per day. Probably more towards the middle of the year and so the technical details but there are some features in the 3350, well, like the in-situ cleaning and some other features that give us the confidence that we should have a higher availability and also a higher throughput, not so much because we have a stronger laser. The laser is the same, but more because of the transparency of the illuminator and the optics that gives us a better transmission. And that's why we get a better throughput.",166

So it's going to be through cycles of learning. So it is not to be expected that we will [indiscernible] from day 1.

Wennink,,Executives,88,"Well, I don't think they're that related. I mean, customers have their plans on whether they follow cadence A or your cadence B. What they tell us is that they need that -- their production outlook in a certain period in a certain year, which is starting 2018, and then you just calculate back using the cycle time that we need, and then we come to a moment where we need to start shipping the tool. So -- and what ultimately drives the decision of the customer to say, ""I need that output in 2018 or 2019,"" there are many, many reasons. It is not only cadence. It's also time that they need to actually develop that next node. And for us, it's not that relevant. Most relevant is when do they need the tool.

And as a reminder, it's a -- to a very large degree, a software type of business with very healthy gross margins, only the yields start being the hardware there. And then you can anticipate that it will continue to grow going into our 2020 plan. It's part of helping us on the accretion of the gross margin to a 50% level.

I know that there was some questions asked about this. But the big order number of roughly EUR 500 million, sounds like this is really 3D NAND.

And we know that the Korea fab in China's full, and the only fab this big is the one that's still searching for a technology partner.

For Q1, our net sales came in at EUR 1.33 billion. This included system sales of EUR 856 million, of which memory represented 42%, with logic representing 58%. Service and field option sales came in at EUR 477 million. Our gross margin for the quarter came in at 42.6%, slightly above our guidance. R&D expenses came in at EUR 275 million and SG&A expenses came in at EUR 89 million, essentially as guided. 
Regarding the order book. Q1 system bookings came in at EUR 835 million. At this level, it's 30% below our prior quarter bookings. I would guess that some listeners might find this confusing relative to our guidance, which includes a 30% increase in Q2 revenues. We'd like to remind you that we are not an order-driven company and that the order patterning varies from customer to customer. Therefore, our bookings are not always a real indication of our near-term business opportunity. However, you can clearly see that our Q1 bookings have changed the complexion of our backlog in a way that supports our Q2 guide of growing strengths in logic and flattening in memory. I can also tell you that we expect strong logic bookings in Q2. Just as a further reference in this regard, I would like to draw your attention to our consolidated statement of operations found on Slide 21 of our Q1 2016 results presentation, where you can see the lumpy nature of our bookings over the last 5 quarters as well. 
Turning to the balance sheet, quarter-over-quarter cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments came in at EUR 3.14 billion. Our free cash flow for the quarter was negative EUR 65 million. This was expected since we received a significant amount of customer prepayments on orders received in Q4, where free cash flow totaled EUR 864 million. We expect free cash flow to return to a more normal level in Q2. Year-to-date, through the 3rd of April, we repurchased 2.7 million shares for EUR 223 million as part of our newly announced EUR 1.5 billion share buyback program for 2016 and 2017 combined. 
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations and guidance for the second quarter of 2016. We expect Q2 total revenue of approximately EUR 1.7 billion. Due to recent demand forecast increases, we now expect continued stable memory shipments for the rest of this calendar year. Memory shipments for the second half of the year should be roughly equal to shipments for the first half of the year. Logic shipments in Q1 were primarily for the 28-nanometer node. We expect some level of continued capacity adds throughout the year at this node, and as mentioned last quarter, we expect a strong pickup of total logic shipments in Q2 in support of 10-nanometer production ramps. Our current view of combined logic indicates that the second half of the year will be greater than the first half of the year, the extent being determined by ultimate 10-nanometer ramp levels in 2016. 
Last quarter, service and field option sales came in at EUR 477 million and is anticipated to grow throughout the year. We continue to plan on a year-over-year increase of approximately 10% in 2016. This part of our business's growth continues to be driven by strong demand for Holistic Lithography options, high-value upgrades and a growing installed base. 
Gross margin for Q2 is expected to come in at around 42%. Gross margin will be significantly influenced by revenue recognition of 2 EUV systems in the quarter. Our second quarter net sales guidance includes about EUR 110 million for EUV. As previously stated, we can only recognize part of the system revenue but must recognize the full cost. This, along with an initial low profitability on EUV, will cause a negative impact of approximately 5 percentage points on the gross margin for Q2, which is included in our guidance. R&D expenses for the second quarter will be about EUR 270 million, and SG&A is expected to come in at about EUR 90 million, both roughly at the same levels as the previous quarter. 
Peter will talk more about the status of our EUV program, but I would like to mention that we completed the shipment of 1 EUV system in Q1. This shipment will lead to revenue in 2017. We expect to ship 1 additional system in Q2. 
And finally, at our upcoming Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on April 29, shareholders will vote on our proposal to increase our dividend by 50% to a level of EUR 1.05 per ordinary share. We fully expect that this proposal will be supported by our shareholders. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to you, Peter.",792
388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2016",2016-04-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3702.0,960081.0,40755497.0,Presenter Speech,P. Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Wolfgang. As Wolfgang highlighted, our first quarter results were very much in line with expectations, and our business is developing along the lines that we communicated over the last 2 quarters. While Wolfgang gave the qualitative outlook for 2016 with combined memory appearing flattish half over half, with combined logic up in H2 over H1, and with combined services up half over half as well, we do see trends and developments that we believe are worthwhile mentioning. 
First one, despite a difficult pricing environment in DRAM, our forecast has further strengthened a bit in support of a continued drive by our customers to keep shrinking cost and specifically for low 20-nanometer and sub 20-nanometer nodes. This has resulted in our current flattish half-over-half sales view for our combined memory business. 
For 3D NAND, shipments continue to new fabs and to fabs preparing for 2D to 3D conversions. And of course, we are watching with interest the developments in the volume introduction of the cross-point architecture as it will become quite litho intensive in time versus the 3D NAND architecture. 
Secondly, as mentioned in previous earnings calls and evidenced by our backlog, it is clear that our sales to our combined logic customers will be become more important starting in the second quarter. This will continue as we are expecting a continued increase in logic orders in the coming quarter in support of initial 10-nanometer node ramps. And as a result, we now forecast the significant increase in combined system and service and field option sales in Q2 to be at the level of EUR 1.7 billion. Also of note in the first quarter, we saw shipments for 28-nanometer logic capacity additions continue. 
I would like to make an observation here regarding logic node ramp behavior. Looking at the ramp speed, size and length of the latest, most advanced nodes, it appears to us that the rollout pattern of such nodes is changing. Previously, node transitions followed each other in a rather predictable pattern throughout our entire logic customer base, whereby new nodes ramp quickly in turn, ending the capacity ramp of the previous node concurrently. Obviously, today, effectively starting with the 28-nanometer node, is that the initial new node ramp is done by a very limited number of customers, but with greater intensity, meaning speed and initial size of the ramp. Then the rest of the node ramp is executed over a prolonged period, whereby the rest of the logic customer base follows the initial customers in phases. Current evidence of this trend is the aforementioned continued shipments for 20-nanometer logic capacity additions, this still continuing more than 4 years after the initial introduction. 
In discussions with our logic customers, we see similar capacity expansion behavior over time for future nodes. With litho intensity rising significantly node by node, initial node transitions are lengthening to 3 years, with the aforementioned longer tail end of previous nodes. This will likely make shipments and order patterns for a specific node as well as the ultimate wafer capacities less transparent over time. However, based on the input from industry analyst forecasts of end-market developments, we believe that our long-term assumption of a 10% node-on-node reduction of the ultimate installed wafer capacity is still appropriate. As you all know, this was one of the pillars underlying the simulation leading to our EUR 10 billion sales target by 2020. 
As for the 10-nanometer node, its introduction is clearly progressing. The speed and initial size of this ramp can be explained by the value proposition provided by the significant strength of this node versus the prior node. The ultimate spend levels for logic in 2016 will depend on, amongst other things, both the level of end demand and the rate at which our customers will be able to execute their ramps. This is why it is still a bit too early to predict the overall 2016 spend levels today. For field options and services, we see continued strength in 2016, and this should show growth, as previously estimated, in the range of 10% over 2015. 
On the [indiscernible] product side, we continued to focus R&D spend on lithography products that are essential to the ramp of our current and advanced processes. In DPV, addressing the growing litho challenges of complex and lithography-intense multipass patterning, our recently launched TWINSCAN NXT:1980 with significant improvements in all key performance metrics has rapidly reached productivity of more than 4,000 wafers per day, demonstrating the maturity of our latest NXT platform. 
In Holistic Lithography, we started rolling out our YieldStar 350 (sic) [YieldStar 350E] integrated metrology system. YieldStar enables highly accurate metrology for subsequent analysis in ASML's Holistic Lithography software products, which allows customers to control leading-edge production processes for increased yield. Holistic Lithography products are now expanding into EUV processes, with customers evaluating our EUV source mask optimization software for development of 7- and 5-nanometer logic technologies. 
In EUV, you're all aware that our continued focus has been on improving EUV stability, availability and productivity, the key performance metrics that drive new technology adoption. Expect no changes in this focus for the foreseeable future. In the past 3 months, we again demonstrated improved productivity and availability, moving EUV towards manufacturing readiness. By way of example, we achieved productivity of more than 1,350 wafers per day in our factory on an NXE:3350, bringing us closer to our 1,500 wafer per day target for 2016. Separately, 3 customers showed availability of more than 80% on average for 4 weeks on the NXE:3300s. In addition, industry-leading customers presented an abundance of EUV results at the SPIE Advanced Lithography conference this past quarter that reinforce the need for EUV and demonstrated real and significant progress in key 2 performance areas, making increased customer confidence in EUV for manufacturing insertion apparent. ASML's commitment remains to do everything within our capability and power to bring EUV to manufacturing readiness. 
Now with that, we would be happy to take your questions.",996

And then it's going to remain at about that level for rest of the year. Is that a reasonable assumption on how I'm looking at the memory shipments?

Wennink,,Executives,18,"Yes, the 3350s, we started shipping 3350s, 2 in the fourth quarter of last year, one in this quarter. Takes about 6 months to install and to qualify the process. Somewhere in this quarter, the second quarter, you will see the first tools released, which actually drives the partial revenue recognition that we just guided. So when that is done, then customers start preparing their integration wafers, and then they should be running them in what we call marathon tests of sometimes months, sometimes quarters. We've actually done, as matter of comparison, with one of our customers on a 3300, by the way, which involved 13 weeks, so that's one quarter. Now this will then start in Q2, so somewhere in Q3, we will see the first results. And results will be focusing on metrics that we just talked about. It's productivity, availability. That's what they will be looking at, and we expect that customers will repeat what we have seen in our own factory, simply because we have the 3350 there since the second half of last year. We have done internal tests also. So what you need to track is really data coming out of the customers, and we will support you also with that by the time those marathon tests have been run at the customers, and we'll give you the data [indiscernible] productivity.",227

Marathon tests for customer where could be focusing at different productivity levels, but we would like to see in the installed base, the capability shown several times. And we can do 1,500 wafers per day by the end of the year. Don't forget that customers don't run 1,500 wafers per day at the current level of the N7 rollout.

So none of it actually is recorded in R&D. Your expectation should be that we're currently running at the EUR 1.1 billion level. We're pretty stable on that, and I would expect that it stays at that level as we continue to invest in EUV. But then also in what prolongs EUV, INA [ph], Holistic Lithography. So for planning purposes, I would just keep it at that level. And just to be safe, in our EUR 10 billion model by 2020, we have modeled 13%. That would give us some room to grow and invest here.

I mean, in logic, we were pretty clear in both mine and Peter's remarks, logic will be higher in the second half than in the first half. The ramp's not a one quarter affair. Q3 is pretty strong. Q4, it remains to be seen just how our customers tape out with their customers and what the yields are and so forth. Our memory is stable. And then you see field options and services. We haven't talked about that yet. With the modest start into the year, but every quarter now, it should be better than the prior quarter and that will lead us to a 10% increase also year-over-year. So it's also quite a bit better in the second half than the first half. So it's relatively safe to assume that the second half is going to be stronger than the first half of the year.

So that's why we rather not do a quantitative guide right now. But we're looking pretty good for the year and also for Q3.",220

This is Wolfgang. A little bit -- something that we got to consider over time. We actually called this field option and services, that EUR 477 million bundle. What you see is that -- and we got to, quite frankly, consider in the future whether we report on this slightly different. The service portion, which is dependent on certain projects like relocations but mainly on the installed base, is a relatively stable, slowly growing number. What brings the volatility into the combined installed base related revenue are the field options and services. And those include everything from a software option to very, very complex SNEP upgrades that can go into the EUR 20 million or so, or even higher than that. And those vary quarter-by-quarter. You have seen the exact same thing last year, by the way. Our Q1 in last year was also -- it was just a tad over EUR 400 million, so we're up 20% year-over-year. So the service portion is pretty stable and then the option for field options is the one that brings a little bit volatility in it. But in summary, we look at our forecast, and we're very confident that we grow the number year-over-year by about 10% or so.",212

And you're right, I mean, the consequence of what we said is if we have quarters now where we have partial the revenue and full cost, we will have in the future quarters where we have partial revenue and no cost. So we'll -- it will be accretive to a level in a future quarter. It's very difficult for us because it depends on various things, and it varies customer by customer. It's very difficult for us to pinpoint that and, therefore, we'd rather don't give you few numbers. But directionally, it will be accretive in the future, of course.",139

And I guess, as a follow-up here, it sounds like not only a 10-nanometer ramp, but also a nice fall through 16, 14 spend. And if we -- I believe exited last year with about 250,000 wafer starts of equipment shipped, plus what you're expecting here as well as the EDA guys talking about tapeouts of 250, 300 to date. Curious, that down 10% node to node that you're talking about, is that something that you actually see at 20, 16, 14? Or does that start at 10 in your view, given the robust tapeouts to date at the 16, 14 level?",104

Wennink,,Executives,48,"Well, it actually start in our simulation, in our estimates, it starts at 20, 16. But like I said in the comments, in the early comments that we made, is that as of 28-nanometer, we see this pattern of this prolonged node. 24% of our system sales in the first quarter was 28-nanometer, which is, of course, more than 4 years after its initial introduction. It's a significant amount of units going to a relatively mature node. When we look at the comments customer currently make about the 20- and the 16-nanometer node intensity rising, we expect the same thing. When we look at the 10-nanometer node, we see the initial ramp being relatively speedy by only very few customers. And that also means that when we talk to the other logic customers, their plans of going to 10-nanometer is a couple of years down the road. So the same pattern that we see in 28 is going to repeat itself. Now when we look at the industry analyst reports, and we take a couple of analyst reports of -- and the analyst firms, Gartner, [indiscernible] Research and those. And we look at what the current expectation is of the end markets that we currently know, and it's all the products that we currently know, like PCs and the tablets and the servers and the automotive. And nothing new in there, like IoT, because nobody knows what that is. So let's take what we know and we look at the conservative estimates and the changed estimates based on the most current insight [indiscernible] the PC market. We can calculate the number of bits -- the bit growth going forward. And the bit growth, we can then translate, looking at the road map of our customers into strategies, wafers that need to be processed. We add it all up, and we look at the forecast. We just come to a number, yes, that is for those nodes. It's about a 10% node-to-node reduction. It's based on what we currently know, and then based on what we currently see. It's based on what customers tell us, which is corroborated by the analyst firms. And that is actually what we've used to calculate our EUR 10 billion by 2020 number. And this is how we do it. And everything that we currently see points into that direction, the 10% node-on-node capacity reduction. But the nodes will be extended. That's going to be the message.",411

My first question was just on the EUV revenue recognition. So it's clear that I think the -- you take the full cost, only half the revenue. And I think you also mentioned that, certainly, the EUV tool you're shipping in Q1, you don't expect it to generate any revenues in this year. So I'm just wondering how we should think about the balance of this year in terms of revenues. And then also looking into 2017, because I think by then you probably would've built up by a backlog of, I guess, 6 or 7 EUV tools for which you may have recognized half, possibly less, in a gross margin dilutive fashion. So I'm just wondering how we should think about, from a phasing perspective, about that.",132

First of all, we shipped one system in Q1. We're planning to ship one in Q2. That leaves 4 to 5 in Q3, Q4. If you recall, some of the systems are actually the 3300 that customers have already paid for. Some were getting some enhancements. Those will lead to quicker revenue, so you can expect some revenue there in the second half. And then we are also making progress on the maturity of the product and the predictability of the installation process. And you see, for instance, we said on these 2 systems, the 110, we previously said midyear, now we're saying it's in Q2. So you see we're making some progress, which also makes it also easier for us to recognize revenue. I won't give you a number here, but the additional units that we are shipping plus some of the performance milestones on the revenue that we already recognized, that we may achieve this year, will certainly lead to more EUV revenue this year. And next year, you're right, there's going to be a carryover amount. I mean, we're shipping certain shipments that have no revenue this year, so we'll have it next year. Plus then, as Peter mentioned before, we're ready to do like a system there on top of that per month that will be a bit back-end loaded from a shipment perspective. But if you go to a 7-nanometer insertion or 7-nanometer equivalent, and we talked earlier about DRAM going to be around the same time, and you look at order lead times, people will have to take delivery starting end of '17 and beginning of '18. So yes, you will have a carryover. It's hard to tell you what that number is, plus we're going to ship more systems next year. So the revenue will be -- plus the predictability of the installation will go up, which in general means you can recognize earlier. So the EUV revenue should be quite a bit up next year versus this year.",344

Wennink,,Executives,52,"And I think I can't help you any further in that sense, only to mention that 2016 and '17 will be complex in terms of revenue recognition, and that's unfortunately, what it is. There's very strict accounting rules for new technology. We have to follow them. And on top of that, the first customers that actually place the orders and put certain criteria in their performance criteria, those are not the same for every customer, where the first customer actually took the first -- gave us the first orders without knowing less than the second customer. So our ability to negotiate terms and conditions and certain performance conditions with the second customer are different than -- from the first, which will be different from the third. So -- and all those performance criteria drive revenue recognition. So it is not only what Wolfgang just said. It's also the fact that per customer, it is different. We'll just have to guide you quarter by quarter. And it's unfortunately, also for us, it's not always that simple to predict when we do, what level of revenue recognition at what margin. But I think for the next 2 years, in 2016, '17, it is what it is.",205

And clearly, this time last year, we had the sizable multiyear order from Intel. I'm just wondering how the conversations are going with the others in the customer base in terms of planning for those production slots. You're clearly -- are planning on increasing the capacity to one a month, as you said. But depending on how people demand the tools or plan for that, you could see some bottlenecks. So just -- can you give us any insight as to how 2017 is -- sort of planning is firming up?",139

Wennink,,Executives,57,"Yes, I think we've also said it on the previous call. I think for next year, we have the capacity to do anywhere between 12 and 15 units. Now your question, how are the conversations going with the other customers? I think an indication of -- you can imagine how that goes. If you still like to refer back to what we said at SPIE -- or what the customers said at SPIE, there was a lot of good data coming out of the customer base that showed a lot of confidence in the fact that EUV will reach manufacturing maturity. Now you have to remember that those presentations are very often done by the R&D people of our customers, and then people have to run the tools and they have to commit output to their customers, other people in operations. So the discussion that we're currently having are with the operations people, and they are about availability and levels of productivity, where they have given a certain targets and we have given them our internal targets, and they would like to see them. They would like to see them running at the 3350, which is going to be the production tool, together with the 3400. And this is exactly the phase that we're in. We're shipping 3350s to the key customers. They're in installation or they're -- in this quarter, will -- some of them will be turned over to the customer, and then we'll see the first results. And that will drive also the order interaction with us and the customers. So to be very honest, I think it's just a matter of time this year that we will see a follow on. We're confident that what we see in our factory, we can repeat at the customer side. That will drive orders, just like you said. If you want to ship 12 to 15 units next year, orders need to come, and they will come.",328

Like I said, that's pretty stable and that is growing with the installed base, of course. And then the other half in average, sometimes a little bit more than half, sometimes a little less, are various field options in all of our businesses. That will also be the case for EUV. But a prominent one is the SNEP upgrade, which is basically -- it stands for system node enhancement package, which is basically a complete open-heart surgery on a scanner where you, for instance, can make a 1950 a 1970 or even beyond that. Those are -- have been introduced last year in volume, with quite a few there, and that provided for one of the step functions. We often get asked why is your system revenue flattening out, and part of the reason is because we are providing a win-win alternative to the customer. It helps them with capital intensity and we're getting an option where the economics for us are acceptable as well. And then in the past, you may remember, for -- we had several onetime events that give us growth spurts. For instance, we included Cymer at 1 year. That's quite a big business as well. And now we're at a pretty decent level. Last year, it was 1/3 of our business. It's about, oh, EUR 2 billion plus, and we continue to believe that it's growing at least as strong as the rest of our business and that's pretty exciting for us.",263

Wennink,,Executives,82,"Yes, I think in our long-term financial model, we have included, as you pointed out, we have included the possibility of our customers making use of the reuse capability. And what we're currently seeing is that it's still in line with what we are planning. And that has -- is because, like Wolfgang pointed out, these upgrades are open-heart surgeries in the field and they're planned per node. So when we discuss a node with a customer, a 7-nanometer node for instance, there is an assumption in there, in the discussion with the customer because of the higher litho intensity, how much of that litho intensity will be split between increase of new systems versus upgrades of existing systems. So we have a pretty good view as to how do customers think, and we work that thinking into our long-term planning. So it's pretty consistent but it's not a surprise because we're actually [indiscernible]",154

Wennink,,Executives,84,"And to be honest, we also -- when we look at 28-nanometer, where -- with some customers, we actually planned reuse of the equipment. Where given the strength of the 28-nanometer node, it -- they've got customer reuse. I mean, we never got to the point. While with older customers that have 28-nanometer node, it was not that successful. And we reused it in 14 or in 16 or in 20. So it's a bit different per customer but also the ultimate size of the capacity in a particular node will also determine how much reuse there will be. Older customers will keep using the machine as is.",108

So one question in the previous 1 to 2 logic node transitions. Your bookings were at high levels for about 3 to 4 quarters. And given the 10% node-to-node reduction you mentioned, and also the quicker ramp out of few customers that you're seeing right now for 10-nanometer, is it fair to assume that the 10-nanometer ramp will be probably 1 to 2 quarters shorter than previous node transition and probably, the booking euro amount will be smaller?",90

Wennink,,Executives,90,"I think because if the litho intensity goes up, it's not likely the bookings amount will be smaller. It's not likely. So -- and also, you have to -- I tried to explain in my introductory statements or that these nodes, if you talk about a ramp of a node or a node to a total capacity, it takes a very long time. It has a very long tail end, so there will be an initial ramp. And since the pattern is changing, it's very difficult to compare the initial, let's say, first 2, 3, 4 quarters of a new node with the nodes -- with the previous ones. But I would summarize it like this: I said the number of customers that -- over the last couple of years have been able to start an initial new logic node has shrunk. There's only a very few. They are more aggressive in ramping the first part of that node because they have to make sure that they can provide their key customers with wafers. So that's what you will see. And then you have a long tail end. So I don't think you can draw any conclusions from that other than that the nodes will be longer, and that the litho intensity will go up. Hence, when you also look at the need for EUV, ASML is looking to grow its top line, and we still stick to our simulated number by 2020, EUR 10 billion.",246

For Q2, our net sales came in at a very strong EUR 1.74 billion, including system sales of EUR 1.25 billion, driven by logic, which represented 65% of sales, with memory representing the balance. 
Service and field option sales came in at EUR 486 million. System sales included partial revenue for 2 EUV systems of approximately EUR 100 million, as forecasted at the beginning of last quarter. During the quarter, we shipped an additional EUV 3350 system, which will lead to revenue in 2017. 
Our gross margin for the quarter came in at 42.6%, slightly above our guidance. R&D expenses came in at EUR 270 million, and SG&A expenses came in at EUR 90 million, both essentially as we guided.
Regarding the order book. Q2 system bookings came in at almost EUR 1.6 billion. This represents a near doubling of orders from the previous quarter and demonstrates again the lumpy nature of our bookings that we discussed in April. As suggested in our last call, our booking strength came from the logic sector, supporting the 10-nanometer volume ramp plans of our customers. 
The growing strength in logic and flattening in memory also supports our previous commentary that the balance of 2016 will be logic-driven against the stable backdrop of memory spend. We took orders for 4 new EUV systems, bringing our total EUV production tool order book to 10 systems valued at about EUR 1 billion. Our overall system backlog now adds up to approximately EUR 3.4 billion.
Turning to the balance sheet. Quarter-over-quarter cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments came in at EUR 2.93 billion. Our free cash flow for the quarter returned to a more normal level of EUR 381 million after 2 quarters of quite varied cash flows due to significant amount of customer prepayments on orders received in Q4, in turn, resulting in a negative free cash flow for Q1.  During Q2, we paid out 2015 dividend worth EUR 446 million and executed share buybacks worth EUR 164 million.
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations and guidance for the third quarter of 2016. We expect Q3 total net sales of approximately EUR 1.7 billion. As indicated by our backlog, logic shipment strength in Q2 is set to continue in Q3. We do not expect any EUV system revenue in Q3. We expect to ship 1 EUV 3350 system in Q3, leading to partial system revenue in Q4. 
Last quarter, service and field option sales came in at EUR 486 million. We continue to plan a year-over-year increase of approximately 10% in 2016 for this portion of our business. Here, growth continues to be driven by strong demand for Holistic Lithography options, high-value upgrades and the growing installed base. For Q3, we expect field options and services revenue of well above EUR 500 million.
For the full year, we expect overall sales to exceed our 2015 record year. The ultimate level will depend on the timing of EUV revenue recognition as well as the size of the initial ramp of 10/7 nanometer capacity at our logic customers.
Gross margin for Q3 is expected to come in at around 47%. R&D expenses for the third quarter will be about EUR 275 million, and SG&A is expected to again come in at about EUR 90 million.
Regarding share buybacks, I would like to mention that we will pause our share buyback program for a few quarters while we are in the midst of the HMI acquisition process. At this time, we, however, expect to complete the EUR 1.5 billion program for 2016 and 2017, which we announced earlier this year.
And finally, a couple of comments on our intent to acquire HMI, as announced on June 16. On July 4, we placed 2 Eurobonds totaling EUR 1.5 billion. The proceeds have been received after quarter-end and are intended to be used for partial financing of the acquisition. We expect the acquisition to close in Q4 of 2016, subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of HMI shareholders scheduled to occur on August 3 and government regulatory approvals from Taiwan, Korea, Singapore and the United States.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to you, Peter.",710
388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3636.0,1008979.0,42506887.0,Presenter Speech,P. Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Wolfgang. As Wolfgang highlighted, our business continues to perform well. We took systems orders of almost EUR 1.6 billion and posted sales of EUR 1.7 billion, which were very much in line with the prior expectations. Hence, our business is developing along the lines that we communicated over the last few quarters. 
While Wolfgang reviewed our outlook for the balance of 2016, there are a couple of things I believe are worthwhile highlighting. First, our memory business continues to remain fairly robust, with DRAM orders and shipments supporting continued shrink for cost, mostly to low 20-nanometer and sub-20-nanometer nodes. 
Meanwhile, NAND manufacturers continue to qualify their 3D NAND products and are ramping their processes through new fab constructions as well as all the 2D NAND fab conversions. 
Secondly, as seen in our second quarter results, evidence of the 10-nanometer logic ramp is now clear as our sales to our combined logic customers has developed as expected. This will continue in Q3, supported by strong orders in Q2. 
As a result, we see combined sales in Q3 at the level of EUR 1.7 billion. And as mentioned on previous occasions, the ultimate spend levels for logic in 2016 will depend on, amongst other things, both the level of end demand and the rate at which our customers will be able to execute their 10/7 nanometer ramps. 
On the ASML product side, let me jump straight into a discussion on the development of our EUV business. In EUV, you're all aware that our continued focus has been on improving EUV stability, availability and productivity, which are the key performance metrics that drive new technology adoption. The latest progress on these metrics was shared at SEMICON West last week, and we have observed a peak wafer per day performance of 1,488 wafers and recorded system availabilities of over 80% on 5 field installed systems. These are encouraging results showing continued progress in EUV industrialization, allowing for a growing customer confidence towards production adoption.
We've shipped 2 EUV systems year-to-date and are on target to ship an additional 4 to 5 systems this year, for which we have purchase orders in hand. 
We believe that the intake of 4 EUV production orders from 2 different customers this quarter, when added to our existing 6 orders, strongly signals the intent of our customers to insert EUV into production at the next full node transition. We expect our order book for production systems to continue to grow in the coming quarters, filling up our 2017 shipment capacity of approximately a dozen systems.
The tools shipped over the next 12 to 18 months will support integration and device qualification using EUV technology for production insertion at the logic sector's 7-nanometer node and the DRAM sector's mid-teens node. 
In deep UV, the rollout of our TWINSCAN NXT:1980 immersion system is progressing well. Since introduction, we've shipped a total of 23 systems and upgraded an additional 5 systems at customer sites to NXT:1980 specifications. We've also installed an enhanced version of the TWINSCAN XT:1460 ArF dry system with a 40% improvement in matched machine overlay, demonstrating our commitment to continue to improve the performance of our dry lithography product portfolio. 
In Holistic Lithography, we have shipped multiple YieldStar 350 metrology systems to our leading customers to support the qualification and ramp of the 10/7 nanometer logic node. And we have also released the new version of our process window enhancement software suite, involving resolution enhancement techniques aimed at helping to maximize manufacturing yield for EUV and immersion-based lithography at the 7- and 5-nanometer logic and the 1x memory nodes. 
Related to Holistic Lithography, as announced in June, we have submitted an offer to acquire Hermes Microvision, it is also our clear intent to create, through the combination of HMI's industry-leading EUV metrology technology and our unique Holistic Lithography product offering, a new class of products for patterning control, creating customer value through improved yield and time to market in their pursuit of the extension of Moore's Law.
And finally, as suggested last quarter, expect no changes in our business focus for the foreseeable future. Support of our customers' clear intent of moving EUV into production is our #1 priority. Increasing customer confidence in EUV for manufacturing readiness is critical at this point in time. ASML remains committed to do everything within our capability and power to bring EUV to manufacturing readiness. 
And with that, we would be happy to take your questions.",745

My question is -- I mean, clearly, Peter, you're seeing very  strong order -- sales trends into the third quarter. How do you see EUV -- I mean, your sales trends into the fourth quarter in terms of EUV? Do you expect to -- of these tools that you’re going to ship this year are -- is there -- you just mentioned on -- in the earlier conversation that you mentioned that there was some -- one tool to be recognized in Q4. Are there likely to be more of those tools that ship in Q4 recognized in Q4 itself? Or is that going to be a 2017 phenomenon? And then secondly, regarding early part of 2017, with the foundry 10-nanometer ramp coming to an end by the end of this year, how do you see -- what do you see developing in the first half of next year before the whole -- you would probably will get a lot of EUV-related orders in the second half of next year given that production starts in 2019. So how do you see developments in the first half of 2017?",189

I'll answer the second part of the question. I think on the revenue recognition part, I'll ask -- I'll refer to Wolfgang. As you said, the foundry 10-nanometer ramp, ending towards the end of the year. As we know, the 10-nanometer ramp for foundry is, in fact, a part of a, let's say, bigger logic node, what you call the 10/7 nanometer node. So what we will see in 2017, the 7-nanometer node is expected to be as a strong and a large node. We expect that in 2017, the continuation is almost a logical evolution from 10-nanometer into the 7-nanometer node to happen. Now -- and you're correct that for 2018 on EUV, we said it before, our production capacity in 2018 will double from 2017. And with the current customer focus on the introduction of EUV in the next logic nodes, yes, we do expect that we will see an order flow in 2017 for EUV to support a shipment capacity and, I think, also the shipment demand from our customers in 2018.",176

That's why we can't guide for the full year. But I think there are several elements that I can summarize. First of all, we just recognized partial revenue for 2 systems last quarter. It is expected that we meet more of the performance metrics this year, so there will be additional revenue coming in, in the fourth quarter. Secondly, we have a shipment that's going out in Q3 that will also have partial revenue recognition in Q4. Thirdly, we will have shipped 3 systems by the end of Q3, so that leaves 3 to 4 systems in Q4. And amongst those systems, are systems where we have the opportunity to recognize revenue if we ship it in time and the customer accepts it in time that would enable us to recognize revenue also in the fourth quarter. And namely, those are the systems that were originally 3300s, where the customers have requested certain upgrades and have requested shipment. So there, it depends a little bit on the timing. So those are the 3 main revenue drivers for Q4. And on top of that, you'll have a little bit of option, service and other EUV-related revenue that's also relatively difficult to predict at this point. So nothing in Q3 but then a more meaningful number in Q4. And we'll focus on shipping and performing, and then the revenue in Q4 should be very healthy on EUV. I hope that helps, Sandeep.",266

Yes, I also had 2, so I wanted to just continue on the question on the fourth quarter. So I think you've laid out the kind of EUV puts and takes, but also, you set the kind of length of the 10-nanometer and then 7-nanometer node. And I think you also just said that you expect that to continue into next year. I think TSMC raised CapEx. They also started to have more customer interest at 7 than they had previously expected. So I guess my question is, how conservative is the implied revenue run rate which, I believe, is around EUR 1.6 billion for Q4, as you see things right now? And then my second question was on EUV. You have a backlog of 10 tools now. Could you just kindly let us know how many customers make up those 10 tools? And also, what is the magnitude of potential further orders in the second half of this year? Or will 2017 be a bigger year or meaningfully bigger year potentially for EUV orders? Just so we can -- we know what to look for.",193

To answer your first question on the 10/7 nanometer continuation, we said it's going to be in 2017. I think what we're hearing our foundry customers say is that 7-nanometer is what they're focusing on. It's not only a single customer, but every foundry customer that we're having and is talking to us about leading edge, they talk about 7. So yes, I do think we will see that continuation in 2017. I don't think it has a major impact yet in Q4. It will have an impact in 2017 onwards. So I think for Q4, we're not guiding for Q4, but I don't think you should see a significant upside in that particular quarter. That upside in that 7-nanometer ramp will definitely happen next year. Now the backlog of the 10 tools, how many customers do we have in the backlog, we currently have 3 customers in the backlog. And the magnitude for orders in the second half of the year, I said it in my prepared comments. I believe that by the end of the year, we'll have an order book that will be at a level whereby we can ship our entire production capacity for 2017, which is about a dozen tools. So 2017, definitely, I think if you look at the customer roadmaps and you look at the customer roadmaps for the next-generation logic node and also the mid-teens DRAM, then 2018, beginning 2019, that will be where first risk production will start. That means that tools need to be in, and that means that 2017 must see more orders than in 2016 for EUV because that ramp profile, I think our capacity is probably a good indication of the customer demand, and our capacity can actually double from 2018 as compared to 2017. So yes, then we must also see more orders, and we will.",311

Yes, I think that's -- clearly, EUV is focused on the mid-teens DRAM node. And I'm not going to go into customer specifics, but you can imagine that leaders act first. And how many tools will we ship? This is the first. It's clear that others will follow, but we also need to put it into perspective. I mean, our expectation is that EUV will be used at mid-teen DRAM node for about 2 layers. So I'd say it's a sizable business, but the number of layers is limited. So yes, there will be more tool orders following. It will not stay with this 1 or 2. It will be indeed more, but it's not a level of lay accounts that we see in the advanced logic nodes for our logic customers.",135

And then if I could follow up on your 4Q outlook. Can you kind of, I guess, help us out in terms of thinking -- in terms of the uncertainty, how much of it is related to the timing of EUV recognition as opposed to uncertainty as to what demand will look like for 10- and 7-nanometer DUV tools? And as part of that question, do you expect DUV to actually decline q-on-q in Q4 as there's a pause at the Tier 1 foundry maker as they move from 10- to 7-nanometer?",94

First of all, let me -- in my script, I said that the record level of 2015, that we would exceed that. So in that sense, albeit to Peter's point, don't expect there huge upsides, but we will clearly view that at this point as some sort of a floor. And then you can see in the EUV, like I mentioned, the 3300s, the upgraded 3300s, if they're recognized -- or not recognized, I mean, that's EUR 60 million, EUR 70 million tools, so it's pretty substantial. And to the 10/7-nanometer ramp, somebody mentioned earlier that TSMC has raised their CapEx budget by EUR 0.5 billion. They seem to be pretty confident. I'd like to just remind you that one of these tools is EUR 50 million, and it can very easily be that 2 or 3 tools go to the left or the right of a quarter, and then it's also a pretty substantial difference. As it relates to Q1, 2, 3, 4 revenue recognition, again, we will guide you as we ship these tools. But we ship, like we said, 3 to 4 tools in the last quarter of the year, so they will not all recognize in the last quarter. So you should assume that we're going on to a more regular EUV revenue flow. Also, quite frankly, as we show, that we can reliably install these tools, and we can, therefore, like we discussed on prior calls, hopefully recognize at least portions of it much closer to shipment date rather than waiting for the complete installation in the field. So 2017 will make these all a little bit closer connected to the shipment date. I hope this helps, C.J.",287

I had 2. I guess the first question, Peter, is again around logic. I guess I'm wondering sort of how the transition's going to look between 10 and 7, and I'm trying to compare it back to the transition between 20 and 16. 16 wasn't really a real litho shrink, so of course, there was a lot of reuse from the litho side between 20 and 16. So I'm curious what you think the reuse will be for what gets ordered for 10 to get reused at 7. Obviously, I know that there's going to be some EUV tools used at 7 that aren't being used at 10. But just sort of in general, what do you think the reuse will look like between 10 and 7?",130
388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3636.0,1008979.0,42506905.0,Answer,P. Wennink,,Executives,22,"Yes. I think that's a good question. But what we're currently planning is that, like you pointed out, the 10-nanometer node is not a very large node. They will not entirely go away. And the expectation for the 7-nanometer node, are actually, quite strong. So there's always going to be some level of reusage actually planned. We don't think that percentage reuse is going to be anything significantly different than what we saw in the past. Having said that, reuse is not something that you can generically apply over the logic or the foundry customers. I mean, some customers, they are extremely successful at a certain node, yes, or are very successful at a certain node and get also follow-on orders on that node. We've actually seen that also in the past. And they will have a very limited percentage of tools that they will apply for what we call reuse to the next node. And others are less successful in a certain node, and they do a lot of reuse for another node. So it really depends on whether the installed capacity for the 10-nanometer node currently has enough customer base. And you have to remember, it is not a lot. The 10-nanometer installed by the end of this year, maximum 35,000, 40,000. So that's not a lot. You have some big customers and you're full. And then everybody moves to 7, which will be different customers. So it's difficult to say, very customer-specific, very specific to their customer base. And what we're currently planning also in our longer-term planning is that we don't see a major shift or a major impact of that reuse model going forward.",279

And then second question for Wolfgang. Wolfgang, now that obviously, EUV is going to, I think, be inserted, at least partially, in 7-nanometer, that's clear, can you again remind us on what the margin targets will be? So maybe you need to ship x number of tools to have EUV be 30% margin. You need to ship y number of tools to have EUV be 40% gross margin. Can you give us those milepost again?",78
388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3636.0,1008979.0,42506907.0,Answer,Wolfgang Nickl,,Executives,24,"Yes. So in order to get to our 2020 target of 50% overall gross margin, we would have to arrive at 40% for EUV. Of course, we are much lower than that today. There are several elements that contribute. I think the biggest one is using our production facilities. We have built a factory that can do many more tools than we're doing this year or next year or even in 2018, so that is a big thing. The second thing is, of course, the learning curve, both at us and our suppliers, for instance, the number of hours it takes you to put one of these systems together and then the cost takedown curves at the suppliers. The third one is as you learn, you're also having less E&O, excess and obsolete due to redesigns. And also, and this is often getting overlooked, if you launch a product and you go from a 3300 to a 3350 and to a 3400, you often have to do a rework in the field that you cannot necessarily always charge, but it goes into your gross margin. And that will go away over the next 1 or 2 years. I think as a orientation, we believe, from a volume perspective, we should be in the neighborhood of 40 tools to be able to get to the 40% gross margin. And depending on the ramp up of production for 7-nanometer or 5-nanometer, respectively, in 2019 and then associated DRAM volume, I think those sorts of that volume, you could see in the 2019 time frame, so well in time for our 2020 objective.",270

Yes, so I'd like to have a bit more details about the previous question actually, because I think you said in the past that logic was 250,000 wafer per month, probably at 7-nanometer. So I think given the layers assumption, it's relatively easy to find a number of tools which are needed. I'm a bit struggling to do the same exercise for DRAM. So you know like -- let's say, if the addressable market is 60 to 80 EUV tools for logic, how much would it be for DRAM? Is it like 25%? Is it 50% of that market? Is it more? Is it less?

Wennink,,Executives,38,"Well, I can give you any number to play with and you can have several simulations, but it's what I said earlier. I think it is important to understand that the 2 layers will be 2 layers or will be more, going forward, yes? That is very important and we don't have that information yet, so that's why it's pretty difficult for us to make that particular assessment. And also, the growth of the memory market and the DRAM market is, of course, is definitely of impact. Well, I think it's -- most important here is that, I think, by 2020, we would have a capacity -- a build capacity of maximum 60 units. I'm not saying that we're going to sell all those 60 units because, like I said earlier, we don't have all the information yet to understand what our customers are planning. But that memory is going to be a significant part of our EUV business. That is clear. And like Wolfgang said, to be profitable in 2019 to a 40% gross margin level we need 40 systems. Now when we look at 2019, look at the logic part, look at the memory market, I don't think that, that 40 systems is a big challenge or a big stretch when you look at our current assumptions on the growth of the memory market and of the logic market. But how it is divided between the 2, that still remains to be seen. So you have to give us a break on this. And I can give you a couple of numbers so you can play with those numbers, but I think you can do that yourself also.",280

Just a quick follow-up. On your R&D budget, I was wondering, if suddenly you were not under the scrutiny of the public market and maybe you were a private company and you could maybe increase your R&D budget more than it is today, on what would you spend it on? And is there anything that would be great to make EUV happen even, not necessarily quicker, but in an even easier way for the customers?",76

And that means that yes, we have an R&D budget today of about EUR 1.1 billion. If we think we should, for -- in the interest of our customers and in creating value for ASML, that we need to increase that to EUR 1.2 billion or EUR 1.3 billion, we would, but we're not doing that. So I don't think there's a big difference between whether we're public or whether we're private. We're spending the money as wisely as we can. We've also said that, when we look at the EUR 10 billion target, our R&D could be about 13%, so it's EUR 1.3 billion. What will we spend that money on? I can give you some indication there. That's the next generation EUV. We have a 0.33 NA EUV tool today, which is the 3350 and 3400. And we will go to then a high NA, a higher NA, a higher numerical aperture tool in the next decade, probably seeing first shipment early next decade. We would start spending the money on that because the 3300 or the 3350 is just the first of a series. The NA improvement will drive down, the geometries will push the shrink, so that's definitely something that we would engage in. And don't worry -- I mean, our engineers, when we look at EUV and we look at our Holistic Lithography focus, they will find ways to spend EUR 1.3 billion. And if you would ask them, they will also find ways to spend EUR 1.5 billion, but we want them to spend it wisely, okay?",282

So I'm trying to wrap up, you know, like the overall picture of this EUV trajectory for logic, and when I'm thinking about how much uncertainty is left in what's going to happen in the next, let's say, 3 years, so -- I'd like to think about it in terms of timing, and when I hear you, it feels like timing is fairly nailed down, and like volume production is going to be 2019. So my first question would be, am I right thinking that's the right timing? Very unlikely things happen earlier, very unlikely things happen later. And then, I would have the same question about the volume of insertion. 6 to 9 layers, as you said, and in line with TSMC comments feels like a fairly large volume insertion of EUV, so maybe in the higher end of the range of what you've been talking, maybe a year ago. And then my last question, of course, is the volume of production, like the capacity that is going to be ramped up for the 10-nanometer node and the 7 -- sorry, for the 7- and 5-nanometer nodes. I think we got in the past about capacity declining from 1 node to the next one, around 10%, but with a fairly wide range of possible outcomes there. So how much more visibility do you have on that metric? So the first one is timing, the second one is volume of insertion and the third one is production capacity ramp up at each node.",257

Wennink,,Executives,43,"Yes, I think, Wolf -- we'll leave the third question to Wolfgang. I think on timing, I think you're about right, 2019/20 a volume introduction, which means for us, at least a year, 12 to 18 months earlier you need to start shipping. Don't forget, also, this is the first high-volume ramp of a new lithography technology in high volume manufacturing, so our customers will take a bit more time to get the tools installed, qualified, processed and it will just take us a bit more time. But from a customer perspective, 2019/20 and high volume usage, that's about the right timing. The volume of insertion, yes, the high end of the range, 6 to 9 layers, that could be. I mean, it's -- we have more insight now than we had 1 year ago. Customers have more insight now. And I think also the customers have also find -- found out, we suppose and that’s basically what we hear from them that trying to do 7-nanometer with the -- on the critical layers with multiple patterning strategies is a very costly and very painful exercise. So we're just closer to the, let's say, to the insertion points and to the decision points. Customers have done a lot more work, that's why we have a bit more clarity. And it is, indeed a -- almost somewhat of the higher end of that range that we talked about last year. But it is what it is.",245

Certainly, it was still true for the 28-ish. Actually, it exceed a bit. And we've -- our assumptions haven't changed. We assume that over time, the semiconductor growth rate will come down a little bit from what they have been in the last 10 years, so potentially approach GDP at one point in time. That's why we have modeled a 10% reduction node-over-node. So 20 16 14 would be about 270. 10, including 10 equivalent would be in the 220s and 230s, and then 7 and the 7 equivalent would be somewhere around 200. But don't forget that the litho intensity is going up for these nodes, so that's still enables us to have the revenue growth that we have forecasted. Those are our assumptions on the wafer start.",145

Wennink,,Executives,45,"And I'd like to add to that. In that last quarter, we also made it clear, I at least hope, that you see, especially in logic, that you have layers of nodes that are now on top of each other. I mean, we are still shipping 28-nanometer capacity, you know. And there is the move of those, let's say, second tier logic makers to move to 14 and 16. So these are not nodes that have ended. There is a much longer tail life of those nodes, which makes it more difficult to also predict how big nodes are going to be and how -- because the lifetime of that node is much longer than we saw 5, 6, 7, 8 years ago.",124

But to Peter's point, just a minute ago, we do have the situation that nodes are stretching out. And -- like if I can remind you about the first quarter of this year, I think it was 35% of our system revenue came from China, and a good chunk of that was driven by lagging nodes that are still very good business for our customers. And in terms of forward-looking, I mean, the exposures on new nodes will go up. And just because we are doing more with EUV in the future, it doesn't mean that the DUV business is going away. We continue to invest. As you probably know, close to half of our R&D budget on non-EUV. So we keep advancing it so that customers can get the cost down on these layers as well, and as a consequence, when you look at our 10 billion plan by 2020, the DUV business will not look much different than it does today. Somebody asked earlier about reuse. What you do see is that we help customer significantly in bringing their cost down and instead of necessarily shipping a scanner, we're also helping them to upgrade the scanners that they already have, which is capital efficient for them and very good business for us. So that continues to be a very, very good business for many years to come for us.",254

On the regulatory front, we have submitted our applications in Taiwan, in Korea and Singapore. I think that will -- should go reasonably well.

On your market share assumptions, I think we would basically show the entire market, which includes the wafer monitoring, control. It's – but also it's the high volume. All together, we think it's about 2.3. The market share assumptions that we have, I think, are not for public disclosure now. I think what is -- the most important is to realize that what we're trying to do is to create a product that does not exist today. It's -- we think that at 7 -- at sub-10-nanometer, the patent fidelity control is going to be more important with the resolutions going down, and that's why we need a different solution. And that solution is, in a sense, new, and it's driven by the uniqueness of the Holistic Lithography capabilities of ASML. That is something that you will not find in any other place. Now if you can combine that with leading e-beam, that is a very good opportunity to actually help our customers manage their yield. They have to realize also that it's -- that we need an e-beam solution, and we believe HMI is a leader and we can introduce it faster, yes? So -- but we could have also chosen as an all e-beam supplier, we could have chosen to actually partner with another e-beam manufacturer. We could have chosen to acquire e-beam, an intellectual-property, and do it ourselves. I mean, that's all been part of our assessment of how do we bring this new solution to the market that's been driven by the uniqueness of ASML Holistic Lithography. And e-beam in itself, it's a highly competitive market and HMI is a great company, and it just allows us to be faster. But it doesn't mean that, that's the only way to bring the solution that we have in mind to the market.",306

We spent quite a bit of time talking through what's happening on the foundry side and particularly with 7-nanometer growing into next year. I'm just wondering if you could help us with a bit more detail on memory as well. Clearly, it's been a slightly tougher year in terms of revenue from that customer group, particularly on the DRAM side, and it looks like we're going to be down somewhere in sort of the mid-20% range in 2016. But given what you've described about transitions and what you know about happening with 3D NAND and sort of filling some of these facilities, why wouldn't we see memory spending come back up to some of the levels that we'd seen in prior years after this more transition year?",130

Wennink,,Executives,74,"That's a good question, and I think there is no reason why we shouldn't. You just mentioned a couple of those drivers. I mean, 3D NAND is  particularly strong. There will be new constructions, new 3D NAND constructions coming online next year and they need tools. They're greenfield fabs, they need a lot more litho, so that will drive the business definitely. And as with respect to DRAM, you are correct. I mean, you could argue that we're in a bit of a slow period. And what we've mentioned on EUV insertion in DRAM is clearly, again, driven by the necessary technology transitions to reduce cost. Everything that we're currently shipping into DRAM is with those customers really focused on their next node. So it's technology transitions that are driving the DRAM demand currently. And 3D NAND, we are expecting, as you said, for 2017, definitely an increase because of the new construction sites that are coming on stream. And DRAM, yes, it's been a slow period. I would be with you if you would say well, there's an opportunity next year for the memory space. I would agree with you.",192

For Q3, our net sales came in at a very strong EUR 1.81 billion. System sales accounted for EUR 1.24 billion, driven by logic, which represented 84% of sales, with memory softening temporarily to 16%. System sales included partial revenue recognition of approximately EUR 85 million for the one EUV system we shipped during the quarter. This EUV revenue was not forecasted at the beginning of the quarter and was made possible because EUV system installation timing became predictable earlier than expected. From this point forward on new EUV shipments, a majority of revenue can be recognized at completion of system shipment. Service and field option sales for last quarter came in at a strong EUR 577 million. 
Our gross margin for the quarter came in at 46%. Gross margin was negatively impacted by 1.4 percentage points due to the partial revenue recognition of the one EUV system not originally forecasted revenue. Non-EUV gross margins came in above our expectation. R&D expenses came in at EUR 273 million, and SG&A expenses came in at EUR 89 million, both essentially as guided. At quarter end, we had to make a fair value adjustment for the foreign exchange hedging instrument that we end up into -- in connection with the planned acquisition of HMI. This adjustment reduced our net income by approximately EUR 28 million and was recorded in the interest line of our P&L. 
Shifting to the order book. Q3 system bookings came in just over EUR 1.4 billion. This included more than EUR 300 million in EUV orders. Strong bookings continued in the logic sector in support of the 10-nanometer ramps with memory bookings increasing from last quarter, supporting stronger memory shipments expected in Q4. Logic and memory booking strengths was in part due to 3 new EUV orders received from both sectors. These orders bring our total EUV system order book for 3350s and 3400s to 12 systems, valued at about EUR 1.3 billion. Our overall system backlog grew by approximately EUR 90 million to EUR 3.5 billion.
Turning to the balance sheet. Quarter-over-quarter cash, cash equivalent and short-term investments came in at EUR 4.31 billion. This includes the proceeds from 2 Eurobonds that we issued in July to partially finance our acquisition of HMI, which is expected to close later this year. Free cash flow for the quarter was a negative EUR 72 million, driven by shipment linearity in shipments for which we had received partial prepayments during the prior quarter. 
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations and guidance for the fourth quarter of 2016. We expect Q4 total net sales of between EUR 1.7 billion and EUR 1.8 billion. While logic shipments supporting 10-nanometer ramps will continue in Q4, we will see them a bit more balanced against memory shipments. We expect to ship one NXE:3300 EUV system in Q4 with an associated partial revenue recognition of approximately EUR 60 million. Furthermore, we expect recognition of deferred EUV revenue of approximately EUR 80 million in the quarter. Total 2016 EUV shipments will then come in at 4 systems, 2 systems short of our targeted minimum of 6 systems, one system the customer factory is not ready yet to receive the system, and for the other system, we experienced a delay of inbound material. The 2 systems that will move to 2017 will be incremental to our 2017 plan. As a reminder, we have a production capacity of around a dozen systems next year and expect the outstanding orders to fill up that capacity by the end of this year. We expect Q4 service and field options revenue to come in above EUR 600 million, driven by ongoing strong demand for holistic lithography options, high-value upgrades and our growing install base. 
Gross margin for Q4 is expected to come in between 47% and 48%, benefiting from the recognition of the deferred EUV revenue I mentioned earlier. R&D expenses for the fourth quarter will be about EUR 275 million, and SG&A is expected to come in at about EUR 100 million. SG&A is impacted by onetime costs, which are related to the planned acquisition of HMI. Regarding share buybacks, as mentioned last quarter, they have been paused while we're in the midst of the HMI acquisition process. 
Let me complete -- conclude with a couple of comments on the status of our acquisition of HMI, which we announced on June 16. In early August, HMI shareholders have voted in favor of the acquisition. We have received regulatory approval from CFIUS in the United States, from the Competition Commission in Singapore, from the Taiwan FTC and from the Taiwan Investment Commission for our inbound investments. We're awaiting approvals from the Korean FTC and the Taiwanese Investment Commission for an outbound investment related to the private placement in ASML shares. Closure of the acquisition is still planned for Q4 of this year, and we have begun the transfer of funds to Taiwan for final execution of the purchase. 
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to you, Peter.",851

Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Wolfgang. As Wolfgang highlighted, our business continues to perform well and as expected. He has discussed the most relevant point of the quarter and our outlook for the balance of this year. 
I would like to take a bit of time to talk about our initial view of 2017 and review the status of our EUV program and customer interaction. Although it's too early to formulate a full quantitative view about next year, we started to develop a qualitative view based upon early customer forecast and our own modeling capability. 
Both of the memory sectors are expected to show solid bit growth again next year, not too dissimilar from this year. Given the available wafer capacity in the memory industry, this, in turn, should drive our memory sales to levels of litho spend and slightly higher than this year. We expect 10-nanometer logic ramps to continue in support of the healthy demand levels for this generation of devices, as also recently confirmed by one of our large foundry customers. Service and field option sales is expected to continue to grow in 2017, well on track to support our 2020 target of around EUR 3 billion. This is, in part, driven by significant sales of scanner system upgrades supporting the efficient capital deployment of customers in the leading-edge node transitions. 
Regarding EUV in 2017, we will start to see the real impact of EUV system sales on our top line with recognition of systems shipped in the calendar year as well as pieces of remaining revenue recognition from systems shipped this year. As Wolfgang mentioned, EUV system installation timing became predictable this quarter, such that we're now able to recognize a majority of system revenues on shipments. 
You all may have heard a significant amount of, I would call it, chatter this quarter about what one might call a go or no-go issue with EUV in logic. This is understandable given the current status of EUV maturity and its related stability performance. However, let me remind you at this point that our customers are facing unprecedented imaging and overlay challenges, and that they're all convinced that this imaging technology will help to overcome those challenges. And as a result, it should be no surprise to you that our efforts are fully focused on the industrialization of this technology, specifically on the system availability of this highly capable yet complex tools. 
We believe the commitment of our customers is evidenced by the fact that we now have 12 NXE:3350 and 3400 productions systems in our backlog. We will also ship the final 2 NXE:3300 systems, one before year-end and the other in early 2017 to 2 different customers, such that they may also begin their in-house qualification of EUV for eventual production issues. This will bring the total number of customers qualifying EUV for mass production to 6, both in memory and logic sector. 
All of our base customers have now publicly announced their intent to insert EUV into their production developments. Final decisions on the exact timing of EUV insertion by our customers will vary from customer to customer. Next to the timing of customers' development programs, the number of EUV specific layers and their related planned timing of the high-volume ramp, it also depends on key 2 performance metrics, all within a fairly tight but well-defined time window. Given the current status of the aforementioned, we expect that the production insertion of EUV will require shipping systems in volume starting in the 2018, '19 time frame. 
Just to remind you of our production capability. We will be able to produce around 12 new NXE:3400 systems in 2017, doubling this in 2018 and, again, approximately doubling this in 2019. Currently, our leading EUV adoption customers are executing real pre-production layer qualifications, trusting that we will bring litho system reliability to an acceptable level for high-volume manufacturing insertion in the time frames I just mentioned. 
To finish, supporting our customers' clear intent of moving EUV into production is our #1 priority in order to ensure that our customers can execute their planned next node industrialization. ASML remains committed to do everything within our capability and power to bring EUV to manufacturing revenues as soon as possible. 
And with those comments, I will be happy to take your questions.",718

My first question is regarding EUV, Peter. I mean, the EUV seems to have reached many of the landmarks that you have talked about. You've highlighted today the 1,500 wafers per day. One of your tools is doing 90% availability. But the question I have is, is there a moment where TSMC or Intel or Samsung says, well, the EUV tool from ASML, say, NXE:3350, is now a qualified by us and we will be implementing it? Or this is not day that, that happens that this qualification is announced, and this is just an ongoing process with the customer. And I have one quick follow-up.",107

I mean, this is basically an ongoing process, and it has to do with the fact that, yes, we are reaching the targets that you just mentioned on a regular basis, that is the -- it's the variability of the tools in field or in the entire installed base that is not consistently at those levels. And I think this is really what customers and ourselves are now working on to execute on those programs that will bring that consistency, and there will be an ongoing -- that will be an ongoing process. And like I said in my introductory statement, the requirements are for us to start shipping EUV tools for insertion in high volume is, for us, the 2018 and 2019 time frame. So we have still some time, and this is exactly what we're going to use to get that consistency there so that us and our customers can take that informed decision.",164

I'm sure you've heard one of your major foundry customers' conference call last week, where they said that they believe the 7-nanometer node for them is going to be as big as the 28-nanometer node. I mean, the 28-nanometer node, as you've highlighted yourself, was a very major node at the foundries, as such. And have you taken that into account in terms of your views into 2017 in terms of growth from the foundries/logic customers?",89

And we just got the confirmation from customers that, that is, indeed, the case, and that statement that was made last year is just a confirmation of what we have believed all along. So yes, we will see a continuation -- a strong continuation. And let's be honest, 2016 was a strong logic year for us, and we see that continuing into 2017.

So once you recognize the EUR 80 million in Q4, can you share with us what deferred revenues will be remaining, and then as part of that, how we should think about what percentage of ASP will be revenued immediately upon shipment? And then lastly, how should we think about gross margin trajectory now that you're revenue-ing upon shipment in the calendar '17 time frame?",91
388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2016",2016-10-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3657.0,1059537.0,44397656.0,Answer,Wolfgang Nickl,,Executives,13,"Okay. I will take this, C.J. First, on deferred revenue. First of all, it's, in our mind, a significant achievement that we now have this predictability of the installation because that takes one of the big hurdles to recognize revenue, in the same way as DUV, away. So we basically have 2 elements, we have the shipment and then we have certain fulfillments criteria that we have to achieve later on. So in this particular case, it was a 3350. You know what the price of that tool is. It's in the mid-90s, so you can do the math what we're going to recognize for that tool in 2017, I guess. The performance criteria is linked to the targets that Peter mentioned in his remarks. So as we are achieving these, you should expect us in the next year, 2017, to also recognize that part closer to shipment. So also in Peter's remarks, already we said that for the 2017 shipments, we'll recognize the majority. And I have to tell you, it's a little bit different customer by customer. But it is the majority, as you have just seen from this 3350. We will be not only able to recognize the majority of revenue closer to the shipment, but we will also catch up from this year's shipment. So we shipped units, for instance, in the first half of the year that we'll see no revenue in 2016, so you'll see catch up there, so very pleased with that. In the meantime, while we're working through the last couple of bumps there to get to the DUV-like revenue recognition, we will update you on a quarterly basis on what the revenue will look like. Just like we did it for Q4, we have one system at EUR 60 million, but then we have deferred revenue coming in at an additional EUR 80 million. As it relates to the gross margin, a couple of points there. First of all, the objective is clear. By 2020, we want to be at 40% gross margin. If you pair that with our other businesses, DUV, where we're somewhere in the 50% range and holistic lithography, where we're north of 70%, and then our CLS business, that's the Cymer service business, which is also in the mid-50s or so, you can see that, that gets us to the 50%. On a standup cost basis, we are very close to where we want to be right now. You can impute that from the information we gave you that -- the one shipment that we recognized last quarter at a 1.4% dilutive effect. If you do the math, you'll figure it's somewhere in the mid-teens, percentage-wise, and that's not for revenue. So you can see from a standup perspective, we're doing okay. But of course, we're shipping only a few systems this year. If you look at the total EUV business, isolate it from one machine, you have to take several other considerations. Number one, we have the infrastructure to build many more systems. So we have cost of under-absorption. We have a service model where eventually we will charge per wafer -- per good wafer out. We provide the service already, but there's not many good wafers out. So you can imagine that this is a very significant loss business for us right now. The learning curve, we are still working on costs, not only internally, but also with our suppliers. And then there are other areas, like we still have to go out in the field and bring these systems that we shipped up to the latest standards, which is also -- that we need to perform that is unpaid. And lastly, we have, of course, shipped this year mainly -- shipped and will ship 3350s and 3300s and then going -- starting next year, we have 3400s, which come at a higher ASP. So if you take this all into consideration and you look at the overall EUV business, it is still significantly negative gross margin for us. But the standard is approaching where we need it to be. And with the volume coming in, it really depends on volume and learning curve. And we believe -- based on what we see in backlog and based on what we hear from our customers, I mean, TSMC, for instance, was very explicit about their EUV plans going forward and Peter mentioned the ramp will be in '18, '19, we believe we can get to that 40% that gets the company to 50%.

I think like I said in my introductory statement, it's too early for us. You will understand that to be quantitative on 2017 is not possible, but we do have very clear discussions with our customers on their requirements for 2017. And we do our own market forecast and simulations, and we corroborate that, too. And the way that we are looking at today is that we believe that the logic ramp will continue strongly as we've seen in 2016, also in 2017. Memory, given the wafer capacity situation and what we hear from customers, that we believe the memory business will be at least at the same level, if not slightly up. And I think on the services and options and upgrade business, I think we will grow next year. So I think it's -- currently, for the quarter, the point of view, very difficult for us to see that last -- and leave EUV a bit to the side, that on the rest of the business, that 2017 would be a lower year than 2016. Very difficult for us to see that because logic's strong, memory is at least as good, perhaps slightly up and we have a service and option and upgrade business that will be up.",212

And I think you've -- you had said it's obviously an ongoing process, and there is not -- there's probably not going to be a moment where kind of the customers just sort of flick on the switch in their minds and say, ""We're going to go for it."" But I'm just wondering, in terms of maybe on the availability targets, which seems to be the main criteria, you obviously said 90% is the key level. But I guess the question that we all have, how long is that 90% availability? How long do the tools need to deliver that availability? Is that a couple of months? Is it 6 months? Because I think you have mentioned you achieved it for about a month now with an old tool. So I'm just wondering kind of how close are we to that potentially critical availability level.",161

Wennink,,Executives,20,"Yes, I think we have said in the past, 85% is probably the threshold that the customers are going to say, ""Fine, let's go."" But it's about the predictability. So when we talk about 85%, it is 85%. It is not for a day. It's not for a month. It is -- with the constant use of the tool, there's this 85% availability of your installed base. So that is what it is today. For instance, we are talking with deep UV, we're talking about availability percentage is way over 90%, and that's for the entire installed base. That's not over a week or over a 13-week period. It is basically ever. Now that is -- that's a very clear target, and you see where we are today, 2016, and where we will be in 2 years' time. We believe that having seen the levels of availabilities and the capability of individual tools in the field, not the entire installed base yet and looking at the projects and the programs that we will actually to draw [ph] because we know what to do, that given the fact that we can show that availability over a really prolonged period, this is not days, it's weeks, it's, in fact, months, then we believe that we can get there at 2018, '19 when we start shipping them in volume. And that will happen over time. I mean, if you look at the number of programs and projects that we are running to get to that level, there are dozens. And all need to be executed one by one, and everyone will actually -- and contribute to a percentage point of increase or several percentage points of increase in that availability. So it's going to be an ongoing thing, like it was an ongoing thing coming from 38% to where we are today. It's a continuous process, together with our customers, that we have a very clear road map.",325

I had 2. I guess first of all, Wolfgang, I'm still trying to understand margins on EUV. I think we had previously been talking about meeting sort of 20 to 25 systems a year to get to roughly 40% margin. And then I think -- now that's gone to maybe having to ship 40 systems to get to 40% gross margin. So you're certainly making progress, but it seems like the supply chain is beginning to sort of hold you back. So I guess my question is really around your need to subsidize the -- your suppliers, because certainly, your customers wrote you checks, but it seems like maybe you have to rate your suppliers' checks and what the impact that could have on margins.",128

So Tim, let me go there. So one thing I think I can tell you, clearly, there are no additional costs coming in from increased prices of suppliers. Yes, it's true that we have supported suppliers with certain prepayments, but those are basically financing transactions, has nothing to do with gross margin and the P&L. You are also right in a sense that volume, clearly, is the biggest contributor to the overall gross margin. You can -- I think you have been here, you can look at the factory, it's there. And if you only ship 3 or 4 units, those units have to carry the burden of that entire infrastructure, including the management that's in there and the quality systems and everything that's in there. So in that sense, volume is clearly the greatest driver to get to the gross margin. There's a bit of a debate in the -- in last quarter call. Well, can you pinpoint it to an exact number? That is -- it's difficult, because I can tell you, we could ship 50 systems. If we don't make any progress on the learning curve and our customers, we may not achieve the 40%. But reversely, we can be at 25 systems and we're making good progress on the learning and we'll be at the target earlier. So I don't want link it to a specific volume, but it's very clear, volume is the biggest contributor to getting to that 40% gross margin. I hope that helps, Tim.",253

So if you take 47.5% in the midpoint of our guidance, we would be somewhere in the -- so above 45%, which is in line with what we have done before.

I just had another one on EUV. Peter, you reiterated the expectation of that sort of 12 units, plus the additional 2 that slipped, but 12 units next year being manufactured, doubling in '18, doubling again in '19. And I can see what you're saying in terms of the 2017 shipments being supported by the current backlog. But I'm just -- you've given us that, but obviously, we always want more. So I'm interested in -- just want to think about 2018 and when we might need to see orders start to come in. So were are lead times at the moment? When would you need customers start -- to start to committing? So there's another part to that would be the big-volume purchase order made by Intel in the second quarter last year. Clearly, you've got that sort of hanging around there that's outside, I think, still after the official backlog, but presumably starts to step in at some point over the next year or 2 to -- because some of those tools will be destined for 2018. So any insight as you -- you can provide on some of those moving parts would be very helpful.",201

I think, clearly, like Wolfgang said, by the end of the year, I think we have in the backlog, at least, the 2017 output secured through orders. But also, I think what we are seeing is that the next 2 quarters or so, we will see also the first orders for 2018 coming in, filling that up. Because doubling in 2018, with the lead times that we currently have, means that we need to start booking those orders as we speak, and that is also exactly the activity of our sales force as we speak with our major customers. Now having said that, because these are volume shipments, it should not be a surprise to you and to others that we're in deep discussions with volume purchase agreements with those key customers, as we speak. Now -- and I think the orders will be a subset or will be, let's say, an integral part of those volume purchase agreements, so-called VPAs, and that's happening as we speak.",168

I just got my calculator. I misunderstood your question, I believe. The -- what I quoted to you was just taking the deferred revenue loss. But then of course, you need to take the 3300 out as well. So if you take both aspects of EUV out, we would be more like 46.5% or something like that. And that's the increase that's driven by the increase in field options. I hope that is clear.

I think that's normally how we work, which is not typical for EUV. That's typical for deep UV and our other businesses also. I mean, we actually have these volume purchase agreements over a longer period of time, could be years, could be a ""No"", could be 18 months, it depends on the customer, where our -- basically, we say, ""At this particular volume, these are the conditions, the terms and the conditions under which we will ship."" And that's also true for EUV. And for ones and twos, you don't need volume purchase agreements, yes? Let that be clear. So -- but for volume, you need volume purchase agreements because that has an impact on pricing, and customers would like to see that impact. So this is also not a surprise. We're in deep discussions, as we speak, on those volume purchase agreements, which will be the trigger. You could say this will be the umbrella under which the individual POs will be issued.",166

Again, we'll talk in more detail in 1.5 weeks from now. But we continue to forecast about 13% of revenue for R&D, and that does not assume a continuation of the customer co-investment plan. Having said that, it also doesn't really hit OpEx in terms of R&D. It's actually in gross margin. Part of it is other income, and part of it is balance sheet straight into equity transaction. So it doesn't impact R&D, but we have not modeled a continuation of that plan.",85

Just refreshing memory, this customer co-investment program was specifically made to support ASML in the, let's say, double in investment time of, let's say, about 5 years, where we had to invest in leading-edge deep UV, but also had to invest in EUV. And initially, we thought it could be for 50. Now when you look at when that ends, it will end at the end of next year. And when you look at when EUV starts revving in volume, well, our plan is doubling the 12 in 2018. And bearing in mind the discussion that we had on the very significant impact that volume has on EUV margins, by that time, when we're in 2018, there will be margin inflow to actually pay for the R&D money that we need to spend for EUV going forward. So I think it's almost like a perfect match in the sense when the CCIP tails off and our EUV business, for which the CCIP was intended, actually takes off. So it was well planned, well timed.",179

Wennink,,Executives,40,"We always have aspirations to drive market share up. I mean, that, in itself, is not a goal. It is a result. I mean, we are focusing really with the HMI acquisition to combine the competencies of the 2 companies and create something, which, from a value point of view, is not available in the market today. And so effectively means, we are looking for industrial products synergy, and this is the reason for the acquisition. You could argue that the product that we are focusing on or that we're envisaging is a product that does not exist today. And so in that sense, call it a dream, but I think we think it's more than a dream. I think it is doable. I think it is executable. But it is something that is not available today. Now how much of that will be valued by our customer base as being high value remains to be seen. We have high hopes, but we do believe that in this new product combination, we will create significant value for our customers to control their yields and their patterning cost, and it is what we are focusing on.

These things are basically looking at the -- as you know, and I suppose that you know, that the EUV plasma is created by using a high-power CO2 laser. So it's, in fact, the continued laser stability, which is a program that we're running with our supplier TRUMPF in the south of Germany. Second point is the tin management in the vessel, which, basically, we need to contain any contamination are coming out of tin distribution over time. Now we have several programs running there. So I would summarize it as those 2. So it's tin management in the vessel, and it's the stability of the drive laser. And that's a drive laser to basically create the EUV plasma out of tin. And those are this whole school of smaller project and some bigger project that we are running with our customer base and with our supply base. But those are very well defined.",155

So yes, capital intensity will -- when we go to 1x, will go up. But largely, in the 1x node and 1x mid-node starting, you'll see the introduction of EUV.",99

My first question is really with respect to the demand evolution for emerging tools. You've talked about strength from the 10 nanometer. You've touched upon memory. Could you maybe give us granular insights into how does that break down between DRAM and NAND and whether the lead times for your tools have any role to play in terms of how you're seeing the orders shaping up? You talked about a pickup in Q4. You talked about memory being slightly higher next year. So I was wondering if you could share some more granularity in terms of DRAM and NAND and how you think that shapes up in Q4 and beyond. That would be my first question.,123

Wennink,,Executives,50,"Like I said, we gave you some qualitative indications, and Wolfgang said in his introductory comments that we see memory shipments going up in Q4 as compared to Q3. And as you -- if you look at the total year 2016, we believe that memory shipments, based on the installed wafer capacity and the customer demand and the bit growth assumption that we currently have, that memory will be upwards. We'll be flat or slightly up next year. Now the split or the granularity that you're asking for between -- to -- in DRAM and in NAND is a bit difficult because what we're seeing very much is that the DRAM tools -- currently leading DRAM tools are relocated to NAND. And then basically, NAND litho is then growing in terms of installed base, but then we ship to DRAM to replace the relocated tool that went to the NAND factory. So it looks like a DRAM shipment, but in fact, it's a NAND shipment. So this is all why we basically combine this into memory. It's very difficult to give you a detailed breakdown of what is DRAM capacity growth or NAND capacity growth. There's a lot of relocation going on between the 2 memory sectors.",207

With respect to your service and field option sales, the idea was to get to, I think, 10% growth year-on-year this year. Seems like you need a strong Q4 well above 600 to get there. And even beyond that, I appreciate you'll give us the roadmap in 2 weeks' time, but should we expect more of a linear trajectory going forward? Is that the best way to model it?

First of all, Amit, correct, you did the math apparently. If you get to 10%, you need like 650. We have said that we'll be over 600. So we'll be anywhere between 7% and 10%. We'll see how that goes. In terms of the makeup, a little bit less than half of this is service and, in general, if you take the full, full year, and that is fairly predictable. I mean, there, you know what your installed base is and what the contracts are, and that's a pretty steady-state, nicely growing business for us. Options have 2 portions to it. There are the upgrades, and the upgrades need to be somewhat linear because you've got to have the teams that perform the upgrades. So we need to schedule those and these. We'll be growing over time, but they -- it will be more like a linear growth. But then you have various options and, increasingly, with holistic lithography, software options that can be deployed at relatively short notice, and that's the difference that you see in a quarter like we have ended it now. And there, you can see that you have one quarter that's stronger than the other, so strong business for us. I think you'll see that we -- whether it's 7% or 10%, we'll be over EUR 2.1 billion, EUR 2.2 billion this year, which is close, we are sure of our business. And when we're talking in 2020 and when we talk in 2 weeks at our Investor Day, you'll see that it will also continue to grow strong. I think you'll see that business well over EUR 3 billion by 2020.",280

Wennink,,Executives,55,"And perhaps, Amit, the term reuse is kind of a -- it's kind of a container term. It has so much in there. Just to give you an indication, I mean, you could do a reuse by basically saying, ""Okay, I have a litho tool in a logic way for fab, and I'm going to add for the next node and the next-generation litho tool. But I'm going to reuse some of those tools that are in there for that new node."" That is one. Reuse also is relocations. You move one tool from one fab to the other tool to go to a different part. I just gave the example of memory. Reuse is also, ""I have this tool sitting there, which is leading-edge tool, I'm going to upgrade it to the next level."" So it's actually that leading-edge tools remain the leading-edge tools, but not in the same shape, because it has a very significant upgrade that can be anywhere between EUR 15 million to EUR 35 million. So it's a heterogeneous container term that you have to be careful with using in more general terms.",188

My first question is on EUV. You guys have been making very good progress on EUV, but some of the challenges seems like -- are outside of what you guys do and more in the bucket of what your customers are doing. So I just want to get your perspective on 3 things that have come up from one of your customer's challenge: one is on the mask blank inspection; second is on pellicle. It seems to like the transmission is very low, like 30% losses right now, and that is an extra according [ph] that needs to be applied, which takes up even more of the UV light; and third is on mask inspection, like actinic mask inspection, if EUV has to be adopted in like high volume in multiple layers. It seems some of your customers are asking for that. So I just want to hear your thoughts on how important these challenges are.",161

It's a good question. I think they're all important. Mask blank inspection, that needs to happen clearly. But we have a solution there. I think our partners call us to start to ship the first mask blank inspection tools to actually do that, and I think the first tool is in the shipments right now. So there are solutions there, and they will go to the first customers. I don't think that's the major issue. And if you ask me, Peter, is there a tool installed for right now? No, but it's in shipment and more will follow. The pellicle transmission, yes, that is an issue. But the 30% loss that you just quoted, there are better results as we speak. That is also something that has been developed or started to develop last year. And if you look at the curve of development, we've made clear progress. Now our biggest challenge is not so much the transmission of the pellicle. I think we're getting -- we're making progress there. Now it is we need to start -- we, the industry, need to start making pellicle as a kind of a volume product at the right specifications, and that production process is just starting up. So there, we need to have improvements in the yields that the pellicle producer currently has, but that's all normal when you look at where we are in the initial stage of that volume production process. But we don't expect that to be a showstopper. That's going to be just hard work on -- in -- basically in -- like, say, with ASML, it's hard work of the industrialization. And then mask inspection, actinic inspection, we said it before. For the 7-nanometer node, we don't need that. Going forward, 5-nanometer 3[ph], that is a potential for some customers. Some customers won't need it, because they actually say we can't afford if you're a memory customer. You're not as sensitive if you're high-value logic customer. So for the upcoming nodes and, let's say, till the end of the decade, that is not a major issue, and we need to find a solution beyond that. Whether it's actinic inspection tool or another solution, that still remains to be seen, but that's not a hindrance for the initial introduction of EUV at the 7/10-nanometer node. So yes, they're all issues that need to be worked on. They are not signed off as absolutely concern-free. There are issues that need to be resolved, but that's pretty normal when you look at when those development has started and where we are today.",433

I just want to understand if your OpEx level or R&D level of 13% assume that a high NA system would be needed? And secondly, like is that an opportunity for another customer co-investment program when you guys are getting to those discussions?",57

Wennink,,Executives,60,"Well, it's a very good question. I mean, if you think about EUV high NA, you talk about the next-generation EUV tool that will be introduced somewhere in the course of the next decade. That will require quite a significant investment in R&D. I think on average, the 13% R&D with our EUR 10 billion target should be able to deal with it. It's more a matter of -- I mean, if you take the cumulative planned R&D that we would need over the next 5 years or so, then cumulatively, yes, that would be -- that would suffice. However, when customers start telling us that they want this earlier, we need to put it in, then you might see a hump, which then, of course, we will have the discussion with our customers how we will, let's say, craft or stage the customer commitments to make sure that the interest of ASML with the increased R&D and the requirements of the customers are well aligned. And that, of course, always goes with some level of financial commitment. What that is? We don't know yet. But when it is clear what customers want in what time frame, then we will definitely have those discussions. But what form it will take? I don't know. It could be simple commitments of placing purchase orders with high level of prepayments, stuff like that, could also be.",233

So just a quick one, actually, on maybe -- so I'm seeing a bit more longer term while everyone is so focused on the gross margins. Is there a market for laser spare parts going forward? So basically, at some point, you will have installed base of, I don't know, like 50, 100 EUV machines. So is there a market for changing the lasers from the wafer business?
