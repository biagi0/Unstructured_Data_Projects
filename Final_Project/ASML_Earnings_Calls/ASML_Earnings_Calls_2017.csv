388904.0,"ASML Holding N.V., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 18, 2017",2017-01-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3636.0,1137690.0,47155137.0,Presenter Speech,Wolfgang Nickl,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Peter, and welcome everyone. 2016 was a remarkable year for ASML, both financially and strategically. I would like to first highlight some of our financial accomplishments and then finish with our view of the coming quarter. 2016 was a record-breaking year in many financial respects, with total net sales, gross profit, net income and earnings per share all reaching record levels. 
In addition, we finished the year with the highest backlog ever, which combined with our current business view, allows us to look forward to another great year in 2017, where EUV becomes an integral and growing part of our system revenues, contributing significantly to our top line growth through the balance of this decade and beyond. 
Turning to our Q4 results. Net sales came in at EUR 1.91 billion. Net system sales accounted for EUR 1.22 billion, driven by logic, which represented 61% of net system sales, with memory returning to strength versus Q3, accounting for 39% of net system sales. System sales included EUR 144 million of EUV revenue, in line with the guidance given during our earnings call in October. 
Net service and field option sales for the quarter came in strong, as expected, at a level of EUR 684 million, driven by ongoing strong demand for Holistic Lithography options, high-value upgrades and our growing installed base. Furthermore, we closed the acquisition of HMI in November, and net service and field option sales include about EUR 25 million for this new and exciting part of our business. 
Our gross margin for the quarter came in at 47.2%. This includes starting the amortization of intangibles as well as the effects from the fair value assessment of HMI's inventory as of the closing date of the acquisition. The negative impact on gross margin for both of these purchase price allocation-related items was approximately 1 percentage point. 
R&D expenses came in at EUR 287 million, slightly higher than guided due to both the R&D expenses of HMI and the start of our partial funding of Zeiss SMT for our high-NA EUV program. SG&A expenses came in at EUR 107 million, also slightly higher than guided due to the inclusion of HMI. 
We also had an impact from foreign currency revaluations on transactions and balances relating to the HMI acquisition. You may remember that this was an unfavorable effect of about EUR 28 million in Q3 as reported during our last call. For Q4, we had a more than offsetting favorable effect of about EUR 83 million. These effects are reported in the interest and other line in our P&L. 
Moving to the order book. Q4 system bookings came in at EUR 1.6 billion for 44 systems, including 6 3400 EUV systems. Strong bookings continued in the logic sector in support of the 10-nanometer ramps and in support of EUV insertion at the 7-nanometer node. Memory bookings strengthened further from its strong Q3 level, supporting expected strengths in memory shipments continuing in 2017, driven by DRAM. 
Continuing order flow for EUV systems brings our total year-end EUV system order book to 18 systems. Our overall systems backlog now stands at nearly EUR 4 billion. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Quarter-over-quarter cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments came in at EUR 4.06 billion. A major drive was our free cash flow of EUR 1.1 billion in Q4. As we experienced in the last quarter of 2015, we saw a significant level of early payments from customers, which will impact Q1 2017 cash flows. Also, as already mentioned before, we closed the HMI acquisition during the quarter and also issued a EUR 750 million Eurobond to support part of our planned strategic investment in Zeiss SMT, which is expected to close in Q2 of 2017. 
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations and guidance for the first quarter of 2017. We expect continuing sales strength in Q1, with total net sales of approximately EUR 1.8 billion, of which an estimated EUR 30 million will be deferred EUV revenue. Foundry shipment strengths supporting 10-nanometer ramps will continue in Q1 and will be firmly supported by memory shipments. 
We also expect to ship our first NXE:3400 EUV system in the quarter. We expect to record the revenue for the system in the third quarter of the year since this system will ship in a nonfinal configuration. 
I would also like to mention here that one of the EUV systems that we expected to ship early this year, postponed from Q4 last year due to a customer-readiness issue, will not ship this year as originally planned. Due to other extenuating circumstances, this customer has now decided to place a system upgrade order for this tool and will take delivery of it in 2018, where it will add to 2 other systems at the customer site to be shipped this year. This leaves our system output plan at 12 new systems and our shipment plan at 13, considering the one additional system that missed delivery for material availability reasons in Q4 2016. 
We expect our Q1 service and field options revenue to again come in above EUR 650 million, driven by continued demand for Holistic Lithography options, high-value upgrades and our growing installed base. For now, we will report HMI revenues under field options and services. 
Gross margin for Q1 is again expected to be around 47%, including the effect from the purchase price allocation for the HMI acquisition. The negative impact of this purchase price allocation adjustment for Q1 is more than 1 percentage point. The impact for the full year is about EUR 90 million and will reduce to about EUR 40 million per year from 2018 onwards. 
R&D expenses for Q1 will be about EUR 320 million, and SG&A is expected to come in at about EUR 95 million. The uptick in R&D spend is driven by the inclusion of HMI and accelerated investment in pattern fidelity metrology, our contributions to SMT's high-NA developments, our own high-NA development acceleration and the strong U.S. dollar. 
As a reminder, regarding our share buyback program. Last year, we purchased EUR 400 million worth of our own shares before the program was paused during our acquisition of HMI. It remains paused for the time being as we close our planned investment in Zeiss SMT. The transaction is in the regulatory approval process in the required jurisdictions. We already received the approval in South Korea and expect the approval from Germany and China in time to flow as a transaction in Q2 2017. 
And finally, an increase of our annual dividend from EUR 1.05 to EUR 1.20 will be proposed at our Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in April. 
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Peter.",1128
388904.0,"ASML Holding N.V., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 18, 2017",2017-01-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3636.0,1137690.0,47155138.0,Presenter Speech,P. Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Wolfgang. 2016 was indeed a remarkable year for ASML, not only financially, as highlighted by Wolfgang, but strategically and product technology-wise as we continue to prepare ourselves for continued growth in the coming decade and beyond. 
I would like to take a moment to highlight some of these key events. Firstly, our acquisition of HMI will enable us to move from simple imaging and imaging placement significantly in the direction of full-pattern fidelity control, which is a key requirement and value provider for our customers at 7-nanometer and below. This, along with an expansion of our current products into broader types of applications, allows us to lay the foundation for future growth in our Holistic Lithography products group. 
Secondly, we brought a key supplier partnership to the next level by agreeing to acquire a minority stake of Carl Zeiss SMT, our major critical optic supplier, for the purpose of not only securing the extension of EUV imaging technology, but also strengthening the current combined businesses of the 2 companies to improve cooperation and governance. The co-investment of about EUR 760 million over a 6-year period centers on the R&D investments of next-generation lenses and related capital expenditure, also referred to as high NA, which is critical in meeting our customers' imaging road maps throughout the next decade. 
Lastly and probably most significantly, the industry has turned the corner on EUV. Throughout the year, we continued to execute on mutually agreed performance milestones, which allowed our customers to grow confidence in the technology and tool performance. This resulted in customer decisions to allocate their most critical layers of the next-generation nodes to EUV, beginning with the industry's 7-nanometer logic node. With customers backing this confidence up with orders, we ended the year with an EUV backlog of 18 systems, as mentioned. Together with the anticipated Q1 orders, this will cover our 2017 and early 2018 EUV output. As mentioned before, our output capability for 2018 will be around 24 systems. Based on the timing of high-volume manufacturing introduction of the advanced logic and memory nodes, as announced by our customers, it is realistic to assume that this production capability will be fully utilized by our customers. This means we will expect a continued order flow in the coming quarters. 
As we move into the next phase of industrialization of EUV, our focus will remain on continued improvement of key HVM performance metrics, very much in line with what customers expect of our DPV offering, above 90% availability and productivity per tool specifications. Furthermore, we are heightening our focus on our supply chain to provide the required number of EUV systems on time and are preparing a competent and sufficiently sizable EUV field service organization capable of supporting our customers in their volume manufacturing insertion plans. 
With respect to our core product lines, we continue to develop industry-leading imaging systems, evidenced by the introduction of our latest immersion product offering, the NXT:1980, which has demonstrated the fastest ramp of a new product in our history, with 46 systems shipped in 2016. 
For our Holistic Lithography product line, 2016 was also a good year where we launched new products, penetrating new large customer accounts, promising significant new business in the years to come. 
Together with the aforementioned progress on the EUV product performance and related business opportunities, we feel confident in further anchoring our leadership position in the semiconductor equipment marketplace. 
And turning to the short term, as Wolfgang mentioned, we expect to build upon our record 2016, seeing further significant opportunities to grow in 2017. We see a continued ramp of the foundry logic 10-nanometer node, as recently confirmed by one of our large foundry customers. With memory strength driven by expected stronger bid growth in 2017. 
In addition, service and field option sales are again expected to continue to grow in 2017. This will continue to be driven by sales of scanner system upgrades and our growing Holistic Lithography product offering. In 2017, we'll see the real -- first real impact of EUV system sales with recognition of systems shipped in the calendar year as well as pieces of remaining revenue recognition from systems shipped in the past. 
For 2017, our opportunities and challenges are crystal clear. The commitment of our customers to EUV is now apparent and evidenced by our significant and growing EUV backlog. Supporting our customers' intent of moving EUV into volume production in the coming 24 months will remain our #1 priority in order to ensure that our customers can deliver their next node transitions as planned. ASML remains committed to do everything within our capability and power to bring EUV to manufacturing readiness as soon as possible. 
With that, we would be happy to take your questions.",793

So my question is related to the memory strength. You mentioned that it should stay strong through 2017, particularly on the DRAM side with big growth. And was just wondering if you're seeing new DRAM capacity being installed, given the pricing trends or if these are tools that are being shipped to NAND and then replaced in the DRAM fabs?",62

Wennink,,Executives,8,"Yes, it's more of the latter. So we've seen significant relocations from DRAM capacity into NAND throughout 2016, already starting in 2015. And as we're filling it all back up, like we said in the previous call, we saw quite a significant capacity drop in 2016 in terms of wafer starts per month in DRAM, which is a double-digit drop, and that's being filled up with new DRAM capacity.",69

The first one was, Peter, just to clarify, your commentary around the EUV shipments next year. So I think I heard you say that it's realistic to expect 24 tools. What would be the sort of puts and takes on kind of whether you would ship capacity or maybe potentially slightly less in terms of adoption and capacity? 
And the second question was on the Chinese CapEx. And I think you said something on the, maybe on your website, some of the data points that has been making the rounds of the press suggest that there could be tens of billions of dollars spent on new memory fabs in China. So I'm just wondering, in terms of the phasing, timing or magnitude, how much visibility do you have on those projects?",136
388904.0,"ASML Holding N.V., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 18, 2017",2017-01-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3636.0,1137690.0,47155147.0,Answer,P. Wennink,,Executives,13,"Okay, thanks. On 2018, the determining factor is not so much our capability or the performance of the tool. It is really, as you can understand, the next nodes of our customers have complexities in there that are not only driven by our capability or our lithography capability. This is really based on the introduction timing of our customers. So what our customers -- all our major customers have made public statements about when they want to introduce their next nodes and start using EUV, we take those statements, and actually, we don't only take public statements, to be honest, we have very detailed discussions with those customers on those public statements and what that means, so we get very detailed plans of when they need what tool, when and that is really driving the, let's say, realistic assumption that when we have 24 units to sell, we will sell 24 units when they stick to their plans. So this is basically what it is. There's nothing more to it than that. So customers will decide. And that could be that if one customer says I need to, for whatever reason, need to do an introduction 6 months later, there will be a 6-month rescheduling. That's what really drives the business. 
China CapEx, yes, it's interesting. I mean, we've also very -- we have a lot of interest following every comment that comes out of China, all the tens of billions that will be invested in all kinds of fabs all over the place, but you also have to look at what impact that will have on our short-term business. Now short term, yes, there are many ceremonies of fab openings or fab extensions, I would say. The number of real new fabs is limited on, let's say, Chinese-owned companies. Of course, there are the foreign companies that open fabs in China, but I think the reference to the tens of billions are really Chinese-owned companies. That will -- that is definitely a promise. But when we look at the next 12 to 18 months, it is good. There are -- there's some good logic opportunity. There's some memory opportunity there. But it's all within the realms of good business and not the extraordinary growth that some people are portraying. That will very likely happen. But it's very likely also going to take a bit more time than the 2017, let's say, slash '18 time frame.",406

Just a quick question, Peter, on the order intake. I mean, in the fourth quarter, you took orders for 6 EUV tools. At the same time, I mean, we have some expectation that you will sign volume purchase agreements with some of your large customers for these EUV tools. So is it now that you will be taking these EUV orders as a normal part of the business as you seem to have done in the fourth quarter? Or are we to still expect volume purchase agreements in the next few months? And I have one quick follow-up question on the 2018 shipments.",106

Wennink,,Executives,16,"Yes, on the order intake in Q4, that was based on a volume purchase agreement for the, you could say, the 3400 delivery. It does not include yet the additional options that they need on those 3400s. So you could say if there's a fully signed and closed volume purchase agreement with that customer, not entirely because the options are still under discussion, what they need and the economics of it. But yes, those orders were indeed taken under the agreements that we have on the pricing and the pricing models. That's just for one customer. I mean, other customers will follow suit as we continue in 2017. And for those who will introduce EUV later, those VPAs will be also signed later on in 2018. So it's, as you said, it's the normal course of business.",137

And then you've already got 6 of those orders at this point. By which point do you need to get all your orders so that, that capacity will be readied for the customer? Because, I mean, you've said in the past that you take almost a year to ship these tools, and then there is a time which the customer takes to install the tool in their own facility and get it stabilized.",95

Well, the time to ship and install is about a year. So it's not plus-plus. So it's not for us a time -- as a year to ship the tool. What our time is, we can ship an EUV tool -- sorry, we can install an EUV tool in about 3 months, 3 to 4 months, and we have currently an internal cycle plan in the factory of about 6 months. So all in all, for us, it takes about 9 months from start-up of the tool to getting it installed at the customer side. Now then the customer needs to, of course, start to qualify their production. The issue is in their supply chain. In their supply chain, we need lenses. We need large mechanical modules that need to be produced, and this is limiting our output capability right now. However, having said that, to your earlier questions, we are in very intense and deep discussions with customers on volume purchase agreements. And it is also clear that those customers need those tools at a certain moment in time. And taking into account our cycle time reduction plans, it is not absolutely necessary throughout 2017 that we need to keep onto this 2-year-type line. That will go down. That will be shorter because we will reduce the cycle time as volumes go up. However, to be able to ship 24 units in 2018, those systems need to be booked by the end of year, so in this year. Now if you're going to ask me when should those orders come in? Is it Q1? Is it Q2 or early Q3? I don't know yet, and it's not that important. But what I do know is that for -- if we need to ship 24 units by -- in 2017, those orders need to be in.",307

Yes, I'll take that, C.J. I mean, we painted the picture at our Investor Day as well. The starting point is a gross margin, if you take everything into consideration, of about minus 75% in 2016. Our objective is to get this business breakeven from a gross margin perspective in 2017. And then in 2018, you would make another significant step forward. We're thinking somewhere in the 20s also. Of course, there are a few things that contribute to that. And you're right, some of the catch-up revenue that essentially comes at no or low cost will help, but it also will help that this year we're shipping the 3400, which has a list price that's about EUR 20 million higher than the 3350s. We're also going to continue to make progress on the cost side. We still have significant amounts of field upgrades that we have to do for no charge, E&O charges. We have learning to do. We're making progress on that front as well. And if you then take into consideration also the service business, where, as you know, we are charging to wafer out. But we got a mind -- a growing installed base that is not productive in churning out a lot of wafers. So we're still spending a significant amount of money on this without real revenue coming in. But if you take it into all consideration, we are targeting around breakeven. 
As it relates to the total business, we're about 45% gross margin in 2016. I think we're going to continue to make progress in both businesses, EUV going from minus 75% to about breakeven, but also the non-EUV business because the mix is shifting towards applications and more higher-value systems. We'll make progress as well. But overall, I think for your modeling purposes, you should assume that the total company gross margin will somewhat go down because you're growing the revenue significantly on the EUV line. So should expect a little bit of a step-back there before then, in 2018, we are marching towards the 50%-plus that we're targeting for 2020.",350

Without tying it down to a specific number, but I think with everything that we gave you between Peter and the shipments on EUV and the margin and -- I think you're in the right ZIP code there on the gross margins. As it relates to orders, first of all, we are thrilled, to be at an overall backlog of EUR 4 billion. Having said that, same story as in prior calls, we publish the backlog because it gives you a decent structural view on what's happening in the business. You see memory picking up. You see a lot of EUV orders coming in. But we always say that just merely looking at bookings or backlog should not be your main input parameter in the outlook because, as you know, the order at the end of the day in particular for the more mature business is merely an administrative act. We have VPAs with all of our customers. And we get -- every other week, we get a detailed sales forecast and order forecast against that. And that is what's giving us the confidence in the numbers.

You had 2 tools that showed a 4-week average of greater than 90% versus 1 last quarter, but there was no improvement in productivity. Is that because it's not your focus right now?

Wennink,,Executives,26,"Let me answer that, Tim. First of all, the reason why we put those metrics in there is, one, to be able to communicate to you, but also to our customers, what we believed at that time when we created those metrics, the most relevant milestones were that customers used to get convinced that EUV was going to be the choice of the next-generation, leading-edge litho production. Having said that, meeting those targets -- not only those targets, it was the continued, let's say, showing of those targets throughout the year that actually raised the customers' confidence to the level to also publicly state ""We're going to use EUV."" And they followed that up with orders, as you will have seen. Now just for your information, we are over 200 watts, which will actually provide us way more than 1,500 wafers per day. And that's what we've shown to customers. And so it is about the confidence that we will be at the high-volume production requirements by the time that customers need it. And that was shown with those targets. The targets, going forward, I would like to relate to other targets that they need for higher-volume introduction, like I said in my introductory comments. It's like with DPV, where we're moving into that direction. Like Sandeep said, it's business as usual. We will be all we have to be and we will be over 90% availability when they need it, when they start HVM production. And we will be at the productivity of wafers per day as specified by the tool specifications, i.e. 125 wafers per hour. This is where we are, and this is why we're absolutely confident that we're going to get there. And that's why it's the last time we're going to give you these targeted numbers because those milestones have been met, evidenced by the customer orders.",312

Okay, Peter. And I guess, just as it relates to backlog on EUV. So you have 18 systems in backlog. You have slots for 12 this year. So obviously, 6 of those are going to ship next year. Since you have 24 slots, give or take, next year, does that mean that backlog can only be 24 exiting this year? Or is the policy such that you're -- if you get an order even if it's going to ship 18 months from now, you're going to put it in backlog so that the backlog exiting this year can be actually a lot higher than the 24 slots that you have next year?",116

And secondly, could you also give us a sense of what's happening in the wider ecosystem, particularly around defectivity and the pellicles? And any other components within the ecosystem, if you could kindly share any updates around those.",117

I'll make some notes. Yes, on the key areas of improvement, well, it's really focused on lifetime extensions of parts. So it's the industrialization of those parts, lifetime extensions, taking out some of the quality issues that we know what to do. That actually brings us to those targets that customers need for high-volume introduction, 90%-plus availability and productivity at spec. 
On the ecosystem, I think 2 things, resist and pellicles. Resist, good progress and we get progress reports every now and then. And over the last couple of weeks, we got some good progress reports on photoresist and on photoresist sensitivity on line edge roughness data and information that give customers good confidence that by 2010 -- end of 2018, '19, we're going to get what we want. On the pellicle, we have started to outsource the pellicle production to a supplier that actually should make the pellicles for the industry, for our customers. Initially, there was a process that yielded low because pellicles still had some defects on it on the pellicle itself. As you can imagine, if the pellicle is a membrane sitting in front of the photomask, you don't want any defects on that pellicle because they're big. They will actually print. Now by the end of the year, we actually received the first defect-free pellicle. And also there, you are seeing progress that everybody is looking for. It is not our main concern. What our concern is, is, yes, that the supply base of those pellicles will be maturing also. So we get a constant flow of defect-free pellicles. But if you look at the progress that we have made over the last 6 months, that gives us the confidence that also by the time when we need the H volume, the HVM requirements, we will be there.",304

On the memory, presumably, yes, it's going to be predominantly 1980s. We always ship, if you add some extra capacity, some KrF. But going back to an earlier question, this is really backing up the installed capacity that was relocated to NAND, which were basically immersion systems where they were upgraded in the NAND space. So it's predominantly NXTs, but we also have some level of capacity space that is in existing fabs, which also need some KrF, but it's largely NXTs. 
The level of conversion from 10-nanometer to 7. 10-nanometer, there's always a level of conversion from 10 to 7, which would include upgrades. So the level of commonality from a platform point of view is always there, but it's really the performance on overlay and focus that drives really upgrades. So when there is a reuse of an existing body in the 10-nanometer space or a previous node on to the new node, then you see upgrade business. And this is a part of the business that we are seeing -- that we see growing in 2017 where we indeed see the number of upgrades in the logic space, but also in the memory space from, let's say, previous platforms to the newest specification of the NXT platform really happening. And that is part of the business growth that we see in service sales and options. So not much different than previous nodes. It does lead to a lot of new business in terms of system upgrades.",250

The only thing that we can say is that, of course, we discuss with customers their business and their plans.

I mean, they're all talking about --and it's real because while -- about customers in the automotive space and customers in this space that is dealing with artificial intelligence and augmented reality, virtual reality, Big Data analytics.

So yes, I understand the question around the gross margins and there are like zillions of effects around it, but there's one I would like to understand a bit more. I think you guys have been talking about PPA having a negative impact this year of around EUR 19 million. So it's actually a noncash impact. So like when you guide for 47% gross margin in Q1, actually, the cash gross margins is more like 48%, 48.2% or something for Q1. Is that the right way to look at it?",97

But in principle, you're right. We're guiding to about 47%. And if you just look at the 2 elements, one being the amortization of intangibles, we said that's going to be about EUR 40 million per year. That's linear, so it's about EUR 10 million. And then we said there was EUR 50 million that result from the revaluation of the inventory to a fair value or market value at the time of closing. We got to work ourselves through this. And as you can imagine, this is going to be a bit more skewed to the front of the year rather than the back of the year. And therefore, there is, as you state, a probably closer to 1.5% impact on the gross margin in Q1. Or in other words, have we -- had we not done the acquisition and the deal with the purchase price allocation, we would have been north of 48% in the first quarter. You've got that correct.

Wennink,,Executives,48,"Yes, I think, ultimately, the proof of the pudding is when customers give you an unconditional commitment to pay you a lot of money, which I think has happened. I think that decision, which I think most customers have been public about EUV, when they want to use it or how they want to use it, just following this up by orders. So I think it is true that somebody asked a question earlier, that what could be -- what could happen to make 2018 a year where you're not going to fully ship your production capacity. I just answered, you know what, I don't know, customer road maps might change but what they're telling us today and we know the number of layers that they want to use EUV on, that we have to use that capacity. And if the customer changed their minds, things will change, but that's not the case today. 
On lead time, yes, lead time, like I said, lead time 2016 was just a 2-year. We had a supply chain that we had to kick out of hibernation. Well, they're now awake, I can assure you. So lead times will also compress somewhat also throughout 2017. I'd love to have a lead time by the end of the year of about 18 months.",218

So on the linearity, it's too early to say. I mean, generally, we have lead times of about 6 months for our tools. So customers probably give us a very clear indication over the next 6 months, which looks very good. The rest of the year is a bit driven by expectations, and so that's always a bit more uncertain to a certain extent. So that might be the reason why some of our peers focus more on the first half. It's just visibility. 
On China 500,000 wafer starts next year, we don't see 500,000 wafer starts next year. It's too much. I mean, it will be there in the end, but as I said earlier it's going to take a bit of time. With some of our customers, we've been talking about building new fabs now for 2.5 years. In that same time frame, our logic customers built the fab and were shipping tools, while we're still talking about the others. So this has to kick in to a different gear also. Those 500,000 wafer starts next year is absolutely not what we expect. Good business. Yes, we will expect shipments into new pedestals for our tools into fab extensions and perhaps a new fab, but nothing to the level that you just mentioned.",217

Wennink,,Executives,53,"Yes, the next 12 to 24 months, I do believe that when you look at what is driving our customer's business, it is 10-nanometer logic and it's memory. That still needs those immersion systems. So I think next 12 to 18 months, I don't see -- think you will see a lot of change. Although longer term, when complexity of chip design increases, the number of layers will also go up. Now the increase of the incremental layers are very much the critical ones, which is going to be EUV. And as EUV progresses in terms of maturity and productivity, also, EUV will grow into the realm of DPV, leading-edge DPV. But no matter how you look at it, there's also, I think, clearly discussed at our Capital Markets Day, immersion and DPV will be with us forever, yes, and also means over the next 10 years or so, going to be very significant part of our business. Over the next 12 to 18 months, it's going to be the majority part and the key part of our business, given the fact that those nodes that they are being designed into are the nodes that we're currently using and ramping, which is not an EUV node. 10-nanometer is an immersion node and the high-teens DRAM is an immersion node.

Just one on sort of your outlook for 2017. You've given fairly sort of clear messaging around what you see on the logic space, on the memory space and, of course, services and options continue to grow. Just the statement around significant revenue from EUV for the first time. If I go back to the Capital Markets Day in late October, you seem to be indicating at that point something on the order of sort of below EUR 1 billion mark as a combination of rev rec shipment as well as the deferred revenue coming through. Is that still a reasonable assumption given -- sort of given sort of better visibility into how you see EUV trending for this year? And also, within services and options for this year, now that HMI is closed and you're in the integration process, what are your expectations for that business over the next couple of quarters?",156

I'll take that, Andrew. EUV, yes, what we said before continues to apply. We said we can ship a maximum of 13 tools, which is a 12 plus 1 carryover. Revenue recognition is now close to shipment or with shipment for majority. And yes, there will be some catch-up revenue from last year where we shipped systems with no revenue recognition. So without tying it down too much, but I think the number will have a 1 in for sure and somewhere north of EUR 1.2 billion is clearly within the realm of possibilities. Service and field options will continue to grow even if you start by -- with excluding HMI, we grew 7%, 8% this year. And also, based on some of Peter's comments on the upgrades, we think it will grow at least by that level. It could grow 10% or so year-over-year. And then we have HMI, which was only in for like 2 months last year, and we're not intending to break this out in the future, but you know from their stand-alone reporting that this should be somewhere in the EUR 200 million ZIP code. That is incremental. I think you will see us announcing new products during the year, but they will not lead to any significant revenue in the year. So EUV field options and services and HMI are all growth drivers, and then you have a -- the rest of the business that is stable, and in some cases, up a little bit. So like we said in our prior remarks, it should be a pretty good revenue year in 2017.",270

Whether it's 250, it doesn't really matter because at 205 watts, we're at 125 wafers per hour and that's the throughput specification. But 250 watts, by the way, is also not with this particular source design, is not our end target. I think with this particular design, we can go higher. We can go 300 watts and above.

And welcome, everyone. 2017 is off to a great start with a stronger-than-expected quarter. I would like to first highlight some of last quarter's financial accomplishments and then finish with our view of the coming quarter. 
Turning to the Q1 results. Net sales came in at EUR 1.94 billion. Net system sales accounted for EUR 1.22 billion, nicely balanced between logic and memory. With the addition of HMI products, we are now including metrology and inspection equipment in the system sales versus previously reporting it as service and field option revenue. This also means that metrology and inspection systems orders are from now onwards included in our booking and backlog numbers. This provides more visibility of our current and future system business in this product group. 
Net service and field option sales for the quarter came in much stronger than expected at a level of EUR 728 million, driven by major DUV and Holistic Lithography upgrades. As noted, YieldStar and HMI system revenue are now reported in net system revenue. Otherwise the service and field option revenue would have been even higher at approximately EUR 790 million. 
Our gross margin for the quarter came in at 47.6%, slightly higher than guided, driven by a higher top line and favorable mix. Gross margin includes the amortization of intangibles, as well as the effects from the fair value assessment of HMI's inventory as of the closing date of the acquisition. Overall, OpEx came in as guided, although R&D expenses came in slightly lower at EUR 315 million and SG&A expenses came in slightly higher at EUR 99 million. 
Moving on to the order book. Q1 system bookings came in at EUR 1.9 billion, including orders for 3 3400 EUV systems from 2 customers. Strong bookings continued in the logic sector in support of the 10-nanometer ramps and in support of the EUV insertion at the 7-nanometer node. Memory bookings strengthened further from its strong Q4 level supporting expected year-on-year growth in the memory sector in 2017. The continuing order flow for EUV systems increases our EUV backlog to 21 systems valued at EUR 2.3 billion. Our overall systems backlog now stands at EUR 4.5 billion. In addition, we also have 4 EUV upgrade orders valued at approximately EUR 200 million. This will bring these 4 NXE systems to NXE:3400 performance. In total, we have 14 3300 and 3350 systems in the field, which are candidates for upgrades. As a reminder, system upgrades are not included in our system backlog. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Quarter-over-quarter cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments came in at EUR 3.84 billion. As already mentioned in January, we saw a significant level of early payments from customers in Q4 of last year, which resulted in a negative free cash flow of EUR 212 million in Q1. 
As a reminder, in Q2, we have several extraordinary cash outflows, which will bring the overall cash balance back to our target level. Assuming approval at our AGM, we will pay a dividend of EUR 1.20 per ordinary share or approximately EUR 515 million in total to shareholders. We also have a bond maturing in Q2 with an outstanding value of EUR 238 million. And lastly, we expect to close the acquisition of 24.9% of Carl Zeiss SMT during the quarter for EUR 1 billion. 
Based on our current business view, we see a continued strong demand for DUV, Holistic Lithography and EUV products throughout the year in both memory and logic. Our view is supported by our highest backlog ever. 
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations and guidance for the second quarter of 2017. We expect continuing sales strength in Q2 with total net sales between EUR 1.9 billion and EUR 2 billion, including an estimated EUR 200 million of EUV revenue. We plan to ship 3 NXE:3400s in the June quarter. Our EUV shipment plan for the full year includes 12 systems and is back-end loaded. We expect our Q2 service and field options revenue to again come in above EUR 650 million, driven by continued demand for Holistic Lithography options, high-value upgrades and our growing installed base. 
Gross margin for Q2 is expected to be between 43% and 44%, driven by the recognition of EUV system revenue. Excluding the EUV revenue, gross margin would be approximately at the same level as Q1. Q2 gross margin also continues to carry the effect from the purchase price allocation for the HMI acquisition. The negative impact of these purchase price allocation adjustments for Q2 is more than 1 percentage point. The impact for the full fiscal year is about EUR 90 million and will reduce to about EUR 40 million per year from 2018 onwards. 
R&D expenses for Q2 will be about EUR 315 million and SG&A is expected to come in at about EUR 100 million. As a reminder, our share buyback program remains paused for the time being as we close our planned equity investment in Carl Zeiss SMT. The remaining approval from China is expected in time to close the transaction in Q2 2017. 
And finally, as mentioned before, an increase of our annual dividend from EUR 1.05 to EUR 1.20 is submitted for approval at our Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on April 26. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to you, Peter.",897

Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Wolfgang. As Wolfgang highlighted, our business continues to perform well. We started the year with a very strong quarter, and we expect this positive momentum to continue throughout the year. While Wolfgang reviewed our current quarter performance and outlook for the coming quarter, I would like to provide some additional commentary on our markets and our longer-term outlook as well as provide a few highlights on our product portfolio. 
As seen in our first quarter results, logic demand remains solid. And our memory demand continues to strengthen with DRAM largely compensating for weak spending in 2016. Logic demand is driven by continued ramp of 10-nanometer with memory demand driven by DRAM 1x nanometer node and additions of 3D NAND capacity. 
The strength in shipments to China this quarter was driven by existing Chinese and non-Chinese customers. As for new China business, we are in discussion with multiple Chinese logic and memory customers regarding timing of system demand for their new fab projects. We expect shipments to support pilot production in these new fabs starting in 2018. 
While it is still too early to provide quantitative guidance for 2017, our directional view, as expressed last quarter, remains largely unchanged. However, in terms of potential magnitude of our business, it now appears that memory demand will be up significantly as compared to prior year. 
On the ASML product side, let me start with an update on our EUV business. We started shipment of our NXE:3400 system, which will be the EUV workhorse in volume manufacturing over the coming years. Furthermore, we continue to make progress towards our 125 wafer per hour productivity and 90% availability commitment. At the SPIE Advanced Lithography Conference in February, our customers presented their latest results confirming our progress on these metrics. The status of the EUV infrastructure was also presented by our customers. And while there's still work to be done on things like pellicle, there appear to be no major roadblocks for EUV insertion in the time frames as indicated by our customers. 
Regarding demand, we took 3 EUV production orders from 2 different customers this quarter, bringing our total EUV backlog to 21 systems. And as Wolfgang mentioned, on top of this, we booked 4 orders for a total value of around EUR 200 million for upgrades of EUV systems currently in the field to NXE:3400 production specifications. And by the way, these orders are field upgrades and do not show in our reported order backlog. 
EUV order flow continues while we work to finalize a VPA with at least one of our major customers, which will translate into additional orders over the next quarters. As customers continue to assess timing of their roadmaps and firm up the layer adoption, we're beginning to get a clearer view of EUV demand for next year. The average analyst demand expectation stands at around 20 new systems shipped in 2018 which, given our current view seems reasonable, while we still have the option to build up to 24 systems next year. In DUV lithography, demand for our TWINSCAN NXT:1980Di immersion systems continues for both logic 10-nanometer and DRAM 1x nanometer nodes, bringing the installed base to more than 60 systems. We're also seeing strong demand on our KrF platform where we boosted the productivity of our XT:860 system further to 250 wafers per hour. For our 3D NAND customers, we released new options that improve focus and alignment performance of high-topography layers typical for this application. And to maximize capital efficiency, a number of customers also upgraded their immersion systems through significant announcements to productivity, imaging and overlay. And these upgrades drove significant growth in our option business, which will continue to drive growth through 2017. 
In Holistic Lithography, we continue to ship our most advanced YieldStar 350 metrology systems to our customers, supporting qualification and ramp of the 10- and 7-nanometer logic node, as well as the 1x nanometer DRAM node. In addition to YieldStar metrology systems, we're also shipping HMI e-beam systems that are now reported as part of our systems revenue as Wolfgang mentioned. The integration of HMI is progressing well and customer interest in our pattern fidelity products remains high. 
So in summary, a great start to the year with a very solid quarter. Strong DUV demand, service and options business show a further growth momentum and continued EUV order flow provides a clear indication that this technology has now become a part of our mainstream business. We expect the positive industry environment to continue resulting in a very good year for ASML. 
And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions.",771

Would love to hear how your discussions are progressing and how you're seeing adoption? And what kind of layer count we should be assuming at that first part of the adoption curve?",69

Yes, like we said, we are talking to logic and memory customers. So on DRAM, the expectation is indeed -- 1y to be specific, it's the mid-teens, 16, 15-nanometer DRAM. That's what -- that would be the introduction node. And that would involve 1 to 2 layers. So you have to remember that, of course, the DRAM market is quite a significant market. So 1 to 2 layers is a decent start for EUV technology at this node. And we're talking, at least, to one customer very specifically, but other customers have shown similar interest and they will follow suit.",101

And then I guess as my follow-up, Wolfgang, if you could give us an update on how you're seeing the trajectory for EUV gross margins.

C.J., so the story there is pretty much unchanged from what we communicated at our Capital Markets Day in late last year. We were at minus 75% or so last year. Our objective is to get to 40% by 2020. We're targeting breakeven this year. There were several components to get this accomplished. One is simply volume, shipping 3x as much as last year. As you can imagine, it's the same factory producing that, so that will help. The second one was mix. Last year, we shipped 3350s. This year we're shipping 3400s. As you know from prior calls, the list price on those is approximately EUR 20 million higher. And the cost is not EUR 20 million higher, so that will help. And then of course, we have the service business where we've talked before that we're charging per wafer, which of course, ultimately is a lucrative business model, but as we are not churning out a lot of wafers right now, but have to man the systems is a -- has a significant dilutive effect on gross margin. And last but not least, we are progressing on the learning curve as well as in our own factory, the number of hours to -- it takes to put one of these things together. And also with our suppliers as well as work that we have to do in the field to upgrade these systems and bring them to the latest level. I think the expectation of 20% is still good for next year as we, again go from 12 systems to around 20 systems as mentioned earlier. And then, we made some progress last year where we can now do partial revenue recognition upon shipment. But again, it's partial revenue recognition because in case we have some performance criteria that will be met later, we got to defer some of the revenue. But on the other hand side, it will help that some revenue that we deferred in the past will come in at no cost. So that's why we believe in this year the deferral and what's coming in is roughly offsetting each other. That's why we said also in our communication that the revenue should be somewhere in the EUR 1 billion to EUR 1.2 billion range. And again, I think we are on the right path to get to 40%. And volume is the biggest driver of it.",403

My first question is on the orders that you have this quarter. The [ order ] was pretty high -- strong. I just want to ask how sustainable do you think the order trend is. And in particular, on the memory order.
[Technical Difficulty] 
In particular on the memory orders, the orders are significantly higher than anytime in the last 2 years. Can you just, a bit more color on -- is it driven by capacity additions of 1x nanometer and any kind of visibility on whether it's NAND or DRAM?",98
388904.0,"ASML Holding N.V., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2017",2017-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3669.0,1172998.0,48273308.0,Answer,P. Wennink,,Executives,13,"Yes, just making a small note here, NAND or DRAM. The orders in Q1, yes, I think that's sustainable for the next few quarters. Given the fact that -- given the outlook that customers are giving us. And yes, it is significantly higher than the last 2 years. But you have to remember, that what we saw over the last 2 years was especially weaker order flow from DRAM-type customers. Because the DRAM market was -- over the last 18 to 24 months, not that strong. And it had to do with the fact that in 2014, we ended -- beginning of 2015 and '14 of [ high mix ] [indiscernible] assumption came online, which were big fabs that actually -- we actually saw when you added them up, it was quite a significant step-up in capacity. But we haven't seen any new fabs coming online at that size since. But what we did see -- and it has to do with your NAND and DRAM question, what we did see is that given the economics of the DRAM markets over the last 2 years, we've seen leading edge litho capacity being used in NAND productions. And that has actually happened, and I think we mentioned that on previous calls also, but bringing the wafer out capacity down with double-digit percentages. Now that has created the situation clearly where demand and supply of DRAM end products was somewhat unbalanced over the last 9 months, which led to increase in DRAM prices, which is not unsurprising that now customers are back filling that capacity that they actually used to basically produce NAND over the last couple of years. And it also is an entry into your question on NAND versus DRAM. It makes it all very opaque if we have NAND and DRAM sitting next to each other. And depending on the market situations, leading-edge litho can be used for either/or. And that's why we look at memory now. And we said it also before as one segment. But looking at it, let's say, from a bit demand point of view, what we currently believe and also looking at last year's bit growth numbers, 30% in DRAM, 40% plus in NAND, looking where the capacity situation is today, looking at the price situation, I can fully understand why memory customers are filling up their open spots in their fabs to make sure that they have sufficient capacity to fulfill the demand of their customers. Now sorry for the very long answer, but you asked 3 questions, so that's why I had a longer answer.",433

They are largely active in the packaging market. What we have done is effectively created a memorandum of understanding to start working together, whereby we actually use them as one of our suppliers, one of our suppliers in -- not so much in the lithography market, but more in the metrology systems area. And we have a cooperation which is focused on making sure that they will get a better understanding of how you manage a modern, complex supply chain.

And we continue to believe that that's going to be flattish year-over-year. It's good news. We have a memory business. I think we both used the words significantly up for us as what we previously believed. Last quarter, we said -- right now, I think it's flat, but it could be up. And now we think it's significantly up. I think that's more than EUR 100 million definitely. And then we have our EUV business, which was only EUR 350 million or so, which we -- like we said before think it's going to be between EUR 1 billion and EUR 1.2 billion. And then don't forget field options and services. Even with the adjustment that we made, we made EUR 2.1 billion last year. And if you add up the 2 quarters, the actual and the guidance, we're almost at EUR 1.4 billion. So we're at a significantly higher run rate there. So I -- without giving a quantitative guidance, I'd say the EUR 7.9 billion is pretty much, very much on the conservative side. I'll give you one other way to look at that maybe helpful for you, Sandeep. If you look at the first half, the actual and the guidance and you deduct that we only have EUR 200 million in EUV revenue in there. So you know in the second half, the bulk of the EUV revenue will come in, and we have not indicated that our non-EUV business is going down. So if you do these 2 exercises, I think you'll get to a pretty good range that is quite a bit higher than EUR 7.9 billion.",316

So if I kind of think about what I heard on the call is very positive developments about EUV, you have already 20 to 21 orders in the backlog. You'll have more in the next couple of quarters. So next year, like 20, 22 is also probably what we are going to see. And at the same time, I heard also that the DUV business is likely to do well in 2018 as well because, mostly because of China generating like a new area of demand in DUV. And when I look at consensus expectations, basically if I assume there is about like $2 billion of EUV revenues -- sorry, EUR 2 billion of EUV revenues with about 20 tools, then that implies the DUV business would be down about $1 billion in 2018. Do you think that kind of pullback makes sense and would reflect maybe like a sustaining of the rollout of the 10-nanometer node? Or do you think actually to 28 and could be another very strong year in DUV?",179

Although what you're asking me is to just give you some reasonable financial feedback on what we think 2018 is going to look like, which I'm not going to do. But qualitatively, I don't see anything at this moment in time that will bring the DUV business significantly down. There is continued strength in the memory business when I look at the strength of the logic business. And leading-edge logic needs a performance memory, so it needs DRAM, and that's clear. I don't see major new DRAM fabs coming online within the next 12 to 18 months. That means that all available spots in -- or let's say, slots in factories that can take leading-edge DUV will take leading-edge DUV given the fact that I don't see that bit demand, end demand will go down significantly. So -- and if memory will stay strong, you mentioned China. I think China longer term -- and I think I said it on the last call, medium to longer term, that will be a, is a big opportunity for the entire industry. However in 2018, what we're seeing in terms of memory projects coming online, it will be focused on, let's say, finishing the construction and then putting the first pilot lines in, which will not drive a big, let's say, addition to installed memory capacity. It will take time. I think all those memory projects are all new. You could call it greenfield, not only a greenfield fab, there are greenfield companies, is going to take a bit of time. Now, the positive thing is that, of course, all those choices for technology and for wafer fab equipment will be made in the next 12 months' time frame. So it's going to be strategically very important to be in China and to actually have -- and to sign up those Chinese customers. But the rollout of that capacity will not be in 2018. 2018 will be pilot production. And you see an acceleration of that roll out in 2019 and 2020. So -- but all in all, we do not foresee a DUV market in 2018. I think what we're currently seeing in the end market simply does not support such a negative view.",374

So 12 system this year, 24 next year, the 7-nanometer introduction and then as we go into '19 and '20, the doubling is driven by DRAM and higher critical layer as you migrate to 5-nanometer logic. Is that fair?",130

Wennink,,Executives,37,"So I think it's a little bit more complex than that, because 7-nanometer is not ending in 2018. I think as you will see the production ramp for our customers in late 2018, '19, and it will continue into 2020. But you will be seeing layers on top -- these node layers will be on top of each other, like we discussed earlier on these calls. What we're currently seeing is that you all see an acceleration of a capacity ramp for a new node by the leading customers, which is almost like a camelback. It's like a hump, and now you have a very long tail. Now that long tail in 7-nanometer will be extending into 2020 and 2021, but it is not by the 1 or 2 leaders in logic, but there are also followers that will move into that 7-nanometer node, and they will start using the EUV in that time frame. So you will see layer upon layer. So this is not nice clean-cut end of 7-nanometer node followed by a 5 nanometer. It's going to be layered. On memory, you said 2019, DRAM 1 or 2 layers. Yes, in production, but I think we'll see probably earlier adoption of 1 or 2 layers in DRAM than 2019.

And those are options that are add-ons that they need in their production process, which of course for us is good business and for the customer always an area where they think they can have some purchasing advantages.

Peter, I was just interested in following up a bit more on some of those comments you were making on the EUV decision-making process. You highlighted during your prepared comments, the public comments from all 3 of your lead customers acknowledging the progress that's been made on EUV not only by yourselves but also across the ecosystem that was fairly well publicized at SPIE. Yet, we are still not seeing all 3 step up sort of equally in terms of orders. I think TSMC has been pretty clear and consistent with what they are intending to do over the last couple of quarters. We can see some of that in your backlog. Samsung also seem to have been clear in their statements, yet as you just highlighted, we don't yet have the volume purchase agreement or indeed the sort of volume orders that you'd highlighted or that you had perhaps expected in the first quarter. And then, finally, Intel, they were the first to sign a VPA 2 years ago now, and yet they still haven't really acted on it. And they had publicly said they would do so when the technology was ready. And again, publicly, they seem to admit that it is, yet they haven't stepped up in terms of their order rates. And given what you described in terms of their 2019 ramps, I'm just wondering sort of why you think we are seeing such sort of different positioning from these lead customers and with a closing order window later this year, where's your confidence level that indeed the 2 who are lagging are going to step up over the next, say, 2 quarters?",283

Wennink,,Executives,42,"Well, to be honest, I don't think customers are really lagging, one. But they have different areas of focus, and they have different road maps and timing of road maps, which they would like to execute and also the size at which they want to do it is also different. So this is not a homogeneous pack. This is heterogeneous, 3 different customers, 3 different road maps, 3 different ways in which they want to execute this. But I think you are absolutely correct when you refer to the public statements, which are very convincing. But it is only the public statements. As you can imagine, we are in a very close contact with them, and we're also seeing what they're doing in preparation of that EUV ramp. And that's real tangible. I mean, those are factories. Those are EUV pedestals. Those are -- that's EUV infrastructure. It's being built and being put into place into those fabs. So that is also tangible, which is not that visible, but to us, it is. On the negotiation process, that's also different per customer. For instance, one of those customers doesn't have a volume purchase agreement yet, but they have orders in our backlog. So they order tools without the VPA. But the volume purchase agreement is really to determine, in their best interest, what the pricing is on a certain volume. Now that is a commercial negotiation, which -- as Mehdi asked in the previous question, is also a matter of how many options do you want and what do you want to pay for those options. So these things are commercial negotiations, which are not fully detached from the planning of what they want to do, but it is a different process. So you have the planning process for the production, which we're pretty close to, which actually drives our own planning, our own production planning and you have the commercial process. And that commercial process ends when it ends, and that's where we are. So I think in summary, 3 different customers, not homogeneous in the way they look at their road maps, the timing of their road maps, not homogeneous in the way that they negotiate and not homogeneous also in the speed at which they want to do something and the speed of their ramp. So this is what we have to take into consideration, but -- again, it's -- I'll try to put some color on what we said before, and what we said before is that we see this ramp of EUV very clearly coming on the 7-nanometer, which means 12 units this year, which are now, say, around 20 units next year, and we could see a further doubling in the years thereafter when we look at the customer road maps and their execution planning. And I think that is the most important to mention right now.",483

And I think last call, you said that you'd be totally full for those slots and even have some backlog by the end of the year for 2019 shipments. So I guess, I'm wondering why you'd only ship 20 systems next year versus 24. It would seem like you have to ship -- you are like totally full on those slots. Why wouldn't you ship all those slots versus only 20. I'm just getting some questions from investors that it seems like a downtick, and I just wanted you to address that.",122

Wennink,,Executives,47,"I think when you look at the 20 -- you have to remember that we also booked 4 upgrade orders. So there are customers that are taking those tools, those 3350s and 3300s out of the R&D. They want them upgraded and put them into production. So that adds another 4. So we always said when we look at our production capacity and we look at the road map and the timing of the road maps that our customers are currently talking about in terms of their road maps ramps and look at that time, we said we will have to use that 24 capacity. Well, 4 of them at least are now being upgraded. So that's basically taking out of R&D and then put into production, which is probably efficient use of the capital. It also means that we need to allocate some of our production people to upgrade in the field, not in our factory, but in the field. Which also has an impact on our own capability. Because you actually have people in the field, competent people, production people, that are in the field doing these open-heart surgeries. So it is a mix now. I want to say new systems and customers wanting those upgrades, because it is capital efficient.",213

You've got 21 tools in your backlog at the end of the Q, first quarter. My understanding is the lead times are including the supply chain about 18 months, and if you're looking at shipments cumulatively in 2017 for the rest of the year and what you said for 2018, it's about 30 tools -- 30, 32 tools to be shipped.

Then it's not a hard and fast rule, right, where you have 18 months. And it's not just the order that's the communication between us and the customer, I mean we are sitting together with these customers on a weekly basis. And just because we don't have a piece of paper that says VPA because some final detail on the term and condition is not done means that we don't have a very good view on what these customers need in which quarter in the next year. And it comes down a little bit to trust as well, right, where you trust the forecast is eventually translating into an order. Of course, in the long run, you've got to have the discipline to have the orders coming in because we can certainly not be the inventory holder of the industry.

It's really the weekly connection that we have with our customers and the almost weekly, or you can say, monthly updates that we're getting on that EUV planning. That is driving this.

And we will be looking at halving the lead time over the next 3 years, so I said till the end of the decade. So by 2020, we should have half the lead time. Which is by the way, this is what we did with DUV. And with DUV -- as a matter of fact, we are reducing the factory cycle time in our factory and the overall lead time of a DUV system still. So it is a continuous process, but it is continuous learning. It's almost exponential learning. That's what it is. That will drive the lead time down.",113

And now the question is, can you do that through multiple patterning or double patterning EUV, which would cut the productivity in half or would you do that with basically a shrink capability with higher productivity through a high NA tool. And the economics that we have calculated on the high NA tool is clearly preferring a high NA solution instead of double patterning EUV when you go to the 3-nanometer node. So as far as we are concerned, looking at the specs, high NA is the preferred economical solution.",122

So we had quite a bit of volume effect there. Plus, of course, our mix is developing, right? I mean, you see more Holistic Lithography as a percent of revenue, you see HMI with the full quarter in there.

I would like to first highlight some of the second quarter financial accomplishments and then provide our view for the coming quarter. 
Q2 net sales came in at EUR 2.1 billion. Net system sales accounted for EUR 1.38 billion, showing another quarter of increasing memory business, which is now at 54% of net system sales, and also a strong quarter of logic sales, which represented the remaining 46%. Installed base revenue for the quarter came in stronger than expected at a level of EUR 717 million, driven by major DUV and Holistic Lithography upgrades. The first half of the year, our total installed base revenue is already at EUR 1.45 billion compared to a full year sales of EUR 2.12 billion in 2016. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 45%, slightly higher than guided, driven by a higher top line and a favorable mix. Overall OpEx came in as guided, although R&D expenses came in slightly lower at EUR 313 million and SG&A expenses came in slightly higher at EUR 102 million, driven by litigation expenses. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Quarter-over-quarter cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments came in at EUR 2.51 billion. As a reminder, in Q2, we had several extraordinary cash outflows, which have brought the overall cash balance back to our target level. We've paid a dividend of EUR 1.20 per ordinary share or approximately EUR 517 million in total to our shareholders. We also have repaid a maturing bond with an outstanding balance of EUR 238 million. And lastly, we have closed the acquisition of a 24.9% interest in Carl Zeiss SMT during the quarter for EUR 1 billion. 
Moving on to the order book. Q2 system bookings came in at EUR 2.37 billion, including orders for 8 3400 EUV systems from 2 customers. Six of the EUV orders came from one customer for use in both logic and DRAM. Total bookings were almost EUR 500 million higher than in the previous quarter. Breakdown of the bookings of 60% logic and 40% memory is the same as in the previous quarter. Strong bookings in the logic sector are in support of the 10-nanometer ramps and in support of the EUV insertion at the 7-nanometer node. Memory bookings, mainly in DUVs, strengthened further from its strong Q1 level, supporting an expected 50% year-on-year revenue growth in the memory sector in 2017. The continuing order flow for EUV systems increases our EUV backlog to 27 systems valued at EUR 2.8 billion. Our overall systems backlog now stands at a record EUR 5.35 billion. After 2 strong quarters in 2017, in combination with a record order book, we are now expecting full year net sales, which are up approximately 25% from our previous record revenue of EUR 6.8 billion in 2016. 2017 revenue is driven by continued strong demand for our entire portfolio, driven by both logic and memory.  
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations and guidance for the third quarter of 2017. We expect continuing sales strength in Q3 with total net sales of around EUR 2.2 billion, including an estimated EUR 300 million of EUV revenue. We plan to ship 3 NXE:3400s in the September quarter. Our EUV shipment plan for the full year remains at 12 systems and is back-end loaded. We expect our Q3 installed base revenue to come in around EUR 600 million, driven by continued demand for Holistic Lithography options, high-value upgrades and our growing installed base. For the full year, we expect our installed base revenue to be up by approximately 20% versus the 2016 levels. Gross margin for Q3 is expected to be around 43%. Excluding EUV systems, gross margin is approximately going to be at the same levels as in Q1 and in Q2. R&D expenses for Q3 will be around EUR 315 million, and SG&A is expected to come in at about EUR 105 million. SG&A includes expected increases in legal expenses. 
Finally, ASML will resume share buybacks in Q3. As a reminder, we had paused our share buyback program for about 1 year to acquire HMI and the minority share of 24.9% in Carl Zeiss SMT. We have EUR 1.1 billion remaining for 2017 from our previously announced share buyback program. We do not expect to execute the entire remainder of the program in Q3 and Q4. In line with our policy, we will return excess cash to our shareholders through share buybacks, and we will make announcements on future share buyback programs when appropriate. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to you, Peter.",773

Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Wolfgang. As Wolfgang has highlighted, our business continues to perform very well. We expect our positive momentum to continue throughout the year based on the market environment and the related strong demand for our products. We should deliver another record year with net sales growth expected at about 25%, representing one of the strongest gains in annual revenues in our history. 
While Wolfgang reviewed our current quarter performance and outlook for the coming quarter, I would like to provide some commentary on the longer-term outlook of our market drivers, followed by an update on the progress and plans for our product groups. Let me start by making some comments on the market drivers and the impact on litho demand. As we have moved further into the year, the demand for memory has continued to strengthen, especially noticeable in DRAM. We are on track to see our memory revenue grow by around 50% year-on-year, creating the highest memory demand in history of ASML. However, we need to remember that this growth in spend coming off 1.5 years of wafer capacity reduction due to significant underspend in 2016 and relocations of leading-edge tools to 3D NAND and that combined with a significant end market demand growth this year. In 3D NAND, the industry continues to witness a number of greenfield fabs that are ramping, which is driving very strong lithography growth. Logic demand, where our tools is expected to grow around 15% year-on-year, driven by the continued ramp of 10 nanometer as well as the start of the 7-nanometer node, which is particularly driving the logic growth this year as it concentrates on the planned EUV adoption. 
With regards to China, we've been doing business in this region for over 25 years and currently have over 600 employees in 11 cities supporting an installed base of more than 400 lithography systems. We also have 2 R&D centers in China and are working to deepen our relationship with Chinese semiconductor industry customers by collaborating with industry consortia. We signed a memorandum of understanding with the Shanghai Integrated Circuit Research and Development Center, ICRD, a public research consortium dedicated to the advancements of the semiconductor industry in China, set up a jointly owned world-class application and training center in Shanghai. We have seen continued revenue growth for China -- from China over the last 5 years by both domestic Chinese as well as nondomestic companies, and we see a lot of opportunity for growth in this region going forward. However, as we mentioned on earlier occasions, the speed with which this growth will translate into sales and earnings is dependent on the ability of our new Chinese semiconductor customers, who effectively bring qualified and competitive products in volume to the market. This might take some time. We are currently in discussions with 5 domestic logic and memory customers, which per published fab plans, that translates into a lithography opportunity of more than EUR 3 billion. This opportunity led last quarter to bookings from a new Chinese domestic memory customer with shipments later this year. 
In summary, we will see significant growth in memory demand versus prior year, and logic will build further on the healthy demand level seen in 2016, largely driven by EUV and China providing a meaningful medium-term growth opportunity. Installed base revenue continues to grow at an even greater rate than last year, driven by broad-based adoption of high-value field options and upgrades. And finally, demand will be further accelerated with the EUV adoption as customers start ramping this technology and volume production. Our current view is that the positive business trends that we're seeing in 2017 are likely to continue as we enter 2018. 
On the ASML product side, let me start with an update on our EUV business. In EUV, we continue to make progress as planned. We now have demonstrated all key performance specifications on our NXE:3400 system, and this includes a throughput of 125 wafers per hour. We also demonstrated 250 watts of a source power, enabling productivity improvements beyond 125 wafers per hour. Availability continues to make progress towards the 90%-plus target with continued focus on reducing the variability. We now have a system configuration that provides all of the agreed product specifications, which will enable us to now focus our work on executing on the plant availability improvements that will drive broad-based EUV insertion in mass production. 
In addition, clear progress on the ecosystem continues as communicated by many of our customers. We have produced 0-defect pellicles, and our customers continue to make progress on photoresist sensitivity, enabling higher wafer per hour productivity. Based on this progress, customers are now more and more confident inserting EUV technology in manufacturing, as clearly indicated by the continued order flow. 
Our deep UV business is expected to grow this year of a record revenue in 2016, fueled by the demand for our immersion and KrF products in both logic and memory. We announced our latest TWINSCAN NXT:2000 immersion system at SEMICON this past week, and this new deep UV immersion system reaches several hardware innovations that to deliver improved imaging and overlay performance in support of aggressive lithography requirements on future nodes, including mix and match with EUV. We're also seeing exceptional demand with our KrF products, notably in 3D NAND. 
In Holistic Lithography, where we bring together scanner, metrology and software to provide high-value process control solutions for our customers, we expect sales to grow about 50% from last year. We have announced our latest metrology system, the YieldStar 365 -- sorry, 375, featuring new optics technology that generates more accurate data at the highest speed, providing increased quality data to feed the process control systems. In addition to YieldStar metrology systems, we're also shipping HMI e-beam systems in support of 3D NAND voltage contrast and defect inspection applications at both memory and logic customers. Product integration of HMI is progressing well with Pattern Fidelity Metrology e-beam tools being evaluated by customers, which enables Pattern Fidelity Control capability in support of the 7-nanometer node. To drive -- through further drive productivity improvements in the e-beam area, we're in the process of developing a multi-e-beam system that combines leading edge e-beam technology with ASML's unique stage and computational lithography technology.  
Finally, we also closed the acquisition of a 24.9% interest in Carl Zeiss SMT. The main objective of this agreement is to strengthen our world-standing partnership with Carl Zeiss and facilitate the development of next-generation EUV lithography system, which we call high NA, due in the first few years of the next decade. This technology should enable the semiconductor industry to produce much higher performance microchips at a lower cost, supporting customer road maps throughout the next decade. 
So in summary, great first half of the year with strong industry demand across all market segments, translating to very strong growth across our complete product and service portfolio for 2017. In previous quarters, we mentioned that we felt we passed an EUV inflection point. Now we see volume orders from all segments of the industry clearly marking an increased rate of adoption with order flow expected to continue, providing significant EUV growth in the coming years. As mentioned earlier, our current view is that the positive business trends that we're seeing in 2017 are likely to continue as we enter into 2018. 
And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions.",1235

Just -- first question, just on the EUV. Obviously, very good progress in the quarter, and you've put a slide in the presentation showing, potentially, for 15 to 16 layers that you could see EUV adoption up for 7 nanometers. I just wondered if you could let us know has there been any changes on your base case assumption for how many layers you could see the adoption of 7 and maybe even 5-nanometer as well in logic, and then I have a follow-up.",89

I don't think we currently have any reason to change our base case assumptions. We put that in there because the additional 5 or 6 layers that you have identified on top of the 10 that has been communicated earlier, are really layers that, in the discussion with the customers, we have identified as potential additional layers. Now that really depends on the speed with which we will be able to mature our EUV systems and drive the productivity up and the availability. Because it's all a matter of cost, and I think the initial 10 are driven, you could say, by the lithographic needs. You just need to use EUV. The additional 5 to 6 will be a function of productivity and the maturity of the tool.",129

And then secondly, just one on the commentary on the installed base and field option sales. You obviously have very strong growth in H1. And given the commentary that you've given for the full year, maybe my math's wrong, but it would suggest a bit of a slowdown in the absolute level in the second half. I wonder if you could just comment on why you feel that's the case or maybe correct if I've got something wrong on that.",83

First of all, you're right. I mean, the -- we had an extremely strong start into the year. We have at EUR 1.45 billion, was a EUR 2.1 billion for the total last year. So it's incredibly strong start. We think we'll be up 20%. Be reminded, last year, we said we think we grow that business by approximately -- at a run rate of 10%, which we were very close to last year. But this year, it's 20% [ up ]. Within that, you have approximately half service and half options. The service piece is pretty stable with an upward trend. It's a function of the installed base to the last degree. The upgrades are a little bit more volatile, and that has largely to do with when our customers can afford to take the upgrade. Because you've got to remember, some of these upgrades take their machines down for 5 weeks or so. And when they're firing on all cylinders, they -- even though they see the great -- even pegged off the upgrade down the road, in the short run, for their yields, they can just simply not afford to take the machines down. And that is why, in the second half, the options piece is coming down a little bit. But having said that, we're having a fantastic yield there, 20% up year-over-year. And I think the trends are of continuous growth there will all go into next year.",248

So I would love to hear from you guys, too, what kind of improvements you're showing, particularly on the reliability in uptime side, which I think is the clear factor that is causing these guys to commit.

Wennink,,Executives,13,"well, I think the most important factor that drives the confidence of the customer is actually in the key forms requirements that they need. It's in 250 watts, which we show, the 125 wafers per hour. And of course, we make gradual progress in the availability and in the maturity of that system. But like we said on earlier occasions, that is going to bring us to a situation where we have that when they ramp in volume in 2019. So they know that will take some time, just like the development of the ecosystem for them with photomask and with photoresist, will take some time also. But the most important part of that, actually drove that conference calls down to meeting all the key lithographic performance criteria, that drove the conference. We now have a system that actually has all that performance in it. We just have to make it a bit more reliable, and that will take a bit of time. And we will know it, and there's a whole program driving it. And it's as simple as that.",181

Wennink,,Executives,15,"Difficult question to answer. I'm not going to guess in this particular case. But what we are seeing is both a combination of filling up available spots, open spots in current DRAM fabs because of the market demand, and the technology transitions that are happening across the customer base. And some customers are leading in that sense, and other customers are followers. But all do technology migration. It's across the base. So it's a mix, whereby open spots in, you can say, open pedestals in effect to these are currently being filled because of the strong end market demand in DRAM, which is particularly driven by the data centers. So it's a combination of both. With DRAM, that's strong. There are not that many 3D NAND relocations happening. But that happened in the past. That happened over the last 18 months, which created this space to backfill with leading-edge lithography systems to address the rising demand in DRAM market.",159

I was just wondering if we could revisit to the 2020 model, particularly in light of the strength you're now seeing in 2017 and your expectation heading into next year as well. If I go back to the scenarios, you guys outlined at the Capital Markets Day last year, you gave us sort of 4 scenarios that supported the EUR 10 billion revenue pre-HMI. But given what we're seeing, some of the lower sort of end scenarios that you have there, in particularly unlikely, I mean, first of all, you have talked about the sort of layer count -- initial layer count expectations of EUV. You're now seeing sort of 10 layers. At the time, we were still between 6 and 10. So 6 layers quite a bit lower at the low end of that range. And then similarly, in terms of the end market assumptions you are using for your lower-demand scenario, a 20% node-on-node decline in wafer starts seems particularly cautious at this point, given what we're hearing in terms of new compute applications and the greenfield build-outs you've highlighted in China. So given that, I mean, do you not think it's sort of more fair to look at the 2 higher-end scenarios that you've outlined there we should sort of minimize likelihood of the 2 weaker ones?",224

I think you're exactly right. I mean, we will not be standing there in New York last year telling you exactly where to pinpoint the revenue in 2020. We gave you a bit of a model with the key sensitivities and, as we've explained, the 2 major ones when we go through all of our sensitivities end market demand. And there, we have shown a little bit of sensitivity, and you see, there's not been that much of an upside and a downside compared to the intensity of the EUV and insertion, where we've seen between a high insertion and low insertion, it was quite a bit of a difference. I think the market assumptions provided another EUR 1 billion to the upside and then was another EUR 2 billion or so in the EUV insertion. I think what we can say is that we were certainly more confident that we're not going through the bottom end of the scenarios because you're absolutely right with everything that you're hearing from the end markets, be it frames and memory, being it new applications, being it like autonomous driving or a move towards autonomous driving, data centers, big data, analytics. Whatever you hear is pointing that the market is not going to be soft. And then with the recent accomplishments on EUV, if we follow through, which is our intent to -- now that we have the specs met, that we get the availability up. And to Peter's earlier point, right now, we've highlighted 10 layers, for instance, in logic that will be initial layers. As we move this further up, we have an opportunity to overachieve that number. But it's too early to pinpoint a new number. That's why we have given you these sensitivities.

Just a quick follow-up. Wolfgang, in terms of the EUV rev rec this year. So earlier in the year, you were thinking, if I recall, sort of EUR 1.1 billion, EUR 1.2 billion. Is that still a reasonable number given sort of shipments and tool performance in the field?",51

It's a good question. I mean, at this point, I would say that it's going to be around EUR 1 billion or so. I mean, it has to do with a whole bunch of things. Like you know, since last year, we can recognize majority of revenue with shipments, but there are still a few things that we need to defer. For instance, if -- the installation, we have a little bit if we provide a longer warranty. We have to defer a little bit there. And we also got to really look at whether the configuration at the factory test is exactly the same as when we retest the system at the customer's site, which in a time when you're struggling to get all your material together can sometimes -- small pieces are different than the final test at the customer. And there, we have to defer again by a quarter or so. So I'd be careful there. And even though we shipped 12 systems and even though we get some deferred revenue in from the past, we will still have to defer a bit of the revenue into 2018. So if you want to be on the safe side, I would count on EUR 1 billion right now. Of course, this has the effect now that we have a stable configuration. Next year, we're going to recognize in the same year, plus we then have a catch-up. I mean, we'll have a deferred revenue balance at the end of this year. So next year, not only will the shipments go up from 12 to 20 before upgrades, but we're going to get a couple of hundred million on deferred revenue. So I would plan on EUR 1 billion right now, Andrew.",294

The development that we're seeing there is that we're executing as planned, as part of the acquisition, on the combination of the ASML lithographic -- let's say the Holistic Lithographic computational competence with the e-beam competence that HMI has in the field. Now the combination of those to the first product will be shipped in the second half of this year and will be evaluated by 3 customers. With positive evaluation, we will then start to ship that product in 2018, which will be a single-beam tool, combined with the ASML computational lithography competence. Now that will be an intermediate solution and will be focused on defect inspection, on wafer inspection. That will be -- that will follow by a more, let's say, economic solution, which will involve multi beam. Multi beam, which actually has the advantage of being able to inspect the wafer much faster, which will bring the cost of inspection down, will also -- the -- you could -- so array or the service that you can inspect will also go up, which will also -- which could have a very positive impact on the customer yields. So that is a product. That's scheduled for the year thereafter, so after next year, whereby it's not only the multi-beam column. Because if you have a capability to move the wafer faster, you also need faster stages. Now lo and behold, there's one company on this planet that's very good at fast stages, and that's ASML. So I think fast-stage technology, combined with good computational lithography, combined with a multi-e-beam solution will get a very powerful solution for wafer inspection going forward.",277

I think we said also on the call that this business was already very, very good last year, and we're up another 15% or so. And I wouldn't put too much weight, albeit it gives you some info on the structure of the backlog. But I wouldn't put too much on the details on the bookings there.

Wennink,,Executives,34,"Well, I think in -- when you think about the growth in capital intensity, where the 50% growth, is really deep UV. I mean, we do take some EUV memory orders, but that is not for capacity additions. Those are really for ramping up and qualifying the product, and the ramp will be at the end of the second half of 2018 going into 2019. So that is not driven by any EUV shipments. It's really deep UV and particularly strong in DRAM. And that is like I said in the prepared remarks also, but I'd like to repeat it. It's not a major surprise, if you think about it. I mean, the DRAM supply and demand curves are -- I'm going to talk about the end product, the DRAM device, really driven by the capacity situation and the end demand. And in a situation like we had in 2014 going into 2015, where 2 major fabs in Korea, M14 and L17, came online, started to take as many tools as they could to fill up the fab, you got a big step up in capacity, where, of course, the end demand doesn't follow that step curve. And so you have a period in which there is a supply and demand imbalance and, at least, a lower DRAM prices, which actually, at that moment in time, memory makers that could also see strong demand in 3D NAND start to relocate capacity out of DRAM into 3D NAND. Now that end demand, driven by strong data center demand, when that goes up, we'll catch up. And that has actually happened the second half of last year, leading to increased DRAM prices. And that is not a surprise then that those empty pedestals, where previously they had litho tools that are now in 3D NAND, are being backfilled with the technology transitions on top of that. And that is creating the strong demand this year, also driven by a strong end market where the data center demand is very strong for leading-edge DRAM. Now what does that mean for bit growth? Well, bit growth, 26% is what market research firms say, now listening to customers that might come up with some different numbers. But trying to predict those numbers is very dangerous. Because last year, we saw market research firms talking about DRAM growth rates, and I'm talking about the end demand growth rates, of lower than 20%, and it ended up north in the high 20s. So difficult to predict. I would suggest we keep looking at the DRAM prices. The DRAM price, it is a commodity, is a reflection of the supply and demand balance. And currently, there is some undersupply, and that's for sure.",455

This is Wolfgang. I got to disappoint you there a little bit. I -- we are not big trackers of this metric. We're solely focused on our EUR 11 billion and the potential upsides to that. And the reason why we're not focusing on this too much is twofold. Number one, historically, the customer CapEx has not shown a strong correlation to our own revenue in a given year. But more importantly, it is something that is very difficult to normalize because you got to think about FX, for instance. I mean, 2.5 years ago, the exchange rate was $1.40, and then it went down to $1.10 to euro. And all of a sudden, the litho spend looks lower, but had nothing to do with our business. It's just the different exchange rate. Secondly, if you heard earlier in the call, we have a very specific strategy to provide upgrades to our customers that we have in field options and services and that they don't necessarily count in the different people's calculation on adding up these numbers. I think from that perspective, we are not looking at it. But we're not worried about our share on the overall spend. We're worried about executing our road maps and getting to our revenue, and it will be whatever share of whatever somebody puts together.",224

In the discussions we've had with customers, that's being addressed. It also has to do -- is a matter of design parameters that you can take into consideration. So that's the sole part of the equation of why high NA is an economic solution or not and everything that we currently calculate. And I think our customers agree with us that the high NA specification, which includes in the different mask size, is very likely.

It's around 30 units, could be a bit more than that, that they need for 2019, which, by the way, could be almost similar to what we're currently looking at where we can ramp in terms of our own capacity. We've said before, we will ramp our capacity double, double from 2018 to 2019. That is true for our build capacity here in Veldhoven, but we're seeing 1- or 2-quarter delays in that capacity in the supply chain. So that means that, that capacity buildup of, let's say, 45-systems capacity is really there in 2020, but in 2019, we see 1 or 2 quarters delay. So that -- around 30 demand, if I add it all up today, is -- that would -- could probably nicely fit to what our capacity is, could be a bit more than 30.

I mean, we have said we're coming on a journey from minus 75% last year to 40%. So now you can argue whether it makes the breakeven a little bit tougher this year and the 20% a bit easier. But in general, it has a little bit of a relocation left and right, but it doesn't change our trajectory that what we have in mind is really 40%. We need that to get to our rate of 50%. And we always said the biggest variable there is the volume, and the second biggest variable is the serviceability of the tool. And then we have -- with the learning curve and avoiding E&O. And with the tool now performing to the specs and that enabling us to ""freeze"" the spec and really work on availability, that makes us really much more comfortable that also on the financial side, we can deliver on that 40%.",165

Wennink,,Executives,57,"I think the ramp-up is a good question. I think the ramp-up in the supply chain, of course, when we said customers turned the corner, but the order flow is also a good evidence of it and is also has ignited a lot of activity in the supply chain. However, going from a very low level to then ramping it up here and there, it doesn't always go as smooth as we would want. That's why I alluded to a 1- or 2-quarter delay to the capacity ramp to, let's say, 40, 45 units. And that's where we are. And I think it's not so much a matter of money. Money doesn't always help you. It's just a matter of can you get the people on time trained, can you get the materials on time with long lead times. And then you could argue money will help you to put -- to get people in faster. But the learning curve is the learning curve. So these are the kind of things that we are -- as we're driving together with our suppliers, and this is what we -- what the current status is. Now rest assured, we'll do anything to get more out. If the demand is higher, then we'll just put everything that we can. But I'm afraid money alone will not do it. So it has to be people, knowledge, and how far we can push it is too early to say.",245

So the second follow-up question I wanted to ask you is that you did mention in your prepared remarks about China where you said there are about 5 fabs. How would you characterize between the need for leading edge versus the trailing edge there?",46
388904.0,"ASML Holding N.V., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2017",2017-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3639.0,1246470.0,50547031.0,Answer,P. Wennink,,Executives,62,"I think that's a good question, interesting question, but it is not the case at all 5 of those customers are all leading edge. And then you have to define what is trailing edge. If you would say in logic, 28 nanometers and below, you qualify as leading edge, then all the logic is leading edge. Now for memory, at 2 DRAM initiatives there, there are definitely -- I would call them leading edge if look at the nodes that they are focusing on. And in 3D NAND, it's 3D NAND. What's leading edge? It's a number of layers, yes? And I think that is where they will start on the learning curve and will not be immediately 64 or 72 layers, but it's going to be a learning curve. Now you have to put that into perspective of why China has taken this step. China's taken this step from a very strategic point of view. In the discussion we have had, very clear that the reason why the stepping up is this, let's say, investment in capacity, leading-edge capacity, is because of the dependence that they currently have on non-Chinese companies who provide China with the right technology. And the geopolitical situation is -- has not become more stable or more reliable or more trustworthy from their point of view. So China has decided that leading technology, leading-edge technology should also be local. And that fits perfectly in the 5-year plan. If you read their 5-year plan, that's what they want. So I don't think that the investment money that will be allocated to those companies that are focusing on trailing-edge technology, that's not going to happen. It's going to be all leading edge.",286

We haven't even given a revenue guidance for Q4, and I think I'm not going to start with the gross margin guidance. I mean, in general, it's clearer next year. Even if we -- I think I've said before, if we defer revenue, in general, it makes it a little bit more difficult to get to the breakeven, but it makes it more simple to get over the 20% next year. It's a bit of a positive effect. But next year, it just depends on -- we got to just see the overall business, and it depends on the rest of the business, right? Because if -- I think Amit did the math before, if you're going from EUR 1 billion to over EUR 2 billion and even if you go from around breakeven to 20%, it's still far below the average of the rest of the business. So without a specific number, which I'm not going to give today, on the non-EUV business for 2018, I can't answer the gross margin question either. But I think the most important thing for us is what I said earlier. Our confidence in EUV volume and EUV gross margin is growing. Our gross margin in DUV, in CLS, in HMI, in applications is healthy. It's exactly where we need it to be, and therefore, we feel very comfortable that we get all the 50% in 2020. But it's too early to talk about Q4 and next year's specifics, Rob.",258

Wennink,,Executives,67,"Yes, I think it's a good question. One correction, I think, 250 watts is not going to be 2019. We have 2 in the 250 watts now. We have the modules that will be inserted in our tool shipments by the end of year, which will provide our customers with 250 watts. So we'll be available as of next year, yes, so one. Two, the -- as you know, because you've been following the company for a long time, the value of our tool is really driven by the ability of our customers to keep cutting cost, the cost per wafer, and that -- the biggest driver there is productivity. So if, going forward, we can improve, for instance, the transmission of the lens, we can improve the transmission of the pellicle, which all takes -- currently takes a way bit of light. The -- like I said in the prepared remarks, customers are progressing on the sensitivity of the photoresist. These are all things that are actually helping to get more light on the wafer. When you get more light on the wafer, you move the wafer faster. When you move the wafer beyond 125 wafers per hour and you can guarantee that, then the tool provides more value. And that's exactly how we're going to do this, and this is a general concept which customers accept. Now when we give them -- instead of 125, 145 wafers per hour, 145, then we'll charge a higher price because we basically split the value of that 20 extra wafers, 50% for the customer, 50% for ASML. So that will also mean a higher sales price for the EUV system. But that happens after we can guarantee the over 125 wafers per hour performance, which is the function of the things that I just mentioned.",304

I would like to first highlight some of the third quarter financial accomplishments, and then provide our view for the coming quarter. Q3 net sales exceeded our guidance coming in at EUR 2.45 billion, largely due to the revenue recognition of an additional EUV system. Net system sales of EUR 1.82 billion was nicely balanced between foundry, memory and IDM, and was more than EUR 400 million higher than in Q2. 
Installed base management revenue for the quarter came in at EUR 628 million, slightly above our expectation. Our gross margin for the quarter came in at 42.9%. Gross margin was diluted by the additional EUV revenue recognized, but compensated by higher-than-expected DUV and Holistic Lithography sales. Overall OpEx came in slightly below guidance, with R&D expenses at EUR 315 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 103 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Quarter-over-quarter cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments came in at EUR 2.68 billion. As highlighted during our July call, we resumed share buybacks in Q3. During the quarter, we purchased EUR 169 million worth of shares. Since January 2016, we have purchased shares of approximately 6 million shares with a value of EUR 569 million against our 2016 and 2017 authorization of EUR 1.5 billion. 
Moving to the order book. The 3 system bookings came in at EUR 2.15 billion. The growth in the immerse and KrF order intake is an indication of the strength of our EUV business. Last quarter's strong bookings were driven by the memory sector, which represented 77% of orders compared to 40% in Q2. Our EUV backlog now reflects 23 systems valued at EUR 2.6 billion. As for EUV orders, we are working closely with our customers to understand the EUV demand through 2020 and use this as the basis for our shipment planning. Actual order intake is always lumpy, and we do expect to take additional orders in Q4. Our overall system backlog now totals a record EUR 5.69 billion. 
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations and guidance for the fourth quarter of 2017. We expect continuing sales trend in Q4, with total net sales of around EUR 2.1 billion. While we target to ship 6 NXE:3400s in the December quarter, we expect revenue recognition of about EUR 300 million for our EUV business. We expect our Q4 installed base management revenue to come around EUR 600 million. This revenue guidance for Q4 brings our total revenue expectation for 2017 to approximately EUR 8.6 billion, which reflects a greater than 25% year-on-year increase. Installed base revenue will account for almost EUR 2.7 billion for the year, also reflecting a 25% increase. Total EUV revenue for 2017 will be around EUR 1 billion, which represents more than 2.5x the 2016 level. 
Gross margin for Q4 is expected to be around 44%, R&D expenses for Q4 will be about EUR 315 million, and SG&A is expected to come in at about EUR 110 million. With this guidance for Q4, our total operating income for the year is expected to exceed EUR 2.25 billion, reflecting a greater than 35% year-on-year increase. 
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to you, Peter.",541

Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Wolfgang. As Wolfgang highlighted, our business continues to perform very well, and demand for our products is very strong. Based on our guidance for the upcoming quarter, we expect to deliver another record year with net sales growth of at least 25% over 2016. The positive industry environment across multiple end market segments continues to fuel strong demand for our products as we move into 2018. 
While Wolfgang reviewed our current performance and outlook for the coming quarter, I would like to provide some commentary on the longer-term outlook of our market drivers, followed by an update of the progress and plans for our product groups. This year's memory strength will translate into a record memory revenue year for us. This, in combination with our strong memory backlog, seems to serve as a solid foundation for further growth into 2018. As our customers further migrate next year to the sub-20-nanometer DRAM nodes, we benefit from a significantly increasing litho intensity for those nodes, driving litho intensity up over 30%. 
Additionally, we do not see significant near-term completion of new DRAM fabs. This is amidst a healthy mid-20s DRAM bit demand growth scenario, largely driven by demand for performance memory in the service space. All in all, a strong base for our 2018 DRAM business. 
In 3D NAND, litho demand is also strong with a number of greenfield fabs ramping. The ramp greenfield fabs take approximately 10% more litho spend than the previous 2D NAND fabs. As this technology scales vertically, there are challenges in building these very tall stacks. In response on NAND memory, manufacturers are implementing so-called stacks of stacks, where every new stack needs additional litho, driving litho intensity up by another 20%. But adding the NAND opportunity to the DRAM business outlook for next year, we can see another strong memory year ahead of us. 
Logic demand remains solid, driven by the continued ramp of 10-nanometer as well as the start of the 7-nanometer node. Litho intensity continues to increase as we migrate to future nodes, and further strengthens with the adoption of EUV at 7-nanometer. As expensive multiple patterning schemes keep driving up the cost of every new node, EUV provides process simplification, cycle time reductions and yield improvement, ultimately resulting in customer cost benefits, which clearly explains the stated desire to introduce EUV for the next nodes.
With regards to China, we continue to see revenue increase throughout the year, and are on pace to set a new net revenue from this region in 2017. This trend of increasing sales to the Chinese region will continue in 2018, as we see strong demand from notable customers building out fabs in China, including additional system orders from new domestic Chinese customers. We expect to see a number of new customers starting pilot ramps next year, and are further expanding our customer support footprint in order to meet the future significant demand growth in this region. 
As we mentioned last quarter, we estimate the initial lithography opportunity on these new domestic Chinese customers to be around EUR 3 billion over the next 3 years. 
On the ASML product side, let me start with an update of our EUV business. In EUV, availability continues to make progress in both average performance as well as reducing variation. In addition to delivering 0 defect pellicles, we also demonstrated the capability of these pellicles to withstand 250 watts of power in support of 125 wafers per hour and beyond targets. 
We continue to work closely with our customers to align on their EUV demand plans and the required timing of tool shipments. Supporting our customers' delivery timing requirements depends predominantly on the ramp-up speed of our supply chain, specifically optics. Long lead time for EUV systems, combined with the inherent fluctuations of our customers' ramp plants poses significant planning challenges. To address these challenges, we continue to work intensely with our supply chain to bring the lead times for EUV down from 24 to 18 months. 
Taking all of the aforementioned into account, we currently have a production plan of 20 EUV systems next year, at least 30 in 2019 and 40-plus in 2020. Also, in support of EUV production implementation, we shipped the first e-beam EUV reticle inspection tool, the eXplore 6000, to a logic foundry customer. This system enables improved defect detection, as optical inspection has resolution challenges on EUV reticles. 
In deep UV, we see continued revenue growth across the product lines, driven by immersion and KrF technology. We provided early access to our latest TWINSCAN NXT:2000 immersion system for initial development of the 5-nanometer node. This new system features several hardware innovations that deliver improved imaging and overlay performance in support of aggressive meshed machine overlay to EUV, which is required for future nodes. The very high demand for our immersion systems equals the fastest ramp of our NXT platform industry as we shipped the 100th NXT:1980 system in Q3. Strong demand for our KrF product is across multiple market segments, primarily driven by 3D NAND. 
In Holistic Lithography, we shipped our first jointly developed product less than 1 year after closing of the HMI acquisition. This product, the ePfm5, is a Pattern Fidelity Metrology system that leverages HMI's high-resolution e-beam metrology with ASML's computational lithography technology. This product's high-resolution capability enables a high capture rate of systematic patterning defects, so customers can accelerate the yield learning curves and drive higher production yields. This integrated system enables the first-ever guided metrology, delivering faster, effective throughput to support volume production. 
In summary, we have demand growth continuing across our entire product portfolio. And we expect another record year, at least 25% revenue growth, largely driven by continued strength of memory demand, alongside solid logic demand. Although it's too early to fully quantify 2018, our current view is that the positive business trends that we're seeing in 2017 will continue in 2018. 
With that, we'll be happy to take your questions.",994

And Dave, on the deferred revenue on EUV, you're correct, same thing, like what we said last quarter. We will carry a significant deferred revenue balance into next year, which means that our total revenue for next year will be higher than what the 20 shipments that we have planned and, of course, the 4 upgrades that we also still plan to do. So the total revenue will include some of that deferred revenue. And there will be a little bit of revenue deferred of the 20 systems, but the majority will be recognized. Therefore, we continue to say that for next year, you should use a planning assumption of around EUR 2.5 billion for total EUV revenue.",119

Wennink,,Executives,16,"The answer on the new capacity is a difficult one. Like I said, let me first answer your first question on the sustainability. On DRAM, like as I said in my prepared remarks, there are no significant new fab plants that will take tools in 2018. So next year. So in other words, in terms of new fab capacity, it will be pretty limited what you will see in terms of wafers out in 2018, which actually means that the bit demand, which is currently around the mid-20s, needs to come from shrink, from innovation, which actually happens. I mean, there's a lot of innovation happening in DRAM. So we got sub 20-nanometer, and then we'll provide those bits. At least that is what the expectation is. And I would support that, I mean, that the innovation drive should be sufficient to deal with the demand, but there would be no relief. On 3D NAND, a lot of greenfield fabs, and that means that there's a lot of shipments to those greenfield fabs. Now when we look at the forecasted bit growth on NAND, it is the reason really where the big question is whether that bit growth is going to be able to absorb all that new capacity in 2018. We don't know yet. I mean, we've -- currently, we've been surprised also this year about a bit stronger bit demand growth that we originally anticipated. That's where probably a bit of a question is probably too early to answer. But all our memory customers, they indicate that, also, on 3D NAND, they see significant bit growth next year from the demand side. So if anything, if you would want to place a question on sustainability, now start asking our customers on what they believe how much capacity is now added or will be added in 2018 and what they think about the demand situation. And the demand situation, of course, we're further away from that, so it's more difficult for us to give you an answer in that direction. Now what is new capacity? Well, I actually answered. I said new capacities -- a lot of new capacity is being added in the 3D NAND space, not a lot of new capacity in the DRAM space. But all in all, if we look, like I said in my prepared remarks, what the drivers are, very much the end drivers that customers tell us are server markets that  already -- markets for the take-up of the new 3D NAND products all looks very healthy. And customers are very upbeat, as also evidenced by the intake in our order book in Q3.",442

The main bottlenecks, as I mentioned also in my prepared remarks, are the lenses, the optics. The optics are the gating item right now. So we're working very hard with   ZEISS to make sure that we can get a bit more output. But as we currently see it, I mean, we've mentioned in all of the numbers, which are up 20 for next year, at least 30 for 2019 and 40-plus for 2020, that is what our current planning is. But we also have started to run programs with our supply chain to shorter -- to shorten the lead time and to shorter the cycle time in their factory. So the total lead time for EUV can come down from 24 to our target by 2019 of around 18 months. So we're working hard, but it's currently optics.",139

And then for 2018, we're targeting 20%, and our objective for 2020 is 40%. So we haven't quite spelled out 45% yet. We have also said that 40% is not the end of the road.

On the last question, it is predominantly being used initially, I would say initially, by logic, yes, because that's where the biggest challenges are because of the more random patterns that you see there. So that will be the first area where you would see the introduction. But as we've seen with all the solutions that ultimately provide customers with more certainty, what happens on the wafer and gives them the ability to make changes, so that it can really manage yield, that also crosses over to the memory products also. We've seen the same with YieldStar and that Star between logic, and it also moves now over into the memory space. And how big is that market? Well, that's a good question because we're actually is a product for which a market does not exist yet, because it's a product that actually -- or the Pattern Fidelity Metrology where you have, where you use the predictive capability to actually manage yield through the scanner is a completely new area. So we have our ideas of what it can mean, but -- and we think it can create -- there's a lot of value. If you look at the first PFM, the Pattern Fidelity tool -- metrology tool that we're shipping this year, we're shipping a few, but the first one we did in Q3, I mean, that has a high level of interest with our logic customers. So how big is that market? It depends on the value that we're going to provide. We have high hopes and expectations, but that needs to be basically worked out together with the customer because that really -- you really show the value of on the wafer. So that is -- juries still get out, but we have high hopes, and actually because it provides an efficacy tool loop that nobody else does.",312

Just interested how to -- sort of how that might step up, particularly when we consider the contribution to ZEISS next year, and also likewise on capital spending, particularly as you're continuing to fit out for the EUV ramp.

Let's start with SG&A. SG&A should grow only very modestly. I mean, we have very few variable pieces in there, but we invest a bit in sales. We invest a bit in HR, a little bit in IT systems. But I think that we'll be growing at a much lower rate than the revenue, and we'll stay around that 1 10 rate, probably a little bit up. If you look -- and our objective there for 2020 is 4% of revenue. For R&D, we're going to add up to 1 25 or 1 26 for this year, which is based on our revenue guidance now in the fourth quarter is somewhere just shy of 15%. And if you contrast that to 2014, 2015, 2016, it was 18%, 17%, 16%, the spend, respectively. Now we're around 15%. We will spend more in absolute terms next year, exactly for the reasons that you mentioned. High NA, both on our premises, but then also on Zeiss SMT's premises. And then we do continue to invest strongly also in the Holistic Lithography field. We're actually accelerating investments there. A bit too early to give a number. It will be up, but I think it will be 14%. So it will be up in absolute terms. It will come down in relative terms towards our target of 13% in 2020. CapEx, we're not that super CapEx intense ourselves. We spend around EUR 200 million for the first 9 months. I usually don't guide, but assume that we're getting out somewhere between EUR 270 million, EUR 280 million. The last 3 years, we're somewhere between EUR 310 million and EUR 370 million. So this year, we'll be around 3% only of revenue. Our long-term model is 4%. And there, you should expect it to come up a little bit over the next 2 or 3 years, but not beyond the 4%, I think, that we have in our 2020 model. And that is, indeed, to prepare the site for high NA prototypes and high NA manufacturing later on. Tax rate model is 14%. The innovation box, negotiations have been going very well. We're in the documentation phase. So we have a principal agreement. We're in the documentation phase that very well supports our 14% model. As it relates to the outcome of the coalition negotiations here in the Netherlands, they're -- and there's no law yet. That's just a proposal. But if that comes through, the benefit of the innovation box will reduce slightly -- without going into the technical details, will reduce slightly, but it's accompanied with a reduction in the corporate tax rate. So both are literally offsetting to each other. There may be a slight timing difference that the reduction of the benefit comes earlier than the reduction of the corporate tax rate, but I think that will not be a significant impact on the 14% model, Andrew.",488

To start with your last one, the actinic inspection tool is not an issue where we are today, and I don't think it's going to be an issue for the 7-nanometer ramps either. I mean, we're going to patent the inspection. So we basically print the photomask, and you inspect the pattern on the repeatable defects. And then you can now weigh this on the photomask. And you inspect the photomask with e-beam preferably, and then you can do the correction. So masks, I think we have all the solutions that we can think of for the 7-nanometer introduction. Photoresist actually makes some good progress, and especially on the sensitivity side. I mean, we're seeing continuous numbers coming back out of the industry and industry participants on sensitivity of the photoresist, which is good, because the more sensitive the photoresist is, the faster you can move the wafer, the higher the throughput. So pellicles, you just mentioned, pellicles being able to withstand 250 watts of EUV power is very good. So I think from an ecosystem point of view, all those elements are increasingly coming to phase, where you can call them mass production-ready.",195

But I mean, there haven't been new DRAM fabs built in the last decade with DRAM capacity having internal demand, et cetera. Do you see the 2 actually -- for the footprint of the EUV tool, et cetera, that to get the EUV tool into DRAM fabs, that do you need actually new DRAM capacity rebuilt? Or based on what your application is, you know already that these existing fabs can be actually upgraded to EUV once the conversion starts? And how quick do you expect a memory DRAM conversion to happen? And I want a follow-up after that.",118

I think on the first shipment to DRAM fabs will be to existing fabs. So we don't need to build new fabs to house an EUV tool. However, if you say we're going to use EUV more broadly and widely in DRAM in the next decade, I'm pretty sure it's going to be fabs built that can accommodate a larger number of EUV tools. Now as a matter -- when you said the last decade, no new DRAM fabs, I may remind you that we have in Korea L17 and M14, which were completely new fabs, which actually are very large fabs that actually drove up the available capacity a couple of years ago, 3 or 4 years ago, to quite significant heights, which I think also led to an oversupply of DRAM at that time. Well, that's not happening today. Well, we're not seeing the announcement of any major new DRAM fab. So that means that the EUV tools that we will be shipping will be shipping to existing fabs that will be able to take them.",179

I'll take that, Sandeep. If you recall, we have entered into 2 separate contracts. We have an equity investment, and then we have a high NA agreement. The equity investment is EUR 1 billion for 24.9%. That is already showing on the line equity method investments. If you look to our U.S. GAAP statements, you already see that there. And that will show a P&L contribution from Carl Zeiss' profit to us. So that's basically 24.9% of the profit is going to show in our P&L. It will show for the first time in Q4. So you see the investment already, but you don't see any contribution in Q3. And that simply has to do with our close process being faster than SMT's close process. So the accounting rules allow us there to do a 3-month offset. And for Q2, we only really had 4 days. So we didn't bother to put that in Q3 because it's not material. We will walk you through the math on how that profit will show up in our P&L because it wouldn't be accounting if it would be easy, because we'll have to do a lot of adjustments here. First of all, they are IFRS. We have to translate that into U.S. GAAP. Believe it or not, at 24.9%, you need to do like a mini purchase price allocation. So there will be some amortization of intangibles, writeup of inventories, all the good stuff that you know. So it will be slightly convoluted at the beginning. But the end result, and from a cash perspective, SMT is a very, very healthy profitable business, and we'll get solid returns on our investment there. As it relates to the high NA agreement, we will make R&D contributions, and we will make CapEx contributions. The R&D contributions will show up in our R&D line. Again, it gets complicated. Some of it has to go through the equity piece because we're a partial owner as well, but the CapEx piece will be recorded on our assets, PP&E repayments. And as a reminder there, the return on our investment, other than getting a high NA tool, is that we get these investments back through adjustments to the price of the lenses later on when we take delivery of the lenses, similar to what we have done previously with our partner there. So right now, you have just R&D in there, a couple of prepayments and the investment. And then starting next quarter, you'll have some of the profits in there as well. And we'll walk you through in more details in January.",435

Maybe if you could give us some color around that, and if you still expect EUV to be at a breakeven level this year, given you're deferring a lot more revenue -- EUV revenues than you expected to defer at the end of the last quarter. And secondly, just as a follow-up, if you could give us some color on what drove these deferrals. Last quarter, I was thinking you'd be doing around EUR 1.1 billion in EUV revenues, and that looks like it's going to be a bit lower than that.",114

First of all, I'll check if it's still together after the year to breakeven level. And then like we said, 20% next year, 40% in 2020. We have always said we will be above EUR 1 billion. I think at the beginning of the year, we said EUR 1.22 billion. It always depends on which customers do you ship to and when do you ship. I mean, admittedly, the 12 shipments this year are back-end-loaded. And from that perspective, a little bit more goes into next year. Deferrals, in general, I'll address them by multiple different items. I mean, it could be that you have a new component in the system, which you can demonstrate in your factory. But you have to replicate in the customer factory to take full revenue. And that is the main reason why the revenue this year came down. We have made an adjustment to some systems. It's not a performance adjustment. It's a maintainability adjustment, which is good news because it will help us down the road with service profitability, which, if you recall, is a main contributor to get to the 14%. But since it's a new feature, we cannot go straight to what we achieved last year. Revenue recognition at shipment, we've got to replicate it at what we call SAT, which is the Site Acceptance Test that the customers require. It's a little bit deferred. That's the difference from the beginning of the year. But it's good news. I think the rest we said earlier. We have a deferred balance that we will start netting into the number in 2018.",270

I don't think that we're going to do that detail. Probably, in general, on 2018, there have been a lot of questions there as well lately. I can't be completely quantitative on this right now, but I think we can give you a few pieces that will help you form an opinion. And certainly, I don't want to go down to a customer level here, but we already talked about EUV. We get to EUR 1 billion this year, and then we get to EUR 2.5 billion next year. So that's a EUR 1.5 billion increase. You will have seen an extremely strong installed base revenue this year. I mean, we're going to almost EUR 2.7 billion, which is up 25%. And if you recall, we said in our longer-term trajectory, we see that business going up in average by 10%. Of course, the service part of it is a pretty stable growth. It's a function of the installed base, but then the options and upgrades are a little bit more volatile. But I would, right now, assume that, that business is flat to slightly up next year. And then for the rest of the business, the combination of EUV, holistic, in memory and in logic, we have experienced an extremely strong year this year, and we see 2018 at approximately the same level. And you have a bit of evidence there also when you look at our backlog, we've got EUR 5.7 billion in backlog. And even though we don't guide to backlog, I think the Street expectation was about just over EUR 1 billion in the orders for last quarter, and we took almost twice as much, EUR 2.1 billion. So I think, without going into customer details, but you should expect another very strong 2018 from us.",301

And then the -- but it's less than EUR 100 million, and then the balance of EUR 500 million is all the way towards DUV. But from a directional perspective, EUV -- we're still investing by the way, because we still have significant innovation. You heard about the 2000 coming out, for instance, now. We're just having upgrade of the first system to this 2000 level. But the rest is a bit more overlaid to deep UV, which over the next couple of years will start to come down.

I think we gave you quite a bit to work with because we pinpointed an EUR 11 billion revenue, but we gave some sensitivities, both around the market vector and the EUV intensity vector. And we're not updating this today. But I think what you can say is that the EUV adoption is well underway, and the lay accounts are not on the low end, as we talked before. And also, if anything, the market is very enthusiastic about end demand. So without updating it today, I think the probability on the low-low or the lower combination has gone down since the year.

Wennink,,Executives,71,"Yes, I think that's a very good question. I think in the latest discussions we've had with customers, there is no doubt they see the benefit of EUV full-stop. Now the question is about timing. And then we do see that from a timing point of view, there are some different requirements from customers from when they want to have the first tool. Now some of those customers would indicate, and then we have also pretty decent and deep discussions with them on what we could do there. So those customers indicated they would like to have this capability rather sooner than later. And if that would mean that we would have to set up an accelerated program, that actually means that we would also ask our customers to commit also in the acceleration and the cost of that acceleration. And that would be, I think, a precondition for us to accelerate. Now this is the level of discussion that we are having today. Now -- and I think -- and it's not superficial. Those are pretty deep discussions. And we're pretty clear also on what it would take to accelerate and what our commitments from the customers, how that would have to look like, which, by the way, we haven't reached an agreement yet. So it's just for your information. Now on the supply side, the gating item here is really the new optics, the optics that comes from ZEISS. This is exactly why we did what Wolfgang explained earlier. With the investment in ZEISS, we signed the R&D and the CapEx program. That's the gating item. Both will get from an EUV source of point of view, the EUV high NA tool will have the same EUV source. No source difference. The tool will be bigger, but we know how to deal with that. The real challenge is in the optics, and this is why we have started to go into this agreement with Carl Zeiss. And I would say that from this point onwards and from this moment onwards, that's really the gating item in this project.",350

With that, I'd like to thank you for your mostly strict adherence to my call instructions and your kind patience in any safe harbor references I might have made over these many years. Now on behalf of ASML's board of management, I'd like to thank you all for joining us today. 
Peter, if you could formally conclude the call, I'd appreciate it.",170
