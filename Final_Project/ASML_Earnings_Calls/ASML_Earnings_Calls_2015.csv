I would first like to highlight some of our financial accomplishments for 2014. Year-on-year, we grew our revenue by 12% to a record level of EUR 5.86 billion. 2014 gross margin was up almost 3 percentage points to 44.3% while our earnings per share increased by 16% to EUR 2.74 per share. Last year, we paid a EUR 0.61 per share dividend worth EUR 268 million and used an additional EUR 700 million to repurchase 10 million shares, returning a total EUR 968 million to shareholders throughout 2014. So all in all, a very successful year for ASML. 
Looking to Q4. Our net sales came in at EUR 1.49 billion, which was ahead of our guidance. Memory accounted for 65% of our system sales in the quarter and also drove the upside in system sales. As anticipated, we recognized revenue for 1 EUV system during the quarter and service and field option sales came in at a very healthy level of EUR 409 million. Gross margin for the quarter was solid at 44% compared to our guidance of approximately 43%. Our gross margin was driven both by product mix and higher volume. R&D expenses came in slightly above our guidance at EUR 268 million, affected by both a strong U.S. dollar and a one-off settlement with a farm-out partner related to our suspended 450-millimeter program. SG&A expenses came in as expected at EUR 79 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Quarter-over-quarter, we grew our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance to EUR 2.75 billion. Regarding the order book, with the NXE:3350, we started to include EUV orders in the bookings and backlog for the first time. Overall, Q4 systems bookings were strong again at almost EUR 1.4 billion, including 2 NXE:3350 systems. An anticipated shift in bookings strength toward logic occurred, which represented 73% of bookings. This was largely driven by foundry. Although memory bookings dropped to 27% of total this quarter and Q4 memory sales were strong, as mentioned, the memory sector backlog remains high at 43% of total. As a result of the strong foundry bookings, our backlog grew to almost EUR 2.8 billion, including EUV. 
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for Q1 2015 and share our initial view on the first half of 2015. Our strong logic bookings last quarter have now given us overall a nicely balanced backlog going into 2015. We expect that strong sales to the memory sector and strength in our service and field option sales will continue in the first half and that sales to the logic segment will increase from the second half 2014 to the first half 2015. 
For the first quarter of 2015, we expect total revenues of around EUR 1.6 billion. We do not expect any EUV revenue recognition during the quarter. As mentioned earlier, we expect strength in service and field options revenues to continue, and we expect revenues in this portion of our business to be about EUR 400 million in Q1 and to strengthen throughout the year. We expect gross margins for Q1 to be around 47%, driven again by sales volumes by the expected rich product mix and continuing strong system performance-enhancing options sales. R&D expenses for the first quarter will be at about EUR 260 million. SG&A is expected at about EUR 83 million. 
Peter will talk more about EUV shortly, but I would like to make a few points regarding EUV shipment and revenue recognition for 2015. As most listeners are aware, we have shown excellent progress in improving on key performance metrics related to productivity and reliability in 2014. Also as announced last quarter, 1 foundry customer has ordered 2 production EUV tools for the eventual insertion in 10-nanometer high-volume manufacturing. The first one of these systems is planned to ship to the customer mid-year. It is highly likely that the demonstration of all key performance metrics will not be confirmed until 2016. 
The accounting rules under these circumstances are not allowing us to recognize any revenue until all performance metrics are met. Hence, we do not expect to recognize revenue on the 2 TSMC NXE:3350s in 2015. We are at various stages of negotiation for the other 4 NXE:3350 tools as well as the 3 customer-requested NXE:3300 to 3350 upgrades, which are in our 2015 production plan. The final negotiations on these systems will determine shipment dates, payment terms and revenue recognition. 
Finally, with now previously mentioned strong financial position and cash flow prospects, we will continue to return our excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We intend to increase our dividend per ordinary share for 2014 again by 15% to EUR 0.70 per share. And accordingly, we'll submit a proposal for authorization to the 2015 Annual General Shareholder Meeting, which will take place on April 22, 2015. We also intend to continue to purchase our own shares during 2015 and 2016, including 3.3 million shares to cover employee stock and stock option plans as well as up to EUR 750 million worth of shares intended to be canceled. The buyback program will start tomorrow. At current share price, these intended repurchases represent a total value of approximately EUR 1 billion. 
Now with that good news, I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter.",891

Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Wolfgang. And so as Wolfgang highlighted, we had a very successful year in 2014 with record sales and record annual gross margins, leading to significant EPS growth. Alongside our 2014 financial performance, we can also claim significant success in product development, new product introduction and product adoption. As Wolfgang also highlighted, we expect our strong second half 2014 sales to continue into the first half of 2015, driven by continued substantial memory spend and an increased spend in the logic sector, which is all supported by our current backlog. 
Today, we see that foundry is essentially working on 3 to 4 nodes at the same time. The 28-nanometer node, the current high-volume node, is still at its full 100% capacity as new demand for this node keeps growing. Therefore, we expect that our 2 shipments in 2015 will be used for capacity additions at this node in order to meet the growing demand. At 20 nanometers, the first chips are on the market, so that node has moved into volume at some foundries. The 16- and 14-nanometer nodes are being qualified for production and there's process development happening at the 10-nanometer node. As we mentioned in earlier calls, the foundry industry effectively sees the more aggressive ramp of new notes ever in their quest for faster, more energy-efficient and cost-effective shrinks for mobile and communications applications. 
In memory, industry analysts are expecting both NAND and DRAM market demands to continue growing at the similar rate to 2014, which means a little under 30% for DRAM and about 35% for NAND. New DRAM fabs are planned and some are already being equipped to meet the demand, compensating for some lost capacity in DRAM due to device shrink, node complexity and compensating for growing device size with movement from PC to mobile DRAM. Next, through the initial introduction of vertical NAND, NAND fabs are continuing their planar node shrinks and are expected to add greater capacity to meet forecasted bit amount. 
As to our product development and product introduction successes, we have ramped our NXT:1970Ci immersion product, launched late in 2013, faster than any new product introduction before with over 50 shipments in 2014. Our TWINSCAN immersion systems set new productivity records at over 1.5 million 300-millimeter wafers imaged in 12-month period, creating huge value for our customers. And we have had significant success in customer adoption of our new YieldStar metrology products with an installed base of all YieldStar products touching on 200 units. 
Regarding EUV, we commented in great detail at our Investor Day in November, so I won't repeat myself too much here. But as a reminder, we have met the 500 wafer per day target that our customers set for us in 2014 as we have now demonstrated these productivity levels at notable customers over multiple days. We also demonstrated the source power at 100 watts with 96% die yield, which is a key factor to get to the productivity levels that our customers need for volume production. Our 2015 productivity target remains at 1,000 wafers per day. And importantly for our customers and for our EUV program, we received the first 2 orders for our fourth-generation NXE:3350 EUV tools, the first of which is planned for shipment in the middle of this year. Our EUV product focus for 2015 is on improving the stability and availability of the machines in the field and to continue the encouraging progress that we've made with EUV productivity so far. We will furthermore concentrate on shipping the first 6 NXE:3350s so that our customers can continue their process integration planning and to begin to introduce these tools into their production environments. 
Before I end my introduction, I would like to comment on some recent events regarding our customer co-investment partners' equity holdings in ASML. All co-investment partners are approaching the end of their ASML equity lockup period, whereby they can begin to sell all or parts of their holdings if they wish to do so. Each company will act in their own best interest and are generally not obliged to inform us of their decisions. I would like to make it clear, however, that whatever they decided in this regard, it in no way represents a change of support for ASML or ASML. There's no impact on the co-investment R&D contributions committed by each partner company. 
Now with that, we would be happy to take your questions. I'd like to turn back to Craig.",745

My first question is regarding your EUV shipments. You've talked about those 2 EUV shipments to TSMC coming through in terms of recognition in the following year. How are -- I mean, how is your negotiations on the other tools going? And how do you see -- do you expect some of those other tools will also be recognized next year as well as how do you see the recognition going on the tools associated with the upgrade from the 3300 to the 3350? And secondly, my question is on 16- and 14-nanometer node. You had strong ramp-up in the foundries in the fourth quarter. Do you see that all those 16- and 14-nanometer orders have come in? Or is there a tail to that?",131
388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2015",2015-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3670.0,747576.0,32762569.0,Answer,Wolfgang Nickl,,Executives,8,"Sandeep, Wolfgang. I'll take the first part on revenue recognition. As of both of us mentioned, our prime focus here right now is to focus on shipping the tools so that customers can make progress on 10-nanometer mid-node insertion, and then preparation for 7 nanometers. Just to ground us, we shipped 3 tools in 2013, we shipped 4 tools in 2014. And we have currently a plan to ship up to 10 tools in 2015. As it relates to revenue recognition, it's different from mature technologies, where we recognize at shipment. And if you look at revenue recognition for this year, you've got to almost look at it in a couple of different slices. First of all, there was 1 3300 that remained to be shipped and recognized. And that system, I can tell you, has shipped by now. And we will recognize that, I guess, in Q2. Then secondly, there are 6 tools of which are 3350s. We've got an order for 2 of them. We ship them starting mid-year. And like I mentioned in my remarks, the revenue recognition rules, they require us to meet all performance milestones in order to recognize any revenue. And we forecast that to happen in 2016. So for the remaining 4 3350s, the negotiations are ongoing with several customers. And it will depend on that outcome and those terms of conditions when we ship, when we get paid, and then when we recognize the revenue. And the same applies actually for the 3 systems that we're upgrading for customers. Those negotiations are also ongoing. And again we will have to see final terms and conditions before we can tell you when exactly we'll recognize them.",283

And then before answering the second question, I will answer the second question, I'd like to add, Sandeep. I mean, if we ship the tools somewhere mid-year, let's say, early Q3, then we take 3 to 4 months to ship and to install the tools. So before the customer can start to do the first qualifications and we start meeting the performance metrics, we will be easily in the beginning of 2016. It's just the time that it takes. So on the second question, the 16- to 14-nanometer node ramp, have all orders come in? Well, you could actually look at the backlog and the order intake and look at the geographical distribution of our order backlog, how that changed during the fourth quarter. And I won't be specific on the customers. But you can deduce from that, that, let's say, some of the logic orders still need to come from other parts of the world. So I don't think everything is in.",164

And historically, you've provided guidance out a little bit more than a quarter. So curious, what's changing this time? Is it really a factor on the foundry side in terms of uncertainty of timing of shipments and/or yields? Or is there something else going on?",60
388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2015",2015-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3670.0,747576.0,32762573.0,Answer,P. Wennink,,Executives,12,"Yes. I think, during our introductory call, I think we were pretty positive on the, let's say, qualitative guidance that we're giving based on the backlog. Because you are right, the backlog is high. It's well distributed amongst memory and amongst logic. For the first quarter, we had a much better indications of the, let's say, time in which we can ship and which we can recognize because we now talk about the general -- the regular NXT immersion tools. But for the second quarter, there could be timing differences towards the end of the quarter, let's say, in the June, July timeframe, where tools might be pulled in a bit or went from 1 month to the other month. Now if you have 4 tools, that's EUR 200 million. I mean, those things are still fluid. So it's not a matter of that we have any doubts on the total demand, it's just a matter of when do we see the cutoff of those very expensive tools that are now over EUR 50 million a pop. So it's more that than anything else.",184

And I guess, if I could ask a quick follow-up, in terms of field services, I think your install base on the emerging front is roughly 224 tools, give or take. I'm curious, in terms of YieldStar upgrade, what penetration are you there today? And what kind of follow-through could we see in 2015, '16 as well as, I guess, the upgrades on the EUV side to help us understand how to model the spares and service part of your business?",84
388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2015",2015-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3670.0,747576.0,32762575.0,Answer,P. Wennink,,Executives,14,"Yes, I think on the last question, how do you model it? I think, we will guide you. When you talk about upgrades, it's a very wide variety of upgrades. You referred to YieldStar. That's one upgrade possibility. But another upgrade possibility, which is actually happening and we're signing deals for this as we speak, are upgrades for the entire tools, for instance, from a 1950 to a 1960, from a 1960 to a 1970, a 1970 to a 1980. There are 4 generations of upgrade possibilities there, which is, of course, an upgrade next to the application products that we are bringing out, which can be, let's say, brought back to earlier scanner models. So the whole upgrade program has a very wide variety of different products. That means it's very difficult to guide you on those different products. What we will do, and I think Wolfgang said it, that we start the year with about EUR 400 million in sales. And I think, Wolfgang, this will grow through the year with, I would say, a significant double-digit percentage towards the end of the year. This is clearly a growth engine. You might remember that on the applications business, the holistic litho business, we said we have a target of reaching EUR 1 billion by 2017. I think we're just over halfway, so there's still something to go. But there's not that many years left, so the compound annual growth rates are pretty steep. And that's only for the holistic litho. And that does not include, for instance, the system upgrades that I've talked about. So all in all, this is a very strong source of growth for us with good profitability.",283

The first one was really on memory. It looks like the order intake has already moderated a bit. But we have also seen a new fab announcement, I think, in December from Micron, Toshiba and some of these people. Presumably, those haven't ramped yet for you. So I'm just wondering what is your maybe 12- to 18-month view. I know it's difficult to predict. But do you think that memory cycle we've just seen has legs? That's my first question. The second one is then on the 10-nanometer foundry ramp, just roughly when do you expect that to materialize? And also could you remind us whether the initial rollout, which presumably will be without EUV, will there be triple patterning? And what increase in the lithography content could we expect over maybe double pattern in 20-nanometer or 14-, 16-nanometer nodes?",146
388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2015",2015-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3670.0,747576.0,32762578.0,Answer,P. Wennink,,Executives,17,"Okay. I'll just make some notes. Okay, on your first question, does memory has legs? I think if you look at all memory customers, DRAM and NAND, then you go through all the major customers, every customer is expanding their capacity. Every customer has either a new fab or an extension to a fab. In other words, there were major fabs announced in Korea for both major players. Everybody knows that in Japan, there's a major factory extension ongoing, Micron announced one recently. So every major memory maker is looking at adding capacity. And that capacity will not be up in the 2 months' time, so it will take time to build those factories and will take time to fill those factories up. And that will not happen in 2 quarters. It will be stretched out over a much longer period. And it just reflects, I would think, the discussions we had with our customers as not only that we have with them privately but also I think how they talk about their business going forward. I think we internally also mentioned this as amongst the senior managers here that we haven't seen our memory customers as, let's say, positive about the future applications of memory products in a very long, long while. It has to do with the fact that memory starts to take many, many forms, which will be used in many, many different applications. And that's what we see happening. So I think it's very broad-based. And I don't think it is something that will easily go away. The 10-nanometer foundry ramp, when we see that happening, that will be end of 2016 going into 2017 and '18. That's when it will happen. Definitely, there will be a higher litho content. We always see this at 20-nanometer. I think, node-on-node, we see about a 35% to 40%, 45% litho intensity increase because of double and triple patterning. Now that all looks nice and definitely for the nodes that we are currently seeing, but we all know that there's -- from a cost point of view, one solution going forward, and that's ultimately EUV. Now that's about 40%, so on average.",363

Wennink,,Executives,22,"Well, I ask the same question when we look at the order backlog and the order intake. But in fact, it's across those 3 categories. We are seeing capacity additions on the 28. We see some capacity additions on the 20. And as you know, from a lithography perspective, the litho requirements for 20 and 16 and 14 are practically the same. We are definitely also seeing 16 and 14 coming out of -- currently in qualifications, so they will ramp in the course of the year, which of course, the installed capacity for 14, 16 is still limited. So that's where definitely capacity needs to go. And by the end of the year, we're also shipping for 10-nanometer. I mean, 10-nanometer initial risk production will be on immersion only. And the 2 sets that we are developing today together with our customers, to be able to deal with that node also requires shipments towards the end of the year. So actually, it's a complicated -- it's a difficult question to answer because you will see capacity additions at every node. Now if you would ask me, ""Would there be an emphasis on one of them?"" I would say 16, 14, that's where probably the majority will go.",208

We're shooting for this EUR 1 billion run rate level for the mid-term. Now the U.S. dollar exchange rate throws us a tad bit of a curveball. So it could be in the $260 million range, too, but we're getting down and we're getting into that neighborhood. We'll control it at that level for several quarters, and then at our Capital Market Day, we said that for the longer term, we really will drop it as a percent of our revenue. And we are right now operating at around 18%. And with our EUR 10 billion ambition by 2020, we should settle it in somewhere in the 13% range or so. So it remains very well-controlled.",140

I think the Chinese market, after years of silence, has actually come back, I mean, as we had this announcement pre-Christmas on the deal that we signed with the Chinese foundry. Generally speaking, there is a lot more activity there. It is also focused on, let's say, what I would call an advanced node. It's the 32-nanometer and 28-nanometer node. Now what I said earlier on that 28-nanometer node is a very large node, where we constantly see devices being brought on through the 28 node level. It seems to continue making it a very large node. But I think the Chinese foundries will benefit from that also or at least that is what they are anticipating. So that market has come back to life definitely. It is not only used tools. I mean, the Chinese market is not a market where you only sell secondhand tools. These are new projects, which require new NXTs. And let's be honest, 28-nanometer is a pretty advanced node. So yes, after years of silence, it's back.",174

I think, there's no reason to change what I said earlier. And I may remind you of what I said earlier. When somebody asked the question, ""Where does this foundry demand go to? What kind of node?"" And it's basically 4 nodes. It's 28, it's even 20, it's 16, 14. But I think emphasis is on 16, 14 and on 10 even. So yes, it does sound like a lot, but I mentioned it in my introductory call also. We are in probably the most aggressive ramp period that we have seen for a very, very long time in the logic industry but no reason for us to change our statement of last quarter of about 175k for that 20, 16, 14 node.

Now when the 3350s will go into volume production, then, of course, clearly there are some performance metrics in stages or milestones that we need to hit, which we're confident that we will hit. And the only problem is that the accounting rules say that when you meet them all, which is also true for the 3300, only they were very limited, yes, then you can recognize revenue.

I want to comment on the pull-in. It was not a pull-in, it was incremental demand. Sometimes when you do guidance, it's not quite clear whether it's in the last 2 weeks of the quarter or whether it's in the first 2 weeks of the quarter. It was not a pull-in, it was just demand strengthening as customers were outfitting the factories. And as you can see also from our guidance in Q1, that is up EUR 100 million, over EUR 100 million. It was, by no means, a pull-in. As it relates to the second half of the year, I'll let Peter chime in. But we didn't give any guidance. And we've given some color on the first half.

I think coming back to reiterate what I said earlier on the memory market, every customer, is not only talking about, but is using their well-earned cash to put the capacity in place in different forms. So there's a time component to it. And now if I really want to answer your question precisely, I need to know exactly when those time components turn into a 2 shipment. I think for us, medium term, the memory business is going to be good because there's a lot of empty fab space that need to be filled. I mean, now you're asking us to precisely indicate when that is, which is very difficult for us. It's going to be there.

Our customers keep telling us that they see node conversions of existing devices coming from 65 down to 45 down to 28, and where that will end is difficult to say. But I mean, it's a big node.

Wennink,,Executives,52,"Yes, I think that's a good question. I think at the Investor Day, we did touch on it. And in fact, what we said, I'm going to repeat. If you look at the manufacturing process of a semiconductor device, and there are very, very few steps in the process where you can actually use a machine to use for corrective actions, the litho tool is a machine that can do that. And there, we have thousands of nodes that we can turn in order to change the settings so that the imaging process takes account of those corrections. So that means that the more you can feedback into the litho machine knowledge about errors or deviations from target, whether it's on overlay, whether it's on the critical dimension, whether it's on depth of focus, whatever, the more information that you can gather, the better you can control this. Now with the prices of litho machine going up from now over EUR 50 million to EUR 100 million and over EUR 100 million when we talk about EUV, next generations, then you can imagine that, that importance only goes up. So the quest for looking at data for those elements of the chip production process, where the litho tool is suitable to do the corrections, that quest for data will continue. Now we created one path by creating YieldStar and metrology and integrated metrology. That's a very valuable part of the business, which is growing. And so are we looking for it, together with our customers and with potential partners to all of us? Yes. And am I willing to go into detail about what that specifically means? No. But you have to use your imagination on what that could be. And then perhaps over the years, we're going to be a little bit more specific on the work that we're doing in this area because we are doing work in this area. But I hope I at least gave you a very clear vision that we have to use the litho tool as the correction mechanism for some of the major challenges that our customers are seeing when they move into the next nodes.",364

First of all, there was no extraordinary contribution in Q4 that -- nor in Q1 in the guidance, by the way. The way how you have to think about the CCIP is, first of all, accounting for that is probably even more complicated than EUV revenue recognition. The most important thing is that close to EUR 1.4 billion will be collected by us in cash. The accounting rules have it that some of it will go through other income, some of it will go through the gross margin and some of it may go straight to equity. So it's very difficult for us. Every quarter, it may also change a bit. So what we have elected to do is when we give you margin guidance, we'll always have the impact reflected in there, and we'll tell you the other income portion of it so that you can always follow our guidance. But the most important part, like I said at the beginning, is it's EUR 1.38 billion. And we'll collect the money over the period 2013 to 2017.",183

The 3300B is already out, so it won't be in the backlog because tools that are shipped are not in the backlog. Now you have the -- the conversion from the 3300B to the 3350 is an upgrade. Generally, we don't put upgrades in the backlog. That's what he said. So of those 10, 4 you won't find in the backlog for that very specific reasons. And the 3350, 6 should go in the backlog, of which we booked 2. So 4 is still is to book, and those will go into the backlog, okay?",130

And then the second -- no, actually I have a big -- the core business, which is much easier than EUV. Your backlog is very impressive. And yes, I do understand that there's no visibility on shipping on a quarterly basis. But given your backlog and given how you have guided during the January conference call in the past, why not help us with the year-end guide? Given your backlog, you seem very confident with business. You talk about opportunities in 20, 16 and 10 and memory, as you've still got some leg into it. So why not use that to give us a reference for calendar year '15 revenue opportunities, and then we could fine-tune it as you report quarterly earnings? To me, it seems like maybe you're not so confident with the booking trend into next year. Maybe this is why you're hesitant to provide calendar year '15 revenue guide. Or is there something else?",158

I mean, there are many examples where we haven't guided the total year and more than -- more examples where we have not guided than we did guide. Now I know that when you hand somebody something very nice, they want it next time also. So I can understand that. But we have to be realistic also. I mean, I said it before. We feel very confident about -- well, about the backlog. But with all the extension that the customers are currently planning, the timing in which they want to ship them, pulling them in or pushing them out a month or 2 is fluid. And like I said, it's EUR 50 million, EUR 60 million tools. Now if we miss 2 or 3 tools, it's EUR 150 million or even more million. And I can see the headlines of the reports that you guys write, ""ASML misses their guidance."" I mean -- and while nothing really happens. So I think we're going to give you what we know that we will ship because we've got extra confirmation from our customers, which is this quarter. And the next quarters, we'll have a very healthy backlog and we will ship. And whether EUR 100 million to EUR 200 million moves into quarter 2 or 3 or from 3 to 4, it doesn't really matter. For the total year, it's a bit different, I mean, we do not have a backlog that covers the total year yet. That will happen throughout the year. The only thing that we know is that our memory customers are pretty bullish about their future. They have all announced capacity and expansion plans in terms of buildings, which is the first time since a long time. Some people would argue, ""That is a point of attention."" But I would also argue that the memory business currently has a much wider application space than it ever had before and that our memory customers, only a few left, have a much different spending profile as they've shown over the last couple of years. So I think there's more control in the memory business. That is at least what we hear when we talk to our customers, which is also one of the reasons why things might move from 1 quarter to the other in terms of the shipments. These things are fluid, let's say, from a quarter to a quarter point of view. Now for the total year, it looks good. But I'm not willing to give you any specific guidance on the total year. Like I said, there have been many more years where we didn't guide than we did guide and 1 quarter has to do with the fluidity of timing of some of those shipments.",464

I mean, there's a certain upgrade opportunity out there in the field. Could you maybe give us a bit of a sense what you think penetration is already for the tools that are in the field and how much more upgrade potential there is, some metrics here, maybe even by foundry, memory would be very useful? And then just a quick follow-up. I noticed there has been a bit of a tick up in CapEx in Q4. Is there anything to be said on that? Maybe you could elaborate a bit on the drivers.",103

The YieldStar upgrade potential, you have to realize that YieldStar comes in 2 forms. It comes in a standalone form, where basically it's a standalone machine. And it comes in a form of an integrated built into the track. That means that the track should have the space available to put the YieldStar in. So those upgrade possibilities are limited because you have to have a track that actually has the space there, which is an open, gaping hole, which then needs a YieldStar. Now on the standalone YieldStar, there is always an opportunity. So you could say for every NXT that is out there, that is 28-nanometer node and lower, the YieldStar data can be fed back in the litho tool, which when you go to an integrated mode, where it's in the track, it is almost easier. But those upgrades are limited. So upgrades for YieldStar are really standalone units that can be shipped. And there are opportunities there, but I would say that the biggest focus that we currently have is on the integrated metrology going forward, whereby the litho tool and the deck are optimized to take the YieldStar. But that is then in there from day 1, it is not an upgrade possibility. So upgrades for YieldStar are there. Biggest upgrade possibility is in the litho systems, where you really take litho systems from a 2 -- 1 or 2 nodes ago, you actually upgrade into the latest and the greatest. That is where the major upgrade opportunity is.",255

Actually, our CapEx for the year came in slightly below what we had estimated at the beginning of the year. I think it was EUR 360 million that we ended up for the full year. It was a year of higher CapEx for us than usual. It had to do with the EUV factory that we're building out. The reason why it's actually a bit lower than we originally anticipated is because we kept the factory fairly modular and we're building it out as we go. In total, it was 6% of revenue. And also in our Investor Day, we indicated that our longer-term model is around 5% of revenue, so we'll see that coming down. So nothing extraordinary in Q4.",128

We said 47% for the first quarter. And without recognition of an EUV tool, I think we said before that these -- the first tools have no gross margin.

And then once we are in higher volume manufacturing, usually like 2 years after commencing shipments, we should reach the 40% level.

In Q1, our net sales came in at EUR 1.65 billion, which was in line with our guidance and driven, as expected, by a nice balance of memory and logic sales. Memory represented 55% and logic represented 45% of system sales. This compares to 65% and 35% in the December quarter, respectively. Service and field option sales came in at EUR 403 million, very similar to last quarter. 
Gross margin for the quarter increased from 44% in the December quarter to 47.2% in Q1 and was in line with our guidance. The increase in gross margin was enabled by volume-driven cost effects and a product mix, which included no EUV system sales for the quarter. R&D expenses came in at EUR 261 million, and SG&A expenses came in at EUR 82 million, both in line with guidance despite a strengthening of the U.S. dollar throughout the quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 11% of pretax income. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Quarter-over-quarter cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments grew to EUR 2.84 billion from EUR 2.75 billion at the end of the prior quarter. 
Regarding the order book. Our Q1 systems bookings came in above the EUR 1 billion mark. We did not book any additional NXE:3350 systems during the quarter. We saw a shift back towards memory in Q1, representing 53% of bookings versus 27% of bookings in Q4. We finished the quarter with a solid overall backlog of EUR 2.6 billion, nicely balanced between memory and logic. With that, I would like to now turn to our expectations and guidance for Q2 and share an initial qualitative view on the balance of 2015. 
As mentioned, we end the Q2 with a strong and nicely balanced backlog. From this, we expect strength in system sales in both memory and logic in the quarter. Having continued strong service and field option sales expectations supports the net sales guidance of around EUR 1.6 billion for Q2. This will leave the first half of 2015 growing over the second half of 2014, as previously forecasted. 
Our Q2 net sales guidance includes revenue recognition of one NXE:3300 system, which we shipped in Q1. We expect gross margin for Q2 to be around 45%. The difference from Q1 is largely driven by the recognition of one NXE:3300 EUV system in net sales. R&D expenses for the second quarter will be about EUR 265 million, and SG&A is expected at about EUR 85 million. 
As to the rest of 2015, we do expect that most of the forecasted DRAM memory bit demand will be satisfied with first half year litho shipment, leaving memory shipments to taper into the second half of the year. We expect stable foundry business throughout 2015 in support of the current FinFET node ramps and NXT node developments. 
Our service and field option sales will likely increase over the coming quarters, as we benefit from increased adoption of our Holistic Lithography products and the purchase of system node enhancement packages supporting customer node migrations. We expect this part of our business to reach EUR 500 million per quarter exiting the year.
Peter will talk more about EUV shortly, but I would like to make a few points regarding 2015 EUV shipments. As most listeners are aware, we continue to show great progress in improving on key EUV performance metrics related to productivity and availability, with unchanged targets of improving both further throughout this year. Meanwhile, we continue to discuss the exact need and timing of potential NXE:3300 upgrades to NXE:3350-like configurations of 3 prepaid systems on order. Depending on the outcome of these discussions, we may ship these tools as NXT:3300 systems in 2015 or as upgraded systems in 2016. We hope that these discussions with our customers, including agreed-upon configuration and shipment timing, will be concluded within this quarter. In addition, we continue in-depth interaction with multiple customers on the planned 2015 shipments of 4 NXE:3350s in addition to the 2 systems already on order. 
I would like to take a moment now to proactively address what has become a commonly asked question of late. And that is, how do changing exchange rates impact our business? 
Firstly, we contract the majority of our business in euro, and we have not changed our pricing as a result of currency fluctuations. Therefore, the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, but also the relative strength of Asian currencies, have a positive effect on our customers' capital spending compared to their original budget. We also have some of our service business, including our final light source business, quoted in foreign currencies. And for that portion of our business, we have a positive translation effect in our P&L. 
Secondly, we do originate a substantial part of our operating spending from the United States, where we employ approximately 3,100 professionals in development, field service and manufacturing of sources and parts for NXE and NXE systems. This spending weighs in heavier in our P&L when translated into euros. Net-net and despite our hedging programs, the disadvantage from our foreign currency base spend is larger than the advantage from our non-euro-denominated sales. For the first quarter, the unfavorable impact on our net margin was less than 1 percentage point.
Finally, as an update on our capital return program, next week at our 2015 Annual General Shareholders Meeting, shareholders will vote on our proposal to increase our dividend per ordinary share for 2014 by 15% to EUR 0.70 per share. And to our 2015, 2016 buyback program announced in Q1, we saw the first repurchases totaling EUR 129 million for the quarter. 
Now with that, I'd like to return the call back over to Peter.",956
388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2015",2015-04-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3612.0,789417.0,34399338.0,Presenter Speech,P. Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Wolfgang. As Wolfgang highlighted, the expectation that our strong second half of last year would continue into the first half of this year has been confirmed by our first quarter results. And our second quarter guidance, which is supported by continued memory spend, has significantly increased in the logic sector as compared to last year. 
We expect that our shipments to the DRAM sector will be healthy in 2015 and show an increase as compared to 2014. However, with shipment strength continuing in Q2, we expect the 2015 sales to DRAM will be weighted to the first half, and limited litho tool purchases will support continued NAND planar strength this year. And although all NAND players have 3D NAND process development programs underway, likely bringing samples to the market in the second half of this year, we do not expect significant volume capacity additions in 2015.
We continue to see the logic sector working essentially on 3 lithography nodes at the same time. The capacity additions continue at some foundries at the 28-nanometer node. But at the same time, we see some customers converting 28-nanometer capacity to 16-, 14-nanometer capacity, driven by our capability to upgrade tools from node to node. And this is helping our customers to manage capital efficiency at the most advanced nodes. 
The 16-, 14-nanometer node is moving into volume at all leading foundries while most advanced foundries are also fully engaged in process development at the 10-nanometer node. Meanwhile, FBU [ph] microprocesses is starting the transition to 10-nanometer node in this calendar year. And therefore, we see logic shipments as relatively stable quarter-on-quarter through the year across the combination of the 28-nanometer, 16-, 14- and 10-nanometer node.
Touching on a couple of things mentioned by Wolfgang. We are seeing an increase in demand for our Holistic Lithography products as well as our field upgrades. Given that the current advanced logic processes are driving increased multiple patterning, the requirement for tighter system outlay or alignment is increasing substantially. This, in turn, is driving our process control product sales on things like our YieldStar metrology products and associated process management software as well as overlay and focus enhancement products for our NXT:1970 product. On top of this, we have seen first orders for our next-generation TWINSCAN, NXT:1980, supporting NXT node requirements. 
As mentioned earlier, our customers are increasingly confronted with higher capital requirements in semiconductor manufacturing, forcing them to focus on improving capital efficiency. We think we are uniquely positioned to help our customers in execution of the capital efficiency programs by providing lithography system node-enhancement packages, supporting each customer's node migrations through significant system upgrades. This, in turn, provides us with an additional sales stream, next to new system sales opportunities.
Regarding EUV. We continue to demonstrate real progress against our targets in source power and system availability, which are the 2 key components of our wafer-per-day program. One customer has already demonstrated wafer-per-day performance at the level of our 2015 target of 1,000 wafers per day. And we are now in the process of upgrading several systems to an 80-watt configuration in order to demonstrate similar wafer-per-day performance across the EUV installed base.
The first 2 orders for our first -- for our fourth-generation NXE:3350 EUV tools are in our backlog. Outlook planning has the first system shipping midyear, with a new high-powered drive laser system and in-situ collector cleaning capability. Meanwhile, we are having extensive discussions and making good progress with several customers on the sale of additional systems in 2015 and beyond. 
The EUV adoption curve will be driven by the continued progress we will make on the key EUV performance metrics. The 2015 target levels of 1,000 wafers per day; a minimum of 70% availability and the synchronization to our customers' roadmaps, which are different per customer; combined with the customer confidence in us reaching the 2016 performance targets will drive EUV demand for the next couple of years. In order to deal with this demand, we are developing a production plan for 2016 of one EUV system per month, supporting a ramp up to a 24-system manufacturing plan for 2017 and doubling that again in 2018. 
Now with that, we would be happy to take your questions.",708

On the 20-nanometer conversion, that's the low 20-nanometer, that's in full swing. We're moving towards the end of the year to the lower nodes. That's end of the year, early 2016 to, what I would say, just under the 20-nanometer node. So this is, by the way, has been a main driver, the 20-nanometer node for our shipments over last couple of quarters. 
New fabs, yes, the new fabs, we have 2 fabs in Korea. One fab opened last year. Another will open in the middle of this year. So shipments, clearly, in Q1 and Q2, are for the fab that opened last year. And the second half of the year, part of the orders that we received in Q1 are for shipments to M14, which the factory of one of our customers, Hynix. So throughout the year, we will be shipping tools to those new fabs. Yes, that's all, I think, Kai.",154

So partly, part of that litho intensity will be covered by new system sales. Another part will be covered by the, I would say, upgrade of an installed base from  one node to the other, which, in fact, for us is pretty good business.

Two, if I may, centered around EUV. Firstly, could you maybe give us a little more clarity or a little more insight into the kind of discussions that you're having with your customers with regard to production orders, kind of inquiries you get, whether they're across sectors or limited to only logic. 
And secondly, as a follow-up, you've talked about there potentially being a requirement wherein even below 1,500 wafers per day would be enough to drive insertion of EUV into full-time production. Maybe you could clarify a little more on that. Do you see more of such applications merging over time? And how should we think about insertion and production?",115
388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2015",2015-04-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3612.0,789417.0,34399352.0,Answer,P. Wennink,,Executives,18,"Okay. On the first question, whether I can give you some more detail on discussion with customers, unfortunately, I cannot do that. But I can tell you, it's cross sector. Yes, it's not only logic. So we are engaging with almost every major customer in deep discussions about the insertion point of EUV and about the potential orders. So it's definitely not only at the logic space. Although, if we would refer to one of the slides in our slide deck, it is true that logic, in terms of pilot production, is the first to put EUV into pilot production. And memory could follow 1, maybe you could you argue for NAND, 2 to 3 years later. But logic is definitely starting, that we're engaging in discussions with customers across all sectors. 
On the 1,500 wafers per day, when you think about the cost per wafer, cost per function, cost per bit, however you want to call it, we've always looked at the cost as a function of productivity. Now as you know, in our emerging products, we're driving productivity up. So the cost per wafer, cost per bit or cost per function goes down. 
Now next to that on EUV, there are other customer benefits. It's particularly the reduction of the process complexity, the increased design flexibility but also the shorter cycle times, which is a big issue if you go to multiple patterning and you have, on some critical layers, 7 to 9 or even 10 passes, which you can replace this with the much less -- much lower number of passes where you use EUV, has a massive impact on your cycle time. That means that there are other economic drivers that will force customers to very, very seriously look into the application of EUV. And that is why -- and for certain customers, depending on their road map and depending on their design complexity, 1,500 wafers per day is kind of a general statement, but for some of them, it could be lower.",337

My first question is regarding EUV as well. I mean, Peter, you're upgrading some customers to the 80-watt laser at the moment. Would you say at this point -- I mean, based on what you've announced on EUV, your EUV programs seems to be running ahead of what you had previously guided the market to. So would you be saying that at this point that you are much, much more confident that EUV is now going to be production worthy by the end of this year for the 10-nanometer node next year? 
And secondly, some of your customers are doing 10-nanometers without using EUV initially. How do you feel lithography intensity increasing for that node, given that it will require, not double patterning but multilayer patterning, to be able to achieve that? And are you going to see orders for that this year or next year?",150

Yes, to say, the [indiscernible] upgrades, we are rolling that out over the installed base because that's a promise to our customers. And actually, the more than 1,000 wafer per day achievement was done on the 80-watt configuration, and we would like to give every customer access to that capability. 
Having said that, the tool that customers are focusing on to put into production is the 3350 because the 3350, with the with higher-powered drive laser and the in-situ cleaning capability has -- will give our customers the ability to output more wafers and to have a higher availability or a higher uptime. And this is what -- of course, if they put the machines into production, is what they really want. So the 3350, if you can do, you could argue if you can do 1,000 wafers per day on the 3300, then you should be able to do this on the 3350. And this is where our confidence, that we will reach our 2015 targets, is, of course, based on the 3300 achievement and our ability to at least copy that onto the 3350 but to the next layer of performance on top of that. So this is why we feel confident, and that is also why the intensity with which we're talking to customers has gone up. 
Now on the 10-nanometer node, the logic node, largely, I think that the default solutions that our customers have in their production plants is on multiple patterning. And the late insertion in 10-nanometer of EUV will be driven by our ability to show them that the 3350 is, indeed, a pilot production-worthy tool. Now -- and that is first part of my answer. I think our confidence has gone up, based on the performance of the 3300. But the default solution is multiple patterning. We have to realize that those designs were finished some time ago. I mean, when you go into pilot production the end of the year, it means that those design decisions were at the end of last year. And at the end of last year, we were not currently -- we were not yet at the EUV performance levels that we are seeing today. So that means that, that N10 default starts with immersion. And one of the earlier callers asked the question, how much more litho intensity will it give well? Well, between 40% and 50%, which part of that requirement will be filled in by our upgrade business. 
Is that fair, Sandeep?",420

That's a very interesting question. I tried to make that clear in the introductory statements. We are in a pretty unique situation. Since being with the company, I've never seen a situation whereby we are shipping to our logic customers, not [ph] as much, as I say, logic customers, effectively in 3 nodes. I've always seen that one node ends and the other node starts, and then you see one -- then all shipments moving from one node that ends to the next node. And then it was much easier to say everything that we are shipping is, obviously, for that next node. 
What we're currently seeing is we're seeing shipments in 28-nanometer nodes, which we're seeing capacity being taken out of 28-nanometer, being reused in 14- and 16-nanometer FinFET. And we're seeing 10-nanometer capacity being built up. For us, it is a pretty opaque picture to give you -- so it's very difficult for us to say how much installed capacity are we shipping to what node. Because of the reuse capability, the fact that we have 3 nodes now shipping at the same time, I don't dare to give you a specific installed wafer out per month capacity. I'm sorry about it, but it is what it is. It's a bit convoluted. 
But the only thing that we do see is that we have a stable logic business, yes, stable logic business over 3 nodes and gives us -- and that the intensity and the need for deep-UV immersion leading-edge solutions is going up because of the higher litho intensity. So difficult to answer your question, so I'm not going to guess. But I'm -- the only thing I'm going to say, that logic business is strong, healthy and stable.",293

I understand that service will be up, maybe, EUR 75 million on a whole-year basis exiting the year versus where it is now or possibly even more than that.

When we use the word tapering, so it's going down somewhat, that's by definition. Logic is stable, as we said and was quite a nice increase in the upgrade and service business. And we said we're going to exit at EUR 500 million run rate. And then of course, it also depends on how the final orders come in for the year.

I think there are fabs in Korea taking tools. There is capacity that -- to take tools in Taiwan and in Japan, particularly. So that will be used. I think it's a matter of timing more. So when you look at 2015 and you just chop the entire ramp up in calendar years, then the only thing that we're saying is that in the calendar year, there is more shipments in the first half than in the second half on DRAM customers. But it is not -- as far as when we listen to our customers, absolutely not an indication that our customers feel that the business is weakening and that's why they need less capacity. It's just a matter of timing of when they ramp their fabs, and it's the culmination of those 4 potentials in Taiwan and Japan and the 2 in Korea, how that ramp-up is scheduled.

Before that time, customers were looking at, ""If we want the capability, do 1,000 wafers per day, we need to go to a 3350. So could you please wait with the 3300 shipment and upgrade to a 3350 in order to give us that capability?"" Now you can understand that having an 80-watt configuration at -- for the 3300 and doing 1,000 wafers per day, that some customers are scratching their head and say, ""Shouldn't we then take the 3300, start using it at 80 watts instead of waiting and then getting a shipment of the 3350 later. It's also a matter of when are we going to do what with respect to EUV.

And that's actually -- that is what we're seeing today. So it is going to be an integral part of our business model going forward, but it doesn't change the long-term business model. 
So you said in the 14-, 16-nanometer as a percentage of the capacity reuse, difficult to say. It's customer-by-customer different. Some customers that have, let's say, a large production of limited products, they would probably do this sooner and more than very large foundries that have multiple customers, dozens of customers that are actually still requiring capacity, for instance on the 28-nanometer node to stay in place because they are upgrading their 45- or 65-nanometer products to 28. So it's a bit different per customer. So I don't think you can give this as a standard percentage. But in general, you could say those foundries with large volumes of -- and, let's say, smaller quantity of type of products, they would do this earlier and sooner than foundries with a lot of customers.",219

That's very helpful. And following up on Sandeep's question earlier, 10-nanometer was initially started with multi-patterning. And there was late insertion on 10-nanometer with EUV. As you look at the 7-nanometer node, I believe the decision on 7-nanometer would be later this year. What are your expectations? Would it be started initially with EUV or multi-patterning? And also, like at SPIE conference, it appeared that for 7-nanometer node, if you want to do multi-patterning, the overlay and the [indiscernible] placement there are the big issue. And do you think, like, from a lithography perspective, is immersion able to handle all the needs? Or is it going to be like either it's EUV or we can't do it?",119

Wennink,,Executives,44,"Well, ultimately, that goal is with the customer. We have an internal view that we believe that EUV should be the technology of choice, very clearly. Customers will tell you that in the absence of a fully production-worthy EUV, as we see it today because we're too early, for that default solution is always going to be looking at what they know today, which is immersion, multiple patterning. And that's what every customer will tell you. Every logic customer will tell you -- said, ""We will look at that."" But at the same time, also at SPIE, your customer's made the public statements, ""Default, we are going there because we're going for double patterning immersion because this is what we know. But when EUV is available, we will use EUV."" So it all comes down to the production worthiness, i.e. the percentage availability of the tool that is going to drive the decision for EUV. When it is there, with the right level of availability and right level of reliability, they're going to use EUV. There's no doubt in our mind. And the fact that they're talking about 2 strategies simply got to do with the fact that nobody can point at an EUV production-worthy tool at 85% availability doing 1,500 wafers per day, because it's not there yet. It is how you need to look at that. 
And when you go into 7-nanometer, the last comment, we all understand. You pointed to it also that 7-nanometer, multiple-patterning immersion is a web of pain, and that customers are trying to avoid that.",262

And then we have a big base in Wilton, Connecticut, and we have literally hundreds and hundreds of R&D people there. And there, we do have an FX impact, like I said in my prepared remark, not fully offset for the total company by positive effect from the sale in the U.S. dollar. 
But I would just suggest there that you model it somewhere in the EUR 265-ish million range for the remainder of the year. We are committed to get to the 13% of revenue in terms of a long-term model by 2020. But you'll also understand that in this time, where we're firing on all cylinders in EUV, Holistic and EUV expansion, that we're not going to run the risk to cut the program prematurely just to make an artificial number to offset an FX risk.",188

388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2015",2015-04-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3612.0,789417.0,34399385.0,Question,Unknown Analyst,,Analysts,51,"It's Jeff Ergis [ph] speaking at Bernstein [ph]. I think there's probably been a mix up in names. Peter, I'd like to come back to the 2 points you made on the fact that 3 nodes are being run at the same time at the moment, and it's really something new for you guys, and the emphasis you put on reuse at the 10-nanometer nodes. So there is 2 way I can think about it: One is 14-nanometer node is reusing the 20-nanometer node at the moment. And it's [indiscernible] it's because maybe 20-nanometer is a disappointing node for the client, actual clients. And if you consider 20, 16 and 14 as being the same lithography node, it's almost an nonevent. But then, if we start seeing a lot of reuse between 20, 16 and 14 and 10, then it would mean that the 20-, 16-, 14-node would be phasing down faster than lagging node have been phasing down in the past. And that could, in the long term, have some effect on demand for lithography. So what -- how do you think about that? Do you see a risk that going forward, higher rate of reuse between nodes means that the total capacity of the industry going to grow at a slower pace with the N-1 node phasing down faster than what we've seen in the past?",229
388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2015",2015-04-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3612.0,789417.0,34399386.0,Answer,P. Wennink,,Executives,52,"Yes. A couple of comments. You assume that the reuse on the 14- and 16-nanometer is out of 20. It's not out of 20. It's out of 28. So -- and we do that by the 28-nanometer capable to upgrade those tools to, what we call, a system node enhancement package sale. So it could be big sales. It could be EUR 10 million, EUR 20 million apiece. So those are almost open heart surgeries in the field. But that, of course, it's cheaper than buying a new tool of EUR 50 million. So what you will see -- and I think I have to refer back to a previous comment. I think when you look at customers that are doing this, customers that are having large volumes of a limited number of products, where those limited number of products are really products that go from node to node, that means that the current node of a limited number of products and a large volume, yes, moves on to the next generation, which means that it almost obsoletes the current node when you go to N+1. And that's also why basically, the capacity follows that, yes, so the reuse of that capacity, which is, in fact, what has happened in the industry for a very long time in microprocessors, yes? It's such a -- that's a well-known fact, yes? And that's what I say, it's a limited number of products, very large volume. So in that sense, you are seeing also, I think, in the foundry industry some very large products, large volume, where the same logic, the economic logic applies as it applies -- or actually has applied for a very long time in the microprocessor world. So I don't think it has a major impact in that sense, other than you could argue that, if everything would be new, then you would sell 40% more new tools. But then, you should also realize that Moore's Law is an empirical of economics. So it's also how do you deal with capital efficiency. And I think this reuse option is a way of customers to control their cost of the additional capacity that they need because of the higher intensity in the lithography systems. So it's a logical way of customers dealing with the node-to-node transition for high volumes whereby you have a limited number of products. And it's basically akin what we've seen in the microprocessor business.",408

Just one question on the comments you're making on 2016 for EUV. I think those are consistent with what you've said before in terms of having the capacity to ship one EUV machine a month next year and 2 EUV machines a month a year after that. But you sounded a little bit firmer in terms of there actually being demand for those machines, i.e. potentially some customers moving beyond the testing phase. So could you just talk a little bit more about what the sensitivities are around that? What the potential upsides and downsides could be for 2016?",109

I think what you will see -- it all hinges on -- and I said it also in my introductory statements, is that when we zoom in on our targets of -- let's say, reaching the overall targets of 1,000 wafers per day, zooming in on the 1,500 wafers per day next year, reaching the 70% availability this year, going to the 85% availability next year, that progress -- I think, that progress will increase the consumer confidence. 
Now we are planning for a success. So actually, it means that we think we will reach those targets. We also think that when we reach those targets, there's not going to be one. There's going to be multiple customers that are going to say, ""Then in 2016, we need to start at least shipping tools for the start of the pilot production."" I think 2016 because those tool installation times and ramp-up times are quite long, but it will have an effect on 2017 in the customer fabs. And this is why we have that production capability there. 
You could say, ""Peter, show me the orders for 2016."" I'm going to say, ""Francois, you're right that they're not there."" But when I said -- when you say, ""Peter, show us the progress that we have made,"" then we have made a lot of progress, and it's on the confidence that we have that by that time, it is 2016, and we're 1 year or 1.25 years down the road that we can show some tangible progress, which will give customers the confidence that they have to do this. That's why the production capacity is there.",275

The first question on EUV. With the progress you've made, can you just give a little bit of color on some of the ecosystem areas, particularly on a mass inspection side, how you believe that potentially impacts, I guess, the production-worthy capabilities for the industry, given that they also need to be ready even if you're ready on the systems side?",63
388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2015",2015-04-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3612.0,789417.0,34399394.0,Answer,P. Wennink,,Executives,60,"Yes, that's a good question. I think this been a subject of heated debate over the last couple of quarters. On mass inspection, particularly, I think one of the most significant piece of news that came out of SPIE was the fact that we announced that we have a working prototype of what we call a removable pellicle. And a pellicle is, in fact, a membrane that sits in front of the photomask. And in fact, what the membrane does, it stops particles getting onto the photomask. Because when it get onto a photomask, which is a reflective photomask, they will print, so you don't want that. So the fact that we have now shown that, that capability is there and we can remove the pellicle and put it back on, it means that you can remove the pellicle, inspect the photomask with traditional inspection tools and then put the pellicle back, gives our customers -- at least, that's also what they said at SPIE, a lot of confidence that they can do without what you call an actinic inspection tool, which is an inspection tool that uses the same wavelength, which is basically an EUV mask inspection tool, which, of course, is not there. So that takes away that need. 
Now you could -- there are some customers that are saying, ""Well, for some very critical layers, we would like to have it somewhere down the line,"" and that's still a debate. We believe that we can show going forward that this removable pellicle is good enough for customers to get confidence that they can work with a defect-free mask. 
So it is where we are. I think this is a big step forward. And that, like I said, it removes the need for an actinic inspection tool this decade, and that's why customers can move on with EUV. 
Now on photoresist, there is -- there's also progress made on that point that is logical. Photoresist companies are not companies that are living on very high margins, so they always wait until the exposure tool is ready and that all the parts of the infrastructure are there, and they are there today. So we also see -- since we have made progress with EUV, resist companies definitely stepping up in their R&D effort and coming up with photoresist EUV, photoresist solutions that were not available 6 months ago. And we're making very good progress there. 
So on the infrastructure, I don't think they're showstoppers. That is -- I could have started with is so my answer would be a bit shorter. But just to give you some detailed information, there are no real showstoppers.",445

There's somebody interfering. Let me repeat what I said. There is going to be 2D devices, planar device, living next to 3D devices, living next to what they call the next-generation memory or a cross point or ReRAM. So there going to be, in the memory space, I said on previous calls also, the diversity in non-volatile memory devices is going up. And that means that will stay -- there's a very long life for planar, for 3D NAND and for new type memory. And that means that the installed capacity will stay there. It's not going to be reused. It's just going to grow, because 2D planar devices will serve another in a different applications than a 3D device than a cross-point device. So this is not applicable. Reuse is not applicable in the NAND business.",138

So let me take this. So on the bookings, we were not disappointed. We're actually quite, quite satisfied with our overall backlog. We said it in the remark, it's very balanced. I think it's always important to also note that we do have volume purchasing agreements with all of our customers, which actually makes the act of placing an order almost an administrative act. So we have visibility beyond the bookings and the backlog. So we were not disappointed and we're as a matter of fact, quite happy with the backlog and confident in our statement that we have a stable business. 
Stock buyback, we have a pretty time-proven policy of systematically giving back what we have available on top of minimum required cash balance. We want to go to the dividend first, and the rest is used for stock buybacks. You saw us ending at EUR 2.8 billion, not EUR 2.5 billion, which is our stated objective. But that's really in preparation for the dividend that's payable in April. So we're executing the program that we announced last quarter and that, again, will put over EUR 1 billion or around EUR 1 billion in stock buybacks for the next 2 years.",203

Before we begin the question-and-answer session, Wolfgang and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary on the recent quarter and provide you our view of the coming quarters. Now Wolfgang will start with a review of the second quarter financial performance, with some added comments on our short-term outlook.

For Q2, our net sales came in at EUR 1.65 billion, with system sales again nicely balanced between memory and logic. Memory represented 47% and logic represented 53% of system sales. Our system sales included 1 EUV tool. Service and field option sales came in at a very healthy EUR 520 million, driven by strong demand for field options and upgrades.
Gross margin for the quarter was 45.6%, above our guidance and impacted by revenue recognition of 1 EUV tool which shipped in Q1.
R&D expenses came in at EUR 267 million and SG&A expenses came in at EUR 88 million, both slightly above our guidance, driven by accelerated product development and infrastructure projects. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 11% of pretax income.
Turning to the balance sheet. Quarter-over-quarter cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments dropped to EUR 2.52 billion from EUR 2.84 billion at the end of the prior quarter, in part due to a EUR 302 million dividend paid in Q2. We also paid EUR 166 million during the quarter for repurchased shares.
Regarding the order book. Our Q2 non-EUV system bookings came in at about EUR 1 billion. This was better than we expected in both memory and logic. We see additional booking of 6 EUV systems. Our total system bookings during the quarter were EUR 1.5 billion. We finished the quarter with a strong overall backlog of just over EUR 3 billion.
As it relates to our EUV backlog and our backlog in general, I do want to point out a change in our definition driven by this quarter's EUV orders, which allows us to make these orders visible to investors. Our prior definition included a time frame of requested system deliveries within 1 year. That time limit has been removed, as the current delivery lead time on new EUV systems is greater than 1 year.
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations and guidance for Q3 and share our view on the balance of 2015.
We entered Q3 with a strong and nicely balanced system backlog. Adding continued strong service and field option sales at the level of Q2, we expect Q3 revenue to be between EUR 1.5 billion and EUR 1.6 billion. Q3 will not include any revenue recognition for EUV systems. Based on expected customer and product mix, we expect gross margin for Q3 to be around 45%. R&D expenses for the third quarter will be about EUR 275 million. SG&A is expected at about EUR 90 million. R&D and SG&A are both up slightly from the Q2 levels, driven by investments in future technology and continued effects from a strong U.S. dollar.
As to the rest of 2015, we expect less tapering in our memory business in H2 than we anticipated last quarter. This is driven by continued capacity additions in 2 new DRAM fabs and by some additional capacity needs in the 1 existing volume 3D NAND fab. We continue to see a stable logic business throughout 2015 in support of current FinFET node ramps and next node developments. Our service and field options sales exceeded the EUR 500 million mark in Q2, and we expect that level to continue throughout H2 due to increased adoption of our Holistic Lithography products and the purchase of system node enhancement packages supporting customer node migrations.
We expect to see Q4 revenues holding up at the Q3 level, with some upside opportunity possible due to logic's need for additional advanced node development tool. This means that we are on track to another record sales year for 2015.
Peter will talk more about EUV shortly, but I would like to make a few points regarding 2015 EUV shipments. As most listeners are aware, we continue to show great progress in improving on key EUV performance metrics related to productivity and availability, with unchanged targets of improving both further throughout this year. We are delighted about the receipt of purchase orders for 6 EUV production-ready tools during last quarter. Of the 6 tools, 2 tools are scheduled to be delivered this year and the remainder will ship from next year on. This is an indication of EUV's continued progress along the new technology adoption curve.
For 2015, we now see the opportunity to ship 5 NXE:3350 production-ready systems, supported by 4 system orders and with close customer in-direction [ph] on the fifth system continuing. Also, we plan to ship 1 additional NXE:3300 before year-end. With the 1 NXE:3300 that we shipped earlier this year, we therefore now forecast a total number of 7 EUV shipments for the year. 1 of the 2 remaining prepaid NXE:3300 is planned to be upgraded to an NXE:3350 or higher. And for the other systems, discussions with the customer have not been conclusive as of today.
We expect that EUV revenue for the year to be limited to the 1 NXE:3300 that we recognized during Q2. Revenue recognition for the remaining shipments this year will depend on the achievement of certain performance milestones and attribution of overall revenue to the system itself and related services. Revenue recognition will vary from customer to customer based on the specific terms and conditions in the respective agreements. We will provide our assumptions for timing of revenue recognition after we have shipped incremental EUV systems. Once the performance of EUV technology has matured, we expect to recognize revenue in the same fashion as we do in our EUV business.
Finally, as an update on our capital return program. Our proposal to increase our dividend by 15% was accepted by our shareholders at our annual meeting in April, resulting in a payment of EUR 302 million in dividends in Q2. In addition, relative to our 2015, '16 buyback program announced in Q1, we now executed total repurchases for the first half of 2015 of EUR 285 million at an average price of EUR 96 per share.
Now with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter.",1006

As Wolfgang highlighted last quarter, we had an expectation that our strong second half of last year would continue into the first half of this year. We can now say that the strength in the first half of this year is expected to continue through the second half, leading us to a record revenue year in 2015, as Wolfgang mentioned. This is clearly supported by our strong service, field options and upgrade business.
Our customers appear to be preparing for continued growth in their business as we see, for example, the 2 new DRAM fabs that Wolfgang mentioned continue to install capacity. In addition, we've all heard announcements of the 2 new NAND fabs likely to begin taking manufacturing equipment in 2016 for volume build of vertical NANDs. On top of this, we see 2 new foundry fabs beginning to take tools in the second half this year in support of advanced FinFET process node ramps and early development of next node logic devices.
So before I move over to EUV, I'd like to share some highlights of our deep UV and Holistic Lithography programs.
Firstly, with respect to our deep UV program, we will begin shipping this year our NXT:1980 emerging product, which is capable of 30% improved overlay accuracy versus our prior offering, along with the world's first 275 wafer per hour emerging capability. This will help our customers to deal with the increasing cost of complexity relating to multiple patterning strategies.
Next to these platform improvements, we are increasingly focusing on the availability performance of our systems. And I'm glad to report that, this year, the average availability of our worldwide installed base of more than 300 NXT tools increased to above 96%, again an important driver of affordability.
Secondly, I'd like to highlight that our Holistic Lithography products now have a 100% attach rate of newly sold emergent systems. Our integrated metrology systems which we call YieldStar is now broadly accepted, with more than 250 systems in the field.
Our Holistic Lithography concept of providing imaging, measuring and modeling capability allows unique support for controlling today's and tomorrow's most challenging advanced patterning processes across all industry sectors. Thirdly, we feel that we are strongly positioned with our wide range of field options and upgrade products. These products allow for extraction of maximum performance for the installed base of our lithography tools, and extension of their performance over multiple nodes allows for a more efficient capital use of our lithography equipment. And as witnessed this past quarter, the amount for this product continues to grow, with combined service, field options and upgrades crossing the EUR 500 million mark last quarter for the first time ever, as Wolfgang mentioned. It's expected to continue to stay around this level for the next few quarters.
And finally, on EUV. As we're -- as we -- as most of you are aware, we continue to demonstrate real progress against our targets in system throughput and system availability. These are the key metrics of performance that drive new lithography technology adoption once imaging and overlay performance have demonstrated and accepted. As mentioned on many prior occasions, our focus in 2015 is on improving EUV stability and availability with continued steady progress on productivity.
As it relates to productivity, during the first quarter, we have demonstrated 1,022 wafers exposed in a 24-hour period at one customer site with an 80 watts configuration. Our target is to be able to repeat this at several customers and at several sites. Now upgrade of systems in the field to 80 watts has virtually been completed in the second quarter. This gives us further confidence that the customer targets are realistic and should be met. In addition, we have demonstrated 130 watts dose-controlled source power in our facilities, enabling further productivity improvements. 
On system availability, which is targeted at 70% by year-end, we've been running at a 55% average on customer installed systems. With current upgrades, multiple sites are now achieving average availability of greater than 70% for 1 week and with one customer achieving a 70% average over a 4-week run, so excellent progress on this important front.
Now with the first orders for our fourth-generation NXE:3350B production tools announced late last year and entered into our backlog, this past quarter, we not only signed a volume purchase agreement for a minimum of 15 tools with a U.S. customer; but have also taken a 6-tool purchase order against that agreement, which has now also entered our backlog. And as Wolfgang mentioned, also discussions are continuing with multiple customers on the exact timing of their requirements for more EUV systems.
Clearly, the EUV adoption curve will be driven by the continued progress we are making on these key EUV performance metrics. The question of how many EUV orders we will see during the next few quarters can only be answered by relating the aforementioned progress with each customer's specific road map, adoption drivers and risk appetite. These are, of course, different per customer, but generally we can say that our logic customers are most aggressive given the complexities of multiple patterning strategies for our DRAM and ultimately NAND customers. In any case, in order to deal with this eventual and inevitable demand, we recently opened our new EUV factory which will enable an output of 24 systems by 2017 and potential further output capacity growth to 60 systems in the years to follow.
Now with that, we would be happy to take your questions.",920

If I may ask on EUV. I mean, in terms of what you're discussing with your customers, you've given some indication of the U.S. customers orders which are going to ship into next year. And do you have any sort of visibility about the other major customers and how EUV shipments would go into 2016? And clearly, you're going to have capacity now to do that given the opening of your new EUV factory. And secondly, my question is on OpEx. You've had some impact to your OpEx from the euro-dollar exchange rate. Is there any further impact to the OpEx from the euro-dollar exchange rate? Or is the current OpEx reflecting what the current euro-dollar exchange rate is?",122

Wennink,,Executives,8,"Sandeep, I will answer the first question, and Wolfgang will take the second one. Your question, do we have visibility on the EUV shipments in 2016, well, there is -- part of that visibility is pretty certain because we've received the orders and we know what to do. And I think they're also -- we are currently planning on the 3300s that will be upgraded to 3350 performance that have not been shipped yet. That could be part of the 2016 shipment pattern. And also, I would say, like I said in my introductory statements, the question of how many EUV orders we will see during the next few quarters, you should really see in the context of the progress we are making on the availability and the productivity vis-à-vis what customers' specific road maps are and what their risk appetite is and their adoption drivers. Now I think we've made good progress on availability and on productivity, which is evidenced by our current performance after the 80 watt upgrade. And so -- and I would say, if you would have a conservative view of 2016, I would say you should pencil in the same number of EUV systems that we've seen in 2015, which is a combination of the 3300s and the 3350s. If you are a bit more positive and that will have to show over the next 2 quarters, as in the second half of this year, that could run up. That could run up to approximately 10 systems, so it's anywhere in between what we ship today and 10 units. That is what our best estimate is today. Don't forget that the real ramp is in logic, first, which is basically 2018 production for our customers, which means 2017 shipment, so the real shipment ramp will be in 2017. And 2016 will be, you could say, an extension of the 2015 development work that our customers are currently doing...",323

What is important is that those tools get shipped because, once they're shipped and it's a EUR 100 million tool, customers will use them. And usage is extremely important in the learning curve and in the adoption of EUV technology. So shipment is very important. So the -- I will say the order of priority is to ship them first and get the cash in which is part of the orders; and then we do rev rec, which is you could say a discussion we will have with the accounting community, which -- and then Wolfgang can go into that into more detail, but it just means that you need to go through the list of agreed performance criteria. You need to tick every box. So in that order: We need to ship first. That's the most important for learning curve and for the adoption. And then we get the cash. And revenue recognition will be with the auditors.",160

Yes, if you look at like where we started the year in R&D around the EUR 260 million level and then SG&A in the low 80s or so, and now we're guiding to EUR 275 million and EUR 90 million, respectively, it's indeed true that the majority of that jump comes from FX effects. Like if you looked at R&D alone, I think we have about 25% or so of our spending in the U.S. And with the exchange rate going from the 1.30s to 1.10, that probably accounted for 2/3 of that jump from EUR 260 million to EUR 275 million. The balance is really in accelerating investments in future technology before we get some of the wind-down of investments in existing technologies. SG&A, very similar; and FX impact, of course. And we are investing in certain areas, for instance, in business development teams for field options and upgrades sales. We are completely focused on the 2020 model that we published last November, and we plan on being at about 13% of revenue in R&D and about 4% in revenue for SG&A. So I think we are in good shape. I want to mention on the FX effects that, of course, as a company, we also have positive effects from FX because we are selling field options and also services. And in particular, services abroad, in local currency, that's about 10% of our revenue in total. And there we have a positive impact on our P&L as well, but net-net, there is probably one percentage point on the net income that we're impacted with from FX. I hope that clarifies it, Sandeep.",281

I had two. The first one was on EUV. So Peter, just to make sure I understand correctly. You're saying that demand and orders will depend essentially on the performance of the next 6 to 9 months, but my understanding is that availability is already moving up to 70% now with what is essentially an old tool. And the 3350 will have, I guess, material improvements in availability, in source power. So my question is, by the time these tools ship, why would the major logic customers, when they see those improvements compared to the 3300s that they're using today, not order those tools? Is there anything really that you think the 3350 will not be able to deliver, let's say, in the first 12 months of shipments that your main customers needs? That would be the first question. The second one will be for Wolfgang, just on the balance sheet. From what I can tell, you've -- it's been a -- not a great cash flow quarter because obviously the dividend's been paid, but you're still above that EUR 2.5 billion threshold, I think, that you've mentioned to us. So is it still right for us to assume that any cash that you generate essentially from here onwards will find its way back to the equity holders either through buybacks or the divi?",231

Yes, the assumption is right. We haven't changed anything on our returns policy. We have established that minimum gross cash balance that we think that we need to run the business. It's around EUR 2.5 billion. Last year -- last quarter indeed the cash balance went down by some EUR 300 million, and that was like you mentioned. It was purely a function of share buybacks and dividends. There was a nice free cash flow in the quarter as well. And the policy remains intact. We look first at dividends on excess cash over the EUR 2.5 billion, and our goal there is a stable, preferably growing dividend. And then the balance, we used for share buybacks. We have EUR 1 billion, thereabouts, program announced in Q1, and we have executed EUR 285 million against this program in the first 2 quarters. So same policy as we had before, no change.",161

And on your question, you basically say, ""So with all the progress that we have made and the introduction of the 3350, why wouldn't customers order those tools?"" And this is a very good question, and I think I would ask the same question, why wouldn't they ask -- or why wouldn't they order those tools, because we are making very good progress. Now I think the answer is we've had in the past over -- past couple of years, we had many expectations and promises on the EUV introduction. We've, as a company, now basically over the last 1.5 to 2 years said we're going to tell you and to give you EUV guidance on what we actually see. Now what we are seeing is a significant improvement, I would say, in availability and in productivity, so your assumption as why wouldn't they come is a very fair one, yes. And on the 3350, we still need to ship the 3350. We have the expectation that the 3350 will perform better than what we have in the field today because, you're correct, it will be higher productivity, with better availability, with in situ cleaning in there. So this is indeed our expectation, but what we do not want is to give you all our expectations. We would like to guide you on what we actually see. And like I said, if you want to be conservative and think that progress is going to be slow, you say, well, perhaps it's going to be, 2016, an extension of what we saw in 2015. If you're a bit more positive, then you would pencil in higher numbers for next year. And if you have higher numbers for next year, you also need to book the orders. Now given where we are today -- and you know me a bit. I'm more of -- I'm more an optimistic person, but we are not here yet to give you specific numbers on orders and when orders will come and when we will ship.",341

Wennink,,Executives,19,"Yes, on the potential upside, logic, that is really driven by the fact that, when you look at the announced node-to-node transitions, and we make it specific and say that's the 10-nanometer nodes transition, what we have witnessed is also true on the 14 and on 20. We see an extended period that customers take for development and for qualification of those nodes as it relates to the timing of the ramp. So it just takes longer to go to the ramp of that node, which effectively means, if the ramp of that node is a given, yes, then you need more development time. Basically, it just brings the shipment of the early development tools back in time, so you need them earlier. And this is what -- where we see the upside. When we talk to customers and they talk about their newest nodes, they just take more time to do the development and the integration work. And that means that, that is an upside that we are seeing for the second half of the year. So it's really advanced technology transitions, earlier acceptance and earlier delivery of those tools because they need more time. On the -- sorry. Yes, do you want to cover the ASP, Wolfgang?",209

It's Wolfgang. I won't be able to give you a number today. I can explain to you a little bit about the complexity and what we are going to do in the future to give, provide you some guidance. Like we said, we expect to ship 7 systems this year. Of that, only 1 we'll recognize. So you have the opportunity to get some revenue recognition in '16 off these tools. Plus then, we will ship other systems, like for instance, the upgraded 3300s, and you can expect to get some revenue recognition there as well. Now as it relates to the 3350, as we launch this tool, the revenue recognition will actually depend on a few factors. It will, of course, depend on shipment acceptance, but it will also depend on certain performance milestones. Plus, we have the revenue and we got to attribute it to the system and related services, so it's fairly complicated. And it's actually been made more complicated that every customer agreement looks different from each other. So it's very difficult if you don't know the -- if you can't go into the detail on all these schedules and milestones to give you a forecast, and as you can imagine, they're also not in -- cast in stone from a timing perspective, so what we are going to do is we are going to give you an indication, as we start shipping these tools, what the timing and the euro amount of the revenue recognition will be. I mean the first one of these could go as early as this quarter, so you could expect us in Q4 to talk about this particular tool, how the revenue recognition will go. And then as we ship 4 tools in the fourth quarter and January, I'm certain that we'll give you some specific guidance but can't do it today. And I'd also like to mention, like -- this is a temporary situation. Ultimately, the objective is, of course, as the technology has matured, that we go and recognize revenue in the same fashion as we do it for our overall EUV system. Sorry to not be specific about the numbers, but that's kind of the complexity behind it but you will see us giving you more specific guidance as these tools actually ship.",390

A couple, if I could. I just wanted a bit of clarification, Peter, on something that you've talked about just on the 10-nanometer insertion for EUV. Presumably, the design window is closing for that in terms of insertion, and I just wonder whether you need further -- or whether you expect further orders for EUV to support 10-nanometer insertion? Or should we just now expect a kind of full insertion of 7 nanometers across the 3 main logic customers? And then I have a follow-up.",90

Wennink,,Executives,25,"Yes, I think, the -- it is clear. I think the EUV insertion is not focusing on 7. And however, things are a bit fluid in the sense that, when you talk about 10 nanometer and you listen carefully to what customers say about the 10-nanometer node, there have also been clear public statements by customers about phases in that 10-nanometer node, yes. You have the first phase, and there's then a second phase. And they will have nodes nomenclatures that are changing, but from our point of view, when you talk about 10-nanometer node, it's a certain pitch or a half pitch, and that could be several phases. Now in this particular case and given the complexities of 10 nanometer production using very complex multi-patterning strategies, I would never rule out that, with progress of EUV, the way it is today. And even if we can accelerate that progress, that -- there's a customer that says, ""Listen, in the last phase of a 10-nanometer node, yes, I'm going to use EUV,"" for 2 reasons. One, it might be beneficial to reduce complexity in -- at that moment in time, and you have to learn. You have to learn for 7. So I'm not ruling this out. This is going to be a function of the progress that we are making over the next 1 or 2 quarters.",228

I mean, whenever customers are going to think of a node nomenclature, it's effectively at the second phase of the 10-nanometer node, but the pitch and the half pitch is going to be the same, yes? So -- but like I said, this is going to be a function of progress that we are making, the complexities and the yields that customers are experiencing in using DPV multiple patterning strategies. That is going to -- those 2 things together, yes, will determine a potential, if you can say, second-phase introduction. And I'm not going to say that that's a slam dunk. With 7 nanometers, I think it's clear. I mean we see very clear announcements from customers that say, ""We're going to use EUV at 7 nanometer."" But it is really the performance and the complexities that they are engaging or running into that are going to determine a potential second-phase introduction. And that is for learning also.",188

Wennink,,Executives,29,"Yes, well, when you look at -- I think, when you look at the potential upside that we're talking about, that's really like I explained earlier. That is because the development and the integration time for the next nodes, for instance, the 10-nanometer node, is more complex and takes more time. So you see, as compared to the original assessment of when they would need the early development tools, which would be the first half of 2016, we see a potential of that being pulled in into the fourth quarter of 2015. That is correct, but that's technology transition. With respect to capacity, like we mentioned in the introductory statements, both in DRAM, NAND and logic, there are several new fabs out there that will take tools, and they will take tools for the most advanced nodes. And they will definitely ramp the first phase. Now that first phase will happen. That's why we are positive or we feel comfortable about the second half of this year. How that will translate into 2016 ramp and the speed of that ramp, we don't know yet, but the fact that those are new fabs, that they have to be ramping the first line gives us a lot of confidence over the next couple of quarters.",213

And we've said before that the 3350 list price is somewhere in the mid-90s, and the 3400 would be over EUR 110 million. And then you've got to be a little bit careful when you look at it in the backlog because what you've got to do is you've got to take the ASP and split it over several elements of things that you deliver. So there may be a little bit that gets allocated to service that you deliver with -- or an insulation or a warranty. So you got to be a little bit careful with the backlog ASP, but I can tell you, for the 6 tools that we took last quarter, the backlog ASP is somewhere in the low 90s.",148

And sort of what's the right opportunity for that going forward? I guess I'm thinking about what gross margins are going to be on your emergent systems because it looks like, in June, if I assume 0 gross margin, that the non-EUV gross margin is sort of 47.5%.

That is definitely true for advanced logic but now also increasingly for advanced memory and especially DRAM. Also there, you see multiple patterning strategies. You see multiple patterning space strategies, which basically also need the control software that we can provide together with the scanner to make sure that customers can control their process and they can make it yield. So yes, you see it now also in memory. And that attach rates will probably expand over time to the entire product base and to, well, I would say, across all industry sectors.

As it relates to the gross margin, it's important to know, first of all, as we -- when we report revenue, we report in systems. And we report in a second category, field options and services. For the Holistic Lithography, it depends on whether the customer orders: It was the original system the option, then it gets reported in the system. When it's later-on order that's -- as an upgrade option, then it will be in our field options and services. So when you hear us talking about Holistic Lithography achieving over EUR 500 million last year and us aiming for EUR 1 billion by 2017, you'll actually find that in both buckets. I think that's important to know. As it relates to the gross margin, we have said that before. There is a strong software content in that business. And there is some hardware in there with the YieldStar, our metrology tool, but the planned margin, it's somewhere in the mid 70. So as we approach the EUR 1 billion in 2017 and as holistic outgrows the rest of the business, yes, it's going to be accretive to the gross margin over time. I don't think I have an exact number to share with on what it could win in which scenario, but in general it's accretive.",219

Why -- can you -- in that context, can you help us understand what is your base assumption for the mix of these systems that are going to be shippable in '17?

However, the -- if you look at the DRAM road map, in 2018, we will be in the mid-1x DRAM nodes, which is EUV territory. So we are indeed seeing potential for a 2017 shipment which also includes advanced DRAM, but the majority will be logic, yes. So and then that's going to be -- if you take 24 units, it's going to be significantly over 50% that is going to be logic, which is microprocessors and foundry. And I would say it's a minority.

Wennink,,Executives,44,"Yes, I think, simply -- I think we probably sound like a broken record in this sense, but we're going to repeat how bookings are being administered in the company. We only have a handful of customers. And actually, we plan our production, and our shipments to a customer is based on an agreement that we have with the operations executives of the customers and looking at their ramp schedule. And then we agree with them that we have a certain production capability there to do the shipments. And then the orders are almost a administrative follow-on part of the process. Just to give you an example: With a few customers, we have volume purchase agreements that span a node, that basically you have a whole node agreement which is a lot more units that are under the volume purchase agreement. And they will just follow on with orders based on the lead time that we give them. And they will be very disciplined on giving us the orders, taking into account the lead time. With other customers, we have annual volume purchase agreements. And with other customers, we have 5 -- we have, let's say, purchase -- we have volume purchase agreements which span a period of 2 years, so when you have an annual volume purchase agreement and you negotiate that for 3, 4, 5, 6 months and it comes in, then the orders will follow because then you only have 6 months left. So then you get them to get an input of orders as -- you could say, as a big lump of those orders in 1 quarter. So what I'm trying to say is don't put too much emphasis on the order intake over a longer period of time. You are correct. It needs to reflect our future business, but a quarterly order intake is not indicative of our business going forward and might be almost deceiving if you understand how the ordering goes in our business. More important is, I think, our guidance on what we believe that we ship, but that is based on the agreements with -- which we have with operational executives of our customers.",364

Peter, you do seem some more optimistic now than you were earlier in the year. And it seems as though, despite sort of broader concerns about the end markets and the cycle, investment is clearly continuing. Your optimism, though, seems more around capacity additions as we come through the balance of the year rather than a sort of a very high level of sort of technology raise. We can see this in the tool mix as well. Looking at 2Q, you had a high level of KrF shipments, for example, but as we then move into next year, it seems as though you're talking much more about technology-driven year, particularly when thinking about logic beginning the initial investment at 10 nanometer and that requiring a high-end immersion. I'm just wondering, is this a fair characterization or perhaps too much of a generalization? And so what are your expectations of your -- or those of your customers in terms of capital intensity for next year? I'm just wondering why wouldn't your product mix move more towards the higher end in 2016 relative to where we are in 2015 if indeed that sort of technical complexity increases.",201

Wennink,,Executives,47,"Yes, I think this is generally the ASPs are going up. And as you've seen, that is just a reflection of the increased need for tools that can help our customers address the complexities of the next nodes. And whether it's on improved overlay, higher productivity, it was an earlier question, it will translate into a higher ASP. So I think that is definitely the case. Now to your point, yes, I think it's too much of a generalization and to try to split the shipment backlog between capacity and technology because, when we look at the capacity additions, they are not in existing fabs. They're in new fabs, which all those new fabs are addressing the most advanced nodes in those sectors. So that in fact is technology, yes, so -- and I will definitely say that the first-phase ramp of those fabs is at technology insertion, but they have to add capacity because it is basically a new fab. So for this year, this is what's happening: We have 2 DRAM fabs taking those tools. We have a logic fab taking those tools. That is driving our business in the second half, and that will happen. Now if you ask 2016, it's too early to give you guidance on 2016, but the customers generally, when they have -- went through the first phase, they just look at where they are and what the end markets do. And they will time the remainder of that ramp to fill up the fab. And that, you could argue, is then capacity and demand. And I would say this is how we actually look at it because 14-, 16-nanometer logic is now ramping. We are now shipping. How much of that capacity will be filled in 2016 really? We don't know yet. Same is for DRAM. So I would say it's probably just the other way around a bit. I mean what we're currently seeing is more technology capacity additions and whereby 2016 will be driven by the situation in the end demand. And that is, for us, still opaque. We don't know that, and I think our customers don't know that either, so we'll just have to wait and see.",369

Wennink,,Executives,50,"Yes, we -- basically, the 3300 that we now have has an upgrade package which brings this to 80 watts. The 3350 ships with a new drive laser which brings it to 125 watt, so that is a productivity increase from 80 to 125 watt, which you could say is almost a linear impact on the productivity. So maybe you're 500 wafers per day on the 3300, 80 watt. Then you can calculate. You don't even need a floppy disk for that, but you can calculate on a piece of paper to it means -- what that means for the productivity. And as you know, we have a target of 1,000 good wafers per day next year, so we need that productivity of the 3350. Now it's not only productivity. It's also availability. Now we have a 70% target for this year, but the 3350, with all the new, and I will say, options on it, which includes better stability of the droplet generator which includes in situ cleaning, actually brings the targeted availability to 85%. Now so if you go from 80 to 125, which gives you more productivity, you get an availability that goes from 70% to 85%. It gives you more productivity.

Wennink,,Executives,52,"Yes, I think you just mentioned it. I could have given that. What you just said could have been my answer. I mean, yes, it's clear that there's more focus in China on building semiconductor capabilities both in logic -- and also, I think that its statement is clear that they want to be somehow involved in advanced memory. Yes, I think China is becoming bigger. It's a bigger market, but don't exaggerate it here. I mean there are still -- when you think about logic as compared to the leading-edge logic makers, they're 2 generations behind. And Moore's law is not slowing down, as a matter of fact. And you can argue 10 nanometer is actually being pulled in. So yes, there is a lot of attention. There's more attention. And I've spent more time in China than I did the years before. We have more interaction with our customers. 28 nanometer is now ramping in China. There's now 28-nanometer logic. There is definitely more activity, but the -- like I said, the generation are still 2 generations behind. And in terms of leading-edge memory, there's a lot of leading-edge memory in China, but that's in NAND and in DRAM. And that's in -- not in Chinese ownership. That's in Korean ownership. So yes, China is moving, but don't think it's going to be a blowout. It's going to be gradual growth over the next 5 to 10 years.",240

Two questions, if I may. The first question relates to your field option and services. You see an elevated level in this quarter, and I'm wondering to what degree is this an outcome of increased reuse by customers as they move [ph], changes in the mode [ph] or across nodes. And how should we think about service and field option sales going forward versus the EUR 2.5 billion to EUR 3 billion target that you have in your 2020 model? And the second question regards to EUV. We've talked about throughput and productivity. We mentioned an overlisting [ph] to be under an acceptable level. Could you give us an update on the defectivity aspect? And where is that trending versus customer expectation?",126

Wennink,,Executives,55,"Okay, I'll first -- I'll take the EUV defectivity question and the growth drivers for field option and service. And I think Wolfgang can then talk about the 2020 targets, where it is [ph], because basically I think you're referring to our model that we showed at the Investor Day last year. On the EUV defectivity, this is currently not a -- well, that's not entirely true. There was a defectivity worry which largely had to do with mask-induced defectivities. I think, with the introduction of the EUV pellicle, which we talked about last quarter, as -- basically that -- those worries are gone. It's now making EUV pellicle mountable and demountable pellicle and bringing that to an industrial state, and that will take care of that. Now clearly there are resist-induced defects. There are process-induced defects. This is why customers need those development tools. This is why they are running hundreds and hundreds of good wafers per day today to figure that out. Now we do not get the feedback from our customers. The answer is that is a showstopper. This is what -- I would say it's the normal development activities that customers have to do to -- before they can go into a production ramp. So we don't have those numbers. And even if we would have those numbers, I would not give them to you because this is a public call. It is a customer privy information, so -- but it's not a major concern and especially since we have now a mask solution. Now on the drivers for the fields option and service growth, very clearly it's the installed base that grows. It's the drive of the customers to look at their installed base and say, ""How much CapEx have we still on the balance sheet? And how can we reuse that? Or how can we use it more efficiently?"" By either getting more wafers out, doing productivity upgrades, doing overlay and focused improvements so that they can use those machines for the next nodes. That is a big driver. And it includes upgrades, so with very advanced upgrades that includes a LAN swap [ph], a new optical system. It could be over EUR 20 million, EUR 20 million to EUR 25 million. Now those are drivers for the field option and service sales. I would go at installed base management, yes. That is what customers are focusing on to have a better capital efficiency. Wolfgang, do you want to take the target number?",419

First of all, also on the reuse, yes, reuse is enabled by us through these packages, and therefore we have also modeled that in our 2020 revenue numbers. And no, the assumptions have not changed as it relates to reuse in our field options and services. The EUR 2.5 billion to EUR 3 billion that you refer to in the different scenarios, it will depend a little bit on -- like I explained earlier on an earlier question, on whether customers order holistic options right with the system or whether they do options later on. But again, at EUR 400 million in the first, EUR 520 million in the second and that being stable, you'll be somewhere over EUR 1.9 billion. So there's still quite a bit of growth left to get to the EUR 3 billion level. We feel very comfortable about it. It's good business for us. It's approximately at the average of the gross margin of our systems business, so we believe that's still a good target range for now.",174

For Q3, our net sales came in at EUR 1.55 billion. This includes system sales of EUR 975 million, of which memory represented 56% and logic represented 44%. Service and field option sales came in strong at EUR 574 million. This part of our business's growth continues, driven by strong demand for Holistic Lithography options, high-value upgrades and a growing installed base. Our gross margin for the quarter came in at 45.4%, slightly above our guidance.
R&D expenses came in at EUR 267 million and SG&A expenses came in at EUR 86 million, both slightly below our guidance, positively affected by slower hiring, more favorable-than-planned exchange rates and some onetime effects. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Quarter-over-quarter cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments grew to EUR 2.68 billion from EUR 2.52 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased shares for EUR 142 million, bringing the total for repurchased shares to EUR 426 million year-to-date. Regarding the order book, Q3 bookings came in at EUR 0.9 billion, slightly below our Q2 non-EUV bookings. Strength in memory bookings continued to be notable. We finished the quarter with a strong overall backlog of approximately EUR 2.9 billion.
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations and guidance for the final quarter of 2015. We ended Q4 with a strong and nicely balanced system backlog. With continued strong service and field option sales in the quarter, we expect Q4 revenue to be approximately EUR 1.4 billion. Based on expected customer and product mix, we expect gross margin for Q4 at around 45%. R&D expenses for the fourth quarter will be about EUR 270 million and SG&A is expected to come in at about EUR 90 million. Our annualized tax rate is expected to come in at approximately 11%.
Q4 is affected by what appears to be a more cautious foundry segment. This is resulting in more limited current foundry node capacity additions, leaving our Q4 revenue guidance below Q3, and removing the potential Q4 upside in the sector we discussed last quarter. However, Q4 foundry equipment shipments will support early next node volume ramps. In addition, given ongoing memory booking strength, we expect that sales to the memory sector will remain healthy in Q4, although slightly below last quarter sales levels.
Given these assumptions for the rest of 2015, we can clearly state that this will be a record sales year for ASML. 2015 revenue will have been enabled by another strong memory year, driven by capacity additions in 2 new DRAM fabs and by some additional capacity needs in the 1 existing 3D NAND fab. The foundry sector will have increased versus 2014, as volume ramps continue at current and prior nodes. We will also have initial but limited shipment for 10-nanometer. Lastly, 2015 will mark a record sales level in our service and field options business.
Peter will talk more about EUV shortly, but I would like to make a few points regarding 2015 EUV shipments. As most listeners are aware, we continue to grow -- to show great progress in improving on key EUV performance metrics related to productivity and availability, with unchanged targets of improving both further throughout this year and next. Without a doubt, EUV continues to progress upward along the new technology adoption curve. 
We are delighted to have a total of 8 purchase orders for our NXE:3350 and NXE:3400 production systems, plus the 3 remaining EUV development tool orders for NXE:3300 systems, of which 2 are going to be upgraded. These 11 tools will go to 5 different customers. However, you now see that our shipment expectation for 2015 has changed to 4 systems, down from our prior expectation of 7 systems for the year.
Changes to shipment schedules are largely due to our customers' uncertainty on timing of new nodes as well as their near-term priority setting. As a reminder, all top manufacturers have had EUV development tools in-house and in use for some time. Also, 2 logic manufacturing leaders have now publicly committed to production insertion of EUV. We expect EUV revenue for 2015 to be limited to the one NXE:3300 that we recognized during Q2. For the time being, revenue recognition for EUV remains difficult to forecast since it depends, amongst other criteria, on the achievement of performance milestones and differs from customer-to-customer. Once the performance of EUV technology is matured, we expect to recognize EUV revenue on system shipment, as we do it in our DUV business. As we announced on our last call, we will share our expectations regarding revenue recognition as we ship systems. For the NXE:3350 that is being shipped right now, we expect to recognize approximately EUR 60 million of system revenue in the middle of 2016, with the remaining balance deferred to 2017. Now with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter.",815
388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 14, 2015",2015-10-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3775.0,876764.0,37596229.0,Presenter Speech,P. Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Wolfgang. As Wolfgang highlighted, the expectations for the second half of this year have been adjusted due to caution amongst our logic customers, as it relates to current 28-nanometer and 16-, 40-nanometer node ramps. However, with these adjusted numbers, we will still see a record revenue year in 2015. While it's too early to say anything quantitatively about 2016, we do see trends and developments that are worthwhile mentioning. 
In memory, our customers are currently indicating to us that their system demand will continue at healthy levels throughout the first half of 2016, albeit somewhat below our high Q3 sales levels.
We expect, as Wolfgang mentioned, that the 2 new DRAM fabs will continue to install capacity next year. Meanwhile, in NAND, we expect limited lithography tool shipments to 3D NAND in 2016, the only existing volume 3D NAND that will likely be full by the end of this year; and the 2 new fabs will likely take limited equipment, given that 3D NAND is still in its early stages of product introduction and the new fabs are not fully online. Given this memory landscape, we estimate that our sales to memory customers could be down year-over-year. By how much will depend largely on end demand and the aggressiveness with which customers will fill their fabs.
As mentioned earlier, in finishing out this year, logic customers have clearly taken a more cautious stance on capacity spend for 28- and 16- and 14-nanometer. However, the near-term completion of 2 new foundry fabs are designed to support the next advanced 10-nanometer FinFET ramp. 
The most recent customer indications are that this technology introduction is progressing well. These nodes should provide high value, given its significant shrink versus the 2016 14-nanometer node. Hence, their continued and clear commitment to ramp 10-nanometer starting in the second quarter of 2016. The speed and ultimate spend levels for logic in 2016 will depend on the rate at which our customers will be able to execute their ramp. And furthermore, field options and services will carry their strength into 2016 and will continue to show growth. On the ASML product side, I would like to highlight the fact that we're launching 2 new scanners: one under our DPV program and one under our EUV program. This is enabled by an almost equal split in R&D spend on our DPV platform, which is vital in supporting the existing industry needs, and our EUV platform, supporting the industry's future leading edge lithography needs. In addition, we continue to enhance our Holistic Lithography product offering, now also moving significantly into the EUV area.
Firstly, with respect to our DPV platform, we've now shipped our first NXT:1980 immersion product, which has demonstrated 40% improved focus uniformity; 30% improved overlay accuracy versus our prior offering; along with the world's first 275 wafer per hour emerging capability. This world-leading capability will help our customers address the increasing and overwhelming cost and complexity of immersion multiple-patterning and ever tightening process control requirements that come with continuing logic and DRAM node shrinks.
Regarding our Holistic Lithography products, leading-edge customers are using our full suite of immersion process, window enhancement and process control solutions to optimize yield at 1 nanometer or the 1x nanometer production nodes. Holistic Lithography production, now also extending into EUV processes, with customers evaluating our EUV source mask optimization software for development of 7- and 5-nanometer technologies. 
And finally, EUV. As most of you are aware, our 2015 focus has been on improving EUV stability, availability and productivity, the key metrics of performance that now drive new lithography technology adoption.
In several recent public presentations, our customers have recognized our EUV progress in these areas. On the raw productivity side, we've a system configuration that has demonstrated more than 1,000 wafers exposed in a 24-hour period. In a 4-week, customer-run manufacturing readiness test at the production conditions, we've seen 15,000 wafers exposed, with comparable results achieved using the same power configuration at multiple customers. Several customers have achieved 4-week average system availabilities of greater than 70%. However, the overall worldwide average is currently still lower, indicating that performance consistency needs to be further improved. 
Now Wolfgang discussed the encouraging state of our EUV orders. Key in our [ph] orders are 2 leading logic manufacturers that are now publicly stating the need for EUV at 7-nanometer. The speed at which these and other customers order and adopt EUV is influenced by multiple factors. That is, in any case, dependent on the timing of the initial production ramp for these next advanced nodes. In that context, some customers have indicated that with the current challenges of multiple patterning schemes, which drives significantly increased complexity, the time lines for current advanced nodes, for instance, 10- and 40-nanometer logic have been prolonged. This is forcing them to put priority on their integration efforts on these current nodes. These combined factors have, therefore, directly affected the EUV tool delivery requirements in 2015, pushing out some of those deliveries to 2016. However, as mentioned before, the need for EUV 4- to 7-nanometer nodes remains unabated.
We do not believe that the decisions on timing of EUV shipments will affect the company's stated target of reaching EUR 10 billion of sales by 2020, since as most of you know, we considered a 3-year node cadence when preparing the opportunity analysis that we shared with you last year. And finally, as our customers are collectively saying and consistent with our previous suggestion, EUV remains a question of when, not if. 
Now with that, we would be happy to take your questions.",933

All right? I know there have been questions with many people, how real is it, but in the discussion we're having with customers and the progress that they are making, which they have shared with us, we believe it's very real. But it will not start before Q2.

The first one was just on EUV adoption in memory and you may have mentioned some of the smaller customers. But I think there was an article yesterday or a couple of days ago that, on the DRAM side, EUV adoption could be on the road map for 15 and 10-nanometer. So I'm just wondering, do you have any more color and if that were the case, in which sort of time frame could you start to look at orders from those customers? And then second question was, just on the logic side, so I think Intel yesterday indicated they'll probably spend more CapEx next year. It also seems that TSMC and Samsung, so 2 foundries ramping 10-nanometer. So I mean you basically have the entire logic camp starting that 10-nanometer ramp, which I don't think has sort of ever really happened in history.

So let's start with that. That is for us scheduled, when we look at the road maps, 2018, early 2019. So that means as the year shipment before, that means 2017, end of '17 at the latest shipment -- at the latest, so that would mean, yes, we need to conclude orders, say, in the course of next year. On the 10-nanometer ramp for logic, very clear that, yes, you are absolutely right. We see all major logic makers bringing 10-nanometer forward. There is a difference as we see in terms of timing of introduction, timing of start of risk production. But generally, you are right. I mean, you see all the leading logic makers moving into the 10-nanometer area next year. Now that -- like I said earlier in the previous question, in answer to the previous question, we see things turning up in Q2. It depends -- generally, these ramps also depend on how well those 10-nanometer introductions go from a, let's say, yield and a production qualification point of view. Now there, I must say, we have had some good and positive news also from customers that things are going well. So yes, that might look favorable going -- let's say, onward from the second quarter. But like I said, we do not control, unfortunately, those advanced ramps for our customers. But that will determine the speed and the size of that opportunity in 2016. So let's keep our fingers crossed that we see the good development that we currently see, we see that continuing.",287

Over the past several years, logic foundry demand has actually turned out to be weaker than expected, because Moore's law is just becoming very expensive. And this kind of brings back EUV to the picture. But EUV is more like later this decade when it's going to be commercialized. So Peter, with that as a background, do you see a scenario where 10 would actually end up disappointing because the cost is going up. And isn't this why the 10-nanometer ramp is turning out to be as slow as what we experienced with 20 and 16?",102

Wennink,,Executives,18,"It's bit of a speculative question, which would -- should warrant a speculative answer, which I'm not going to give. What we are seeing on 10-nanometer is a level of cooperation with our customers -- with our logic customers to manage the complexities of 10-nanometer multiple patterning, which should lead, and that's what we're currently seeing, to yields that should provide our customers and their customers with a cost curve -- function of cost per bit that is still competitive, that is for the -- at least for the larger applications. The application that use a larger volume, still a very attractive node. Don't forget, if you talk about 10-nanometer and you compare the 10-nanometer shrink to the 20-nanometer shrink, which from a litho point of view, 16,14,20 is about -- what I'm saying, you talk about a significant shrink, that's a real shrink with a real cost benefit. It's hard to imagine that the end users and the customers of our customers are going to walk away from that benefit. This is also what customers keep telling us. And like I earlier said, the progress on the 10-nanometer development is going well. So we currently don't think it's going to be a small node because of that reason. You did mention one other point, which I think is important. You said 10-nanometer is going to be an expensive node, which is true and this is -- and also EUV is going to be a solution. But to be very frank, I mean, we've always planned 10-nanometer to be an EUV node. Now we're just late. And this, unfortunately, leads to a situation where customers need to apply complex multiple patterning strategies, which probably means that the 10-nanometer node is going to be prolonged, which actually has an impact on EUV, which pushes the EUV need 6 to 12 months back for those guys. And which, by the way, is what we put into our simulation model last year, because we anticipated somewhat that complexity coming. So in that context, you need to see 10-nanometer and EUV.",348

I think the total DRAM CapEx spending is really dependent on the aggressiveness with which our customers want to fill the existing new fab space that has been opened end of the last year and in the middle of this year. Those are very sizable fabs. There's a lot of potential capacity there. And I think it will be a function of the end market demand and how much aggressiveness our customers will want to put into the buildup of that capacity, which will, of course, will have an impact on the supply of DRAM. So I don't know how they want to deal with that. So this is a bit of a -- it's a good question. If you had the answer, I would like to know. But we don't have that answer readily available, because it depends on the customers. What we do know is that the first half of 2016 is still healthy. But the second half is still a bit too far out. How much of that is shrink? Well those new fabs that we're talking about are for the leading-edge nodes. So it's shrink and capacity, because they're 2 new fabs and it will take basically the leading-edge devices. It's both.",207

I'll take a crack at this. You're right. I mean, in general, when you look, for instance, 28 going to 20, 16, 14 that the litho intensity goes up by some 40%, 50%. And you're also right in your observation that our systems revenue as a company has been fairly stable over the last couple of quarters. I think there is 3 reasons for this, at least. One is that we have provided upgradability in our road maps to our systems. And you will have seen that, if you just take this year versus last year, we went from EUR 1.6 billion to -- we will be somewhere around EUR 2 billion on field options and services. So we do upgrade that don't show up in our systems revenue. Second reason is that, in particular, over the last couple of years, we have provided our customers, in response to the multipatterning requirements that Peter mentioned, with significant performance upgrades with 250 wafers per hour, and now we're going to 275 wafers per hour. That's not going to go on forever. We are reaching the physical limits there. And last but not least, and as was also already mentioned by Peter, we see the period of time over which customers facilitate certain nodes stretching out. If you take the 20, 16, 14 for instance, not all that equipment is being bought in a 2-year period. We have started to ship in the second half of '13. We're shipping in '14 and '15, and we're actually going to ship into '16 as well. So those are the 3 reasons why you're not seeing a big expansion on the system revenue yet.",283

Is that something that I heard or did I hear it correctly?",45

I'm glad you asked the question because we want to be crisp on that. Let me just give you a precursor. Revenue recognition is somewhat difficult for us on EUV, and it's in particular difficult to forecast. We have a pretty good view on the volumes, but then the revenue recognition in detail depends really on what customer we ship to, certain performance milestones and other accounting-related treatments. And in the long run, by the way, we want to do this like we do it in EUV at shipment. But what we said last quarter is that we are going to give you guidance as we ship systems. Starting with the 3350 that's being shipped right now, we're telling you that of that revenue, EUR 60 million will be recognized by mid-2016, with the rest in 2017. But that's just for this particular system that's shipping right now.  As a reminder, we're planning to ship another 2 systems this quarter, and there will be very likely revenue next year as well. And then we plan to ship somewhere, if I want to pick a range, an additional 6, 7 tools or so next year on top of that. And there will be some revenue, because remember, there will be some 3300s in there. There will be some revenue. So the EUR 60 million I mentioned is by no means the entire EUV revenue, it's just the one that is attributed to the system we have started shipping now. And in our January call, we are going to talk about the shipments that we will make this quarter and how that will translate into 2016 revenue. I think -- and hopefully, we can give more color on that -- even that in January, but I hope that clarifies this a little bit for you.",304

Peter, question on the memory, you said memory being healthy in the first half, driven more by DRAM new capacity. When you look at the memory next year, and you said overall memory could be down. So in your downside scenario, are you looking at more downside from NAND or from DRAM?",57

Wennink,,Executives,29,"Well, it's down year-on-year. We've had a particularly strong year in 2015, which was driven by the fact that we had a large DRAM factory coming online the end of last year -- just at the end of last year, taking tools throughout this year and a very large factory coming online middle of the year taking tools. So in that sense, there's a significant DRAM shipment this year. NAND was pretty stable as compared also to the year before, to 2013. Now when we look at the total memory market, DRAM will be driven by -- I said the further build-out of the first 6 months of the year, we have a pretty good visibility on it. But we don't know exactly what customers are going to do. With what speed and what aggression, you could say, are they going to fill up their remaining capacity in the second half of the year. That's where it becomes a bit more unclear. And on NAND, NAND is really driven by 3D NAND. And on 3D NAND, by the end of this year, the only dedicated 3D NAND fab will be full. That means there will be 3 --  I'm sorry, 2 new 3D NAND fabs coming online, but they will be limited in terms of the number of capacities that it will take, driven by the fact that it's still a device architecture that -- in its first phase of its life, so it's not going to be a full ramp.  And some of that capacity only comes online in the course of the year. So by design, if you then say 3D NAND is the driver next year, there is a limitation in terms of available capacity and available appetite, we think, to go fast. And we're probably going to be more 2017. So it's those things, as we said, that could be a likelihood that DRAM will be lowered and in 2016, as compared to 2015, largely driven by the strength of 2015.",335

That's very helpful. And on the 10-nanometer, the volume production is slated for second half of 2017. And so if that was the time line, how much before do you really ship the volume to your customer? Is that second half, what you're seeing, are those pilot lines or mass production tools? And what will be the, really, volume out in second half of 2017, when does the volume tool go into fabs?",74

Wennink,,Executives,31,"Yes, I think what you need to understand is that -- we mentioned it a couple of times before. That 10-nanometer is highly complex. It's complex because it involves multiple patterning strategies for multiple advanced layers, which actually means that the time between shipping a tool and the qualification for production lengthens. So you should not underestimate that time. So when there is a -- on the road maps there is, let's say, a volume ramp starting the second half of 2017. You need to think about a year earlier that you need to put those tools in and to make sure that you can grow to this full ramp, which means that the first pilot ramp will be starting somewhere in the middle of next year and the first risk production is starting at the beginning of the year. The new fabs will be ready soon. They will be able to take machines in the second quarter. Those machines will take time to install. It's about a quarter. So you are in Q3 of 2016 before they can start working on pilot production. And then it's logical that the volume production will be in the middle of 2017. These things get more complex, takes more time. So in that sense, it all fits.",214

My first question, Peter, is on the 3D NAND side. There is a very different commentary which I'm hearing from you guys versus the rest of the industry. We are seeing like Internet [ph] orders peaking at all-time high because of orders that they have received from Toshiba, and there is like a big conversion in Toshiba that's happening next year; and also at Micron. So I wanted to understand like, is there a big difference between a customer that builds a new fab on 3D NAND versus somebody who's converting their fab from planar to 3D. Is there a big difference in the litho intensity?",113

Wennink,,Executives,34,"On the 3D fab, generally as a greenfield fab, we need about 10% more litho in a greenfield fab with the same wafer capacity out. We are basing what we see in 3D NAND based on the customer complex that we have and on the shipment patterns that they're asking and on the wafer start capacity that they want to add. And we believe it is -- it doesn't show a full aggression. You've mentioned Toshiba, they will likely be ready with their fab taking tools at the end of this year; and we don't foresee it as a very strong ramp. And with Micron, that fab will only become available in the course of the year, whereby, of course, the fab needs to ramp up. And those are all elements that make us believe that 2016 will be a limited year for 3D NAND, 2017 definitely. 2017, you'll see these 2 fabs ramping. That would probably be a much stronger year. We'll just see a slower 2016 than what you seem to indicate.",174

And then my second question is on the service side. You guys had record high revenues in service. If I look at your service revenues, they've grown from about EUR 400 million a year ago to EUR 575 million, almost like a 40% increase. I just wanted to understand how sustainable is the revenue level on the service side? Usually, service tends to be like more stable. So just wanted to get a sense of how we should think about service revenues and quarter-to-quarter variability in that.",89

This is Wolfgang. First of all, you're right. I mean, we do in a quarter now that what a few years ago, we did in a year. But I'd like to just make sure that we're clear on the nomenclature, it's field options and services. So it is really driven by options that we make available on our Holistic Lithography, the software product, but also the upgrades that we enable. I mean, if you have a 1950 immersion system today, we can upgrade that 2 or 3 levels, and those are major upgrades. I mean, they're like EUR 20 million. Peter always calls them heart surgery. It's basically almost replacing the scanner. So that is increasing quite a bit. The installed base is increasing as well. And with that, we have higher service revenue. It's a good business for us. This year, I mentioned it earlier in a response to another question, I think we'll be around EUR 2 billion, and we see that business continuing to grow. For modeling purposes, I think if you take a 10% increase year-over-year, I think you're in the ballpark. So it's a strong business for us, and it continues to grow.",202

We don't see that caution at all as it relates to 10-nanometer. When we talked about caution, it had to do with -- also had to do with foundries not being the, let's say, the leading foundries. We mentioned last quarter that we also saw some -- still some upside in the areas of China, areas of Taiwan, not specifically in the leading edge. That has all disappeared, and it had to do with 28-nanometer also. So 28-nanometer, where we planned some shipments for the remainder of the year, did not turn out to happen. And I think it's largely been in that area, 28-nanometer, here and there some 16- and 14-nanometers tools, but those are, you could say, 2, 3 tools in total. And 2 tools are easily EUR 100 million. So you have to put it in context. So it's -- that caution does not, let's say, I would say affect the eagerness with which those customers are now talking about the 10-nanometer ramp. I mean, the 10-nanometer ramp, they keep pushing us and telling us that this needs to happen for several reasons. I mean, it's very strategic for all the leading foundries to be there with the right yields at the right time for the leading-edge customers. And they're pushing it.

The 3050s's a production tool. We're selling those tools to production people, to wafer fab bosses. They have different requirements than just to print one wafer.

Wennink,,Executives,45,"Yes, let's make one thing clear, when you talk about 10- and 7-nanometer, you probably talk about the specific road map that is out there. When we look at it, and let's look at it together: for us, the 10- and 7-nanometer is same lithography tool. And so in that sense, it is not the 1.5 years. For us, it's closer to a 3-year. And that also coincides with some other comments that were made by other customers about a prolonging of nodes. That's what we're seeing. We're seeing it happening at 10-nanometer.  The real lithography step that we will see is what -- is when we introduce EUV, whether you call it 7 or 5 or how do you want to call it, that is in the '18, '19 time frame. And that means that we need to ship in 2017 -- start shipping in 2017. Which means this is exactly in our plan. So node naming can be a bit confusing. We just look at what type of machine, litho tool, is needed when. And that means then our advanced DPV immersion tools are needed largely in 2015 and '16, and big part in 2017 and EUV starts to be needed in 2017 shipments for us and use for our customers in '18, '19. So this is how we look at it, and I also think this is how you should look at it when you talk about lithography.",241

We've talked a lot about rev rec, but can we talk about cost rec? I presume you'll be taking cost upfront, but if so, what's the timing on that? Is it -- do you recognize all the cost on the initial EUR 60 million? And can you talk about cash recognition as well, so when you'd actually expect to see cash payments for these?",71

Again, you will not be surprised. This will differ customer-by-customer as well. But yes, this will make it even more complicated. We will have situations where we have to recognize the cost when we start recognizing some revenue. And in that case, we'll get a little bit out of whack on the margin, and we'll have to describe that effect to you. And then the cash, that we put a lot of attention on, and you can in general assume that we get cash earlier than we recognize revenue.",90

I got 2 technical questions, actually. The first one is actually on this 3350B, which was in my mind supposed to be delivered and installed December. So could you maybe explain what are the technical difficulties that you're facing with this tool? I understand it's quite difficult to deliver, but still I would like to understand what is the delay related to? The second question is around the ecosystem. I'm sure you send people to SPIE Photomask in Monterey. I was there. It looked like the ecosystem has made a lot of progress regarding the pellicle, regarding the mask manufacturing and with ZEISS. But there is still this actinic through the pellicle inspection tool, which is missing for very high-volume manufacturing. So how do you think this will be solved with [indiscernible]?",136

Wennink,,Executives,50,"Well, if we talk about the first one, the 3350B shipped 2, 3 months later than we thought. But it had to do with the fact that we have a new drive laser there. That is the laser that is basically shooting at the thin droplet. It was the stability of that laser we had some issues with, but -- that are resolved now. So that's why we shipped the tool. So it's just when you have a big new piece of equipment and you have a planning on the integration, sometimes the integration takes a bit longer. This  was the case. On the ecosystem, this question of whether we need or do not need an actinic inspection tool that can actually inspect through the pellicle. This has been a question that has been around for a couple of years. I think the general consensus is that for the EUV introduction, also for the production introduction, we do not need it. We might, in the end, need it if feature sizes keep going down and we keep shrinking to 5-nanometer, 3-nanometer that, by that time, we need something like an actinic inspection tool. But that's not in sight, so that's next decade. Until then, we think we can definitely live with the solution of a removable pellicle. And it's up to us and our customers to prove that, actually, the removable pellicle is such a good solution, that we do need an actinic inspection tool at all. And this is where we are today. So not -- whatsoever, no impediment to EUV introduction in our production in this -- in the, I would say, remainder of this decade.",278

It has some price increase, but that has to do with the productivity. So we have a higher productivity as compared to the previous tool, that provides higher throughput, lower cost per wafer, lower cost per die, lower cost per bit and that will reflect in the tool pricing. So as you know, we had a previous tool that -- the 1970, that was able to do 250 wafers per hour. This one, 275.",79

Two, if I may. Firstly, with regards to EUV and the shipment being delayed from this -- for this year into next year, if I could go back to that and just try to understand it a little better. So that's aimed at, at risk production? Is there a particular reason why the customers were unwilling to proceed on that as planned in parallel with the focus on the next node, which is the 10-nanometer. I appreciate 10-nanometer is a priority, but is there a particular reason that you think that has changed in the past 3 months, so if you could dig a little bit more into that? And as a follow up, if I may ask you more broadly, strategically, looking at areas outside lithography, if you've talked about in collaborating with partners on the etching side, could you give us a sense of your progress there?",153
388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 14, 2015",2015-10-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3775.0,876764.0,37596280.0,Answer,P. Wennink,,Executives,55,"Yes, on the EUV shipment delay, I think I mentioned that, to be clear, the issue with 10-nanometer is, is that we are late with EUV. That's the major issue. I mean, we should have had EUV risk production or production ready at 10. Which actually -- which we didn't for all kinds of reasons. It's complex and we had the Cymer acquisition and we didn't make enough progress fast enough. I think we're hitting our targets for 2015, so we're aiming at hitting our targets in 2016. So I think we're on the right track. But we cannot change history. We cannot change the fact that we're late. So that meant that we forced our customers into a bridge solution, which is 10-nanometer doing with multiple patterning immersion. That's highly complex. And when we talk to our customers -- and you're absolutely right, saying that 10-nanometer is the first priority, it's very strategic. And we then talk to customers and say what are they focusing on and how can they divide their capacity of people that can do the integration for 10-nanometer and to do the development work for 7-nanometer. That capacity is limited. They have virtually all their people working on the 10-nanometer introduction because that is what the first priority is. Now with that fact that 10-nanometer is also stretching out, so the lifetime, you could say, the timing of that node is getting longer. It is natural that then also they need the EUV tools later. They need it later because EUV is getting introduced a bit later, but also they need all their resources to do the 10-nanometer development. And those are the reasons why they say, ""Okay, we can now take the EUR 95 million or close to EUR 100 million tool today or we can take it when we actually need it and we have the resources to deal with it."" And this is where we are today. It's a very practical solution that customers are now discussing with us, finding out that 10-nanometer is not as simple as we thought, and that their initial desire to stay on a 2-year cadence is getting more complex. You move on and you learn more. And this is what has happened and this has happened throughout the year. And I think it has become clear to us over the last 3 months that this is where we are and this is the situation and we're going to help our customers deal with it. Okay, then the second question, on etch. I think, yes, one of the issues is when you keep shrinking and you do multiple patterning, that one thing is overlay. Now overlay, we do actually have a metrology solution that is integrated, called YieldStar. But you also have a CD, the critical dimension, how you want to control the critical dimension. The CD uniformity is not only determined after the imaging process but also after the etch process, and we are working together with an etch company but also with an applied research company called IMEC to see what we, as a combination of 2 suppliers, can do to help our customers to control that CD uniformity when we keep shrinking to 10 to 7, to 5. And that's work that's ongoing. But I would say that's ongoing more on a research and development level, where we work together with those companies.",569

Just going back to the 7- and 10-nanometer nodes in the context of trends in immersion revenue. I think on the Q2 conference call, TSMC made a comment that they expect total wafer starts at 7 and 10 together to be lower than at 20 and 16. So given that outlook, and if that were true, and given that you've seen an increase in litho intensity clearly at 10 and potentially at 7 as well, would you expect that your foundry immersion or revenue trend will inflect at 10-nanometer and into 7-nanometer? Or given that there is also the situation where we're seeing some weakness in the smartphone market, that you would see more sort of a continuation of the trend that you've seen in the last 1 or 2 years? And I have a brief follow-up.",140

If you don't mind, I will abstain from commenting on the smartphone market because it's a bit too far away. So we just listen to the customers. The assumption that wafer capacity might be lower in, let's say, 7 -- 10, 7 than in 20, 16, I think it's also something that we have assumed when we talked to you last year, when we gave you an outlook until the end of the decade. I mean, we have actually seen a 10% node-after-node reduction of the wafer capacity needed. And it has to do with, indeed, the increased cost and especially the increased initial cost. Because the market for those customers that can afford that cost and can create value with that cost, that market in terms of number of players, although those players are very large, but that market is, of course, smaller than when we had 28-nanometer and above. So that is an assumption that we also follow. However, you mentioned that the litho intensity node-by-node goes up by about 40%. And especially, we go to 10 and 7, we see very intense multiple patterning strategies. And Wolfgang alluded to that part of it, we are going to help our customers by upgrading machines in the field, which will be an impetus for our service and field option sales. And next to that, when we look at the multiple patterning strategies and the number of layers that are affected, we also see upside in the number of units that they need from an immersion point of view. So not everything in life is that rosy. It means that costs will go up and complexities will go up, so it will force customers to, after this node, to move into EUV. I think it's inevitable. So I don't think it has a major negative impact on us because of the reasons that I just mentioned. And I think the immersion business will stay very healthy for the years to come.",333

And just a very brief follow-up to Wolfgang. You said that R&D spending on EUV and DUV is roughly similar, when do you expect the DUV part to start falling off? In your current planning, when would you start dropping that, and sort of increase the EUV spend from your overall R&D point of view?",57

We're just shy of EUR 1.1 billion per year right now, and our target is by 2020 at EUR 10 billion revenue to be about 13%. So we're still seeing a little bit of growth there. The split is a little bit less than half EUV, and the other half is not only DUV, but it's also Holistic Lithography and it's fundamental research. Fundamental research, I would suggest will be flat to slightly up. Holistic Lithography will go up year-over-year because it's -- there are a lot of additional value comes in through for the software options. And then DUV, over time, will go down. I mean, we've just put major innovation in the 1980. We will -- we see one platform after that. So I don't think that you see a major inflection before the end of 2017, beginning 2018. And that's when we will ramp more in EUV when we go into technologies that prolong the life of EUV, such as high NA that some of our customers are now starting to mention now publically as well. So overall, the shape will be overall R&D will grow at a slower slope than the revenues. So the percentages will come down and somewhere in the '17, '18 time frame, you'll see EUV come a bit down and EUV extension and applications will go up in the piece of the pie.",239
