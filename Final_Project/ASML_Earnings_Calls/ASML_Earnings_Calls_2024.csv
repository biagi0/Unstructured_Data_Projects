Dassen,,Executives,1,"Revenue for the quarter came in at EUR 7.2 billion, which was higher than guided, primarily driven by the fact that the installed base business at EUR 1.6 billion was higher than we expected. And that was both as a result of higher service revenue and higher revenue from upgrades.
That fact, so the higher installed base business, also drove up the gross margin. So gross margin came in at 51.4%, also higher than the guidance as a result of, as I mentioned, the higher installed base business. 
Net income for the quarter came in at EUR 2 billion. And after a few soft quarters, the order intake for the quarter was very, very strong. Actually, a record order intake at EUR 9.2 billion. If you look at the composition of that, it was about 50-50 for Memory versus Logic. And around EUR 5.6 billion out of the EUR 9.2 billion was related to EV, both Low-NA and High-NA.",160

388904.0,"ASML Holding N.V., Q4 2023 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2024",2024-01-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,1092.0,3002351.0,109798861.0,Answer,R.J.M. Dassen,,Executives,5,"My favorite topic. So it comes to fast shipments, as you know, in the course of 2023, we changed the testing protocol for immersion tools on fast shipment, and we agreed those with customers. And as a result of that, we could recognize revenue again upon shipment. So that's for immersion. 
When it comes to EUV, earlier on, we said that we expected around EUR 2.3 billion of value of fast shipments at the end of this year for EUV shipped but not yet recognized in revenue. That turned out to be quite a bit lower, EUR 700 million, and there's a few reasons for that. 
First off, we had a couple of tools that were originally scheduled for shipment in, let's say, the last couple of weeks of '23. That actually slipped into the first couple of weeks of '24. And then secondly, we had some shifts in demand from customers that also led to a few tools slipping into '24. So as a result of that, the value came in at EUR 700 million rather than at EUR 2.3 billion.
That said, for 2024, we expect, at the end of 2024, that we will not do fast shipments for EUV. Main reason being that we assume that we'll not capacity constraint for EUV in 2024 because of the additions of -- additional capacity that we've been talking about. And that means that in our guidance when we talk about our expectation, '24 revenue being similar to '23 revenue, the revenue from these fast shipments, so the EUR 700 million, but also these tools that slip from 2023 into 2024, that's included in that expectation.",276

Dassen,,Executives,7,"So yes, I mean, as we said last quarter, clearly, there is still uncertainty. There are uncertainties at the macro front. And also, I think it's clear to see that our customers are navigating through the downside of the order cycle. So they're really making that move right now. And as a result of that, I think the question really remains, as it was -- as we expressed it last quarter as well, what's the shape of the recovery? 
Yes, recovery is there, but what's the shape of the recovery? And how fast is that recovery going to be? And I think that's still unclear. That said, I do believe there are a few positive signs. And I think it is important to recognize those as well. So one positive sign is that we clearly see that the inventory levels in the end markets are getting to -- are improving and are definitely at a better level than we were a couple of quarters ago. So there is a clear improvement on the inventory situation in the end market. So that's one positive development. 
Secondly, if we look at the utilization of our tools, we clearly see that they are improving. They're not yet at what I would call normal levels, but they're clearly improving. And all the indications that we're getting is that we believe that, that improvement will continue to occur in the course of this year. So good development there. 
And thirdly, clearly, the EUR 9.2 billion order intake that we talked about earlier on, I think, is also a clear positive indication. So few good data points, a few positive data points. But still, we believe it's too early to revise our guidance. So we would keep our guidance as we articulated it last quarter, which is that we believe that 2024 will be similar in revenue as 2023. 
That said, we also set 2024 very much a transition year and a year in which we're really building up capacity. We're making good investments into our capacity because we believe 2025 is going to be a year of strong growth, and that's what we're preparing for in this year as well. 
If we look at different elements in the composition of our revenue, I would say if we look at the end markets, I would say that we believe, on the Memory side, we believe there will be -- that memory will be bigger than 2023, in 2024. And that's primarily because we see no transitions there. And these no-transitions primarily support the increased demand for advanced DRAM. And then you should think about DDR5, you should think about high bandwidth -- high-bandwidth memory. 
On the logic side, I would argue that we're looking at a small decline in comparison to 2023, primarily because of all the capacity additions that we've seen in 2023. I think it's fair to assume our customers will digest those capacity additions. So as a result of that, we believe that there, the growth will be a little bit smaller. 
If we then look at the different technologies. On EUV, we believe that we're looking at an increase. From a revenue unit number perspective, we believe will have approximately the same number of units of EUV in revenue, and that includes the things that we talked about earlier on, the fast shipment and units, et cetera, are included in that estimate. But we will benefit in EUV from higher ASP because we'll have a bunch of 3800s in our revenue with a higher ASP. And also we'll benefit from 1 or 2 EXEs or High NA tools that we'll have in revenue. So I think for EUV, we expect an increase. 
As it comes to non-EUV system sales, as a result of the flat guidance, we believe that we'll see a small decrease there, and that will be primarily related to immersion. So we expect to have less immersion sales in 2024 in comparison to '23. 
And as it comes to installed base business. On the installed base, we believe that will be flat in comparison to last year. And then finally, in terms of the composition over the quarters, we believe that the momentum will build during the year 2024. And as a result of that, we expect the sales level, the revenue level in the second half will be higher than in the first half of 2024.",738

So in 2023, we ended at 51.3% gross margin. We expect that this year, we'll be slightly below that number. A number of puts and takes there again. I think if you look at EUV, we talked about the introduction of the 3800. So that would have a positive impact on the gross margin. And also, we expect that the service gross margin for EUV will improve. So that's positive.
But as I also mentioned, we'll have less immersion, and that will have a negative impact on the gross margin. And also, as we also mentioned in previous quarters, this really is an investment year as well. We're investing for the capacity expansion that we'll take benefits from in 2025, so significant investments there. And also we're very much investing in our capability, both in the factory and in the field as it relates to High NA. So those are drags, if you like, on the gross margin. And if you add that all up, we think that the gross margin of '24 will be slightly below the gross margin for '23.",183

Dassen,,Executives,11,"As you know, for 2025, we gave an expectation at the Capital Markets Day of a gross margin range between 54% and 56%. And we still believe that, that is the right window to look at. I recognize that's a jump from the gross margin that I just -- expectation that I just gave for 2024. We have good reasons for that. 
First off, of course, in 2025, if you look at the EUV mix, there will be substantially more high ASP tools in there than lower ASP tools in there. So I think that's an important element in there. Secondly, we'll have many more High NA tools in revenue in '25 than in '24, and they will be able to absorb the costs -- better absorb the total cost that we have for high NA. And even more importantly, as I mentioned, we are building capacity for '25. And of course, that should lead to, as we expect higher sales levels for '25. 
So many more outputs for EUV and DPV. And that means that we should, in '25, will get the benefit of the investments that we make in '24. And if we combine all of those dynamics, then indeed, we believe that the 54% to 56% window for gross margin in '25 is the right number to look at.",222

Dassen,,Executives,13,"So for Q1, we expect EUR 5 billion to EUR 5.5 billion of sales in that quarter with a gross margin expected to be somewhere between 48% and 49%. We expect installed base revenue of approximately EUR 1.3 billion. That's a bit of a soft start for the year. But that, I think, is very much in sync with what I told you earlier on that we really believe that the momentum is building up throughout this year. And we expect that the second half of the year will be better than the first half.",95

How do you see this developing in 2024? And can you give us an update on the most recent export control regulations and how it's impacting your business moving forward?,38
388904.0,"ASML Holding N.V., Q4 2023 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2024",2024-01-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,1092.0,3002351.0,109798871.0,Answer,R.J.M. Dassen,,Executives,15,"So you're fully right. The business in '23 with China was very, very strong. I should remind everyone that, that was also driven by the fact that we already had many orders for systems into China. And the majority of the sales that we have with China was actually executing on orders that were already there by the end of 2022. 
I think we explained it last time, the order fill rate typically for China was fairly low in the past couple of years. It actually was below 50%. So with the shifts in demand that we had with other customers, that meant that we were able to execute on the demand that was clearly there in China, and that's why the China sales went up significantly in this year. 
I should also say that those sales are really to mid critical and mature -- for mid-critical to mature manufacturing. I mean that's where the systems are going to. And that demand is very, very solid. It was solid last year. We expect it to be solid this year and also on a go-forward basis because of all the dynamics that are going on in China, we believe that, that will remain solid. 
In terms of export controls, you're right. I mean, last year, we had Dutch rules kicking in and we had additional U.S. rules kicking in. We actually sought clarification with the authorities on the interpretation of those rules, and that really confirmed the expectation and the interpretation that we gave in our update on Q3. 
In that sense, what it means that we should now expect that for 2024, we will not get export licenses for shipment into China for, let's say, advanced immersion, so 2000 and up tools. And we should also expect -- for a handful of fabs, we should expect not to get export licenses for China for 1970 and 1980 immersion tools. So that is the interpretation that we had in Q3, and we had that confirmed in follow-up conversations with the authorities. 
In terms of what that does, as you recall, we said on -- in Q3, we said that we believe that between 10% to 15% of the China sales in 2023 would be affected by this rule. So if you look at the impact that these export regulations that were articulated in '23, the impact that, that will have on the '24 sales, we confirm that we believe that will be somewhere between 10% to 15% of the China system sales in 2023.",424

So we had a few soft quarters, but this was a strong quarter in terms of cash generation. So I think that was clear. And that, to a large extent, I think that was also related to the fact that we had a significant order intake, and as a result of that, we had an uptick in down payments. 
The strategy -- capital allocation strategy and policy, by itself, hasn't changed, right? So we still -- whatever cash we need in order to make the investments into the business for capacity, for technology, et cetera, et cetera, that's the first deployment of the cash. 
Secondly, we have a policy of growing dividends. And as it comes -- and growing dividends, which are paid out on a quarterly basis, and as it comes to this year, we will pay an interim dividend in Q1 of EUR 1.45 per share. And we will recommend to the AGM to declare a final dividend of EUR 1.75 per share in the AGM. And that would bring the total dividend for 2023 up to a level of EUR 6.10 per share, which would be a 5.2% increase over last year's dividend. And then whatever is left will be paid back to shareholders by way of share buybacks.",213

Dassen,,Executives,19,"So essentially unchanged, I would say, in comparison to what we said last quarter. So we -- if we start looking at 2025, as I mentioned before, we are looking at a year of significant growth. And that is for a couple of reasons. First off, we think the secular trends in our industry are still very much intact, right? If you look at the developments around AI, if you look at the developments around electrification, around energy transition, et cetera, they will need many, many semiconductors. So we believe the secular trends in the industry are still very, very strong. 
Secondly, I think we clearly, by 2025, we should see our customers go through the up cycle, I mean the upward trend in the cycle. So that should be a positive. And thirdly, as we also mentioned last time, it's clear that many fab openings are scheduled that will require the intake of quite some tools in the 2025 time frame. 
So we view 2025 as a strong year of growth. Now we are making the investments, as I also mentioned before, in 2024 in order to be able to create the capacity that will be needed in '25, but also will be needed to cater to the demand that we talked about in the Capital Markets Day earlier on in 2030. So we see strong growth, and we believe we need to prepare for that growth. 
And talking about Capital Markets, you can put it into your calendar. We expect our next Capital Markets Day to be on November 14 of this year. I really look forward to seeing you there, and discussing with you the good growth opportunities that ASML has for the foreseeable future.",288

Dassen,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first review the fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial accomplishments and then provide guidance on the first quarter of 2024.
Let me start with our fourth quarter accomplishments. Net sales came in at EUR 7.2 billion, which is just above our guidance, primarily due to more installed base business. We shipped 10 EUV systems and recognized EUR 2.3 billion revenue from 13 systems this quarter. Net system sales of EUR 5.7 billion, which was mainly driven by Logic at 63%, with the remaining 37% coming from Memory. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 1.6 billion, which was higher than guided due to additional service and upgrade sales. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 51.4%, which is above our guidance, primarily driven by installed base business. 
On operating expenses, R&D expenses came in at EUR 1.041 billion, and SG&A expenses given at EUR 284 million, both basically as guided. Net income in Q4 was EUR 2 billion, representing 28.3% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of EUR 5.21.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 7 billion. Moving to the order book. Q4 net system bookings came in at EUR 9.2 billion, which is made up of EUR 5.6 billion for EUV bookings and EUR 3.6 billion for non-EUV bookings. These values also include inflation corrections.
Net system bookings in the quarter are more balanced between Logic and Memory relative to past few quarters, with Logic at 53% of the bookings, while Memory accounted for the remaining 47%. 
Looking at the full year, net sales grew 30% to EUR 27.6 billion, with a gross margin of 51.3%. EUV system sales grew 30% to EUR 9.1 billion, realized from 53 systems while a total, we shipped 42 EUV systems in 2023. Deep UV system sales grew 60% to EUR 12.3 billion. Our Metrology & Inspection system sales decreased 19% to EUR 536 million.
Looking at the market segments for 2023. Logic system revenue was EUR 16 billion, which is a 60% increase from last year. Memory system revenue was EUR 6 billion, which is a 9% increase from last year. Installed Base Management sales was EUR 5.6 billion, which is a 2% decrease compared to previous year.
At the end of 2023, we finished with a backlog of EUR 39 billion. Our R&D spending increased to EUR 4 billion in 2023 as we continue to invest in innovation across our full product portfolio. Overall, R&D investments as a percentage of 2023 sales were about 14%. SG&A increased to EUR 1.1 billion in 2023, which was about 4% of sales.
Net income for the full year was EUR 7.8 billion, 28.4% of net sales, resulting in an EPS of EUR 19.91. We finished 2023 with a free cash flow generation of EUR 3.2 billion. We returned EUR 3.3 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks in 2023. 
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the first quarter of 2024. We expect Q1 net sales to be between EUR 5 billion and EUR 5.5 billion. We expect our Q1 installed base management sales to be around EUR 1.3 billion. Gross margin for Q1 is expected to be between 48% and 49%. Lower revenue and margin relative to Q4 is primarily driven by lower emerging volume, along with an unfavorable change in product mix. In addition, we also expect [indiscernible] EUV volume and lower Installed Base business in Q1 relative to Q4.
The relatively slow start to the year is a reflection of the current state of the industry coming out of a downturn. As it relates to gross margin, I would like to make a few more comments on the 2024 margin drivers as well as our longer-term ambitions of 54% to 56% by 2025. We finished 2023 with a full year gross margin of 51.3%, and there are a number of developments that could impact the gross margin in 2024.
For EUV, positive drivers include a higher ASP of the 3800E as well as improving EUV service margins. For deep UV, we expect product mix to have a negative impact on margin in 2024. On our installed base business, we currently expect a similar gross margin as 2023, but the final impact will ultimately depend on the level of upgrades in 2024.
And finally, as we have said before, we expect significant costs in 2024 related to the introduction of High-NA and to the ramp of our capacity to 90 EUV, 600 deep UV levels that we have talked about before, which will create pressure on the gross margin.
When we assess the combined effects of these different developments, we expect a slightly lower gross margin in 2024 compared to 2023. We are still targeting our earlier communicated gross margin ambition of 54% to 56% by 2025. This increase in gross margin will be driven by a number of items. First, higher sales volume, both in EUV and deep UV, which improved fixed cost coverage. 
Second, a move to a higher-margin EUV 0.33 NA system as the vast majority of systems in 2025 are planned to be 3800E systems. Third, we expect reduced headwinds from capacity investments as we ramp volume, including High-NA. Fourth, we will also be transitioning to a higher-margin EUV High-NA system, the 5200 in 2025. Lastly, we expect our Installed Base business to have a positive impact on 2025 margins due to both improved EUV service margins as well as increased upgrade business volume.
The expected R&D expenses for Q1 are around EUR 1.07 billion and SG&A is expected to be around EUR 300 million. Our estimated 2024 annualized effective tax rate is expected to be between 16% and 17%. In Q4, ASML paid the second quarterly interim dividend of EUR 1.45 per ordinary share. ASML intends to declare a total dividend for the year 2023 of EUR 6.10 per ordinary share. The third interim dividend of EUR 1.45 per ordinary share will be made payable on February 14, 2024.
Recognizing this third interim dividend and the 2 interim dividends of EUR 1.45 per ordinary share paid in 2023, this leads to a final dividend proposal to the general meeting of EUR 1.75 per ordinary share. In Q4 2023, no shares were purchased.
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Peter.",1088

Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Roger. As Roger has highlighted, we had another year of very strong growth in a very challenging environment. And we finished the year with a solid backlog of EUR 39 billion. The uncertainty remains in the market due to a number of global macro concerns, while the semiconductor industry is currently working through the bottom of the cycle. Our customers are still not certain on the shape or slope of the recovery this year but there are some positive signs in the indicators that we have been monitoring. Industry end market inventory levels continue to improve, moving towards more healthy levels. With probably 2 utilization levels are still running lower than normal, but are now improving in both Logic and Memory. We expect utilization levels to continue to improve over the course of this year.
And lastly, as mentioned by Roger, we saw very strong order intake in the fourth quarter in support of future demand. To be able to follow the curve of the industry recovery, we are looking at the combined demand for 2024 and 2025. As mentioned last quarter, we fueled 2024 as a transition year in preparation with the expected strong demand in 2025. We, therefore, continue to make investment this year, both in capacity ramp and in technology to be ready for the upturn in the cycle.
While we see some positive signs of recovery, we feel it might be a bit too early to change our perhaps conservative view as communicated last quarter, and therefore, still stay with our previously communicated expectation of 2024 revenue to be similar to 2023.
Looking at the market segments. Customers are indicating, they are seeing healthy growth this year, primarily driven by AI-related demand for both Logic and Memory but also expected from other end markets as inventory levels improve. And coming off a very strong year in 2023 with 60% growth in Logic revenue, we expect some pause in demand as customers digest the capacity additions and while utilization levels improve. Based on current demand, we see lower Logic revenue in 2024 versus 2023. 
For Memory, inventories are approaching normal levels and customers are expecting to see demand growth on a number of end markets this year. Litho demand is primarily driven by DRAM technology node transitions in support of advanced memories such as DDR5 and HBM in support of AI-related demand. We currently see revenue growth in our 2024 Memory business versus 2023.
Turning to our businesses for EUV. We are expecting revenue growth in 2024 and we are planning to recognize revenue on a similar number of EUV Low-NA systems as 2023, which includes the fast shipments for 2023. Although we planned a similar number of systems as 2023, we will have higher ASPs from the NXE:3800E systems, more weighted towards the second half of the year. In addition, we expect revenue from 1 or 2 High-NA systems. 
Based on the aforementioned, we expect our non-EUV business to be down in 2024, primarily driven by lower immersion sales relative to 2023. For our Installed Base business, based on our view today, we expect a similar level of revenue compared to last year, plus the recovery becomes more clear this year. Customers may likely look to upgrade their systems in preparation for 2025. And this could provide future business opportunity this year. As a reflection of the current state of the industry coming out of a downturn and an expected recovery over the course of 2024, we expect a stronger second half relative to the first half of this year. 
On the geopolitical front, as communicated earlier, we do not expect to get export licenses for our most advanced immersion systems, the NXT:2000 and up for China in 2024. We have been in contact with the U.S. government on their export control regulations announced in October last year, and we can confirm the estimated financial impact as communicated in October.
At that time, we stated the impact of the Dutch and the U.S. export control regulations combined is 10% to 15% of our 2023 China system revenue. This impact is based on our presumption that as of 2024, we will not obtain export licenses for NXT:2000 and up immersion systems to Chinese customers. And in the case of only a handful of Chinese fabs, this also includes NXT:1970 and 1980 systems. While the export regulations had an impact on our business, we continue to see strong demand for mid-critical and mature nodes in China.
Looking longer term, while there are still significant uncertainties, primarily driven by the macro environment, it appears we are passing through the bottom of this specific cycle and expect an industry recovery over the course of 2024. Based on discussions with our customers and supported by our strong backlog, we currently expect 2025 to be a strong year driven by a number of factors. 
First, the secular growth drivers in the semiconductor end markets which we have previously discussed, such as energy transition electrification and AI. The expanding applications [ space ] along with increasing lithography on future technology nodes, drives demand for both advanced and mature nodes.
Second, the industry expects to be in the middle of a cyclical upturn in 2025. And last, as mentioned earlier, we need to prepare for a significant number of new fabs that are being built across the globe, in some instances clearly supported by several government incentive plans. These fabs are spread geographically, are strategic for our customers and are scheduled to take our tools.
It is essential that we keep our focus on the future and build capacity in preparation for further long-term growth as we discussed in the market scenarios for 2025 and 2030 during our Investor Day in November 2022. We plan to update our view during our Investor Day this year on November 14, 2024.
In summary, although there are still near-term uncertainties with a positive outlook trend, we clearly remain confident in our long-term growth opportunity. And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions.",1009

Yes, I think in the prepared remarks, I already alluded to it, I think we will see -- we are seeing the first signs, the positive signs of a recovery, which is basically the data we get on inventory levels, but also we see our utilization rates going up again.
That -- and also in the history, not only of the company but the industry, means that we're in a recovery cycle, you will see that continuing throughout the year, which means that 2025 could be the first full year of the recovery.
Now having said that, to assess the slope of the recovery, we take a bit of a conservative view that could, of course, change. So if the slope of the recovery is a bit faster than we think than some of that 2025 business, which we're preparing, by the way, to ship or at least to build in 2024 could actually be shipped in 2024.
Now I don't think it's going to be in the first half, but some of that -- if you talk about key areas of potentially improvement. That could be an area seeing some pull-in for system shipments into 2024, one.
Two, I think when that happens, customers see it happening. But we also see that they might have some time to take advantage of the time before full utilization and do upgrades and actually Installed Base business, which is generally high-margin business. I think those are, I think, the 2 main areas where we see upside -- potential upside for 2024.",261

That's always the case. I mean, you could argue, I mean, we have seen the focus on AI in the Memory space. Now clearly, that could happen. But I think it's generally the end markets that are reflective of where the recovery will take us in 2024.
That will actually drive higher utilization of our tools and will mean pull-in of those machines because customers don't want to miss the market upturn. I think it's all a bit of the same because the end markets ultimately will have to -- will have to drive the recovery.
And I think AI is now particularly something which could be on top of that because that's clearly a technology transition. But we've already seen a very positive effect of that in our Q4 order intake.",133

Dassen,,Executives,15,"Yes, Joe, as you know, we never disclose High-NA orders, and we do it for a good reason. I've said it before. The world is very small and High-NA orders are something that is competitively sensitive for our customers.
So that's why customers, they don't want us to be specific on High-NA. I think it is fair to say that if you look at the EUR 5.6 billion of order intake for EUV that we recorded in Q4, obviously, the lion's share of that is in Low-NA, and that should be very clear.
In terms of overall orders that we have for High-NA, I think a couple of quarters ago, we said it's now double digit. I think since then, we had a few quarters where we added a couple, so I think that's what we're looking at. But the lion's share of the order intake in the quarter really was obviously for Low-NA.",154

That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, can you give us the puts and takes on free cash flow this quarter. I wonder, I guess, -- I thought that it might have been a bit higher given the record level of EUV orders and the associated partial down payments that are related to that. So just any help you could give us on the free cash flow this quarter?",72

Down payments were helpful, right? So as a result of that, I do -- you did see that in the second quarter -- in the last quarter Q4 free cash flow was quite positive at EUR 2.6 billion just for the quarter, primarily driven, as you say, by down payments.
But it's also fair to see that we are in ramping mode. We are preparing for a ramp in 2025, and that means we're taking in materials. We're building inventory for High-NA, et cetera, et cetera. So I think on the inventory position, you would see that we're adding quite a bit.
So that is obviously a negative, if you like, to the free cash flow. But still, overall, I think the EUR 2.6 billion that we recorded in the last quarter, I think, was a healthy -- was a healthy cash generation.",146

Actually, the question is about the 2025 acceleration. My feeling is that you sound a bit more comfortable on the fact that this strong acceleration is going to happen. And I remember you're saying that you are targeting the middle of the range. But at the same time, and I'm sure you didn't miss this one, consensus has come down really to the lower end of the guidance for 2025.
So can you maybe tell us if you are still targeting the middle of the range, at least? And what do you need to see in terms of Memory recovery, Logic orders coming through to 2024 to reassure that?",110

Yes, yes, I mean we feel a bit more comfortable on 2025 after having received EUR 9.2 billion of orders, which, especially in the EUV domain, it's focused on 2025. So I think you get the vote of confidence from our customers on what we thought was going to happen, which is always good.
When you talk about the middle of the range, I said -- my comment was that I thought the lower end of the range was too conservative. That's what I said. I can make it in the middle of the range or the high end of the range. It's your choice, but I'm not going to comment on that because that would give me in January 2024 -- the 24th of January, give you an outlook or either I give you guidance on 2025. I mean it might be a bit early.
So -- but I do feel directionally, that's what I said. I said the low end, I thought it was too conservative because we do believe that 2025 is going to be a very strong year. Well, the order intake actually gives us at least some level of confidence that -- that statement at that time was actually quite good. So I feel more comfortable. Yes, that's absolutely true.
Now if the recovery in 2025 is indeed what we expect. Yes, we should see a further order flow in 2024. Our lead time -- order lead time is 12 to 18 months. So yes, and that's what I also said last time, if we're right on 2025, we need to see orders coming in, in the first half of 2024.
Now we've seen a significant batch of those orders already coming in, in Q4 2023. So that just supports our assumptions. So in that sense -- now make a long story short, yes, I feel more comfortable, I think, with me are my colleagues.",323

Wennink,,Executives,22,"Well, I think it's -- what we're seeing is, of course, the information coming off our tools that we see the utilization rates going up. That's one. Clearly, there's also an element of technology transition.
That's also clear. I think there's a bottleneck in the AI and making use of the full AI potential, DRAM is a bottleneck. The performance memory is a bottleneck. And there are solutions, but they need a heck of a lot more HBM and that's EUV. So it's a bit of a mix.
I mean, yes, you've gone through, I think, the bottom of this memory cycle with prices going up, utilizations increasing, and that combined with the technology transition driven by AI. That's a bit what we see today. So it's a combination of both, and I think that will continue.",137

Is that expected to be sort of at the same level we've seen for the last few quarters where it's been exceptionally strong? Or is there some rebalancing you're expecting across global demand expected for later in the year as we get towards that growth expectation for 2025?,62

Dassen,,Executives,25,"Well, I mean, we're not going to be specific at the beginning of the year exactly on China. But I think a few data points that we want to share with you. First off, as we also said in the video, we do see the demand from China being very robust. Second, there is an impact, obviously, coming out of the export controls. And Peter just gave you that impact, the 10% to 15%.
So I think fundamentally, it's pretty clear that the China demand remains very strong. As we said before, it's primarily driven towards mature and met critical notes. I mean that's what it's all for.
It's a bit too early to speculate exactly how the China demand is going to pan out because that's also dependent on how the demand for the rest of the world is going to pan out because as you know, from previous years, we have allocation questions, right?
So for a number of tools. we're still supply constrained. So there you have to determine where is the tool going. And that will only be known once you have a complete picture of all the demand on a global basis. So that's why it's too early to make specific predictions is it kind of going to be a bit up, is it going to be a bit down. But one thing is for sure, China will remain very strong in our numbers also in 2024.",242

So I think from that vantage point, I think there is no big impact on either the cash flow or the gross margin. Of course, the question is you prebuild, but then -- back to Peter's point. And Peter said what the -- in response to the question of the puts and takes from Mehdi on this year. Of course, we currently look at prebuild. It could be that some of those are pulled into 2024. So I would look at a prebuild more as an opportunity than as a threat to the gross margin.",137

And as you know very well, analysts, we are very good like extrapolating trends. So we were very skeptical about these targets of the [ EUR 500 million ] of EUV bookings.
Now looking this quarter with indeed this huge booking number in terms of EUV, which basically puts you in a much better position into 2025. And indeed, it's clearly supporting your comments 3 months ago. But I would like to know this Q4 orders, we know that it's very lumpy. It's always moving from 1 quarter to another very significantly.
To what extent Q4 orders is a pull-in effect? In other words, do you see still a healthy EUV activities? I don't expect the EUR 5.6 billion every quarter. I'm not saying that. But should we -- do you see already in Q1, the activity of EUV fairly healthy and in Q2? Or should we just expect Q4 as an exceptional and it will take a significant post? That's my first question.",210

Wennink,,Executives,30,"I think generally EUR 9.2 billion is pretty exceptional because it was the highest order intake forever. So that's -- you don't -- you're right, we would not expect to top that every quarter.
Now I think, yes, the analysts are very good and extrapolating trends. But I have to warn you that trends in EUV order intake in our business with a few customers might be a very tricky thing to do to actually try to extrapolate it, which is actually proven by the order intake in Q3 and in Q4. It's lumpy, as you said.
And it has to do with a couple of things. I mean, in Q4, also clearly, the -- as a part of the EUV order intake had to do with the obvious technology transitions needed in the DRAM space to support AI. That will continue.
But I think all in all, in 2025, when we look at a recovery of these -- of the cycle and have a full year recovery. On top of that, the new fabs. Yes, we need to see a healthy order intake for EUV in the first half of this year of 2024. Just like I said earlier, we have 12 to 18 months for a lead time, so that needs to happen. And I think this is what we need to see.
And then I don't think that Q4 -- yes, it was exceptionally high. It was a very good order intake. But for the good reasons. It's basically moving the EUV orders now into the 2025 delivery time frame, orders that we're now getting is not for 2024, it's for 2025. So that will have to continue and in my mind, will continue in the first half of 2024.
So yes, may not be EUR 9.2 billion again in Q1 2024. But yes, in the first half, we need to see healthy further order intake and to support our 2025 view. Absolutely.",327

And maybe a follow-up to the Memory migration. I mean, this quarter, what is really outstanding is the split of memory within EUV, which is like 50%, I mean, roughly, which is very high compared to history. So to support exactly the migration you are describing.
Now we know that the Memory market is -- has low utilization rate right now and is recovering, but still fairly low. So I would assume -- I mean, to which extent, given the low utilization, they can migrate more, they have -- it's many off-line tools so they can migrate, spend a lot of time on it.
And to which extent agitation grows, they will put the brakes on the migration? Do you see what I mean? I mean -- in other words, should we expect the memory as investing significantly right now, but then will slow down as the industry comes back? Or should we expect a fundamental line, growing line because you have a lot of wafers to migrate anyway? And therefore, we won't see so much lumpiness. Do you see what I mean?",184

Wennink,,Executives,32,"Not entirely, but I do believe that what is important to us as you look at these memory cycles as this is game of chicken. So it's -- you build the capacity, there's always big step-ups, the underlying growth pattern is also more regular.
So you have these times where you have overcapacity. I think that's just part of it today. We are going through this cycle. We just see the utilization rates of our memory tools going up. I think EUV is always in that sense, cash. You don't buy loosely extra EUV systems in dynamic space. That's always going to be the gating item.
Now if you then come to the conclusion that you need more EUV because DDR5 and HBM is where the external demand is, then there's not much to migrate. You just need more, so -- and I think that's on the back of a cyclical recovery because inventories are being consumed.
So that migration, having the space to do migration or that -- I don't see that. It might be available in the non-EUV space, but in the EUV space, that is actually scarce tool, which you don't have available in abundance, and that tool will be the first to be fully utilized.
So I don't know whether it's answering your question, but it's just -- I'm just trying to think of what you meant or what the other question meant. But I think the recovery in Memory is cyclical. And on top of that, I think we have the technology transition into DDR and into HBM. And that drives Memory. And I don't think it's going to be something that is very short lived, i.e., 1 or 2 quarters. This will continue.",289

Now having said that, there is no doubt in my mind now that the High-NA [indiscernible] of all our customers that are using EUV is the right choice from an economic point of view. We kept that corroborated now very clearly through our customer contacts, and that used to be a question some time ago.
But I think everything that we're currently seeing and also looking at alternative patterns of multi-patterning Low-NA EUV, High-NA is very clearly in -- very clearly the most cost-effective solution. I think that is also driven by the answer that Roger gave that is as we've had -- he said last year, we have double-digit orders in the order book, and as I said in every quarter, we comfortably add a couple of those. Those customers give us those orders because they do those calculations and they see this.
So yes, I can understand the question. I think our confidence that it's the most cost-effective solution, both in Memory and Logic, Logic and Memory has only gone up.",220

I just wonder, related to your point earlier that HBM and DDR5 could drive an upside to that 30% contribution to EUV volumes in 2025. Do you think there is upside to your potential demand capacity limit. You've got like 75, 80 units from HBM first or from others?",78

Wennink,,Executives,46,"That's a very good question. That's something that we need to consider very carefully. We have said our capacity buildout will be 90 EUV Low-NA systems, 20 High-NA whereby internally, we are looking at that number as a kind of a base number where we're investigating whether that number should be higher.
The question is whether that 90 is going to be enough. Now we have to realize, we are selling wafer capacity, which is not only a function of the number of units, but also a function of the productivity of those tools. Now we have a pretty aggressive road map for the productivity in terms of wafers per hour.
So it's a complex question that you're asking. But actually, we need to look at this especially against the math that we're seeing for little requirements in the area of AI, whether it's HBM or whether it is Logic, whether the number of units and the road map on productivity, which gives wafers because the combination is wafer capacity, whether that is sufficient.
That is a constant thing we need to look at, and that's going to be something that -- I think is going to be very central when we do our Capital Markets Day by the end of the year. I think we're going to give you -- it also gives us a bit of time to actually engage with our customers to really understand those requirements and translate that into units and productivity.
So good question, Didier. But I'll have to refer to the Capital Markets Day by the end of the year where we're going to be a bit more detail, but this is exactly what we are now looking at.",287

I'm just wondering if you can give us an update in terms of your -- from your point of view in speaking with the customers.

I think a good question, Andrew. I think the longer-term let's say, positions that customers have taken are pretty rock solid. I think they will happen. Now the question is about timing and timing could be a function of the things that you just mentioned. I mean is there enough capable resources or are there capable resources, people. Will permits and/or all the things that are necessary like energy and water will all be available on time. Those are, you could say, tactical and operational considerations that are always there.
Now we have examples where we have indeed delays because of the things that you just mentioned. We also have examples where things are spot on time. So it's really very dependent on the specific situation of a specific fab.
I think the intentions are very clear. We don't see any delay there. We could seek operational or delays that will push things back 6 months or 9 months that could happen. But generally, those fabs are there, those febs are there in the U.S., they're in Japan, they're in Taiwan, they're in Korea, they're in China, they're in Europe. I mean, we don't see any indication or any customer messaging to us that those things won't happen.
Yes, there could be some regional issues. But we also have some good examples that give you Japan, for instance. Things will happen on the dot. So that's will probably also like to happen in Germany. So it's -- these are things that will happen. And in other areas, there might be more problems with, like you mentioned it, water, energy, people building restrictions and stuff like that.

I think very easy answer that technology buys are dominant. Yes. So -- and they're also very much focused on the technology transition, so EUV. And were we surprised? I must be -- I say, yes, to some extent, we were surprised in the meetings we've had with customers and especially the Memory because we're leading-edge Memory customers. We were surprised about the technology requirements of -- for litho, EUV specifically and how it impacts how important it is for the rollout and the ramp of the memory solutions for AI. 
This is why we received more EUV orders than we anticipated because it was obvious in the detailed discussions and the reviews with our customers, that EUV is critical in that sense. And that was a bit of a surprise, that's a positive surprise. But that's what we learned. So yes, a surprise, yes...",146

So C.J., the revenue for 25, as you know at the Capital Markets Day, we expect 5 systems in revenue, and that's still the way we look at it. There will be more shipments, but it's a bit too early to say how exactly is the revenue recognition going to work is, as you know, we just shipped only the first modules of the first tool.
It's a bit early. But the 5% in revenue, that's still the way we look at it. In terms of the introduction of High-NA into Memory, I think that's consistent with what we had at an earlier question. We do see the time frame of Memory and Logic adoption more or less in sync. So to us, that is more or less the same time frame.",133

I mean there is this bear case on High-NA EUV. I mean when you look at your 2030 guidance, you look at you're guiding to about 20 High-NA EUV tools. But when you look that, if you remember, when you had guided the initial ramp of EUV, you had talked about 50-plus tools.
So is it that your guidance on High-NA EUV on 20 tools is a function of the throughput of the tool? Or is it a function on the adoption of the High-NA EUV into lithography -- into semiconductor production? Because there is this emerging case of that ASML itself is not so bullish on the adoption of High-NA EUV. And I have a quick follow-up.",130

Wennink,,Executives,81,"Well, it is the latter. It has nothing to do with the productivity of the tool. Although we will work on the productivity of the tool, which we always do to help our customers upgrade cost. But it's basically the adoption of High-NA litho because it's needed. It is needed in -- when you look at the customer road maps and the customer designs, that's what they need from a cost point of view.
So I don't know where the notion comes from that we at ASML are less bullish about High-NA or the adoption of High-NA, that's not the case. Okay. I mean -- I think on the contrary, we've seen in the interaction with our customers that all our customers now are convinced that High-NA is a more cost-effective solution as opposed to mobile patterning Low-NA. So yes, I don't know how to answer it differently.",148

I mean, in terms of your optimism, I mean, clearly, memory orders were much stronger than we expected in Q4, but there is all these new fabs, which are going to be built over the next 2, 3 years. I mean, and your customers would have given you what you need to ship to those fabs, et cetera.
But do you expect to sign up those Logic related? I mean, clearly, Memory is going to ramp. You've talked about it earlier. But on the Logic side, those orders will be signed up in the next few quarters for '25 and '26.",109

I think -- certainly for '25. I think when we look at our large Logic customers, there are still some large customers that still need to order, yes. So for 2025. It still has to come yes. Now of course, we're in discussions, this is clear. But I mean, you could also say that some are not in the order book that definitely need to be there if they want to have tools in 2025.

Wennink,,Executives,85,"I mean, we will get those orders before we start shipping. I mean, that's clear. In the past, what we used to do, but now that's true. Some time ago, that is the advantage of being in this industry very long, so you have a good memory.
In the past, we used to do this because we knew the customers who're having -- actually opened the fab, the pellicles were there, and we're still negotiating some terms and conditions. That was largely on deep UV, which the tool price is, of course, lower.
Now you won't do that when your tools are the EUR 200 million or even EUR 350 million. I mean that's where the financial risk on both sides is a bit higher. So you want to get a little bit more certainty. So that practice might still be true for some, let's say, I wouldn't even call it cheaper tools, calling on a $70 million or $80 million tool a cheaper tools is a bit of anomaly. But I mean -- but that's what happened at that time, but I don't think it EUVs, that's going to be the case.",193

Dassen,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first review the first quarter 2024 financial accomplishments and then provide guidance on the second quarter of 2024. 
Let me start with our first quarter accomplishments. Total net sales came in at EUR 5.3 billion, at the midpoint of guidance. We shipped 12 EUV systems and recognized EUR 1.8 billion revenue from 11 systems this quarter. Net sales -- net system sales of EUR 4 billion, which was driven by Logic at 63%, with the remaining 37% coming from Memory. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 1.3 billion as guided. 
Gross margin for the quarter came in at 51%, which is above our guidance, primarily driven by product mix, more immersion and EUV systems and some one-offs.  
On operating expenses, R&D expenses came in at EUR 1.032 billion, and SG&A expenses came in at EUR 273 million, both slightly lower than guided due to a shift in spend to later in the year. Net income in Q1 was EUR 1.2 billion, representing 23.1% of total net sales and resulting in an EPS of EUR 3.11.  
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 5.4 billion, which is lower than previous quarter. We ended Q1 with negative free cash flow, primarily driven by lower down payments and higher inventory relative to last quarter. 
In the current environment, as customers work to return to profitability and strengthen cash position, we continue to provide some support for our customers. The higher inventory is a result of the increased material intake, including High-NA as part of planned capacity ramp in preparation for stronger demand next year. 
Moving to the order book. Q1 net system bookings came in at EUR 3.6 billion, which is made up of EUR 656 million for EUV bookings and EUR 2.9 billion for non-EUV bookings. Net system bookings in the quarter were driven by Memory at 59% and Logic for the remaining 41% of the bookings.  
There is quite a bit of speculation around order numbers, so I will make a few comments here. In the past 6 months, we've had orders of almost EUR 13 billion, which is quite significant. As we said in the past, our order flow can be lumpy and may not be evenly distributed over the year. 
Although we don't guide orders, an order rate a bit over EUR 4 billion per quarter for the final 3 quarters of the year would provide full order coverage at the end of 2024 for a 2025 sales number that would be at the midpoint of our 2022 Investor Day scenarios. At the end of Q1 2024, we finished with a backlog of around EUR 38 billion. 
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the second quarter of 2024. We expect Q2 total net sales to be between EUR 5.7 billion and EUR 6.2 billion. We expect our Q2 Installed Base Management sales to be around EUR 1.4 billion. The relatively low first half of the year compared to the expected strong second half is in line with the expected industry recovery from the downturn.  
Gross margin for Q2 is expected to be between 50% and 51%. The expected R&D expenses for Q2 are around EUR 1.07 billion, and SG&A is expected to be around EUR 295 million. Our estimated 2024 annualized effective tax rate is expected to be between 16% and 17%. In Q1, ASML paid a quarterly interim dividend of EUR 1.45 per ordinary share.  
Recognizing the 3 interim dividends of EUR 1.45 per ordinary share paid in 2023 and 2024, this leads to a final dividend proposal to the Annual General Meeting of EUR 1.75 per ordinary share, which will result in a total dividend for the year 2023 of EUR 6.10 per ordinary share, which is a 5.2% increase compared to 2022. In Q1 2024, we purchased around 0.5 million shares for a total amount of around EUR 400 million.  
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Peter.",690

Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you Roger. As Roger has highlighted, a relatively slow Q1 start to the year is consistent with our guidance and expectations coming out of a downturn. Overall, semiconductor industry -- sorry, overall semiconductor inventory levels continue to improve, trending towards more healthy levels. We also see continued improvements in lithography to utilization at both Logic and Memory customers, all in line with the industry's continued recovery from the downturn.  
Looking at the market segments, we see a similar environment as communicated last quarter with demand momentum from AI-related applications. Memory demand is primarily driven by DRAM technology node transitions in support of advanced memories such as DDR5 and HBM. Logic customers continue to digest the significant capacity additions made over the last year -- over the past year.  
As many of you know, next week, April 24 is the General Meeting of Shareholders and my last effective working day at ASML.

And first of all, thank you for the last 10 years leading ASML and making it the great company we know today. I think some of our audience have been with you for the 40-plus quarters you led as CEO, but probably not many for the nearly 100 quarterly calls over your past 25 years in ASML. 
I am sure everyone on the call will miss you as much as we all will at ASML. I am myself very honored and privileged to succeed Peter, and I'm very much looking forward to working with all of you. 
As Peter mentioned, our view on the market segment for 2024 has not changed relative to what we stated last quarter. We expect Memory revenue growth this year, primarily driven by technology transition in support of advanced memory technology. We see lower Logic revenue this year relative to last year, as customers digest litho capacity installed over the past year.  
Turning to our businesses. For EUV, we continue to expect revenue growth in 2024. We plan to recognize revenue on a similar number of EUV 0.33 NA system as 2023. In addition, we expect revenue from 1 to 2 High-NA systems. 
On our 0.33 NA system, we shipped the first NXE:3800E this quarter for qualification of the customer. The NXE:3800E has the capability to deliver significant increase in performance, with a productivity of 220 wafer per hour, which is a 37% increase over the NXE:3600D in its final configuration.  
The NXE:3800E also brings imaging and overlay improvements, which will make it the future tool of choice for memory and logic advanced nodes. Those performance increases will deliver better value for our customers, including cost of ownership, and will translate into higher ASPs and improved margins for ASML.  
EUV customer plan to transition to the NXE:3800E this year. As a result, the majority of our Low-NA EUV shipments in the second half of the year will be this system.  
Regarding High-NA or 0.55 NA EUV, we shipped our first system to a customer, and this system is currently under installation. We started to ship the second system this month, and its installation is also about to start.  
During the SPIE industry conference in February, we announced first light on our High-NA system located in our joint ASML IMEC High-NA lab in Veldhoven. We have since achieved first images with a new record resolution below 10 nanometer and expect to start exposing wafers in the coming weeks.  
All High-NA customers will use the system for early access to process development. The customer interest for our system is high as this system will help both our Logic and Memory customers prepare for High-NA insertion into their road maps.  
Relative to 0.33 NA, the 0.55 NA system provide finer resolution, enabling an almost 3x increase in transistor density at a similar productivity in support of SAP 2-nanometer logic and SAP 10-nanometer DRAM nodes.  
We expect our non-EUV business to be down in 2024, primarily driven by lower emerging system sales relative to 2023. For our Installed Base business, based on our view today, we expect a similar level of revenue compared to last year. As the recovery becomes more clear this year, customer may look to upgrade their system in preparation for 2025, and this could provide future business opportunity this year.  
Our outlook for the full year is unchanged with similar revenue compared to 2023. In line with the industry continued recovery from the downturn, we expect a stronger second half relative to the first half of the year. We view 2024 as a transition year and continue to make investments this year, both in capacity ramp and in technology to be ready for the upturn in the cycle. 
Looking longer term. While there are still significant uncertainties, primarily driven by the micro environment, it appears we are passing through the bottom of this specific cycle, and we expect an industry recovery over the course of 2024. Based on the discussion with our customers and supporting our strong backlog, we expect 2025 to be a strong year, driven by a number of factors as mentioned last quarter.  
First, the secular growth driver in semiconductor end markets, which we have previously discussed, such as energy transition, electrification and AI. The expanding application space, along with increasing lithography and future technology nodes, drive demand for both advanced and mature nodes.  
Second, the industry expects to be in the middle of a cyclical upturn in 2025. And last, as mentioned earlier, we need to prepare for the significant number of new fabs that are being built across the globe, in some instances, clearly supported by several government incentive plans.

You both will be missed for sure. 
And then I guess my first question is for Roger. I understand bookings can be lumpy, but the EUV orders also done quite a lot in the March [ quarter ]. And you said that you need to hit over EUR 4 billion run rate to hit the midpoint of calendar '25.  
But I'm just kind of curious, there is an expectation that you should be better than midpoint of next [indiscernible]. Do you really need EUV orders to really meet those calendar '25 outlook? And where do you think that's going to come from mainly? Is it the foundry logic vertical? And also just along the same path, how much of your memory bookings was from China? And then I have a follow-up.",147

Many questions in one question, Krish. Very well done. I'll try and answer them as best as I can. Yes, Krish, I think you're absolutely right in our conclusion that, indeed, order intake is very lumpy. And I think that's what we've seen in the past, and we have been saying that for many, many years. We said it last time when the orders came in very high. We say it today when -- from the vantage point of some, the orders come in pretty low.  
And therefore, if you look at the past 6 months combined, you're looking at EUR 13 billion, which is EUR 6.5 billion per quarter, which we still continue -- we still believe it's pretty significant. When I talk about the EUR 4 billion that we need in order to get to the midpoint of next year, I'm indeed talking about everything.  
So of course, that also includes EUV. And I think as many of you have probably recognized, if you look at the intake in the past couple of quarters and also in the past quarter, it's pretty clear that there's a few usual suspects absent in the order intake. And I think that's pretty clear, right?  
So if we look at the plans of some of our large customers, and you talk about foundry, foundry indeed does come to mind in this discussion. If you look at the plans and the announced plans of some of our larger customers, it's pretty clear that in the next couple of quarters, significant orders need to come in. So -- and part of the EUR 4 billion that you should see in order to get to this midpoint indeed have to include the orders from those customers.  
So again, the midpoint, does that mean that now all of a sudden, we're guiding midpoint? No, we're not. As Peter has very clearly said it on previous calls, if we look at 2025, we're looking at a significant uptick. We're not looking at the low end of the scenarios that we provided back in 2022. But we're not saying now you need to look at the midpoint of the guidance.  
We just give you the math that is required in order to get to the midpoint of the guidance with our expectation of a very strong recovery into 2025 has by no means changed. 
In terms of your questions on memory and particularly then on China, Krish, as you know, we typically will not disclose the geographic distribution of our order intake. Of course, there is, I would say, a healthy part in the order intake that is related to China. But it's not like that the order intake is distributed over the globe with a very high -- so the very high concentration that you saw in the sales for Q1, you don't see that back in the order intake. So the order intake is more distributed geographically than what you would see in the sales for Q1.",505

That was directly the consequence of the fact that we realized that this year, we will probably not get licenses to ship the latest generation of immersion. That was what that 10% to 15% comment was related to.

Can you talk about the China business trend over the recent quarter, please? Because China has been really strong, and there has been always concern that China may actually go to capacity by adjusting period in this year or later this year. Do you have any comment on China trends, please? Then I have a follow-up.",63
388904.0,"ASML Holding N.V., Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2024",2024-04-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3626.0,3086802.0,111801841.0,Answer,R.J.M. Dassen,,Executives,14,"Yes. I mean, China, relatively speaking, is high. But if you look at absolute numbers, you would recognize that China is actually lower in Q1 than it was in Q4 of last year, right? So -- because if you do the math, then China was at EUR 1.9 billion in this quarter. It was at EUR 2.2 billion last quarter.  
So I think from that vantage point, it's gone down a bit, but it's still strong. And the reason that China is strong, both in absolute terms and in relative terms, is also because the rest of the world, the demand is -- or at least the sales and the shipments in Q1 were relatively low, which was no surprise. I think it's very much in sync with our perspective on a market that is in recovery.  
And market being in recovery means that customers are first driving up the utilization of their tools, which is exactly what they're doing, and we noticed that. And if the utilization comes to a certain point, then they will start -- they will order, and they will require shipment. 
And that's exactly why we've also said on the call that we believe that we're going to see momentum building up in the course of this year with a much stronger second half, as Peter also just said, a much stronger second half than the first half.  
So in terms of trends in China, strong first quarter for sure, but not a record quarter, but a strong quarter. We expect China to continue to be strong this year. And obviously, you also -- to the -- also, you have to see that in relation to the rest of the world that we believe is going to recover.  
We've also said on previous calls, and I just want to reiterate that, that if you look at the demand for China, the demand in China continues to be strong. And that is related, as we've said before, to the fact that the demand for mature technology continues to be strong.  
And I just point out what we said at the Capital Markets Day in 2022. Capital Markets Day 2022, we said we believe every single year between '22 and 2030, we believe 380,000 wafer starts and capacity needs to be added to mature. And if we look at what has happened last year, what has been added in terms of that, both in China and in the rest of the world, it's actually below that number.  
So yes, China is strong. And of course, it's not just mature, but mature is a very significant part of what China has added -- is adding. Yes, China is strong, but China is strong because they're adding capacity that we believe the world needs. And yes, as a result of this, China's share and global market share over the years become larger than it is today. 
Their self-sufficiency will increase in comparison to today. But we believe that what China is adding today in terms of mature capacity is rational and is in line with the -- with our expectation of what capacity and mature needs to be added in order to get to what the world needs in the second half of this decade.",546

And I have a follow-up on the EUV and 2-nanometer, 3-nanometer area, please. So you are expecting some massive order from front-end logic customers. Can you share, is that for 3-nanometer or 2-nanometer? And what is the level of EUV kind of layer count between those 2? 
Because I do understand that, potentially, you can have some usage. So that may impact some 2-nanometer incremental demand because some 3-nanometer can be migrated or reused for 2.",77

So this is Christophe here. So maybe on your first question, so I think we mentioned a few times now that customers were still -- logic customer, foundry customers were still digesting. So some of the capacity they had put in place, and we were then referring to 3- and 5-nanometer.  
When we look for the 2-nanometer capacity still have to come. And I think, as you mostly are aware of, we expect the ramp for that technology to start sometime next year. So I think this will be the next most probably wave of EUV order.  
And this is also back to the comment Roger made in answer to the first question. So we are going to now focus when it comes to EUV and logic foundry mostly to 2-nanometer order intake, which, as Roger said, should come in the next few months.  
On the number of players, so no change there. I think we mentioned in the past that the layer -- EUV layer for 2-nanometer is very similar to what we had on 3-nanometer because 2-nanometer is mostly a device transition. As you know, most customer, logic foundry customer will transition to gate-all-around, which is, I would say, quite a complex move. 
And as a result, the focus of the change is on that. So all the expectation we have in terms of EUV layer on 2-nanometer are not different from the one we have shared with you for quite a few months already now.",249

Dassen,,Executives,21,"Well, I mean, that would be a bit opportunistic on their side. And I like to think of the relationship that we have with our customers as much more one of partnership than one of transactional behaviors. So no, I don't think that necessarily has an impact.  
Of course, we said in previous calls, in order to get as many -- create as many degrees of flexibility that we have for next year that we will do some prebuilding. But of course, we do that in very close interaction with customers, understanding what they need.  
And I think that's a big distinction that I think you need to draw. I mean, on the one hand, we're having very intense interactions with customers to understand what they need, and then you have PO. And actually, the PO process, as you probably will appreciate, given the amounts that we're talking about these days are pretty, call it, bureaucratic and formal processes where there is a lot of governance necessary in order to get there. That gets you to the lumpiness.  
But in the meantime, we have a pretty good understanding based on our interactions with customers what they really need. So that's I think -- it's the interaction with the customers. It's the comfort that we get based on those conversations that ultimately drives our plans for the year. That ultimately drives our plans for prebuilding much more so than whether or not an order is going to be received or not.",250

And perhaps speaking from experience over the last 25 years, we are a transparent company. So it also means that we will build inventory or work to prepare because our lead times are just so long. And we inform you, as our shareholders, on this. And of course, customers hear this, and then we're in the midst of negotiations on final orders and, let's say, on a commercial basis, which, of course, if you put the 2 things together, it might be that those orders take a little bit longer, which is quite normal.  
So I think this is what we've seen before, and we've seen it again. But again, as Roger said earlier, if you believe 2025, and you know that if you want to buy an EUV tool, there's only one phone number that you can actually dial, then this will happen. But this is just where we are in terms of our customers knowing that we're building because we want to make sure that we can ship to them. And we have long lead times, and their commercial efforts on the POs that will come.",189

And your next question comes from the line of Francois Bouvignies from UBS.,21
388904.0,"ASML Holding N.V., Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2024",2024-04-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3626.0,3086802.0,111801853.0,Question,Francois-Xavier Bouvignies,,Analysts,26,"I mean, first of all, Peter, thank you a lot. You will be missed definitely in the investor community, and thank you for the dialogue. That was very helpful, and I look forward to work with as well more with Christophe. 
So the first question I had is a bit on the lead times. So you mentioned that the buildup of inventory doesn't impact so much the lead times if I tried to read correctly. And when you said last quarter, you said that you have 12 months or more than 12 months lead time now on EUV. 
Now when you look at 2025 targets or ranges, you need to have 70 more EUV tools to get to this mid- to high end. And according to my calculation, have around 30 EUV tools in the backlog for next year. So -- which means that you would need more than 40 EUV tools still to satisfy your revenues for 2025. 
So I'm just surprised the amount of EUV tools you need and with the 12 months more lead times, I would think it's a very dangerous game for your customers to wait into the last moment. So can you maybe help us clarify the fact that you probably need orders significantly in a short period of time and reconcile with the fact that you said in the next 3 quarters, you need more than EUR 4 billion? But I mean, it's going to be too late if it's Q3 or Q4 for EUV to get it delivered in '25, if you see what I mean.",264

Francois, but it's a slightly different question, but essentially, the question that we were just looking at, right? It's the same question that Joe was said -- that Joe was raising to a large extent. And I can just reiterate what I said there. 
Of course, with customers, we have an ongoing dialogue on what they need. And then Peter said it, then there is a bureaucratic process, and there is some negotiation going on that will ultimately lead to the order being made and being translated into a PO that, as you also know these days, comes with the obligation to pay money. And that's probably part of the reason why customers -- why some customers are postponing the placement of the order a little bit as well. 
But the reality is that we know quite well what customers want and customers know it as well. So it's just a matter of those 2 worlds coming together and then ultimately needing to appeal. 
Is it a dangerous game on their side? Is it a dangerous game on our side? I don't think so. I mean, as long as we have a very open dialogue with one another, I'm pretty sure that in the foreseeable future, you will see the translation of what we know is from demand into orders. I'm quite confident with that.",226

And maybe my follow-up is on High-NA. I mean, you see -- we saw a couple of milestone in the last few quarters. Christophe, you talked about the productivity -- I mean, the density improvement. 
When we think about the lead times for High-NA, what is it today? And if we assume mass production in, let's say, '26, '27, should we expect some uptick in terms of orders for this maybe in the next few quarters? And what's the key milestone you are still waiting for from a product point of view, technical point of view to drive more adoption?",102
388904.0,"ASML Holding N.V., Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2024",2024-04-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3626.0,3086802.0,111801857.0,Answer,Christophe Fouquet,,Executives,30,"Well, so I think a few key milestones. So the first one, I think we've been talking about it for a few quarter is the fact that customers have been committing to EUV High-NA with double-digit basically units in our backlog. And they have done that without even seeing one image from the tool. So I think this shows a bit the level of commitment and trust they have in our ability to bring new technology. 
Now I mentioned the first image, 10-nanometer -- less than 10-nanometer resolution image. This is a huge milestone for both our customer and ASML because this single image prove that the technology we have been developing for many, many years is working. And you cannot imagine how welcome that milestone was by both our customers and ourselves. That's very, very important. 
Now what's going to happen next is since we can soon expose wafer, every customer are going to come to see us here to get access to the tool we have in our lab and start to expose their own reticle, so that they can decide for themselves exactly how to use the tool. And we expect that this work will lead, at some point to, I would say, the next set of decision on High-NA. 
So what's happened in the lab in the next few months, the work we'll be doing with all our customers, and I stress again all our customer, I think, is most probably the most exciting milestone to come. And this will really help one to understand basically what's next for High-NA. 
But I cannot stress enough on, I would say, how happy and excited that we've been able to generate those first images. When you look at the undertaking of a technology like High-NA, for us, for our customers, this is a very, very important achievement. And again, the next few months, we'll build on that.",319

Pleasure working with you. And maybe if I could direct the last question for you here at ASML given your long experience. 
As you look at the strong secular trends led by high-performance compute, historically, at the leading edge, it was led by Apple and Huawei, and then only Apple post the embargo. 
But now given the performance power, cost requirement, how are you seeing kind of the trends on the high-performance compute side moving closer and closer to kind of being the pipe cleaner for the bleeding edge? And how does that impact your thinking of what kind of longer-term growth for leading-edge wafers will look like?",112

Wennink,,Executives,33,"Well, I think it's two questions. I'll answer the second one. You're basically saying what will drive leading-edge, high-performance compute. But you're absolutely right. I mean, when you think about high-performance compute, and especially in the context of AI, and I've said this many, many times before, AI is driven by massive amounts of data and about also understanding the correlation between those data elements and then overlaying that with smart software. 
But -- and I also believe, it's actually what I'm seeing and what I'm hearing is that IoT in the industrial space will actually be in -- will be an area where we will see a lot of AI applications. 
Well, in order to collect all that data, you need sensors because you've got all kinds of examples, whether it's the car or whether it's life science, medical equipment, it's about sensing, and that is really the domain of mainstream semiconductors. 
I don't like the word mature. Like it's something which is old fashioned that you don't need it. It is mainstream, and it's critical in the -- I would say, in the, I would call it, amalgamation of mainstream semiconductors and, I would call, advanced semiconductors. 
And this is also why you cannot distinguish the growth of one against the other. I mean, you need both. And I think what will -- what you will see is that the growth of the industry, and especially high performance compute, will be driven by the value that is going to be created. 
Yes. Cost is a significant issue, but Moore's law is a vehicle of economics. And when you create more value of the transistor, the new transistor, the next-generation transistor then -- at cost, then you're going to grow. And when you think about AI, I mean, some of these examples, and especially in the software space where you see productivity, just the calculated productivity advantages of 30% to 50%, then the value of the next-generation transistor will be huge. 
Now if you ask me, ""Peter, what's going to be the next killer application?"" I'm going to give you the same answer as I gave you over the last 25 years, and it's, ""I have no clue."" But what I do know is that when the value of that next-generation transistor whether it's -- and it's particularly driven by high-performance compute, it's energy-efficient performance. 
If we bring that to life, and we'll bring it to life together with our customers because we have High-NA, and potentially Hyper-NA, then the, I would say, amalgamated consolidated demand for also mainstream semiconductors will go up. 
So this is what I believe, and this is what I see when I talk to customers. And I talk to actually users of the value in the space. And this is why I'm so confident about the long-term future. And this is all connected. So you cannot distinguish the two.",485

And Roger, a follow-up question on your backlog comment around the EUR 4 billion plus required to hit the midpoint over the next 3 quarters. I guess, as part of that, if you had to think about the higher end of the range, I think that would add 2 plus per quarter. 
And then also, if I look at your backlog today, excluding High-NA, it's still sitting at roughly 18 months. And so, obviously, I would expect your backlog exiting '24 to have tools that will be shipped in '26. So is EUR 4 billion the right number we should be thinking about for the next 3 quarters? Or should be -- should it be significantly higher?",119

Dassen,,Executives,35,"So if you're looking at the midpoint, it is EUR 4 billion, and you shouldn't underestimate what we've already, in that calculation, taken out for the post-'25 period. And I'm sure you're all going to do the math, right, because it's not all that difficult to do the math. 
And then you're probably going to figure out that, that's a pretty healthy number and probably a number that maybe exceeds a little bit what you currently have in your models in terms of High-NA, and that's okay. But that's a calculation that I'll leave up to you to make. 
But that has clearly been recognized in our calculation. So we've taken out whatever is for '25, and our focus of the EUR 4 billion really is what pertains to 2025. 
And to your question, C.J., if you're looking at the high end of the range, there's a EUR 5 billion delta last I saw between 35 and 40. And 5 divided by 3 gets you to 1.7, right? So that's it. So then there would be 1.7 needed more in order to get to the high end of the -- of that bandwidth at the beginning of the year.",200

I have one quick question and then a follow-up. The first is on China services. We've seen a number of these articles talking about U.S. government asking the Dutch government to prevent servicing of certain aspects of the installed base in China. I had a lot of investor questions on this. 
I just wondered if you could provide any perspective on potential implications. Given especially that tools don't work without services, is it fair to assume any ban would likely not encompass all China services revenues? 
And secondly, on electrification, you mentioned electrification could be a potential driver of litho demand. We've seen a number of news articles talking about the need for technology to help deal with strong EV-driven power needs in the grid as well as AI server-driven demand. So wondered if you could provide some context on what this means for longer-term litho demand.",155

I think on the China services, yes, we're probably reading the same articles. So yes, that has been a discussion between the 2 governments, and let it be a discussion between the 2 governments. 
I mean, of course, we are providing input. We're providing input of the size of the -- and the type of services. And I think it's all being taken into consideration to determine in the end what the real problem is. 
And I think that is something which governments will need to discuss because, probably, it's all going to be in their discussion on what they call the national security interest. So we just provide them with the information. And I think, currently, we have -- there's nothing that stops us servicing the installed base in China today. 
On the electrification, I think we've said this many times when we talked about the growth of the industry, and it also refers back to the question that C.J. asked, yes, the grid, the electrification, the builder of the grid, the investments in renewable energy and the investments in a smart grid will be a significant driver, is a significant driver for mainstream semiconductors. 
So if that is indeed true, electrification, when you think about the vehicle, is also about mainstream semiconductors and advanced semiconductors. So yes, I mean, this is not a requirement or a request of one part of an industry. It's all connected. 
So you are indeed correct. I think this is what people now start to realize that if we want to invest in renewable energy, that -- take the Netherlands for -- as a particular example, there's a significant investment in solar panels and in wind, which actually means that we need to upgrade the grid. And the grid needs to be smart because there's not going to be a constant supply of those electrons. So that needs to be managed. 
So it's a complete overhaul of directive grid needed. Yes, that's absolutely true. And this is why we need more mainstream semiconductors. And we need a lot more of them. And Roger pointed out, we said at the Capital Markets Day 2022, 380,000 wafer starts per year need to be added. 
Well, we didn't do that last year. We were lower than that. So we're running behind our own model. So I'm happy that around the world, investments in mainstream semiconductors take place because we need them.",406

It's in the storage because that's another one, right? You need the electricity at a point in time which is not being generated, and it's in the usage, like the EVs. So it's everywhere. And therefore, this was a very significant part, as Peter just said, of the 380,000 that we talked about. 
Of course, we'll review this again when November comes. But I think the world is clearly appreciating a little bit better by now how significant the electrification is and what it does for the demand for mature chips.",115

Obviously, you're expecting an acceleration in revenue. Can you give some detail on what you expect to lead that revenue growth in the second half? 
And specifically on China, you characterized that as strong right now. Do you expect that to remain strong as you go into the second half?",64

So the second half, I think this is very much in line with the orders that we have today because we're fully booked for the year. So the shipment plans that we have, and this is across the board. So this is for some of the fab openings and some of the ramps that I think all of you are aware, that have been scheduled for 2024, both in Logic and in Memory. So this really is across the board. 
As you know, there is -- we are fairly conservative, I would say, on the Installed Base business, right? So the Installed Base business in the second half is only a little bit more than what we have in the first half. And I think that's still potential that I think there is for the year that we see an uptick in that number, particularly as it relates to the potential for upgrades in the second half of the year. But it really is very much, I would say, across the board. 
And in terms of China, I think we already said that. We expect China to continue to be quite strong. Of course, it depends a little bit on the sales also to the rest of the world. There are still some tools where we are supply constrained. 
So there -- the demand composition could be such that there are some limitations to what we can ship to China. But normally, as we said, the demand for China is very strong. So all the reasons to expect the strong sales into China to continue for the rest of the year as well.",274

And that -- if that is sustained as we expect, as the market expects, as our customers expect, then you should see -- in the second half of this year, you should see that memory not just, let's say, technology transition, but it's also really the addition of this. 
So that's, I think, very much in line with the current developments that we see in the market. So in the second half -- and one of the drivers why indeed you see this step up from the second half to the first half indeed is that you will see additional building of the capacity in the memory market.",135

And Christophe, hope to see you more often in the U.S. 
Back to my question, wanted to understand 2 things. First, what is the mix of backlog from -- attributed to China, excluding EUV? 
And then second question, Roger, can you update us on the NXE:3800E? How is the throughput with the early system shipment in the first half? And how is it going to improve in the second half?",95

So nice try, Mehdi. On China, we're not disclosing that.  We're not disclosing the composition of the backlog in a geographic sense. So we said before at some point that the China, we said at once that China was a little bit over 20% in the backlog, and that -- as a result of that, no one should be surprised that the sales is around that percentage. That's not dramatically changed. 
So I think we're still in that ballpark, but we're not going to be very specific on that. But at least that gives you a bit of a ballpark. 
As we said on the introduction of the 3800, we said before that this will come in full configuration in a couple of months' time. So in the second half, we'll get it to the 220 wafers per hour. Very quickly, it will get to 195. So it's several steps. So first, very rapidly getting it to 195 wafers per hour. 
And then the tools that are going to leave the factory somewhere in the second half -- or early in the second half of this year will be 220. And the ones that are still at 195 will get an upgrade, such that, I would say, early in next year, you'll see the entire fleet being at 220 wafer square per hour. That's the plan, Mehdi.",228

And if Martin is listening, thank you so much for everything, really. It's been an amazing privilege for me to cover the company for the last 24 years. And congratulations also to Christophe for the promotion to CEO job. 
I've got one question on EUV and DRAM, if I may. The question is really, first of all, can you tell us roughly speaking of your wafer capacity -- of the wafer capacity deployed in the industry, how much a transition to EUV yet? And how much do you think that could evolve to the industry adopt EUV for DDR5 and HBM? 
And then related to that, I think in the past, you had mentioned that over the longer term, I think 2030 was a sort of time frame, the EUV unit breakdown could be 70-30 between Logic and Memory or DRAM. Do you think that the layer count increase we see with HBM could drive that to maybe a 50-50 sort of split over the course of the next 5 or 10 years?",177

So I think your question about the exact capacity is quite difficult to answer. I don't think we have all the elements to do that. 
What I can share with you is the trend we see on DRAM, basically, for EUV, where our customer road map basically is calling for an increased node on node of the number of EUV layers. And I think we see that basically already for a few nodes. And that, I think, is with the current visibility of the road map we have from our customers. So we see basically the number of layers continue to increase to execute on the DRAM road map. 
The high bandwidth memory doesn't change that dramatically because the device itself is very similar. What is changing is the ratio between area and logic, mostly, which typically call for larger die and, therefore, more wafer capacity needs. So there, you have a translation in volume, but that's not related to the number of EUV layer. That's more related to the number of wafer you will need to do a high-bandwidth memory. 
And there, again, I think Roger mentioned it before, we're still trying. I think our customers are also still trying to understand exactly what will be the effect of high-bandwidth memory on the overall capacity needs for DRAM in the -- well, in the next few months. 
But I think that the jury is still out on that. And we're working very hard on our side to try to understand that with the idea that when we come to all of you on November 14, we understand that a bit more. But I think it's work in progress also on our customer side.",288

Dassen,,Executives,1,"Net sales for the quarter came in at EUR 5.3 billion, included in there EUR 1.3 billion for Installed Base business. That EUR 5.3 billion was smack in the middle of the guidance that we provided last quarter.
As to gross margin, that came in at 51%, 51% was better than what we guided. A couple of reasons. First, there were some mix effects. There was a bit more immersion and EUV in there in comparison to the dry business. There were also some one-off effects in there that drove up the gross margin to 51%. Net income for the quarter at EUR 1.2 billion.
In terms of order intake, the order intake came in at EUR 3.6 billion, included in there EUR 656 million for EUV. There's been quite some speculation, I have to say, around the order intake for ASML. So it's maybe good to make a few comments on the order intake and also how people might want to look at that on a go-forward basis.
So first off, I think it's important to recognize that the order intake over the past 6 months. So if you take the Q4 and the Q1 order intake together, you're looking at nearly EUR 13 billion, which I think is a pretty significant number.
I think people have recognized by now that the order intake process is typically quite lumpy. But I think it's good to also look a little bit at what do we need in order to get to the different scenarios that have been articulated for 2025.
So maybe bring back to people's mind in the Investor Day for 2022. We were looking at different scenarios for revenue for 2025. And there was a bandwidth between EUR 30 billion and EUR 40 billion for the 2025 net sales. And then if you try to look at it from that vantage point, if you try to look at the backlog that we have today, the question then is if you want to get, let's say, to the midpoint of that bandwidth that we provided, so the EUR 35 billion, what do you still need? 
So if you look at, what's in the backlog today for '24, for '25, beyond '25, then in the next 3 quarters, we would need a little bit over EUR 4 billion for the 3 quarters to come in order to, at the beginning of 2025, be fully booked for that midpoint.",409

Dassen,,Executives,5,"Essentially, the way we look at 2024 has not changed. So as we said last time, we look at 2024 very much as a transition year. In terms of revenue, that means that we would be looking at revenue for '24 which is similar to the revenue that we had for 2023.
But we're really looking at that as a transition year in which the momentum is building up during the year. So that means a stronger second half than the first half and also really gearing up towards what we think is going to be a strong year of 2025.
And that is really backed up, I think, by some of the industry trends as we see them today. So we do see the utilization of our tools, both for Memory customers and for Logic customers, further improving. We do see that the inventory, particularly downstream inventory, is being navigated quite nicely and is being driven down to what we would see as normal levels.
So all of that, I think, is very much in sync with our expectation that we will see recovery for the industry in 2024. And that, as I mentioned, we're building up for a stronger year in 2025. And that means for us building a capacity and preparing for that ramp.",217

I think for '24, I would say, margin, we set a little bit lower than the gross margin that we had in 2023. I would still be looking at that. I would still look at that similarly. We gave the different puts and takes to the gross margin for this year on the last quarter. 
I would still look at that in a similar vein. I think important to recognize still that the gross margin for 2025, which would mean a pretty significant step-up from the gross margin this year, that we still think about that the way we've mentioned that during the Capital Markets Day in 2022, which is somewhere between 54% and 56%. So a big step-up. Why is that? Just reiterating the key points there. First off, the lion's share of our EUV tools, Low-NA EUV tools by 2025 will be 3800s, and that will come with a better ASP and also a better gross margin. 
Also on the Installed Base business, we believe 2025 is going to be a stronger year. First off, because we continue to improve the gross margin that we have on service for EUV, but also because we believe that with the recovery in the market as we see it, we believe that the update -- the upgrade business in 2025 will be better than what we've seen so far. 
High-NA, we'll be looking at higher volumes for High-NA, so that will give us better fixed cost coverage for High-NA. We'll also look at the introduction in terms of revenue for the 5200, which also will come with a better gross margin profile.
And very importantly, as you know, we're very much investing this year in the ramp, right, the ramp for the second half, but definitely also for the ramp in 2025, and that means that we're already hiring people, training people in the factory, in the field.
The revenue of that and the benefit of that will yield particularly in 2025. So in 2025, really -- we will really utilize the higher capacity that we've been building over the past couple of quarters. And all of those factors combined will lead to this step-up in gross margin to the 54% to 56% that we've been indicating in 2022.",379

So I would say, pretty exciting both for Low-NA and for High-NA. If we look at Low-NA first off, in Q1, we shipped the first 3800 Low-NA machine to a customer for qualification purposes. As we mentioned before, it's a tool that comes with significant improvements in its specification.
So most notably, I would say, on the throughput side that we will see an increase in throughput from 160 wafers per hour to 220 wafers per hour in final configuration. So that's a 37.5% increase in productivity. So that's a big deal. But it also comes with better overlay. It comes with better imaging. So all in all, clearly a tool that will drive value for the customer in a big way. 
So it will drive down the cost of ownership for the customers. And that also means that there is quite some customer interest in the tool. So you will also gradually see there that the second half of this year. But also, as I mentioned, in next year that the 3800 will become a more and more significant part of the EUV sales.
So -- and with the value that obviously this tool is driving for the customer, also comes a better ASP for us and also a better gross margin for us. So that's the story, I would say, on Low-NA. 
On High-NA, big moment obviously, that we could report in Q4 because that's when we started shipping the first modules of the High-NA tool to its initial customer. So that system, we're now in the process of installing.
We actually just very recently also started shipping the second tool -- the second High-NA tool to a customer. So I think really good progress on that front. At the SPIE conference in February, we could actually report first light, which was a big moment for everyone engaged that we were able to report that. And we also see the first images coming from the High-NA tool.
So all in all, I think very much on track and good progress. The industry is really excited around High-NA and for very good reasons because if you look at the specifications of the High-NA tool, it will provide a transistor density that actually is 3x of the transistor density that you will have with low-NA tool.
So it's a really big step-up. And if you combine that, as we do, with similar productivity on the High-NA tool, as you have it for a Low-NA tool, it's very clear the value that it brings to customers. So for customers, there's a lot of interest in High-NA.
As you probably know, we have this joint ASML-Imec lab here in Veldhoven -- High-NA lab here in Veldhoven, where customers are working with the tool. Next couple of weeks, we hope to really see the first wafers being exposed with that tool, and that's again a big moment for us because that means that our customers can really experience the tool, can understand how they are going to insert that tool into their road map.
So big interest from customers in working with this tool in the lab. And obviously, something that is further going to drive up the adoption of High-NA in the production road map for our customers.",547

Dassen,,Executives,11,"Absolutely. So policy hasn't changed. And start sounding like a broken record here, but we first use the cash that is generated to support the business and then whatever is left will be distributed back to shareholders. 
And when you talk about what is needed in the business, in the current circumstances that we're looking at for customers, you really see customers working their way back to profitability, working their way back to higher cash levels.
In that circumstance, we still support customers just as we did last year. So that is still going on. And on the other hand, as I mentioned, we're looking at momentum really being increased over the quarters to come, leading up to what we think is going to be a very strong 2025. 
And that momentum being built up, obviously also means that we're currently taking in quite a bit of inventory, quite a bit of material in order to be able to accommodate that ramp going forward. So that obviously puts pressure on the free cash flow. It has clearly put pressure on the free cash flow in the first quarter. Pretty sure that, that will yield and that investment will yield in the period to come.
On the dividend side, we paid EUR 1.45 per share in interim dividend in the last quarter. So we have proposed a final dividend of EUR 1.75 to the AGM. And if you add it all up, so 3x EUR 1.45 plus the EUR 1.75 final means a total dividend for 2023 of EUR 6.10 per ordinary share. And finally, in terms of share buyback, we've executed share buybacks in the past quarter of around EUR 400 million.",282

Dassen,,Executives,13,"So yes, I mean, there are still some uncertainties, I would say, primarily macro uncertainties. That's still clearly there. But as I mentioned before, if you look at the trends in the industry, if you look at -- and I'm kind of talking about the cyclicality trends in the industry. So like the utilization going up, inventory downstream being managed to more normal levels. I think it's pretty clear that the industry is in its upturn and therefore we do believe that by 2024, we're going to see recovery, clearly, a recovery of the industry.
So if I then fast forward to 2025, then what do we find ourselves in? Well, first off, I think we will find ourselves in 2025 in the midst of the upturn. So that's a positive.
Second, and we've talked about that many, many times, but the secular trends are really strong. I mean, if you look at AI, if you look at electrification, if you look at the energy transition, it's all very strong, very positive momentum behind it. So the secular trends are very, very strong. And that is also something that I think will yield in 2025. 
And then finally, if you just look at all the fab openings that have been indicated by our customers, the recent news on positive outcomes of CHIPS Act money allocation, I mean all of that is very strong, very supportive, I think, for new fab openings across the globe. 
And I think by 2025, you will see all 3 of those coming together: new fab openings, strong secular trends and the industry in the midst of its upturn. So that's why we're doing what we're doing, which is really preparing for that ramp, for that momentum that we see being built up.
And that's also the reason why also, not just for 2025, but also beyond that, we're having all these building plans. We are expanding our capacity to the 90 EUV tools of Low-NA, to the 600 DPV tools and to the midterm, 20 High-NA tools. So we're building that capacity because we believe it's needed, and we believe it's needed for what we think is going to be a very bright future for this industry altogether and for ASML in particular. 
And just comparing notes on that is something that I very much look forward to that. As you know, we have a Capital Markets Day planned by November of 2024, the 14th of November. So we look forward to sharing our view on how the market is going to develop there, and really look forward to seeing all of you there.",439

We published our Q2 results today, and I would like to take the opportunity to discuss this with you in more detail. 
Q2 2024 was a good quarter. Our second quarter sales are just over EUR 6.2 billion. That's at the high end of our guidance, primarily driven by more immersion system sales. Our Installed Base Management came in at EUR 1.48 billion. This is slightly higher than guided, driven by increased service revenue. Our gross margin for Q2 is 51.5%, above our guidance. This is primarily driven by the product mix, more immersion systems. Net income for the quarter was EUR 1.6 billion. Our net bookings came in at EUR 5.6 billion, of which EUR 2.5 billion in EUV system. At the end of Q2, ASML had a backlog of around EUR 39 billion.
Now I will talk about the outlook for the third quarter and the full year, and I will give you our guidance for Q3. In Q3, we expect total net sales to be between EUR 6.7 billion and EUR 7.3 billion. We expect our Q3 Installed Base Management revenue to be around EUR 1.4 billion. For the third quarter, we expect a gross margin between 50% and 51%. 
Our outlook for the full year 2024 has not changed. We expect revenue similar to last year. As indicated before, and based on our current guidance, the second half of the year is expected to be significantly higher than the first half. This is in line with the industry's continued recovery from the downturn. 
Our guidance on market segment is similar to what we have stated in previous quarters. We expect Logic revenue to be slightly lower in 2024 compared to 2023, as customers digest the capacity added in 2023. For Memory, we currently see revenue growth in 2024 compared to 2023. This is primarily driven by DRAM technology node transition in support of advanced Memory such as DDR5 and High Bandwidth Memory. 
Our Installed Base business is expected to be flat relative to 2023. As we have said before, 2024 is a transition year. We continue to make investments both in capacity ramp and technology to be ready for the expected strong demand in 2025. Based on the different levers discussed in the past 2 quarters and the net impact on margin, we still expect a slightly lower gross margin in 2024 compared to 2023. 
Now I also want to share with you some important update about our EUV technology. First of all, 0.33 NA systems. We have shipped additional NXE:3800E system this quarter, and we are continuing to ramp as planned. As customers transition to the 3800E this year, we expect the majority of shipments in the second half of the year to be 3800E. 
Regarding High NA or our 0.55 NA system, we have shipped the second system this quarter and our first system is running qualification wafer at a customer. The second system is also now under installation, and this is progressing well. 
Our customer interest for High NA is high. They are using already our system in the joint ASML-imec High NA in Veldhoven for initial wafer exposures and developments. We have now achieved images with a resolution of 8-nanometer, which is a new world record. We are, with High NA, enabling an almost 3x increase in transistor density relative to 0.33 NA system. Our system in Veldhoven has exposed the first wafers for multiple Logic and Memory customers. 
So all in all, good momentum on High NA, high interest, and we are progressing well against our customer expectations. 
Let's switch now to our longer-term outlook. When it comes to demand and our business beyond 2024, we expect, as we discussed in previous quarters that the overall semiconductor inventory levels, we continue to improve. We also see today further improvement in litho tool utilization levels at both Logic and Memory customers. While there are still uncertainties in the market, primarily driven by the macro environment, we expect a continued industry recovery in the second half of 2024. 
We currently see strong development in artificial intelligence driving most of the industry recovery and growth ahead of other market segments. Based on discussion with our customers and supported by our strong backlog, we currently expect 2025 to be a strong year, driven by a number of factors, as mentioned last quarter. The secular growth driver in the semiconductor end market are still very much intact. The energy transition, electrification and artificial intelligence will continue to drive demand. We also see an expanding application space along with increasing lithography on future technology nodes. This will also drive demand for both advanced and mature nodes. 
The industry expects to be in a cyclical upturn in 2025. As a result, we need to prepare for a number of new fabs that are being built today across the globe. Those fabs will be spread geographically and are strategic for all our customers. They all scheduled to take our system. It's essential that we keep our focus on the future and build capacity in preparation for further long-term growth. We have discussed this long-term growth in our Investor Day in November '22. There, our annual revenue forecast for 2025 was between EUR 30 billion and EUR 40 billion. Our opportunity for 2030 annual revenue was between EUR 44 billion and EUR 60 billion. We plan to update our view during our Investor Day this year on November 14, 2024. 
In summary, although there are still near-term uncertainties, primarily driven by the macro environment, we remain confident in our long-term growth opportunity.

Dassen,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Christophe, and welcome, everyone. I will first review the second quarter 2024 financial accomplishments and then provide guidance on the third quarter of 2024.  
Let me start with our second quarter accomplishments. Total net sales came in at EUR 6.2 billion, which is just above guidance. Net system sales of EUR 4.8 billion, which is made up of EUR 1.5 billion of EUV sales and EUR 3.3 billion of non-EUV sales. Net system sales was driven by Logic at 54%, with the remaining 46% coming from Memory.  
Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 1.48 billion, slightly higher than guided. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 51.5%, which was above our guidance, primarily driven by more immersion systems than planned.  
On operating expenses, R&D expenses came in slightly above guidance at EUR 1.1 billion due to higher R&D expenses regarding metrology and inspection, while SG&A expenses came in slightly below our guidance at EUR 277 million as a result of lower IT spend. Net income in Q2 was EUR 1.6 billion, representing 25.3% of total net sales and resulting in an EPS of EUR 4.01.  
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 5.0 billion. We ended Q2 with free cash flow of EUR 386 million, which is an improvement relative to last quarter. However, as mentioned last quarter, there continues to be pressure on free cash flow as we provide some support for our customers and operate at higher inventory levels, the latter being a result of the increased material intake, including High-NA, as part of our planned capacity ramp in preparation for strong demand next year. We expect a gradual return to normal cash conversion levels as the industry continues to recover.  
Moving to the order book. Q2 net system bookings came in at EUR 5.6 billion, which is made up of EUR 2.5 billion of EUV bookings and EUR 3.1 billion of non-EUV bookings. Net system bookings in the quarter were mainly driven by Logic at 73% and Memory, the remaining 27% of the bookings. At the end of Q2 2024, we finished with a backlog of around EUR 39 billion.  
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the third quarter of 2024. We expect Q3 total net sales to be between EUR 6.7 billion and EUR 7.3 billion. We expect our Q3 Installed Base Management sales to be around EUR 1.4 billion.  Gross margin for Q3 is expected to be between 50% and 51%. We still expect a slightly lower gross margin for the full year 2024 compared to 2023. 
Although margins for the second half of the year are expected to be positively impacted by higher volume and more favorable EUV Low-NA mix, we expect this to be offset by increased High-NA costs relative to the first half of the year.  The expected R&D expenses for Q3 are around EUR 1.1 billion, and SG&A is expected to be around EUR 295 million. Our estimated 2024 annualized effective tax rate is expected to be between 16% [ and ] 17%.  
In Q2, ASML paid a final dividend of EUR 1.75 per ordinary share. Together with the interim dividend paid in 2023 and 2024, this resulted in a total dividend for 2023 of EUR 6.10 per ordinary share. The first quarterly interim dividend over 2024 will be EUR 1.52 per ordinary share and will be made payable on August 7, 2024. In Q2 2024, we purchased 106,000 shares for a total amount of EUR 96 million.

As Roger highlighted, a good quarter with sales and profitability above guidance. Although macro uncertainty remains, overall semiconductor industry levels continue to improve, trending towards more healthy levels. We also see continued improvement in lithographic tools utilization level at both Logic and Memory customers, all in line with the industry's continued recovery from the downturn.  
Our outlook for the full year is unchanged with revenue expected to be similar to last year. We currently see strong developments in AI driving most of the industry recovery and growth, ahead of other end market segments. We still expect a stronger second half relative to the first half of the year.  
Logic customers continue to digest the significant capacity additions made over the past year. With this digestion, we see lower revenue from Logic this year relative to last year.  
In Memory, demand is primarily driven by DRAM technology node transitions in support of advanced memories such as DDR5 and HBM. In support of this transition, we expect growth in revenue from Memory this year relative to 2023.  
For our installed base business, we continue to expect a similar level of revenue compared to last year. As the recovery becomes more clear this year, customer may look to upgrade their system in preparation for 2025.  
Turning to our businesses. We expect EUV revenue growth in 2024. We plan to recognize revenue on a similar number of EUV system as 2023, with expected revenue from 1 to 2 High-NA system.  
On our Low-NA EUV system, additional NXE:3800E system this quarter as we continue to ramp production. As customer transition to advanced nodes in both Logic and Memory, we expect the majority of shipments in the second half of the year to be NXE:3800E system.  
Regarding High-NA, we shipped the second system this quarter, and it is currently under installation. The first system shipped to a customer is running qualification wafer. Overall, the interest is high with EUV customers now using our High-NA system in the joint ASML-Imec demo lab in Veldhoven for their initial development.  
We have already exposed wafer for multiple Logic and Memory customer and have now achieved the imaging resolution specification of 8-nanometer. High-NA will enable an almost 3x increase in transistor density relative to the Low-NA system. So all in all, good momentum on High-NA and progressing well against customer expectation.  
We expect our non-EUV business to be down in 2024, primarily driven by lower immersion system sales relative to 2023. As we have stated over the last few quarters, we view 2024 as a transition year and continue to make investments this year, both in capacity ramp and in technology to be ready for future demand.  
While the slope of the industry recovery is still uncertain, based on discussions with our customers and supported by our strong backlog, we expect 2025 to be a strong year, driven by a number of factors as mentioned last quarter. First, the secular growth driver in semiconductor end markets, which we have previously discussed such as energy transition, electrification and AI are still very much intact. The expanding application space, along with increasing lithography and future technology nodes, drives demand for both advanced and mature nodes.  
Second, the industry expects to be in a cyclical upturn in 2025. And last, as mentioned earlier, we need to prepare for a number of new fabs that are being built across the globe, in some instances, clearly supported by several government incentive plans. These fabs are spread geographically and are strategic for our customers. They are all scheduled to take our tools.  
It is essential that we keep our focus on the future and build capacity in preparation for future long-term growth, as we discussed in the market scenario for 2025 and 2030 during our Investor Day in November of 2022. We plan to update our view during our Investor Day this year on November 14, 2024. In summary, although there is near-term uncertainty, we remain confident in our long-term growth opportunity.  
With that, we will be happy to take your questions.",679

In the booking for EUV and the EUR 2.5 billion, whether any 2-nanometer orders from foundry customers that you said you should expect in Q2 or Q3? Any High-NA in the mix? And based on the bookings momentum and backlog, how do you think about calendar '25 revenues? Do you think it could be towards the upper end of the EUR 30 billion to EUR 40 billion range? And then I have a quick follow-up.",89

Dassen,,Executives,8,"So on the bookings, as you would have seen in the bookings mix, 73% of the bookings was related to Logic. So I think that gives you a pretty strong indication who the buyers are and who is in the mix. So I think it is reasonable to assume that the foundry business at 2-nanometer is in the book. So that's one.  
High-NA is not in there. So no High-NA bookings in this quarter. So everything you see there on EUV is related to Low-NA.  
As it relates to 2025, Krish, very consistent, I think, in our messaging. And that's why we say we confirm what we said in November of 2022, which is we expect 2025 to be between EUR 30 billion and EUR 40 billion. We've also said it's not the low point of that guidance.  
Last quarter, we've given you a bit of an understanding of what it takes to be fully booked at the beginning of 2025 for the midpoint of the range. I think you can conclude with the bookings number that we've reported that we're nicely on track. But with that, we still confirm that our expectation is between EUR 30 billion and EUR 40 billion and are not going to be more specific than what we've been so far.",216

Kind of curious, what do you think about the           implication for ASML from here? How much more severe could it be, given the fact that you do have a pretty high exposure to China? If you can give some color or some bookings around it, that would be very helpful.",94

So I think on that topic, we comment even less, I will say. So that's the first thing.  
I think we had a discussion on China in the past together. I think the point Roger and I have made in the last few quarters, which is still valid, is before you look at China, I think you have to look at the opportunity we see on the mature semiconductor market. That opportunity we have defined as being significant in our Capital Market Day in November 2022. We still believe it's significant.     
In 2023, 2024, China has been investing a large part of this market. And this is why I think our revenue on China has been high. Moving forward, we still believe that this market is needed. And therefore, that the capacity is coming out of somewhere. So that's a bit the position we take on that discussion. I think we always look at the end market, at what's the need of the end market. I think we are a bit less sensitive on where that capacity may be produced.",199

But clearly, for such a large node, one would expect to see more order flow. So I wonder to what extent it's fair to assume one should expect more EUV orders from them in the coming quarters?  
And as a quick follow-up, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that AI is driving most of the industry's recovering growth. Are you able to decompose what specifically is driving this to ASML? To what extent you see litho needs being driven by high-bandwidth memory, data center processing or edge AI? Is there any area that's surprising to the upside?",115

Dassen,,Executives,15,"So it's clear, I think, that if you look at the orders that came in, that there is a healthy start, I would say, for the N2 foundry business. I think it's a healthy start. It's also clear that obviously, not the full capacity that you would need for this node is in there, but that is pretty logical, right? I mean obviously, this customer is going to ramp. And there you will see gradual buildup, and that will -- you will also see -- at some stage, you will see additional orders coming in for that ramp.  
Exactly what that buildup will be, you might want to raise that question by tomorrow. And maybe the second part, I think, is for you, Christophe.",125

I think -- so I think I said it in my comments initially, I think we've been also consistent there. So I think AI is driving, I would say, right now, the biggest part of the recovery. This is true for Logic. This is true for Memory. Roger just commented on Logic.  
I think you know that for high-bandwidth memory, those products drive more demand, more of a wafer demand because we are looking basically at a higher density of DRAM on those products. And we look at something that, of course, will take course over several months.  So we started to see the positive effect of that for 2025. We expect that to continue into 2026, both for Memory and for Logic. And at some point of time, I also mentioned that maybe the other segments are a bit behind in terms of recovery.  
So a lot of the capacity today, either Logic or DRAM capacity will be [indiscernible] those AI product. As the other segments recover, we also expect potentially some capacity to be needed there. And that's also why we believe overall that 2025 will be a strong year.  And I think the -- whatever one is trying to understand, what you're trying to understand is exactly the pace of it. That, I think, we don't know exactly. But the fundamentals, I would say, on AI, and I think the recovery in general are strong from our point of view.",244

And the second question I have is regarding the DRAM adoption of more EUV layers as well as High-NA EUV, how do you see the layer count change over the next few generations? Are we going to see a similar level of growth of layers as we have seen over the past 2 years or it will gradually slow down? If there is a number you can share, it would be great.",121

I think the foundry customer has indicated that they're looking at N2 in the second half of 2025. I think you're typically, for this customer, looking at a lead time of around a year. As we've said, I think, putting in orders at this stage, I think, is consistent with that. To the extent that there is a difference in timing or ramp, again, I think that's a question that you might want to raise on a conference call tomorrow.

On DRAM, so I think there also, I think I'll be very consistent with the information we have shared with you previously. So we see on there an increase of EUV use on every node. I think this is a trend that continue at least in the foreseeable future.  
Of course, it's always more difficult to make forecast on nodes or technology that are still being defined by a customer. But that logic is still in place. I think you have seen also in DRAM that at this point of time, all customers are using EUV in production. I think the last customer was very public about that recently.  So you see a gradual basically adoption with different speed maybe per customer. But I would say, very much in line with, I think, what we explained already now for a few years.  
On High-NA, we also see opportunity for DRAM, the horizon of '25, '26. As I mentioned in my commentaries, we see customers very eager to test the High-NA tool in our lab, exposing their own wafer to validate basically that High-NA can provide a nice opportunity both in performance but also in cost savings. So they also -- same as before, we believe that '25, '26 is about the time where we could see some insertion of High-NA for DRAM.",223

And maybe the second question I had is a bit of a follow-up. So if we take like this EUV orders of EUR 2.5 billion and your EUR 39 billion of backlog and that you have, I come with like you still have 30 tools, EUV tools to book for next year to reach the midpoint of the guidance. So Roger, you said nicely that your order backlog is orders is going well on track above this EUR 4 billion, but it's mainly driven by deep UV.  
And on EUV, it seems that you still need 30 to book for the rest of the year, which would imply around EUR 7 billion of EUV orders coming in H2 versus EUR 3 billion in H1.

I think you're now jumping into one specific element of the revenue, but I think our math holds for the full revenue. And I think that holds. And I think going deeper into that and going there, I don't think adds anything to the overall message that I believe we're nicely on the way to achieve the objectives and the bandwidth that we've discussed before. 
So I wouldn't go -- I wouldn't want to go at this stage any more specific into any of the components. As I mentioned before, we have a Capital Markets Day coming up.

But there are limitations that for some fabs are more stringent, and this is then particularly related to parts, so to parts being sent either from the United States or from Europe or when it comes to the use of technology, so manuals, et cetera.

With all of those ""scheduled to take tools,"" how much of an impact do you think is that in 2025? And how much is actually beyond that, given the lead time effects to build a lot of concrete and steel going in at the moment? But certainly, not many ready to take actual cleanroom equipment just yet. Can you help us with how you think that's going to the phase over '25 and then '26 and beyond?",111

So I think to make the -- the answer is simple. I think most of it will come, in fact, after 2025. So I think the volume from those fabs is still limited next year. 
I think you're mostly aware of the big announcement either in the U.S., in Europe, in Japan. So I think this will come after '25, mostly starting 2026. This was also a bit my comment about preparing also the capacity for that. 
So as Roger explained, when we prepare the capacity, taking into account the lead time we have some -- for some of our factories, some of our suppliers, of course, the capacity is there to meet the market demand, in fact, beyond 2025. So this is what we wanted to be ready for. 
So this is also why we are still very comfortable with the long-term view of the market because those things are going to come. And we could expect even some more government funding moving forward, because as you also see it in the news, I think there is more and more wish from everyone to really invest in this business. So I think that's also something we don't expect to slow down over time. We expect that there will be more after the first wave of investments.",218

So that's why also in the past, we said that when it comes to 2025, more than half of the shipments will [indiscernible], but that will include new fabs, including new fabs, for instance, that are being constructed in Taiwan. So more than 50% of our shipments for 2025, we expect to go to new fabs. But Christophe is absolutely right.

Dassen,,Executives,41,"Chris, what you see is that we are indeed building up momentum. I think that's sort of what you might expect, given what we said we look at 2025 as a growth year. And I think what you see over the quarters in 2024, that it is clearly building up over the quarters. 
I think -- and as we said before, we have been building capacity. So we're able to do it. But the demand is also building up this momentum over the quarters leading into the growth, the year in 2025. 
I should also add that as we've mentioned before, there is also some deferred revenue that we've been building out. And that means systems that we have shipped that we have not yet recognized revenue for. And the impact for that in the second half is expected to be around EUR 1 billion. So that's a substantive number, and that comes either from fast shipments that we have been doing. And as you know, we no longer intend to fast ship by the end of this year. So that gives you a bit of a tailwind there. 
But there's also a number of 3800 tools that we're shipping and that we take revenue for after shipments at site acceptance, that's for the customer. And also as you know, we're in the process of shipping High-NA tools that have been shipped, but [ where we only ] take revenue at the moment of the site acceptance stuff. 
So there is a number of reasons why we will recognize revenue for stuff that has already been shipped. And I think with that tailwind and with the building up of momentum both in terms of capacity and in terms of demand, we're indeed looking at a very progressive buildup of revenue throughout this year and leading to an over EUR 9 billion expectation indeed in Q4.",315

I think as we said in the past, we have, I would say, a good backlog for High-NA, which means that the customer I was referring to, all our EUV customers have ordered those systems. I think you see that we start to deliver those tools. 
And of course, this is timely aligned with some of the opportunity to insert. The addition of the lab basically is good for our customer because this gives them a chance even before that to hit the ground to get the first data. And I think you understand on the technology, High-NA, the very first data are critical to understand exactly what's the value of the technology. 
So this is why today, the wafer that are being exposed are already providing very valuable information to our customer, information they can start to use to refine a bit their insertion scenario and the value that High-NA could bring. That's why we have been, obviously, quite excited about the fact that we are generating this data today.

Dassen,,Executives,51,"So indeed, as Christophe said, it will be -- the majority of EUV tools in the second half will be 3800. I should add, as you know, C.J., and we talked about this before that the -- we have a ramp schedule where the initial 3800 are not yet up to full configuration. So gradually, we will get the 3800 up to the full specification of the 220 wafers per hour. 
It also means that not all of the 3800 that will ship in the second half of this year will command the higher ASP because some revenue is deferred up until the point where the tools have been upgraded to that high specification. So we will not get the full tailwind, I would say, of the strong 3800 pricing in the second half. 
But it's definitely going to help in that, but you will see a stronger effect of that in 2025, where, of course, the share of the 3800 is going to be even stronger. And there, all the tools essentially will be in final specification. And we will also get some deferred revenue that will be recognized in [indiscernible] from tools that have been shipped in 2024. 
So if you look at the gross margin for the second half, of course, this is one element in there. We also have a [ slight ], and that's a positive, I would say. And then we have a higher volume, obviously, in 2025 -- in the second half of 2024 as we just calculated. That's also a positive. 
Slightly negative is that in the deep UV mix, as I mentioned before, the dry component is going to be more visible, right? So that's a bit of a drag on the gross margin. 
And then we also, in the second half, we're going to have the first revenue recognition of the High-NA tools. And of course, on the one hand, that's great because that means we have the sign-up of customers on the tool, as we expect in the second half of this year. 
But you also know that the gross margin on that tool is not great. So that will also be a drag. So that's the reason why for the second half of this year, we expect a slightly lower gross margin than we expect -- than we were able to report in the first half.",398

So first, I'd like to say that I think we never qualify any customer as being reluctant for High-NA. I think this information came from somewhere else. I think the short answer is the data generation helped. Again, we are exposing important wafer. We told you in the past, we're happy to get that amount of backlog on High-NA because our customer were showing the trust in the technology without having any data at hand. So they were basically following our, I will say, analysis or our promise that this will help them moving forward. And they have been willing to invest for R&D quite heavily and by the way, even down pay some of those systems. So this was a huge commitment from the industry. 
I think the data is helping tremendously because our customer can see data. I think that can be used also for potentially their customers to have a much better discussion around High-NA. 
So I think the dynamic is good. And I would say the discussion is getting a lot more concrete. And I think we need to give a few more months to that discussion so that everyone based on data this time have a bit of a better idea of what should be done moving forward with High-NA and how quickly.",219

But if we were to assume that there is some sort of AI, PC and smartphone refresh cycle, pushing volumes for those combined markets to maybe a high single-digit volume growth in calendar '25 or calendar '26, do you think that there is enough capacity in DRAM, maybe NAND, and maybe to a lesser degree, in Logic to deliver on that potential uplift in volumes?",87

I think it's very difficult to answer the question. I think what we have seen with AI is a major investment from many companies in supercomputer and the ability basically to train model. 
What we still miss in AI, I think, is the emergence of end product. So I think today, there's not much revenue made on AI. There's just a lot of investment. What we see is that still that investment require a lot of capacity. I think you have seen some of our customers announcing also more capacity to be built before 2028. 
And as I said before, if the rest of the application were to recover, the -- what has been done so far, which is to reallocate some of the capacity to HBM, may become more difficult. So overall, I think we still expect as the rest of the market recover, to see a need for more capacity. And that's, I think, also true for DRAM. 
Now to tell you at what speed, I think this is still a bit difficult, I think I said it a few times. I think the recovery is something we are looking at every day. And there is also a lot of uncertainty. So this is why you see us being, I would say, strong in our view of 2025, but also a bit cautious because there's still a lot of uncertainty around those opportunities.",246

So I think there's two parts of that. I think the technology part where we are busy here in ASML to demonstrate basically the performance of the tool. We have seen very big progress there. We have measured 195 wafers per hour on the tool. We expect to see the final specification being measured also in the coming weeks. 
We don't see any hard showstopper. So we just see some work to be done. With the customer, I think some of the delay was also a choice we made to support the demand in the previous year. So if you remember, 2022 was a year where we saw a very strong demand from all customer in EUV. And we thought this would be wise to slow down a bit the ramp to the next product to not disrupt that demand. 
At this point of time, the tool also is getting at customer. We made a choice, has been explained before, to ship it initially at a lower throughput so that the qualification could start earlier at our customer so that it can be ready basically for high-volume manufacturing next year when I think this is the real expectation for this tool to run manufacturing. 
So from my point of view, maybe I would say the biggest element to help you is that technology-wise, there is no concern at all. And when it comes to qualification with our customer, I think this is underway. And of course, we are going to use the next few months to mature the system. It always takes a few months to do that.",269

But then in addition to that, we also have 3800 that we shipped in H1 but recognizing revenue in H2. And also with High-NA tools that with the long lead times and given this is a very new technology, we're going to recognize revenue not upon shipment but upon SAC. 
And that combination of things that we expect around EUR 1 billion to be added to the revenue, so deferred revenue that we expect to see recorded in revenue in the second half. So that's the difference. It's not just a fast shipment but also the other dynamics that I just talked about.",140

We have been building capacity for EUV. As you know, we are working towards a capacity level of 90 in the '25, '26 time frame. So we have been driving up capacity quite a bit.

So maybe in terms of the adoption of High-NA and litho itself, Christophe, maybe you can make any comments on what your interactions with the foundries and the memory companies have been in terms of using litho as a critical driver of the scaling in semiconductors over the next few years because there has been a lot more conversation in the industry about the limitations of litho.",118

So first, I think you're hinting to it. I think if we look at the last few years, the scaling, the shrink is slowing down. I think this is not new. And for a long time, litho had an impact on that. I think at this point of time, it's more fundamentals basically and related to all the innovation you need to put in place in order to be able to scale the transistor.  
Now this being said, scaling is slowing down. So that's many years already. What is not slowing down is the need for transistor density. So that curve, which is more slow practically, is not slowing down. So customers are asking more and more density at the same speed they have done for many, many years.  And as scaling slowed down, I would say shrink become even more valuable because shrink is still today the best way to save cost on density. Everything else require you to just build more transistor with more steps.  
So shrink today and it's true today, it's going to be true to [indiscernible] is still the best way to reduce cost. And sometimes we say the less you can shrink, the more the value of shrink is going to be. That's one thing.  
The other thing, of course, is if you shrink less, you need more volume. And more volume can be obtained by exposing more wafer or exposing more stack on the wafer. But in both cases, you -- this drive also more lithography. So we never really feared the reduction of shrink because this was driving volume.  This is one of the reasons why we have been building capacity. And at the same time, we know that every step we will be able to make in lithography will have huge value for our customers. So this is something also we believe continues to be important. And of course, most probably over time, and we'll also talk a bit about that in November, we will look at more ways to help our customer to drive this density basically up. 
So I'd say no news there. Scaling is slowing down. It's not a difficult thing to say for litho [ person ]. It's just reality. Density does not. Therefore, need for more volume, more volume for shrink. And I will say some opportunity to look at other applications to help our customers to get this density at cost. We'll talk a lot about that in November, I'd like to say, because I think it's one of the things we want to explain again, everyone.",442

I just wondered if you could give us a sense for how big domestic Chinese demand is as a part of your backlog today, just to get a sense for the level to which it may contribute to revenues next year.
And secondly, just on China again, there's a lot of rumors flying around. And I suspect the rules that are in place today are the result of some give and take in different companies, different stakeholders pushing in different ways. 
But just to hear it from the horse's mouth, can you give us some idea of what the U.S. government would ideally like you to ship to China regardless of the rules that are in place today? And how does that compare to what you're shipping to China today? Any color on that would be helpful.",145

Dassen,,Executives,70,"Adithya, on the backlog, I think we said it before that our backlog is a little bit north of 20%, and that's still the case. So that's on the Chinese share in our backlog. 
On the China rumors, we're not going to add, I think, to the rumors that are already out there. I think this is a negotiation between governments. Companies are not at the table. And we live by -- we obviously stick to what we're allowed to do. And we're not going to speculate about what government A might want to see in the rules and what government B might want to have in the rules. I don't think that's going to add to any clarity. 
I think what is very important to understand, and Christophe said that at the beginning of the call, the way we look at the demand for our tools is not from a specific geography, in this case, China. We look at -- and that's the way we model our sales medium term and long term. We look at what is the global demand for wafers. And whether those wafers are being produced in country X or country Y, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter. And I think that is very important to recognize in looking at your model. We don't have a specific China element in our models.  It's the global demand for wafers that drives our modeling.",240
