With that, let's begin. After 5 consecutive quarters of sequential revenue growth, fourth quarter revenue was negatively impacted by the global disk drive shortage caused by the flooding in Thailand, which affected the mainstream GPU segment more than anticipated. Shipments by some PC OEMs were reduced, and higher disk drive prices constrained the ability of some PC OEMs to include a GPU in their systems.  Additionally, the Tegra 2 mobile business declined more rapidly than expected ahead of devices based on the Tegra 3 processor ramping into production in the first quarter of calendar year 2012. 
However, despite tough economic conditions and the exiting of our chipset business, NVIDIA recorded very good results for our full fiscal year 2012.  First, our overall GP -- our overall business grew 33%, excluding the chipset business we've been exiting. Discrete GPUs, including GeForce, Quadro and Tesla grew sharply over the year. GPU attach rates remained strong at 53% of consumer PCs and 36% overall, according to Mercury Research data.
A resurgent PC gaming market saw games like Battlefield 3 and Modern Warfare 3 record over $1  billion in sales in their first week on the shelves. At the time of the launch of Battlefield 3, over 80% of gamers were below the recommended hardware specification to play the game, driving a significant increase in gamer GPU revenues over the year.
Our Professional Solutions Business had a record revenue year driven by large adoption of the Fermi generation of Quadro workstation products, as well as growth in emerging design economies such as India and China. Our Tesla products were selected to power the world's fastest supercomputers, including Oak Ridge National Laboratory's upcoming Titan supercomputer. In addition, we made major strides in speeding up GPU computing applications support and code porting through our open HPC and directives initiatives.
And in one of our most important achievements for the year, we established a position in the mobile market. Tegra products captured share in Tier 1 tablets and smartphones. Over the course of the year, Tegra products shipped in 14 phones, 34 tablets and in 18 of the top 20 carriers. We designed and shipped 3 generations of Android devices. With Tegra 2, we were the first to ship dual-core mobile processors. And now with Tegra 3, we are the first to ship quad-core processors. The Tegra mobile processor has grown into a multi-hundred million dollar business.
Looking ahead, while we anticipate continued negative effects from the hard drive shortage, we believe gaming demand will continue to be robust, driven by the combination of our next-generation Kepler architecture and new hit games, such as Mass Effect 3 and Diablo III, both highly anticipated PC games coming in early calendar year 2012.
We believe that tax rates will continue to be stable, and that we are well positioned to grow notebook share with significant new notebook wins in the upcoming Ivy Bridge design cycle.
We are excited about a number of recent announcements we made in the professional space, which we believe will transform the workstation.  First, yesterday, we announced that NVIDIA has joined forces with HP to introduce the world's first of all-in-one workstation, the Quadro-based HP Z1 Workstation. The Z1 features a 27-inch display that snaps open like the hood of the car, so users can easily swap out parts and make upgrades without any tools required. This is the first and an entirely new category of professional workstation that we believe will tap market segments where space is a premium and users are unwilling to compromise performance. 
Second, we announced Maximus, a breakthrough for the workstation industry. Maximus enables for the first time a single workstation to simultaneously handle real-time visualization and compute-intensive simulation, functions which previously required separate steps or separate systems. Design and creative professionals have longed for machine that could perform these functions simultaneously. Maximus includes a combination of Quadro and Tesla, unifying software technology and a rigorous certification process for professional applications. We believe Maximus will redefine the workflow in several segments and that workstations will increasingly shift with multiple GPUs.
Meanwhile, Tesla continued to make headlines in computational science. In addition to a number of new supercomputer deployment announcements, we announced breakthroughs in research. Two of the most important supercomputers in the world were recently announced in Oak Ridge National Labs' Titan and the NCSA's Blue Waters, both Tesla-based. China -- Chinese researchers announced they had achieved a major breakthrough in the race to battle influenza by using NVIDIA Tesla GPUs to create the world's first computer simulation of a whole H1N1 influenza virus at the atomic level.
With Tegra 3, we believe our mobile business is poised for renewed growth. In addition to the launch of the world's first quad-core tablet, the ASUS Transformer Prime, we announced tablets based on Tegra 3 from a number of key OEMs, including Lenovo, ZTE, Fujitsu and Acer. We also announced, together with ASUS, the world's first quad-core tablet priced at $249, the ASUS 7-inch MeMO ME370T. Next up, our Tegra 3 phones. We're looking forward to announcing some of the first ones at Mobile World Congress.  
With innovating, exciting new tablets at the high end, quad-core tablets at lowered price points for consumers, the world's first quad-core smartphones coming soon and Windows 8 devices later in the year, we remain confident that Tegra 3 will drive a new phase of growth for our mobile business.
With that, let me hand the call over to Karen.",1255
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 15, 2012",2012-02-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3598.0,259182.0,12941989.0,Presenter Speech,Karen Burns,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Rob. For the fiscal year 2012, revenue was $4 billion, up 12.8% from the prior year. GAAP net interest -- net income grew 129.5%, resulting in earnings of $0.94 per diluted share, an increase of 118.6% over the prior fiscal year of $0.43. Non-GAAP net income grew 54.2%, resulting in earnings of $1.19 per diluted share, an increase of 46.9% over the prior fiscal year of $0.81.
For the fourth quarter, revenue was $953.2 million, down 10.6% from the prior quarter. As Rob discussed, the hard disk drive shortage had more impact on our mainstream GPU segments than originally anticipated, and our Tegra 2 products declined more rapidly than expected. GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 51.4%, 0.8% lower than the prior quarter and our original expectations due to an additional charge in the quarter to settle a patent dispute with Rambus. Non-GAAP gross margin, which excluded this charge, was 52.5%, consistent with the record gross margins we achieved in Q3. These results contributed to a GAAP net income of $116 million for the quarter or $0.19 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income worth $158.1 million or $0.26 per diluted share.
Revenue results by business segment were as follows: Our GPU business was down 3.6% quarter on quarter, due to the impact of the disk drive shortage on our mainstream GPU desktop and notebook businesses. Our professional business was down 3.6% from the record level achieved in the third quarter. Our Consumer business was down 42.5% sequentially. As mentioned previously, this primarily related to the sharp decline in our Tegra 2 products ahead of the ramp of Tegra 3, as well as the seasonal decline in our game console revenues.
For GAAP, our outlook for the first quarter is as follows: Revenue at $900 million to $930 million; gross margin of 49.2%, plus or minus 1%; OpEx at $383 million; and a tax at approximately 20%. For non-GAAP, we expect the following differences from our gap outlook: gross margin of 49.5%, plus or minus 1%; and OpEx at $340 million. Depreciation and amortization are expected in the range of $52 million to $56 million, and capital expenditures in the range of $35 million to $45 million. Diluted shares are expected to be 622.5 million.
As for the FY '13 outlook, our view of the market has changed and the outlook we gave in Q3 should no longer be relied upon. We are updating our FY '13 outlook as follows: we expect the overall PC market to experience continued headwind from the disk drive shortage. We expect our GPU business to gain share. Our Professional Solutions Business is expected to have another record year. Maximus enables us to sell more than 1 GPU on to a workstation, and new supercomputer centers around the world are anticipating the shipment of Kepler.
Tegra this year was $360 million, and we expect it to grow at least 50%. We expect gross margins to exit FY '13 at around 52%. We expect our OpEx investments in FY '13 to be approximately $1.56 billion on a GAAP basis and $1.4 billion for non-GAAP. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now take questions.",530

We're ramping our Kepler generation very hard, and we could use more wafers. The gross margin decline is contributed almost entirely to the yields of 28-nanometer being lower than expected. And that is, I guess, unsurprising at this point. And because we have -- we use wafer-based pricing now, when the yield is lower, our cost is higher. And so we've transitioned to a wafer-based pricing for some time. And our expectation, of course, is that the yields will improve as they have in the previous generation nodes, and as the yields improve, our output would increase and our costs will decline. And that's why we expect to exit the year at 52% or about.",141

But this quarter, we are expecting to announce and ship Tegra 3-based superphones. And they -- rumors of them are starting to -- and excitement about it is starting to leak, but at Mobile World Congress is when we expect to announce these devices. And we expect to announce and ship them this quarter. And so we're expecting Q1 to be a sharp uptick in Tegra sales and shipments. Our expectation is Windows 8 is later in the year. And Microsoft has given their estimates about Windows 8, and our expectation is that there will be meaningful contributions from Windows 8 later in the year, starting probably in Q3.",130

And just as a follow-up, with respect to kind of what you're seeing in the PC market and specifically, the impact of hard drives, maybe give a little more color that. Obviously, we've heard from some of your competitors on that and it sounded like that the hard drive availability is getting somewhat better depending on who you talk to. How do you see that playing out kind of over the next 2 quarters or so as it impacts your business?",83

I think PC-centric semiconductor companies have guided down on average, I think about 8% Q1. And so I think everybody is expecting hard drive headwind to continue through Q1 and potentially through Q2. As far as what we see, Q4 started out with less shortage than we -- than people have predicted, and the reason for that was because there was a lot of channel inventory and people consumed the channel inventories. The channel inventory dried up. Prices of disk drives in the channels started to spike. And, as you know, channel business is a large part of the discrete GPU business. And China is particularly a large region for us, where a large amount of the PCs are built in channel, and they are built -- what we call DIY. And so design it yourself or build it yourself or design it for you. And so you spec the parts and you go to on IT mall and they build a PC right there for you. And so in those part of the regions where -- in countries, regions and countries where people build PCs like that, the spot price of disk drives have increased quite a bit. And so our sense is that that's going to continue through Q1 and potentially through Q2.",221

And so the margin improvement will come entirely from 28-nanometer. And TSMC is doing fabulously with 28, and this year, with 28 relative to 40, it's surely a huge improvement. But during transition years, because we have so much of our business tied to the leading edge nodes and because when we transition GPUs, we transition so much of it at once. And this year -- particularly unique this year is that the number of notebook design wins that we have and the number of 28-nanometer GPU design wins that we have is, at OEMs, is much, much higher than our previous generation. And so all of the transition of 28 is going to be very fast. And so we're just going to have to continue to work with TSMC and get the yields of 28-nanometer up as fast as possible. And we surely expect that by the end of the year, we're going to be in a pretty good place. We're in a pretty decent place now, but we just need to get the yields up.",188

This is the first major quarter of 28-nanometer shipments. There have been some shipments. There've been some shipments in previous quarters but very, very small. And so for TSMC, this is probably the first large quarter of shipments, and we're going to continue to improve yields from here. So there's nothing particularly wrong. This is just early in the learning cycle of a new node. And so we'll improve it with every single outs [ph]. And also this isn't a problem that we can solve. Everybody's using the same 28-nanometer. And so this affects all of us, anybody who uses 28-nanometer. So I think with everybody ramping production, there's going to be a lot more learning cycles both from us and from other people. But TMSC is in a good place now and we just have to keep improving it.",145

Well, my guess is that this is across the industry. This 28-nanometer is still early and it's maturing. There aren't that many 28-nanometer products in the marketplace as of now, and the number of cycles of learning is not very significant and the amount of volume is surely not very significant. At this point, we've -- we're ramping very hard all of our 28-nanometer products. And the yield is much better than 40-nanometer when it first came up, but it's not as good as we had expected in our previous projections. And so we're going to have to work hard with TSMC and support them and encourage them and wish them well and to get the 28-nanometer yield up as fast as possible.",141

The amount of 28-nanometer capacity in the world is not enough. And so I think we're expecting 28-nanometer to be constrained through the entire year. New generations of smartphones, new generations of GPUs are going to drive the demand for 28-nanometer capacity -- or drive the demand for 28-nanometer devices. And so I think you're going to find that this year is going to continue to be tight. We could use more 28-nanometer wafers, and TSMC's management team is working very hard on [indiscernible] us with our demand and they're driving cycle times hard and trying to improve yield. And so all of that is going to improve throughout the year and very steadily throughout the year.

And I think that there are fewer PCs sold in Q4 than there was -- that we -- that the industry had expected. The attach rate of those PCs that were sold were stable and relatively consistent with our model. And so your premise is -- it's -- I don't think it's correct. And attach rates seems to be stable. The number of PCs sold has reduced. Some people think it's cannibalization from smartphone and tablets and other devices, but disk drive has surely played a role in that as well. And so when the disk drive supply resumes, my sense is that consumers' demand will return to what they were and GPU attach will remain stable.",131

And what we've told you guys before, the increase in investment relative to last year on an absolute basis has to do with the fact that we're investing a lot more in mobile devices. This last year was a big year for us. It was a big year because GPUs grew quite significantly despite the shortage of disk drives and softness in the market towards the end of the year. But it was a particularly big year for us because this was the first year that we really engaged the mobile market and our mobile position really became established. At this time this last year, no one thought that we would really be as successful in the mobile market as we ended up being. And so I think that today, we have now 3 generations of Android operating systems and devices behind us. We have tens and tens of smartphones and tens of tablets. We have engagements with nearly every single Tier 1 OEM in the world on the mobile side, as well as on the computing side. And so I think that this was a pretty big year from that perspective. And because of that traction and because of that -- the success we've seen, we think it's really -- it makes sense for us to double down on mobile computing and go after it in a big way. And so we're going to have a lot more products this year than last, and you're going to see that we're going to have tablet devices, as well as tablet processors, as well as integrated processors with modems. And so this is an aggressive investment surely but it's a very big, big market opportunity, as you know.",294

Let's see, we compete primarily today with Qualcomm. And the reason for that is because -- there are 3 major opportunities in the smartphone marketplace this year that are really exciting. In the United States, of course, LTE is very important. Outside of United -- and they have a very -- they have the only real integrated solution today and, in fact, they have the only shipping solution today. And so they have a very good position on LTE in the United States. Outside of United States, where LTE adoption is much further behind, the next major upgrade is quad-core. Today's dual-core phones needs to be upgraded. And so the next major upgrade, the next major superphone, the next major big thing is quad-core. And so Tegra 3 is incredibly well positioned there. So outside the United States, in Europe particularly, in China, you're going to see quad-core Tegra 3 phones coming on throughout the year.  
The third growth opportunity is the 999 or what some people call 1000RMB phone. And this is an affordable, very affordable smartphone with dual-core capability and the way that they describe it, the way the marketplace internalized it is it's a phone that has the capability of an iPhone 4 but is extremely affordable. That's a great opportunity for us because Tegra 2 is a fabulous dual core and with a 3G modem, you could achieve RMB 1,000 in China in the near future. And so that's a pretty exciting opportunity for us, and we're just about to enter into that market opportunity. And so those are kind of the market opportunities and the competitive dynamics. It's really primarily the 2 of us. I think the highest level -- the reason for that has to do with the fact that in order to be successful in the leading edge in the Tier 1 phones, you need to have a great application processor and a great application processor road map. You need to have a world-class software stack because the software part of these phones has become the most complicated part. And the third, going forward, is the ability to integrate a modem. And we were fortunate to have purchased Icera last year and our integrated road map is going to be pretty exciting.",390

So increasingly, Apple and Samsung are taking more share in the market versus say, HTC, Motorola and others. So even though Tegra 3 could be a great product, how are new ensuring that you're engaging with the right set of customers? And what real underlying drivers are going into this expectation of 50% growth for this year?",77
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 15, 2012",2012-02-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3598.0,259182.0,12942047.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,60,"We're expecting to grow at least 50% this year, and it comes from 3 different -- maybe 4 different sources, if I can break it down. One is Tegra 3 phones. One is Tegra 2 phones for the 1000RMB market, which is the fastest-growing segment in smartphones today. The third is Android tablets. And as you know, we finally were able to put together a tablet that is both exciting, as well -- tablet architecture that's both exciting with Tegra 3 and Ice Cream Sandwich, as well as affordable. We've been able to reach the $249 price level for retail. And the fourth is Windows 8 on ARM. And so these 4 growth drivers, frankly, this last year, what really -- the only thing that really worked super-well for us, in even on Tegra 2, was smartphones, and that contributed to $360 million in revenues. And so this year, we're expecting smartphones from Tegra 3, from Tegra 2, from Tegra 3 Ice Cream Sandwich tablets and as well as Tegra 3 Windows on ARM tablets. And so there's a lot more opportunities for us. But you're right that Samsung and Apple are very, very strong. And so our strategy is actually very simple. By teaming up with the best partners in the world, we would like to bring great technology to them and partner with them to build exquisite devices. And also to move faster. I mean, we, as an industry, have to move a lot faster in bringing competitive solutions to the marketplace more rapidly. And so by partnering with HTC -- and they are a fantastic company. I'm not suggesting we announce any products here, but surely, a partner like HTC would be fabulous for NVIDIA to partner with.",292

And if I could just perhaps push back on some of those drivers. So for instance, the 1000RMB market. There, we have seen integration with base land and connectivity being an attractive feature. So how do you address that? And then on Android tablets, you have some things are getting better but outside of the Kindle Fire, we have not seen sales pick up as much, or perhaps that's just my perception of the market. So if you could address those 2 issues also.",86
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 15, 2012",2012-02-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3598.0,259182.0,12942049.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,62,"Well, the 1000RMB market has a lot of segments underneath that. And at RMB 1,000, you really need to have a world-class phone. And right now there just isn't a very good solution for a world-class, high-performance dual-core processor with integrated 3G modem. And surely, there's RMB 500 phones and they have low-end integrated solutions with 3G. But nothing sufficiently good at the RMB 1,000 to be able to claim that it's as good as an iPhone 4 but at a much affordable price. And so that segment, where you need to have a world-class high-performance dual-core processor like Tegra 2 and a great software stack, along with 3G modems are, as you know, quite affordable and quite abundant and they've been around for many years. Integrating those together on a bill [ph] material is not too difficult. And so that's one. 
With respect to the tablets, Amazon Fire is a really interesting product and it's great e-reader. But our belief is that there's a marketplace for tablets that are much more general-purpose. I think the ASUS Transformer Prime is a first example of a tablet that can really demonstrate differentiation, and people love it, and it's, frankly, my favorite computer now and it's a lot of other people's favorite computers. It is a tablet sometimes, it's a full Notebook PC sometimes and the performance is really terrific. And so I think Ice Cream Sandwich addressed a lot of the challenges that the tablet industry had, Android had last year with fragmentation. But now with Ice Cream Sandwich, your phone is Ice Cream Sandwich, your tablet is Ice Cream Sandwich, all the applications that come off at the marketplace can work on both. And so I think that unification, it is the only operating system that allows that today. And so that's -- that, I think, is a great advance for the tablet market. And then lastly, at $249, if we can bring a quad-core -- if we can bring Tegra 3 to $249, and for those people who have seen and touched it, that tablet's going -- it's going to sell like hot cakes, we believe. Because it's the right price point, it's completely general-purpose and it's state-of-the-art. So we have reasons to believe that this tablet market is far from over, and there's a lot of interesting opportunities and differentiation to be brought to this market yet.",399

I mean, it's -- I haven't thought of it that way but it's about the same. But from a gross margin perspective, obviously, much more from 28-nanometer. Those are problems that are going to get solved for the whole industry. I think as the industry -- as TSMC ramps more and more 28-nanometers, their capacity would increase and their yields would increase and their cycle times will reduce. And this is a world-class company. And Morris and the management team are all over it, and they're doing everything in their power, and if history is any indication and it tends to be, they're going to work their way into a fabulous node here any time. And so we have just started ramping in the last several months. And so the Q1 is kind of a bit of a transition quarter for us. But I'm very confident that we'll work through the 28-nanometer yield issues.",157

And as a follow up, I hear you when you say at least 50% growth in Tegra. But your guidance there is nonetheless substantially lower than what your original guidance was. Can you just kind of walk through the delta here? Is it that you're pushing forward your expectation? Or do you think there's some lost business that you simply can't gain back?",64

I'm glad you asked. There's one major delta from last - from our previous guidance. About, I would say, a couple of quarters ago, I would have thought that on balance, that Samsung was one of our largest customers as they were last year. But looking forward, my sense is on balance, Samsung will use their own application processors. They'll dabble outside probably and they'll use outside application processors like ours whenever their own can't serve their needs. But on balance, they're going to try to use their own. And so that's the big delta that I've taken off of my guidance.",107

But if you think along the lines of where we currently guided versus a typical Q1 -- and some of that, we call it -- we're $100 million-plus short and call some of that -- some of that resulted from 28-nanometer yield and shortage, and some of that resulting from disk drives shortage. And call it half-and-half. So if you were just to take a swag at it, about $50 million.",79

We are doing a CFO search. We have many interesting candidates. I haven't decided on one yet and the reason for that is because I think Karen and the financial team are doing a fabulous job and I have a very -- it allows me to be very choosy and to set a very, very high bar. And so if you do know of someone, ask them to call me, but we have a lot of very interesting candidates. Icera. Icera is going to prove to be one of the smartest and one of the best acquisitions in our history. We are -- we will have shipping modems this year for sure. And hopefully sooner than later. And then our plan is to integrate our application processor, which, as you know, is already one of best in the world, and the Icera modem into an integrated product for the mainstream LTE market. And so we're doing that as quickly as can. And that's one of the reasons why we're investing heavily in OpEx is so that we could build this class of products for a much larger marketplace and a much larger market opportunity for us.",197

I have a couple of quick ones. Firstly, given that your Tegra business has some scale now, how are you thinking about margins in that business going forward? And secondly, what are the key growth opportunities for your professional services -- workstation business in 2012? And is 10% to 15% sort of still the right range to think about annual growth for that business?",73

Let's see. The first question with respect to Tegra. We expect our gross margins to be in the range of the corporate average. And our estimates are that it would be around that area, plus or minus, okay? Nothing dramatically different. Second is growth opportunities for PSG. In the area of workstations, we introduced a concept called Maximus -- not a concept, a platform technology called Maximus. And it allows for the workstation to not only visualize but it also allows it to compute. So you could do simultaneous simulation of fluid dynamics while seeing the fluid flow over a structure like a car or motorcycle or whatever in real time. And so Maximus has been received fantastically, and our hope is that more and more workstations will have not just 1 GPU inside for visualization but 2 GPUs, 1 for visualization and 1 for simulation. Next year -- this year is also the year of Kepler. It's been 2.5 years since firming and supercomputers and supercomputing centers around the world are waiting anxiously for Kepler to launch so that they can upgrade their supercomputers. So that's a growth opportunity for us. In the area of high performance computing as well, we're hoping that the work that we've done to make Tesla much easier to program for -- it's called OpenACC. It's a technique called directives, making it super easy for software programmers to take advantage of GPU computing and we've worked with industry on that. It's an open standard. So we're excited about the developments of that. The response has been fabulous. And hopefully that making GPUs easier to program will also increase its adoption. And so those are some of the growth initiatives that we have going in. And our expectation is that Quadro and Tesla in combination would PSG, will deliver a record year again this year.",313

Good morning, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call on the first quarter of fiscal 2013 results. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Burns, Interim Chief Financial Officer. 
After our prepared remarks, we will open up the call to a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website and is also being recorded. A replay of the conference call will be available via telephone until May 15, 2012, and the webcast will be available for replay until our conference call to discuss our financial results for our second quarter of fiscal 2013. The content of today's conference call is NVIDIA's property and cannot be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent.
During the course of this call, we will make -- we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2012 and the reports we may file from time to time on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
All our statements are made as of today, May 11, 2012, based on information available to us as of today. And except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. 
Unless otherwise noted, all references to market research and market share numbers throughout the call come from Mercury Research or Jon Peddie Research.
During this call, we may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our financial release, which is posted on our website or in the case of our fiscal year 2013 outlook, the reconciliation is posted on our Investor Relations website.
With that, let me begin. Each of NVIDIA's businesses performed at least in line with expectations for the quarter with notebook graphics and Tegra coming in slightly higher than we had anticipated. As expected, we faced headwinds from the soft economy and hard, hard drive prices -- high hard drive prices, which passed the PC mix away from the channel in favor of OEMs. 
However, our competitive position was enhanced in mid-March with the launch of our new Kepler GPU architecture. Kepler is more powerful, more compact and more efficient than anything before it. Kepler is also our first architecture to include virtualization technology built right into the GPU. And we'll talk more about what that means at our GPU Technology Conference next week and at our upcoming Analyst Day on May 24.
Our first Kepler product was the GeForce GTX 680, which is 10% faster, 20% smaller and 22% more power efficient than its direct competitor. Of more than 130 media reviews published so far, each and every one of the recommended our GeForce GTX 680 over the competition. Kepler is the most efficient GPU architecture we've ever created and we expect this to translate into more market share and higher margins. 
Less than 2 weeks ago, we launched our second GeForce Kepler product, the GeForce GTX 690, which uses 2 Kepler GPUs to set a new bar for performance. The 690 is a gorgeous piece of engineering and industrial design, and this is widely noted by the press. The public reaction speaks to its degree of craftmanship and pride our engineers and designers put into their product. PC Magazine, which is a mainstream technology publication, described it as the card to cherish. Enthusiast sites went even further with HardOCP calling it the most perfect card they've ever tested. Their review found it to be, and I quote, ""the finest looking, best performing, most efficient jewel GPU card in the world with unsurpassed design and engineering.""
And yesterday, we launched the GTX 670 to even better reviews. 
These cards enter a healthy PC gaming market. We launched the 690 at our GeForce LAN/NVIDIA Gaming Festival in Shanghai. The event had 8,000 live attendees competing with a passion that has to be seen to be believed, and more than 1 million people viewed the 2-day contest online. 
Note that revenue hit a record in the first quarter as we refreshed our notebook GPUs top to bottom with the launch of the GeForce 600M series. The unprecedented power efficiency of GeForce 600M notebook GPUs has enabled new notebook form factors like that of the Acer Aspire Ultrabook M3. Putting a GeForce 600M GPU in an Ultrabook makes the Ultrabook truly worthy of the ultra tag. 
All indicators are that the strong growth will continue for our notebook business through 2Q -- Q2 and Q3 driven by Kepler design wins on the Ivy Bridge platform. Our visibility into OEM builds suggests that the attach rate, stable for the last 3 years, will remain strong. 
We'll be instituting more Kepler GPUs in the coming quarters. Demand is high for Kepler and although supply will continue to improve, we are not able to meet all our OEM and channel demand in Q2. We do not expect the 28-nanometer supply situation to resolve itself until later this year. This is factored into our current outlook. At this point, we can sell everything we can get. 
I'll now turn to our Tegra business. The world's first Tegra 3 phone was launched in February by HTC. The HTC One X is their new flagship product and has delighted reviewers worldwide. This is the first phone we've had that launched day one across multiple carriers. Tegra 3 gives it a long battery life, thanks to the 4-PLUS-1 quad-core architecture, console gaming -- console quality gaming and fast web browsing. And because Tegra 3 utilizes a specially enhanced 40-nanometer process, it's not affected by 28-nanometer supply constraints. 
Other phone wins around -- announced at Mobile World Congress includes ZTE with the first Tegra plus Icera phones, Fujitsu, LG and K-Touch. Tegra 3 phones are now shipping from 22 carriers in Europe and Asia and more will follow shortly.
The launch this past quarter of the first 2 phones with Icera baseband processor signals a new opportunity for NVIDIA to penetrate the mainstream smartphone market and to capture a greater share of the silicon bond in each phone. Looking forward, you'll see Tegra 3 LTE phones with partners' baseband processors in the second half of this year and then next year with our own LTE baseband processors as well. 
Additionally, we remain very excited about Tegra's opportunity in Windows on ARM. Progress continued this quarter with Microsoft shipping development PCs powered by NVIDIA's Tegra 3 mobile processor to Windows 8 developers and to device makers. Microsoft, itself, has made some important recent announcements about Windows on ARM, particularly those referring to its ability for enterprise application. And related, Forrester has predicted that 375 million tablets will ship in 2016 and almost 1/3 of these will be bought directly by business. Even for the rest, Forrester believes that most consumers will use them for work as well as at home. 
Before handing things over to Karen, I'd like to remind everyone that our annual GPU Technology Conference takes place next week. We're bringing together several thousands of sciences, engineers and academics together to share, learn and network. Jen-Hsun will be presenting a major keynote at 10:30 a.m. on May 15, and it's well worth listening online if you can't be there in person. We'll also have keynotes from a Princeton researcher using GPUs to model collective behavior and the leader of a team competing for the Lunar X PRIZE. Many of the best minds in computing will be there. 
Finally, I want to highlight our Annual Investor Day on May 24. If you'd like to attend, please e-mail me or visit our website at nvidia.com/ir to register. 
Now, over to Karen.",1344

Revenue was at the high end of our outlook at $924.9 million on the strength of our new Kepler GPUs we launched in the quarter, as well as from strong performances in our notebook and Tegra businesses. GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 50.1%. Non-GAAP was 50.4%, both at the high end of our outlook, again on the strength of our new Kepler GPUs and desktop and notebook.
Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were 1.3 and 2.1 percentage points lower than the prior quarter, respectively, largely due to the impact of 28-nanometer supply shortage that we experienced for our new Kepler products. GAAP OpEx was $390.5 million, non-GAAP was $348 million, both slightly above our outlook. The quarter-on-quarter increase was largely attributable to planned hiring and related infrastructure spending to support our strategic businesses as well as the impact of the payroll FICA tax reset that affects every first quarter. 
These results contributed to a GAAP net income of $60.4 million for the quarter or $0.10 per diluted share and non-GAAP net income of $97.5 million or $0.16 per diluted share, both slightly above the midpoint of our expectations.
Revenue results by business segment were as follows: Our GPU business was down 6.7% quarter-on-quarter due to the 28-nanometer supply shortage, which largely impacted our high-end desktop business as well as shorted supply for our new Kepler GPUs for notebook. Our professional business was down slightly at 4.2% from the fourth quarter, within normal seasonality. Our Consumer business was up 20.8% on the strength of our Tegra business as we've launched Tegra 3 for smartphones and tablets, offset by a decrease in our embedded business. 
For GAAP, our outlook for the second quarter is as follows: revenue of $990 million to $1.05 billion, gross margin of 51.2% plus or minus 1 percentage point, OpEx of approximately $418 million. 
Our GAAP OpEx outlook for Q2 includes a onetime charge related to our corporate donation to Stanford Hospital of $25 million payable over a 10-year period. 
We approximate our tax rate for the quarter at 20% plus or minus 1 percentage point.
For non-GAAP, we expect the following differences from our GAAP outlook: gross margin of 51.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point, OpEx of approximately $354 million, which excludes the $25 million onetime charge related to our contribution to Stanford, as well as stock-based compensation and certain other charges related to acquisition.
Outlook for the second quarter depreciation and amortization are expected in the range of $55 million to $57 million and capital expenditures of $35 million to $45 million. Diluted shares are expected to be approximately 628 million.",441

Supply is still constrained, and our manufacturers are working their hearts out to catch up to our demand. But at the moment, demand still continues to exceed supply, and we expect that to happen for throughout the year as Chris was saying earlier. But Kepler is a fantastic, fantastic GPU. This is arguably the best we've ever made, and we've made some pretty fantastic GPUs over the years, and we're just in the process of rolling out Kepler into each and every one of our businesses and -- starting with desktop. There are still many, many segments within desktop that we're expecting to transition into Kepler throughout the year and throughout next year. There's a notebook that's in the process of rolling out now, and we started shipping this quarter and that -- or this last quarter, and that explains the big jump up and we're expecting another jump up this coming quarter. But Kepler is our GPU that goes into GeForce and Quadro and Tesla. And this upcoming week at GTC, I'd love to tell you about some of the new ideas around GPUs, and so Kepler is the core of many of our businesses. And when our GPU architecture is incredibly successful, you could see it drive all of our businesses for several years. And so my guess is that this will do again the same. And of course, Tegra 3 is ramping as we talked about before. Although we don't have LTE at the moment, LTE is predominantly a U.S.-centric phenomenon. Outside of the United States, the big superphone upgrade is quad-core. And Tegra 3 is the world's first quad-core and it's even a special quad-core at that with 4-PLUS-1, and it's got NVIDIA's branded graphics and all of our style of doing wonderful graphics and the video games and the content really shows. And so Tegra 3 is the next major upgrade for superphones in Europe and in China and elsewhere. And then towards the end of the year, we hope to bring Tegra 3 with LTE phones to United States.",353

On that 28-nanometer shortage side of things, do you expect the solution to that problem to be more yield-driven by your primary supplier or -- I think in the past you've talked about looking to potentially diversify to additional foundries, so would the supply coming on from those potential suppliers fix the problem as well?",63
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q1 2013 Earnings Call, May 11, 2012",2012-05-11,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3617.0,305367.0,14994560.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,12,"Yields of 28 are probably the best of any new node that TSMC has ever done. They've done a great job with 28, and I think that it also explains the demand on their 28. It's yielding wonderfully at this point in its ramp. The performance is fabulous. The efficiency, energy efficiency, is terrific. So I think it explains the reason why the demand is so great for this particular node. I think the increased supply will have to come from increased capacity and it's -- we're short now, and every chip that they can come out of their fab is being shipped instantaneously. We've reduced cycle time dramatically between us and our customers, and we're trying to get the products to market as quickly as possible.

So your 28-nanometer yields are good and we've heard this from other -- from some of your peers as well who are also constrained by TSMC supply. Was the problem that the customers of Taiwan Semi just didn't give a bullish enough forecast so that TSMC didn't add sufficient capacity, or was there sort of a misunderstanding in the planning process? Can you maybe help us understand a little bit of the dynamic that's going on between you and your supplier?",92

And the reason for that is because we've known for some time that Kepler is going to be a fantastic GPU and we've had big plans for Kepler, and we invested last year rather aggressively on the various designs of Kepler and all of the capabilities that people were starting to learn about Kepler, and there are many more to come. And we made those investments because we expected to be able to grow the market, and there's every evidence that we're growing the market. There's just not enough capacity and the planning process when we think about these new nodes, it just simply needs to be better. And I don't think there's any way around that. In combination between us and TSMC, we under planned for the supply of 28-nanometer, and we need to fix that in the future.",159

Is that a structural change where you're seeing potentially lower margins because you're much more tied to just the one supplier?",73

And so it's really a shortage of supply that is causing our margins to be compressed at the moment, but we expect that to be cured as we go through the year.

And then there are many other Tegra 3 phones that are teed up and coming to market. And so we're expecting the phone segment of Tegra 3 to continue to grow. There's also tablets. Tablets are doing very well for us. It represents about half of the overall demand at the moment, and there's some pretty exciting tablets that are about to come out throughout this year that we're working on.

And so I think at the moment, it's safe to say that supply is what's constraining, what's holding our margins back. As supply improves and yields will be improving throughout the year, I think we have every chance and every possibility of delivering great margins again. And so I think the #1 issue for us right now is just to make sure that we have enough supply of Kepler GPUs. And if that comes through, the margins will take care of itself.",100

Primarily, the reason for that is because Kepler is such an energy-efficient GPU and the performance and the energy efficiency of the performance is just the best in the world, and I think that people are recognizing that. Ivy Bridge hasn't really changed anything from our perspective. The market structure seems to be consistent as it was before. Consumer demand continues to be quite high and consumers -- one of the most important applications for it is video games, and video games still prefer to have GeForce. And so I think all of those dynamics are still consistent. OEMs still would like to have ways to differentiate their products, and adding the GeForce processor has been one of the best ways to differentiate and create a premium segment and it remains that way. And so whether it's thinner notebooks or Ivy Bridge, I don't think that, that's really changed the dynamics. So we're expecting attach rates to be quite healthy and consistent with the past.",195

We have an understanding about wafer prices from TSMC and we negotiate with them and we now both understand where the pricing is, and so I don't expect a pricing increase and I surely hope it doesn't happen. With respect to margins, the reason why margins are great on Kepler is because it's a really efficient GPU. It's higher performance, it's lower power and for every performance level, it's also very efficient in terms of die size. And if that's the case, then our margins would lift. It is the most efficient architecture we've ever done and certainly relative to Fermi, our last-generation GPU, Kepler is much more efficient. And as you know, efficiency drives productivity, and in this particular case, productivity is margins. And so I expect that the more Kepler we ship, the higher our margins would lift. And so the really big focus for us is just to continue to ship as many Keplers as we can.",171

There's just more of it than last quarter. I would say last quarter was not a typical quarter for us. I would characterize last quarter as a difficult quarter, and it was completely supply constrained. And this coming quarter, we're still supply constrained. And although it's a significant growth quarter, it is still difficult from my perspective, and the supply is still far short of demand. And the second part of our growth comes from Tegra 3's ramp, and we're really fortunate with Tegra 3 to have chosen an enhanced version of the 40-nanometer process. This is a technology called LPG, and we're the only one in the world using it. And it is a balance between high performance as well as extremely low power. TSMC did a fabulous job with us on that, and I really appreciate it because now we can support Tegra 3's ramp without consuming more of the 28-nanometer wafers that we can allocate to Kepler. And so I think the answer is, quite simply, more supply and more supply of 28-nanometer and Tegra 3's ramp that's contributing to the growth.",199

The first one was we were all in a room all day yesterday at a small company in Santa Clara and there was a lot of talk about the structural advantage that Intel had going down in node. So just wanted your perspective since you do -- are one of the fabless companies that uses leading-edge technology and ultimately the first and the follow-up to that -- kind of related to that was as we go down in node, and some of the fabless companies have talked about going down in 20-nanometer, and what does that do to potentially margin or affects headwind.

There's nothing that would suggest that TSMC doesn't have the scale or the capabilities to do so. They're manufacturing an enormous number of wafers by anyone's standards, and so I think the availability of leading-edge wafers is not something I'm overly concerned about. In terms of process technology, it's also important to recognize that CPU's needs for process technology and SoC's needs for process technology is similar but not the same. And TSMC's leadership and density is something that can't be ignored. People always talk about one dimension of the semiconductor process, which is the transistor, but metallization is increasingly, especially for SoCs, by far, the most important variable. And so I think that we just need to be careful not to get -- drink too much marketing bathwater when we think about the technology variable because it's so complicated and SoCs are very different than CPUs. And so let's see, the second is margins. Our job is to make sure that we continue to create efficient architectures that are highly valued, and I think that if we continue to do and create GPUs like Kepler, I think we're going to be doing just fine.",228

I think the question comes into the economic advantage that the advanced technology is going to deliver. Are you getting the cost reduction? Clearly, 28 appears to be delivering that.

This is a conversation that we have at every node and we take every node seriously. And there's no evidence that anyone is becoming increasingly complacent, and so I think these are typical conversations to have. With respect to efficiency or productivity of each node, we will go into the node when it delivers value for the products that we need to create. And so if it makes no sense to go to a new node, we wait until it make sense to go to a new node. And so there isn't anything that -- nobody is in automatic cruise control, and we look at each node carefully with TSMC and we try to adjust each node if we can improve it for our products and otherwise. And then based on those analysis, we decide which products and when should go into the new nodes. And so it just simply needs to be analyzed. I don't -- there's nothing that suggests that the next node is going to be unproductive. If it's unproductive, it won't get used, and so my expectation is that it will be productive.",196

As we look at the gross margin issues, can you talk about -- because one of the areas you've highlighted in the past is PSB and the future opportunities that, that brings. What are the gross margin drivers for going down the line, and I'm talking about looking at other areas, so if you can talk specifically on PSB. And also on Tegra, as these constraints happen across the group and then Qualcomm talked about it, do you see yourself increasingly gaining share going down the line on Tegra 3? That's my first question, please.",98
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q1 2013 Earnings Call, May 11, 2012",2012-05-11,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3617.0,305367.0,14994609.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,61,"Okay. First, I'll answer the question backwards. Well, the answer is yes, we're gaining share. And the reason for that is because we were a very small player before. And as a discrete application processor provider, we've gained quite a bit of share. If you look at their market, our competitor's market -- business around discrete application processors, I think that you'll find that our share is growing quite rapidly. And so my expectation is that as we grow throughout the year that we're doing so because we're growing share, number one. Number two, PSB's gross margins are healthy and slightly improving, and the reason for that is because we continue to add more value to the high end of the visual computing market. Digital content creation is a growing market, and more and more of design is moving to digital forms, and this is an area that we are world leaders at and this is an area that we continue to add a lot of value to the industry on. And so as we increase value to the marketplace, we'll reward it with higher margins. And our focus is to make sure that PSB, where we have extremely high share already, that we continue to help grow the market. And that's one of the focus next week of GTC. If you all have a chance to either tune in or come even down to GTC, you're going to find some really, really fantastic work being done around the world by our partners and content developers who are using our technology to create wonderful assets and create wonderful things and discovery of new science.",274

Let me just ask you a second question. Can you give us any updates on Windows on ARM as well the efforts in terms of timing of products coming, especially as Intel is making a big push in that category as well on the tablet front? So any commentary on development on the PC form factor on tablets and Windows 8 and regarding timing as well, that'd be helpful. That's one question. And then two, Kepler, it's been said that you will need Kepler in volume to be able to increase discrete attach rates in Ultrabooks. Any commentary as to the attach rates in Ultrabook in general? And how much of that is going to be Kepler? And how much of that will be a print [ph] products? That'll be helpful.",132
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q1 2013 Earnings Call, May 11, 2012",2012-05-11,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3617.0,305367.0,14994611.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,63,"Windows 8 tablets and Windows RT tablets are very different things. Windows 8 x86 tablets and Windows on ARM tablets are very different things. And as Microsoft goes to market, people will understand why we're so enthusiastic about Windows on ARM. They're just very, very different things, and so I'll let Microsoft tell you about their plans, but I'm very enthusiastic about it. I think it makes a lot of sense for enterprise. Anybody who has a large part of their work around Windows would really benefit from Windows on ARM tablets and all the Windows on ARM devices -- range of devices that will be following after that. We've shipped about 1,000, maybe more than 1,000 Tegra Windows on ARM, or Microsoft has shipped more than 1,000 Tegra Windows on ARM tablets for software developers, and that number is growing very rapidly. And so we're working very closely with them to march to market with an exciting product as quickly as we can. Ultrabook, we see no difference between an Ultrabook and a PC. It's a thinner PC, but PCs have been getting thinner. And there's plenty of room from a thermal or mechanical or electrical perspective to support a GPU. And the reason why people put GPUs in their notebooks is because it helps them deliver a premium device. It also enables consumers the ability to enjoy multimedia better. And so I don't see any difference relative to attach rates when it comes to Ultrabooks. And then with respect to Kepler, Kepler is our primary focus for next-generation notebooks and we're trying to build as much as we can. And the more that our supply catches up to the demand, the more our customers can ship Kepler GPUs. Everybody is really, really anxious to get more, and so we need to just make more.",306

I was just wondering if you could compare and contrast how Tegra really, not only from a efficiency perspective, how it compares with the current status quo in the market, number one. And number two, with regard to SDR or software-defined radios and Icera, how do you think that changes the landscape for LTE, I guess, next year and the year -- and beyond?",71
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q1 2013 Earnings Call, May 11, 2012",2012-05-11,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3617.0,305367.0,14994614.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,66,"Well, Tegra 3 is the world's first quad-core processor. And it's not only quad-core, as you might know. It has a really energy-efficient CPU core as well. And so not only does it deliver higher performance, it's also more energy efficient than the status quo. And of course, with all of the products, the graphics and the video games are just so much better. And so I think that based on the demand and the reception in the marketplace for the first Tegra 3 phone, I think it's safe to say that Tegra 3 is really the standard by which everything is being compared, number one. Number two, software-defined radio, there's no question that SDR allows us to deliver a much smaller and efficient and cost-efficient modem. And with LTE, it is very clear that the die size is smaller, the energy efficiency is excellent and that's really going to help, especially with capacity being so constrained. Having a very small modem, a very small LTE modem, is going to be a big differentiator for us. Not only will we be able to make more of integrated versions of application processors and LTE modems, we'll also be able to bring more cost-effective solutions to the marketplace. So we're really, really gunning for that and running as hard as we can.",220

And this is new for us, and we still have a lot to learn and we're learning as fast as we can. But the Icera SDR modem is really revolutionary and when we can combine that -- and there's every evidence it works great. We're shipping phones now. There were people said that we couldn't get that modem to market, people said that we couldn't get phone's voice to work. But obviously, all wrong. We're now certified on LTE and we're in the process of getting products to market. And so these are all barriers that we have to overcome, but we're taking it -- ticking it off one at a time and we're -- I'm cautious, but very enthusiastic about the technology we're bringing to the market.",140

Is that smaller die or is that a value proposition that customers pay for and just allows you to kind of get that upgrade?",47
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q1 2013 Earnings Call, May 11, 2012",2012-05-11,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3617.0,305367.0,14994619.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,71,"Well, absolutely both, absolutely both. Kepler is the most energy-efficient. It's also the most die size-efficient GPU we've ever made. The performance per watt and the performance per millimeter are both the best that we've ever done. It was a huge drive for our company to transform ourselves in just about every single dimension from architecture to design to implementation to software. We pulled everything together for Kepler. When you're more energy-efficient, at any level of power that the system can provide will be higher performance. And so if the system can provide 300 watts, we're higher performance. If the system can provide for only 10 watts, we're higher performance. If the system can provide 1 watt in the future, we'll be higher performance. So energy efficiency is incredibly important. And of course, at any price point in the marketplace, if we are efficient with respect to die size, that can only help our gross margins. Whatever gross margins we had at the Fermi generation, so long as market dynamics remain similar, I expect our gross margins to be higher than the Fermi generation wherever that happens to be. And so that explains why I'm so impatient to get Kepler lined [ph] up and why we need so much more Kepler supply from TSMC.",214

And my other question, Jen-Hsun, is in January, you had a Microsoft representative in CES and you asked them about how Windows -- Microsoft would avoid confusion as Windows on ARM came out, and you may defer this question to Microsoft, but what's your update on that thought as we look ahead to Microsoft tablets?",56

They've been very thoughtful about the segmentation of the Windows -- the next Windows generation. There are different customers with different needs, and I think you're going to find their answer rather thoughtful. I'm very pleased with where they ended up and I think it's going to really, really, really help the positioning of the Windows on ARM tablets because they're very different than those -- than x86. It's a new product category. I think you're going to find that they're really desirable, and they're going to bring a lot of value to the marketplace. For people who -- where Windows and Office is still a very central part of their digital experience, I think you're going to find that this is really the best tablet on the planet.",141

No, no change to that. No additional color. The 3 growth drivers for Tegra are: One, phone design wins; and two, because we've successfully reduced the costs of tablets, we're starting to reach price points of Android tablets that are really resonating with the market and of course, the Android tablets are just getting better and better all the time, and Tegra 3 Android tablets are really delightful. And there's a whole bunch of new tablet that are coming starting now and towards the end of the year. And then the third driver is Windows on ARM. That's coming together really nicely, and I think that people are going to be quite delighted by it. And so those are really the 3 primary drivers and they, all 3, remain drivers at the moment.",135

The OpEx went up about 7% sequentially. It's being guided up again. So now we're kind of at the high end of your OpEx range. How should we look at the OpEx throughout this year?

The more we ship, the more -- the higher our ASPs will be. And so Kepler ASPs are higher than Fermi ASPs because they target the premium segments. Kepler margins are better than Fermi margins because they're in the enthusiast segment and the performance segments, also because they're so much more energy-efficient and so much more die size-efficient. And so I think the simple answer is we just need a lot more Keplers, and the demand for Kepler is really, really high in desktops, in notebooks. The gamers come out and refresh their PCs once every few years. And on all accounts, Kepler has been a complete home run. And this is -- it's pulling people out to refresh their PCs, it's -- and PC gaming is really vibrant right now. And so I think those factors are really driving Kepler. So the more we can build, the higher ASPs we will be and surely the much higher margins we will be.",182

Good afternoon, and welcome to NVIDIA’s conference call on second quarter of fiscal 2013 results. With me on the call today from nVIDIA are Jen Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Burns, Interim Chief Financial Officer.
After our prepared remarks we will open up the call to a question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one initial question with one follow up.
Before we begin I’d like to remind you that today’s call is being webcast live on NVIDIA’s Investor Relations website and is also being recorded. A replay of the conference call will be available via telephone until August 16, 2012, and the webcast will be available for replay until our conference call to discuss our financial results for our third quarter of fiscal 2013.
The content of today’s conference call is NVIDIA’s property and cannot be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent.
During the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business please refer to the disclosure in today’s earnings release, our Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 29, 2012, and the reports we may file from time-to-time on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
All our statements are made as of today, August 9, 2012, based on information available to us as of today and except as required by law we assume no obligation to update any such statements.
Unless otherwise noted all references to market research and market share numbers throughout the call come from Mercury Research or John Peddie Research.
During this call we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our financial release which is posted on our website. With that, let’s begin.
We’re pleased to report a better than expected quarter driven by Kepler, the best GPU we have ever built, and Tegra 3, the world’s first quad-core mobile processor. Kepler is the most capable as well as the most energy efficient GPU architecture we’ve ever created. Kepler drove a record quarter for our notebook business based on the beginning of market share gains. And we believe that due to the later timing of Ivy Bridge rollout this year, the lion’s share of market share gains are still to come in the third quarter.
Our desktop GPU business was also up this quarter from strong GeForce GTX sales. Up to now, due to supply limitations, we have only been able to address the enthusiast market.
Finally, we’re able to bring Kepler to the core PC gaming market. From our data of the global install base, roughly 80% of gamers have graphics cards that are below the recommended specifications of the wave of new games coming out in the second half of the year. Kepler is the perfect upgrade for the millions of PC gamers around the world. Kepler will soon be flowing into our professional businesses.
Our Professional Solutions business was down slightly in the second quarter from the previous quarter but with the recent introduction of the Tesla K10 and K20 GPU for high-performance computing, we anticipate growth again for Tesla starting next quarter as it begins to ship.
Tegra had a record quarter. As you and the press have obviously noted, Tegra 3 is showing up in some of the world’s most exciting mobile devices and the business is ramping. Google recently announced and launched to tremendous response the Nexus 7, the world’s first $199 quad-core 7-inch tablet. The Nexus 7 runs the newest version of Android 4.1, Jelly Bean. It is the perfect device for the hundreds of millions of consumers who use Android phones and would like to enjoy the same content on a larger display.
Microsoft this quarter, unveiled its own Windows RT powered tablet called Surface, again driven by a Tegra processor. A groundbreaking mobile device powered by Tegra 3 was Fujitsu’s ARROWS X, the world’s first quad-core LTE smartphone, which began shipping into Japan.
Tegra processors also began shipping in automobiles this quarter, powering Tesla Motors’ Model S 17-inch touch screen infotainment and navigation system, the largest ever in a passenger car. Tegra also powers its all-digital instrument cluster. For drivers, the system provides larger, more-readable maps and a beautifully rendered instrument cluster that can be personalized from the multi-function steering wheel.
With that, let me hand the call over to Karen.",769

Revenue of $1.04 billion increased 13% quarter-over-quarter meeting the high-end of our outlook. Driving this strong demand for our desktop - driving this were strong demand for our desktop GTX GPUs and record quarters for our notebook and Tegra products. GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 51.8% and non-GAAP was 52%, representing an increase from Q1 of 1.7% and 1.6 percentage points, respectively. Improved 28-nanometer supply enabled us to ship more of our Kepler GPUs in the high-end segments.
GAAP OpEx was $401.1 million and non-GAAP was $342.5 million, both much better than our outlook. GAAP OpEx was up on our announced charitable contribution of $25 million. Its net present value of $20.1 million was charged to OpEx as a nonrecurring item. Non-GAAP, which excluded this charge, was down from the prior quarter benefiting from lower discretionary expenses. These results contributed to GAAP net income of $119 million, a 97% increase over the prior quarter equivalent to $0.19 per diluted share, which was up 90%. Non-GAAP net income was $170.4 million, a 75% increase from Q1, equivalent to $0.27 per diluted share, a 69% increase.
Revenue results by business segment were as follows. Our GPU business was up 15% sequentially due to the strong demand for our desktop performance and enthusiast products, and growing notebook share as the industry continues to move to the Ivy Bridge platform.
Our Professional business was down 8% sequentially due to continued weak economic conditions in Europe and the slower ramp of Romley platforms. Our Consumer business was up 36% on the strength of our Tegra business.
While we continue to be supply constrained, our GAAP outlook for the third quarter is as follows: revenue of $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion; gross margin of 51.8%, flat from the second quarter; OpEx of approximately $390 million. We expect our tax rate for the quarter to be 20% plus or minus 1 percentage point.
For non-GAAP, we expect the following differences from our GAAP outlook: gross margin at 52%, flat from Q2; OpEx of approximately $350 million, which excludes stock-based compensation and certain other charges related to acquisitions in aggregate of approximately $40 million. Depreciation and amortization are expected to be in the range of $57 million to $59 million and capital expenditures of $30 million to $40 million. Diluted shares are expected to be approximately 630 million.",394

Are conditions different this year? Should we expect it to play out similarly this year?",42
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2012",2012-08-09,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3713.0,346200.0,16758246.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,6,"Well, we wouldn’t have guided what we guided if we didn’t have faith and confidence in the Tegra growth. The difference I guess may be more important to talk about is this year, I think that it is relatively clear that the Android tablet, particularly Nexus 7, the Transformers from ASUS they’re doing really well.
And the reason for that is because it has taken us some time to get the cost, the functionality and the quality of the experience really, really good. You now know that there are hundreds of millions of Android phones around the world and whereas the first tablets when they first came out was introduced with the Honeycomb operating system, the Honeycomb operating system was very different from the Android phone operating system at the time.
But now with Jelly Bean and Ice Cream Sandwich, the applications and the investments that you make in your Android phone, all of those applications just magically show up on your Android tablet and so this Android tablet is a really wonderful, higher resolution and larger format display for you to enjoy your content when you’re not running around, when you’re sitting at home. And so if you haven’t had a chance to try the Nexus 7 I really urge you to. It’s the first thing I use in the morning and it’s the last thing I use at night. And it’s really wonderful that all of the applications and all of my content stay synchronized between my One X phone and the Nexus 7 tablet.
And so I think that the momentum of the products that we have are much stronger. Our position in the market is much stronger. And we’ll see how these devices do in the marketplace. But at the moment, we’re quite confident in their position in the market.",304

How much of it is Romley delay? How much are product specific issues? When should we expect that to pick up?",38
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2012",2012-08-09,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3713.0,346200.0,16758248.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,8,"Well, Quadro and Tesla are unique in the marketplace and we’ve gained share if anything. So the market position of Quadro and Tesla are very good. Their value proposition are very unique and the people that buy Quadro and Tesla buy it because they need it. It’s not a discretionary expense. They need those products. During times when the economy is a little slower and right now, as you know, the economy is rather slow in Europe and in China that affects people’s enterprise consumption. So that’s a factor.
The other factor is the Romley platform launch. It’s a very important platform. And it started out in servers and it’s in the process of moving into workstations and I’ve got a lot of confidence in Intel’s execution. They will ramp up those workstation platforms and the OEMs are all fully charged up to ramp up those workstation platforms. And then on top of that we have the Kepler GPUs that are flowing into Quadro and flowing into Tesla and so I think the trajectory is good and I think things will work itself out.",184

You talked about being - still being in a supply challenged environment. I’m just curious how much business you feel like you might’ve left on the table? And separately, if you could talk about the trajectory of your 28-nanometer supply and whether or not you feel like your shortages are going to subside this quarter?",65

And we expect to be supply constrained throughout the quarter. We’ve taken the supply constraints in consideration for our guidance. And if the supply situation comes in the way we expect, we’ll have some upside. And I know that TSMC is working as hard as they can for us and so we’ll report on what we learn at the end of the quarter.",75

I think that some of your other competitors out there are trying to ramp at least an integrated processor baseband solution. What are your plans there? Are you guys still on track to really introduce, I guess, codename Grey, sometime in the next couple quarters here?",65

And you need to have a world-class software stack. These phones are increasingly becoming computers. It’s not just a telephone anymore. And so having a software stack that allows you to concurrently use all of the wonderful things that we’ve come to know our phone and more is really, really hard to do. And there are very few companies that provide that today. And the third of course is a state-of-the-art modem and baseband.
And that is exactly the reason why we bought a company called Icera. And our intention is to integrate those 3 major pieces to provide a really great platform for our customers. We haven’t announced when Grey is going to be available in the marketplace, but we’re working as hard as we can for it and when we do introduce it, it would, as you’d expect and as the reason why you’re asking, expand our market position and expand our market potential tremendously.",203

GeForce is growing faster than the sequential rate. Tegra is growing much faster than the sequential rate.

When you guys initially discussed Tegra 3 wins you’d mentioned that China was a big component of that. And wanted to just get a sense from you how you think that business will ramp? Is it white box or branded names? And what kind of ASPs of phones will you be selling into?,62
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2012",2012-08-09,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3713.0,346200.0,16758258.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,18,"Yes, we’re just now ramping into the China, what we call the affordable superphone segment. Basically, all of the capabilities of today’s superphone but really engineered for affordability and Tegra 3 has such a great reputation, the software stack is really exquisite and so we’re quite excited about it. There are many phones being created right now. A couple of them have been announced and we’re expecting them to ramp shortly. We still expect China to be a big market opportunity for us.
If you look at the overall market, the U.S. is very LTE-centric. Korea is very LTE-centric. It’s very important to have LTE and we don’t have a very good position there until our i500 standalone LTE modem starts - goes into production and when our integrated solution goes into production. Until then, our target is really focused on the superphone and the premium phones in the non-LTE parts of the marketplace and that would be Europe that would be Asia and China. And so, we still expect those to be really terrific markets for us.",178

How much of a role do you play in that versus other components in the phone that - where they can make different choices?",46

And then one last quick question on the non-Apple tablet market, you alluded to the idea that you do see momentum there and it sounds like that momentum is better than last year. I guess really just trying to get a sense of your confidence level there, how much bigger perhaps you think the opportunity is, not necessarily for you but for the market, the non-Apple market this year versus last year?",73
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2012",2012-08-09,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3713.0,346200.0,16758262.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,22,"Well, I think we found the position. For every product, if you want to be like another product and something like iPad, it’s not particularly a smart, smart strategy. But the Nexus 7’s value proposition is not to be a cheaper iPad. It’s to be a peripheral or a companion device for someone who’s really invested in the Android operating system. And the Nexus 7 finally, from a tablet perspective, made it really, really easy for you to enjoy and to synchronize all of your content that you’ve already invested in for your Android phone to just magically show up on your Nexus 7 device. It tells - just picks up where I left off when I’m reading a book. All of my music is there. All my books are there. All the readers are there. It’s just - it’s the same e-mail. It’s just fantastic.
And so when I’m traveling, when I’m running around during the day, I use my One X and when I get home I turn on my Nexus and I just pick up where I left off. And so, I think that the value proposition is just much more clear now and the build quality is fantastic. ASUS did a fantastic job. Google did a fantastic job with Jelly Bean. Google Play is really easy to use.
Magazines are there. Books are there. Movies are there. And so, I think it’s taken this long to really build a platform that adds value to Android users. And so that’s the value proposition. It’s not an alternative to an iPad. It’s really a device that enhances the user experience for someone who’s an Android user and there happens to be hundreds of millions of Android users. And so I think this is a - I think the niche is really well met and I think they’ve done a really good job.",314

And then do you expect desktop or notebook to be up more for Q3?,40
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2012",2012-08-09,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3713.0,346200.0,16758266.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,26,"Desktop and notebook were both up strongly in Q2. And we expect both of them to yet again be up strongly in Q3. In the case of notebook GPUs, we’re ramping - you probably know that Ivy Bridge ramp was delayed because the market was kind of soft.
And now, Ivy Bridge is ramping up strongly and our market share for Ivy Bridge is the best we’ve ever had and the reason why it’s the best we’ve ever had is because the Kepler GPU is really the best GPU we’ve ever created and its energy efficiency is just so fantastic that the market demand for it is really strong, so we expect to gain share and we expect to ramp up Ivy Bridge in Q3.
In the case of desktop, there are several factors working in our favor. One is the PC gaming marketplace is just really, really, really strong. PC gaming is a vibrant segment. All the game developers are talking about it. It’s a platform where free to play has become very important and whether here in the United States or China or Europe, we’re seeing strength in PC gaming. And we’re about to introduce and we just started ramping into it, our Kepler GPU that is targeted squarely at the gamers. And the segment starts out at about $99 and goes all the way up to about $249.
And those segments, we haven’t been able to address until now. And we’ve not been able to address it because we just haven’t had enough supply. And now that the supply is starting to catch up and gives us enough supply to launch into that segment and that segment is just dying for Kepler, and finally we’re be able to bring Kepler to them.
And then lastly, Q2 was quite a shock in the system. We had - or Q1 was quite a shock in the system. We had the convergence of a couple of issues. One of them was the shortage of 28-nanometer supply. And that was very surprising to us and to a lot of people. And the second issue was the flood in Thailand that raised the cost of disk drives, which affects the desktop market, as you know. And both of those issues are working themselves out. And so we got a lot of positive momentum driving the desktop market. And the market is really, really strong. We’re feeling a lot of positive momentum right now.",411

And then as a follow up, obviously the Tegra business very, very strong, as you mentioned. Could you maybe share with us any updated expectations in terms of Tegra revenue for the year?

Integration’s a good thing. If you look at connectivity a multi-function connectivity chip goes for something along the lines of about $3, $3 to $4, but an LTE modem is $20 to $25. And so the important thing is to focus on the important thing first and so we’ve taken off a big bite and we’re working on LTE integration and so I’m quite excited about the integrated version.
There are very few companies in the world that have the ability to build an integrated platform based on a world-class application processor, a world-class software stack and a world-class modem and that’s - they are 3 things that are very, very hard to do and I think we’re one of those companies that can pull it together and when we get that done, we’ll think about other things.

And we’re selling into a marketplace with quite a bit of pent-up demand for Kepler. Yields are improving.
And we’d like them to improve even faster because when you improve yield faster with our wafer buy business model that we talked about some 3 quarters ago, your units grow and your margins grow.

The VGX is targeted at enterprise. Our partners there would include the virtualization companies, Citrix, VMware and Microsoft. The OEMs that we would be working with there are the best OEMs in the world in the enterprise space. And we announced that Cisco would be working with us and so we’re really excited about that work. And so all of us are working on integrating software, building servers, and introducing them to customers and so on.
On the GRID side, that’s targeted at gamers and cloud gaming is really quite the buzz. One of our partners was bought by Sony recently. Gaikai has been a long-time partner of ours and a development partner on GRID and they were bought by Sony recently, so that’s really exciting.
Now they have quite large financial backing and of course a rich library of content to bring to it. And so, we’re working with the service providers on that side. We don’t have any more to announce at the moment, but we’re very busy working on it.",182

And my sense is that it’s going to stay that way. And the reason for that is because I really feel that the market has held nice positions for alternative tablets, nice positions with really great value proposition, a really good reason to buy it and really affordable and really exquisitely made. And so, I think we’re finally seeing the convergence of all of these wonderful things in non-iPad tablets. And so, we’re delighted by the early success and the demand out in the marketplace for the tablets that we’re in.
I think tablets is likely to be a strong growth opportunity for us, as we had hoped and as we had worked on. A lot of people think that the tablet market in just a few more years will be as large as the entire PC mobile market and based on the information from people that use our tablet today, I really wouldn’t be surprised by that. And so if we can protect and even grow from our current position of tablets, I think this is going to be a very, very large part of our overall business.",202

It’s too early to comment on January. We have so many new things to introduce. I think there is seasonality, there’s market share, there’s supply and there’s new products and so that’s enough variables, enough elements to consider for when we get there. But I’m hoping that supply would be even more improved. I’m hoping that yield would be much more improved. I’m hoping that the market is reasonably robust. But mostly I’m excited about the new products that we’re going to ship.",87

And as a follow up, given what you said about 28-nanometer supply improving further and the yields improving further, how should we think of that with respect to gross margins? Is there still some increase available on the gross margin line as a result of those elements?",49
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2012",2012-08-09,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3713.0,346200.0,16758298.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,58,"Yes, back in the good old days, this is 3 quarters ago, when we started going into wafer buying, our margins are now very, very affected by improving yields. It is a very large lever and if there’s anything that we can do to improve yields, it should be all hands on deck and there’s just a lot more room to improve 28-nanometer yield to the 40-nanometer level.
And so what that says is that as we ramp further and further into 28-nanometer and as we improve yield, it should improve our margins. And the leverage, as you can tell, would be quite significant. And so we should be all hands on deck to improve yield. TSMC is already all hands on deck to improve yield. Nothing could be a greater lever for their ability to increase supply for all of their customers. 
So everybody’s interests are all perfectly aligned.",150

I understand the easing of barriers to adoption with the similarity of phones, but one thing we’re seeing with iPads is a lot of adoption in businesses, particularly services businesses. So perhaps you could give us a sense of whether you think these Android tablets are likely to remain consumer devices? And what proportion you guys are modeling at least for the maybe percentage of users that might want to add a tablet in addition to their Android phone? So what are you thinking about in terms of your market opportunity?",107
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2012",2012-08-09,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3713.0,346200.0,16758301.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,61,"Well, I think it’s taken us 1.5 years to really even build something that appears that the market really loves. And we’ve taken -- during this 1.5 years we’ve worked on some - gosh, 60 tablets, maybe more. And we didn’t give up on it because we believed in the future of it. And I think that people recognize now that we have a lot of expertise in building these and the tablets that we’ve built are really, really delightful. And so I’m really excited about the fact that the positioning of Android tablets is now finally resonating with the marketplace. If you have an Android phone, you ought to go get yourself an Android tablet because all of your content just shows up.
And I think if we could - if we use that - if we extrapolate it from that, surely it’s going to be a very large market. But we’re just going to have to wait and see how it develops. But I’ve got a lot of confidence in the ecosystem and our sales ability to build even greater tablets based around Android. And you can just imagine all the things that people are now doing as they hit this tablet. It’s just going to be really wonderful. So I think the positioning of Android tablets is spot on.
Now in terms of enterprise, there’s a couple of ways to make tablets much more delightful for enterprise users. I don’t use my tablet at the office because there’s just too many incompatibilities. And for me it’s important for me to be able to see every number on the spreadsheet; just several of the numbers on a spreadsheet is not enough for me. And so I need to see all the numbers. And I need to see all the graphs. I need to see all the charts. It’s too important to me. And there’s just no reason for me to make that compromise. And there’s a couple of ways to provide that.
One is obviously Office and then the other is to virtualize it, which is the way Citrix does it. And Citrix and VMware and RemoteFX makes it possible for us to remote the entire PC experience to any device. And that’s the reason why we created VGX and I’m very excited about the work that we’re doing there. It has a real potential of freeing up all of our employees so that they can use whatever device they like and still be able to get 100% compatibility. So there’s a couple of ways to do that, putting Office on a tablet, the pure Office version, and then putting the PC in the server and remote and virtualizing.",451

They’ve remained rather elevated. This is an investment stage in the new business, so that’s understandable. But is this something where you feel like you need to hang on to this level of cost and you just hope to grow into these operating expenses or do you envision maybe coming to a point where you’ve made the investments so R&D expenses will eventually fall?",77

We have more ideas than we can invest in right now and we’re trying to invest as thoughtfully and in a measured way. But as you mention, we’re in the process of reinventing our company. We’re the only computer technology company that has made its way from the PC industry to the mobile industry. And now we have a real position in the mobile space, whereas there were - just one year ago, I think there was an analyst report that showed some 48 application processor companies in the world and we weren’t even on it. And now, we’re probably #2.
And so I think we’re making really good progress in making our way into the fastest-growing segment of the computer industry. And I think as a computer technology company I can’t imagine why, I can’t imagine how long-term you could have a sustainable advantage if you’re not one foot in the computer industry and one foot in the mobile computer industry. It’s just too important not to be in these 2 segments. And so we made some investments. We’re making investments to reinvent ourselves and I think that reinvention is really, really paying off.",211

First, historically I think, I remember your works Professional business actually had significantly higher margin than your other 2 businesses. Now you’re getting mix moving towards your GPUs and you’re still actually improving your gross margins. Could you talk about that? Is that because of the new business model with TSMC? Is that because your cost structure is much better? If you could talk a little bit about that?",77
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2012",2012-08-09,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3713.0,346200.0,16758310.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,70,"Well, Kepler is a real margin driver and so when we ship enthusiasts, when we ship performance, those are all margin drivers. But you’re right that Quadro and Tesla were both down and they both have the highest margins and also because they’re the highest value and the most software-intensive parts of our business. They have much higher margins and they were both down. And so the other businesses made up for their margins and more. But it’s the current business model and I prefer a die buy, to tell you the truth, and it’s just because it’s simpler for us and it’s more predictable for us.
But now that we’re in the wafer buy model we just have to put a lot more intensity into yield improvement. And yield was better in Q2 than it was in Q1. We’re expecting it to be better in Q3. And so we just we really have to drive the living tar out of it and be all hands on deck. It is a very, very important earnings driver for us. And we’re still far away from where we need to be. And where we were before was higher than this and so 28-nanometer overall is still dragging our gross margins as a company. But we need to - we have our sights on much higher margins than this.",226

And then I guess for the Tegra business, obviously one year has made a huge difference. Clearly it seems like nowadays people will agree there is a market for Android tablets. Could you talk about - you said phone versus tablet you’re focusing more on tablets, or you think that’s where the growth comes from. To the extent you can give us some qualitative idea on Windows 8 or Windows RT I guess I should say; are you talking about multiple design wins? Is it a significant contributor for Q3? And how do you see that sort of progressing? I would really appreciate that.",105
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2012",2012-08-09,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3713.0,346200.0,16758312.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,72,"We have 3 design wins on Windows RT. And I think Microsoft announced - well Microsoft announced theirs. ASUS announced theirs. And I don’t think the third has been announced yet. So I won’t announce it for them.
In the near term, tablets will be an important driver for us and the reason for that is because our segment of the phone marketplace is mostly focused on superphones and the performance phones. In order for us to grow much, much more, we have to integrate a very important piece called the LTE modem and so we have to integrate that and that’s the reason why we bought Icera and when we do that, when we achieve that, our market opportunity grows substantially. It’s many times larger than the current phone segments that we target. And so I think that in the next several quarters our primary focus is going to be continued smartphones or superphones and premium phones, and then of course ramping all of these tablets that we’ve been designed into.",172

There’s the LG phones, the Fujitsu phones and now we’re in the process of ramping the phones that are indigenous to the Chinese market. We’ve ramped the ZTE phone.
That’s also a global phone and we’re in the process of now ramping the superphones in the Chinese market. And so - but as you know, the real focus is to make sure that we build these phones as wonderfully as we can. I’m just incredibly proud of the work that we did with HTC on the One X.

Our market share and our market position is the highest it’s ever been. The technologies and the capabilities we’re bringing to that marketplace we were just at SIGGRAPH this week and you might’ve seen some of the announcements. The work that we’re doing around Quadro plus Tesla to accelerate the design workflow is really revolutionary and people are just so excited about it because I was just reading a report today about one particular company that took a 1.5 months to create a particular shot and is now able to do it literally in 2 days.
So whether it’s rendering or video compositing or simulation in creating those shots and most shots today have so much computer graphics in it and advertising and HD advertising is a very big part of the work that we do with Quadro. It’s really revolutionized how people produce videos. And so the work that we’re doing there is better than ever. And I have every confidence that as soon as the economy gets better or even if it doesn’t get better, eventually people will have to upgrade their workstations because it’s at the core of the work that they do. It’s the creative part of their company.
And so irrespective of the economy at some point that people will have to come back and buy new workstations. I think part of it is people waiting for Romley to launch. They’re ramping up into the workstation space and I think that the ramp is just now ramping up. So I have every confidence that once those things get settled down that the enterprise customers will come back and buy again.",282

The first observation that you need is that most of the growth came from the tablet segment and in Q3 we expect to have even more tablets for the production. And so I don’t know that I have much more insight than that. And we’ll come back and report it as soon as we can. I think the highlight is just the market reception of these tablets have been better than any tablet that we’ve ever [indiscernible].,80

So are you seeing kind of a resurgence in PC demand given the Ivy Bridge ramp corresponding with the Ultrabook Windows 8 or is it primarily market share gains, new product, customers? Can you elaborate a little bit further on that?",73
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2012",2012-08-09,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3713.0,346200.0,16758325.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,85,"A couple of growth drivers for us in GPUs. One of them of course is the notebook design wins on Ivy Bridge and Ivy Bridge was going to ramp in Q2 and it ended up ramping in Q3. And so that’s one growth driver. Our market share is going to be higher, the attach rate is stable, and Kepler is just a really wonderful GPU for notebooks because it’s so energy efficient. The other growth driver is desktop. We’re not seeing anything different than other people from a demand perspective, but it’s important to realize that desktop for us is not the same as OEM desktop.
The vast majority of our GPUs for desktops are sold to gamers. There are, hard to say exactly how many hardcore gamers are around the world but it’s many, many tens of millions.
And people estimate it somewhere around 50 million to 100 million core gamers around the world. And they upgrade their GPUs every couple years. And I think that Kepler is the best GPU we’ve ever built. It’s the best GPU the industry has ever built and it’s the best GPU in the industry today and so everybody has been anticipating the Kepler GPU for the gamer segment and we haven’t been able to ramp into it because the demand or because the supply just didn’t allow us to do it until now and so we’re going to be quite enthusiastic ramping Kepler into the gamer market and the reception has just been fantastic.",252

If it is the channel, is there the potential there’s pent-up demand as that becomes available?",44

I mean we don’t buy desktop PCs very much from Tier 1 OEMs anymore. It’s mostly and yet the desktop PC market is really quite vibrant and the reason for that is because gamers build their own PCs and there are tens of millions of gamers all over the world.
And so I think, one, that the market is very different than people expect. Two, what drives the gamers are 2 things. One, great games and there are just some wonderful games coming out now and PC gaming is really surging. From a technological perspective, from a game play and interest perspective, it’s surging past game consoles.
And then secondarily, the Kepler GPU is just so fantastic. It’s the best GPU we’ve ever built. And compared to what the current installed base is, it is so far superior that I think gamers have been clamoring for it. And yet, until now, the most affordable Kepler is about $400. It’s only been available for enthusiasts - enthusiasts and scientists. And finally we’ve been able to bring that, bring the price down to the level of a gamer - PC gamer and a volume that allows us to support the ramp.",218

Good afternoon, and welcome to NVIDIA's Conference Call on Third Quarter of Fiscal 2013 Results. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Burns, Interim Chief Financial Officer.
After our prepared remarks, we will open up the call to a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] 
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website and is also being recorded. A replay of the conference call will be available via telephone until November 16, 2012, and the webcast will be available for replay until our conference call to discuss our financial results for our fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. The content of today's conference call is NVIDIA's property and cannot be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent.
During the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 29, 2012, and the reports we may file from time to time on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
All our statements are made as of today, November 8, 2012, based on information available to us as of today and, except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. Unless otherwise noted, all reference to market research and market share numbers throughout the call come from Mercury Research or Jon Peddie Research.
During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our financial release, which is posted on our website.
With that, let's begin. We are pleased to report that NVIDIA achieved record revenue and record gross margin in the third quarter, driven by strong demand for our energy-efficient Kepler GPUs and Tegra 3, the world's only 4-PLUS-1 mobile quad-core processor. Our strategies to reinvent our company are driving growth. They are: first, create the most energy-efficient processors; second, invent mobile and cloud-computing technologies that will grow us beyond the PC; and third, create solutions for special-purpose PC markets, where we can make a significant contribution such as gaming, design, media and entertainment and GPU-accelerated computing.
This quarter, we not only grew our PC business. We also significantly increased our business beyond the PC: in tablets, quad-core phones, data centers and automobiles. NVIDIA processors rolled out in Q3 in a range of new devices and settings, from Google's Nexus 7 tablet and Microsoft's Surface to Oak Ridge National Laboratory's new supercomputer and Tesla's latest electric sedan, which was just named Car of the Year by Automobile Magazine.
3 years ago, non-PC revenues were 7% of total revenues. This quarter, they grew to a record 30%. Our notebook GPU business recorded a second consecutive record quarter. 
In the premium segment, we increased market share with Kepler as part of the Ivy Bridge design cycle. Consumers are also now starting to realize that a great tablet is better than a cheap PC. Because of Tegra, Android and Windows RT, the entry-level PC market is now a new opportunity for us. Our desktop GPU business increased again this quarter. With improved supply now available, we delivered Kepler into the volume PC gaming market. With the majority of gamers using graphics cards that are below the recommended specifications of the wave of new games coming out, Kepler is a great upgrade for the millions of PC gamers around the world looking to play Assassin's Creed III, Far Cry 3 or Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 this Christmas holiday.
Our Professional Solutions business was up, driven by a record quarter for Tesla. In Q3, we shipped more than 18,000 NVIDIA Tesla K20 GPU accelerators to Oak Ridge National Laboratory for their new Titan supercomputer. With 50 million CUDA cores working together, these new Kepler-based GPUs delivered 90% of Titan's 20 petaflops of peak processing performance, making Titan the fastest open-science supercomputer in the world. 
While the Quadro business was roughly flat quarter-to-quarter, it was down from last year, consistent with softness in the global workstation market. Our strategies to grow better than the market include new Kelper Quadro products to refresh Romley-based workstations in the latter part of the year, as well as new capabilities like Maximus, enabling both modeling and simulation in one workstation.
In addition, this quarter, we also announced the industry's first cloud-based GPU that delivers workstation graphics capabilities to any screen. Built on the Kepler architecture, the cloud-based NVIDIA VGX K2 GPU will allow engineers and design professionals to work anywhere on virtually any device and still have access to the computing and graphics performance of a GPU-powered workstation.
Tegra had another record quarter, driven primarily by the emergence of Tegra 3 as the applications processor of choice for many of the world's most popular tablet. According to Strategy Analytics data, market share for Android tablets grew in Q3 to 41% from Q2's 29%. Tegra 3 is now powering a number of Android tablets, including the highly successful $199 Google Nexus 7. It also began powering Windows PCs with the launch of Windows RT devices. These include Microsoft's revolutionary Surface, Lenovo's IdeaPad Yoga 11 and the ASUS Vivo Tab. 
Additionally, new Tegra 3 smartphones were released in important markets. Of note, AT&T announced that they will be launching the new HTC One X+, the first Tegra 3 LTE phone to ship in the U.S. market. And ZTE announced the U950 quad-core smartphone, which delivers Tegra 3 to a new price segment for the China smartphone market. This segment is about 30 million to 40 million units large. 
NVIDIA's automotive business also delivered a record quarter and continued its steady growth, as a growing number of leading auto brands choose Tegra to drive their infotainment and navigation systems.
With that, let me hand the call over to Karen.",1027
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q3 2013 Earnings Call, Nov 08, 2012",2012-11-08,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3742.0,382608.0,18277121.0,Presenter Speech,Karen Burns,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Rob. We had record revenue this quarter of $1.2 billion, up 15.3% quarter-over-quarter and 12.9% year-over-year. As in the second quarter, revenue was driven by strong demand for our Kepler GPUs in desktops and record performances by our notebook and Tegra products.
We also achieved record gross margin on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Our GAAP gross margin was 52.9%, up 1.1 percentage points sequentially and up 0.7 point year-over-year.
Our non-GAAP gross margin was 53.1%, up 1.1 points sequentially and up 0.6 point from a year earlier. These record margins reflect the continued transition to Kepler GPUs from our previous Fermi generation and a mix more weighted to high-end segments.
GAAP OpEx was $384.4 million, and non-GAAP was $344.8 million, both better than our outlook. GAAP OpEx was down quarter-over-quarter due to the absence of a non-recurring charge of $20.1 million in Q2 related to our announced charitable contribution. Non-GAAP OpEx, which excluded this charge, was up slightly from the prior quarter, driven by planned strategic hiring and higher engineering-related costs, offset by lower compensation costs, including FICA, and reductions in discretionary expenses.
These results contributed to GAAP net income of $209.1 million, a 75.6% increase over the prior quarter and 17.3% year-over-year. That's equivalent to $0.33 per diluted share, which was up 73.7% sequentially and 13.8% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $245.5 million, up 44% sequentially and 13.1% year-over-year. That's $0.39 per diluted share, which was a 44.4% increase sequentially and 11.4% year-over-year.
Revenue results by business segment were as follows. Our GPU business was up 10.7% sequentially and 14.7% year-over-year. This was due to the continued launch of our new Kepler desktop products and our OEM partners launching new Ivy Bridge platform for notebook.
Our Professional business was up 12.4% sequentially due to the first shipments of our new Kepler-based Tesla products, supporting the new Titan supercomputer. Year-over-year, our Professional business was down 4.2%. The strength in Tesla year-over-year was partially offset by the weak economic conditions impacting demand for our Quadro products.
Our Consumer business was up 35.7% sequentially and 27.6% year-over-year on the strength of our Tegra business.
Inventory in our desktop channel business remains stable at levels we believe are healthy. DSO was 34 days, down 5 days from the prior quarter. Accounts receivable and DSO decreased in the current quarter despite the increase in revenue as a result of shipment linearity and strong collections.
DSI was 69 days, down 1 day from the prior quarter. We increased inventory by $41.8 million from the prior quarter, largely for production builds of our Kepler GPU products in support of expected demand, offset by declines in our Fermi-based GPUs.
Our GAAP outlook for the fourth quarter is as follows: revenue of $1.025 billion to $1.175 billion; gross margin of 52.9%, flat from third quarter; OpEx of approximately $400 million; and a tax rate of 20%, plus or minus 1 percentage point.
For non-GAAP, we expect the following differences from our GAAP outlook: gross margin of 53.1%, flat from Q3; and OpEx of approximately $359 million, which excludes stock-based compensation and certain other charges related to acquisitions in the aggregate of approximately $41 million.
We expect our tax rate to be approximately 19%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Depreciation and amortization are expected to be in the range of $58 million to $60 million and capital expenditures of $60 million to $70 million. Diluted shares are expected to be approximately 629 million.
Lastly, we are very pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend and has also approved the extension of our existing share repurchase program to December 31, 2014. The quarterly dividend of $0.075 per share is equivalent to $0.30 per share on an annual basis and approximates an annual yield of about 2.4% based on yesterday's closing stock price of $12.61.
We have increased our cash by $305.2 million this fiscal year, with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the current quarter of $3.43 billion compared to $3.13 billion at Q4 fiscal 2012.
We are committed to return cash to our shareholders and made this decision based on our strong cash position and the high confidence we have in our business to continue generating future cash. 
Thanks, Rob.",719

And that's related to enterprise weakness, but it's also associated with the fact that Romley, the server platform, was delayed by some time for workstations. It's in the process of ramping now. And we think that, that held back some purchases of new workstations as people waited for this new platform. It's surely a lot better than the previous generation. And so, hopefully, as Romley gets out into the marketplace with the new Kepler GPUs, we're going to see the workstation market recover. But the end markets, whether it's notebooks or desktop, our expectation and our outlook is that it's softer than we had originally predicted.",131

The end markets are softer than this time last year. If -- I guess, I'm surprised that you asked at all, although I think the overall market seems to indicate that the holiday season for PC sales is a little softer than expected. And it's global.

And the reason for that is because a great tablet is surely better than a cheap PC. And these days, the tablets are so versatile. And many of them are transformable and have hybrid tablet, as well as notebook usage models. And now with the Surface -- Microsoft Surface and Win RT, the distinction between a PC -- a cheap PC and a great tablet is all but disappeared. And in fact, we see our tablet business grew 100% year-over-year. And so I think that the PC market, especially the cheap PC market -- but we don't really play in the cheap PC market. The low-end part of the cheap PC market is all integrated. And so our opportunity is to replace and going into that marketplace with the Tegra processors and the tablets that we serve. So for us, the vast majority of uncertainty is just end market of PC.",166

This is a brand-new market for us. Although we are already shipping some quantities of discrete LTE modems, the vast majority of the marketplace is really integrated. And so our -- we have a next-generation application processor integrated with a next-generation LTE. And this quarter, we hope to tape out and race it to market. And so our OpEx has increased so that we can invest in that initiative. It's obviously a very, very large market opportunity for us, and so we're very quite bullish about it.",159

And actually, related to that, can you give us some feel for what proportion of Tegra are tablets rather than smartphones? And do you expect Tegra for Windows RT tablets to be up or down in the January quarter?",41

We expect the tablet sales to be down in the January quarter because most of the tablets go into -- we shipped most of the tablet processors into manufacturing for our OEMs for their holiday build. Overall, our tablets are up 100% year-over-year. Our Tegra processors overall is up about 50% year-over-year. And so that gives you a sense that the vast majority of the Tegra growth has come from tablets, and Super Phones has been relatively stable. And one of the reasons why we are so interested in integrating our application processor with a 4G modem, so that we can expand the reach of our application processors into Super -- into more of the smartphone marketplace. This is really a great opportunity for us. Because if you think about the number of companies in the world that can combine a world-class CPU, a world-class GPU, a 4G modem and has the expertise and the complicated software stacks necessary to partner with all of the companies on the various computing devices, there aren't really that many companies. And this is a great opportunity for us, and so we're investing aggressively to get 4G into our product line.",203

And there are really 2 drivers of that, that the -- we're being cautious about the PC end markets. The entire -- we're seeing relatively similar behavior across each one of the regions. Although our position is better than ever in GPUs and in our workstation business, the PSP business, as well as our Consumer business where the Tegra business is, we're expecting some amount of end market softness. The second thing I've just -- I explained to David that the tablet will be down, even though the devices that we're in are incredibly successful. The Nexus 7 is selling super well. And the Surface and the Win RT devices are really exciting. And, however, the vast majority of the builds for the holidays have to happen for the holidays. And so we shipped more proportionally to them in Q3 than in Q4. But overall, year-over-year, the tablet has doubled. And the overall Tegra business has increased 50%. And so I think that we'll see how the market -- the end markets do. And nobody's going to know until it's done. So but if it does well, we're really well positioned to take advantage of it.",211

And then on the desktop GPU side, it looks like you had solid growth there in the third quarter. And I know that a big percentage of this business is tied to gaming. In the U.S., we've seen several new and much-anticipated game releases. I could clearly see that as a big demand driver for the team. But the team has often talked about the gaming environment in Asia as being an even bigger driver for your GeForce products. So maybe you can just spend a little bit of time, kind of highlighting what are some of that trends in Asia that are responsible for -- what were responsible for kind of the solid demand trends for your Kepler-based products in the second half of this year.",128

In fact, our GeForce business has been growing steadily, and it remains robust. The driver for that, of course, is PC gaming. The gaming marketplace is very, very large. And each one of the regions has a slightly different dynamic. Here in the West, we're going to see a couple of really huge titles coming out. Call of Duty is coming out this holiday season, Far Cry is coming out, and Assassin's Creed is coming out. And the anticipation is really great for those. In China, the dynamics are rather different completely. On the one hand, there are no game consoles really in China, so the PC is the game console of China. And the second dynamic is their discovery of free-to-play, massive online, multiplayer online games that are free to play. And that people can enjoy with easy access and play it and pay as they go. All they need to have is a great GeForce card, and they can enjoy just about all the games they can play. And so I think the global PC gaming marketplace is quite vibrant. And we'll just take a cautious look as we -- cautious posture going into Q4, as we're uncertain about the end markets. But if the end markets prove to be healthy and prove to be good, we're well positioned to take advantage of it.",227

But there are other supercomputers that are going to be built around the world, if that's what you mean. Kepler is just ramping for supercomputing, for high-performance computing. And so Oak Ridge and the Titan was the first supercomputer we built into. And we've been planning on this for over a year. And so that was a very significant challenge for us. And it says something, that the world's largest supercomputer would have chosen the Kepler GPU to power 90% of its computation. And we're hoping that Titan is going to deliver some amazing breakthroughs in science. This is the largest open-science supercomputer in the world. This is the fastest open-science supercomputer in the world. And it also -- it was also the first supercomputer that we delivered Kepler to. At this point, we have supercomputers all over the world that we need to go build out. The run rate for Kepler is about 2x the run rate of Fermi 1 year ago. And so this is -- it really shows that people understand now that GPU-accelerated supercomputing, or GPU-accelerated high-performance computing is really the most energy-efficient and also dollar-efficient way of computation. And so I think we're starting to see that we're about reaching the tipping point of accelerated computing here. And we're really excited about it. It's been quite a journey and quite an investment. But now CUDA is impacting every aspect of our business. In Tesla, you could see the progress there we just talked about. CUDA is also making it possible for workstations and design applications to design and simulate at the same time. CUDA is also making it possible for our PC gaming GeForce to be able to use simulation for special effects and to materials and dynamics in the virtual world. And so CUDA is -- has proven to be a real lift for our entire GPU business. And I would go so far as to say that, because of CUDA, we have kept the GPU continuing to grow into more and more applications, and as a result, continue to grow the business.",359

And then, Jen-Hsun, just one longer-term question on Tegra. A few of us attended ARM's Tech Conference last week. And there was a session with Samsung. And they were pretty straightforward that with Exynos, they're going to be looking at more of a merchant strategy going forward. And they also expressed some pretty strong interest in Windows RT. As you look at the competitive landscape next year for Tegra, and just the resources that Samsung has, their own fabrication facilities, does that alter your view of the competitive landscape at all, when you kind of think about Samsung potentially getting involved in this business segment?",106

And to most customers, Samsung is just downright scary. And you've heard Asia's posture about Samsung. And so I think that our focus is pretty simple. We have to continue to stay ahead of them technologically, and we have the capability to do so. We're one of the few companies in the world that has the ability to do so in the area of computing. Number two, we are a neutral and a friendly partner for all of the companies that Samsung competes against. And in most of these devices that you're talking about, it's not a -- it's not like selling a DRAM. It's about -- it's like collaborating to build computers. And so it's engineers working hand-in-hand with other engineers. And so if there's concern about trade secrets, if there's concerns about confidentiality, we are one that they have no concerns about. And so we're not going to win everywhere. But as you know, Tegra is a small business. This is -- we still have an opportunity to grow well over 50% each year. And surely, as we look into next year, between our next-generation processor, the new segments that we're in and the fact that we're going to introduce our own 4G-integrated modem processors, I think our growth opportunity is still pretty exciting.",223

At least, you gave your perspective to Mike's question, but I just wanted to follow up on that a little bit. The analogy between the tablet market and the PC market, it -- correct me if I'm wrong, in the PC market, you had refreshes and -- between you and AMD. And you would, on the back of your architecture, you would win a socket and lose a socket. And that could last 1.5 year, but when I look at the tablet market, so you got a marquee design win, Google 7, Nexus 7 and then the 10 goes back to Samsung. Is there anything different here that you can drive that can lead to more sustainability of design wins, and not just Google, just kind of broadly? And again, I wanted to just put that out there that you guys have done a good job and not sitting idly and targeting, going after the mobile space and expanding your TAM. And then my quick follow-up, Jen-Hsun, if I may, the low-end TAM you mentioned, how big is that TAM for you on the low-end PC side that you did not address before?",198

Our focus is to build the world's best mobile computers. And to do that, you need to have a great SoC, you need to have a great GPU, and you need to have extraordinary software capability. And there are multiple platforms: there's Android, there's Android phones, there's Win RT, there's Linux, there's Chrome, there's Windows 8 phone, there's quite a few platforms. And we have the capacity as a company, both technologically as well as resources, to be able to partner with many of these companies, these ecosystem owners, to build these great computers. And you're right, we're not going to win them all. But as you can see, we win our fair share. And we're winning more and more every day. We won about 100% more this year than we did last year. And my hope is that we'll win even more next year. And every time we expand the reach of our company into new platforms, and this year was Win RT, it really expanded the reach of our company and expanded our growth. And so we're just going to keep -- stay focused on that. And one of the attributes of our company is technology leadership. You can trust us, to partner deeply with us, to build these complicated devices. And I think that's a real virtue. With respect to the size of the PC TAM you're alluding to, and what I also believe and now what the world has seen, that a great tablet is every bit better than a cheap PC. And that is the reason why tablets are gaining the favoritism of consumers all over the world. It's easier to use, it's more delightful to use, and it's more useful. And the cheap PC market represents probably a couple of hundred to 200 million units a year. The vast majority of the world's PCs are affordable PCs, as you know. They're cheap PCs. And that segment is now wide open, as these mobile processors have become more and more capable. And you know that disruption comes from the bottom. The disruption comes from the bottom because the volumes are so high. In just 2 years' time, this year, we'll probably ship around 30 million Tegra processors. And that just happened in the blink of an eye. And that's -- and yet there's enormous markets ahead of it. And so once an instruction-set architecture like the ARM CPU reaches critical mass and the developers all focus on it, it becomes more and more valuable. And it becomes more useful. And as more companies drive and compete in this ecosystem, in this marketplace, we make the SoCs better and better. And before you know it, it disrupts the market above. And the market above is -- directly above the tablet is the cheap PC market. And so that's a big opportunity for us, especially now with Win RT. And so I'm super excited about it.",498

Last year, we had Motorola, we had LG, we had some others. This year, we had the benefit of working with HTC; Fujitsu, the #1 in Japan; ZTE; and with Wayne, our next-generation processor, we will have even more. And so each year, we're able to gain the trust and develop the reputation to work with more and more smartphone companies. And so we're going to continue to expand in that segment. It -- for us to really grow in the smartphone marketplace, as you know, we need to really integrate a modem. And that's one of the reasons why we -- well, that's the reason why we bought this really great company called Icera. And we have 4G LTE now certified at AT&T data side. And we're in the process of working on voice. Now one of the reasons why our OpEx is high -- increased for next quarter is our increased investment in our integrated application processor in 4G from product.

But overall, the -- with the exception of Quadro, which was down year-over-year -- it was down year-over-year not because we lost any share, not because ASP was down. In fact, ASP was stable. Gross margin was stable. Our position in that marketplace is better than ever. The workstation marketplace was just generally soft. Two reasons, as I mentioned earlier, I think the end market was soft and the delay of the Romley platform, workstation platform, caused some delayed buying in the marketplace. But overall, the GPU marketplace was -- our GPU business was up about 15% year-over-year. And I think -- I would think that the ASPs was up.",118

But mobile computing, as you know, is the future of computing. There is no computing beyond mobile computing in the future. Every computer will be mobile. And so this isn't really a question about we're expecting to be more or less profitable in Q3 or Q4. This is really about the future of the industry. And we, for all of the good fortune and good decisions, have gotten ourselves in a pretty great place in mobile computing. And I think that we have now an opportunity to integrate our 4G modem and expand deeper into the smartphone market; continue to execute our roadmap; and because of the enormous implications of Win RT, give us the opportunity to grow into the PC marketplace. The future of cheap PCs is really tablets, great tablets. They're likely be Win RT tablets. They could be -- they may very well be Android tablets. I could even imagine them being Chrome tablets. And so these are -- and these tablets have keyboards, of course, so they're sometimes touch tablets, sometimes they're a notebook. But I think we all recognize now that this is likely the future of the computer industry. And so I think we find ourselves in a really exciting time. And Win RT just went to market. I'm really excited about it. We're seeing people using it all over. And next year, I think we're going to see even more. And so this is pretty exciting stuff.",255

As far as the -- either the voice side of LTE or the fully integrated side, is there any sort of benchmarks timing-wise that we can look forward to as to when you expect those products to be available?",60

We're taping out products, our integrated product now. And that's really the product that, that in about a year's time frame, will really, really matter to get us into a larger part of the smartphone market. In the meantime, we're also ramping into the marketplace our next-generation application processor. And so we're looking forward to a new generation of Super Phones that will be in. And so but the real big opportunity is going to come with integrated 4G modem, a processor that we internally call Grey.",93

You talked about developing an integrated baseband in that processor to compete against Qualcomm, I would presume, which is the dominant player there. If you look at where Qualcomm is positioned in terms of its end customers, obviously, they have Apple, and they're benefiting from that. How do you intend to kind of take share away from Qualcomm in the market? And how do you look at the market in smartphone, which bifurcated between the high end, which is Samsung and Apple; and the low end, which is ZTE and Huawei, how do you look at the smartphone market? And how do you position your products relative to the competition?",119

First of all, thank you very much, Raji. I think, first of all, we have already taken share from the mobile processor companies. The fact that Tegra is already a multi-hundred-million-dollar business on its way to being much larger is taking share from someone. And so we're brand new to this marketplace. And we've only been in it for 2 years. And so this is -- we're obviously -- we're clearly holding our own. Our position is where computing is richest. If computing and a general-purpose computing platform is -- matters, if performance matters, technology leadership matters, I think we can make a real contribution. When you think about integrated modems, you're right that more companies are becoming vertically integrated. That's going to affect all of us. Samsung's desire, probably based on some questions earlier, is not to buy chips from other companies -- any companies. And so -- but we don't have Samsung as a customer today and nor do we have Apple, and so we have nothing to lose. But there are many other customers that I think are going to be pretty terrific to work with. And whether it's global Tier 1s, the global brands, whether it's LG or ZTE or HTC or Sony or Fujitsu or -- I mean, there's a large list of global phone brands that we love to partner with and that we're partnering with. There's also China. The dynamics of China is very, very different than the dynamics of the rest of the world. They have many different modem standards. They have a very large number of phone companies. And we have the software engineering capacity to be able to partner with them and to help them build amazing phones. And so I surely see what you see that there are vertical integration, and that's -- they will continue to do that. However, there's a very large market of hundreds of millions of phones that we can go and make a contribution to.",332

Just one last question. As you look to fiscal year 2014 on the Tegra side, any thoughts in terms of kind of what the mix could be between tablets and smartphones? And along those lines, do you see kind of ARM-based Tegra processors in the notebook market gaining some traction in fiscal year '14 or calendar '13?",59

We have several segments for Tegra. There's Tegra Android phones, there's Tegra Android tablets, there's Tegra Win RT, PCs, and there's Tegra automotive. The car is the most mobile computer of all. And people know that all the cars want to incorporate computers for all kinds of reasons, whether it's infotainment, navigation or driver assistance. And this is an area where we can add an enormous amount of value. And next year, I think you're going to find that -- we're going to find that auto is likely to be its first $100 million year. Win RT is likely to be much larger next year than this year. And Tegra tablet will continue to be quite a rich business for us. And then there's the Tegra phones. So if you look at it from that perspective, tablets and automotive, the Android tablet, Win RT tablet and automotive will represent a -- the largest proportion of the overall Tegra business. And then the year after that, I hope that, with our integrated modem, Tegra could be a much larger part of the business. And with respect to PCs, tablets are the modern PCs.",193

I mean, the pricing has been great. The gross margin seem to have been good. Can you help us understand what are the factors that might impact gross margins for that product, which way you think they'll be going as presumably yields improve as way for cost decline and I get -- I guess, ASPs decline? How do we think about GPU margins going forward? And also, how much is Fermi versus Kepler?",83

Pricing is stable because our position in the market, in the market that we serve, is better than ever. A lot of people see our GPU business as a components business selling into PC. But that is part of it. We sell GPU components to notebook OEMs. And there, the margins are much tighter. However, the other parts -- the vast majority of our GPU's profits come from, what Rob called earlier, the special-purpose PCs, PCs that are built for PC gaming. Gamers build it for PC gaming. This is our GPU architecture, our GPU stack, the software that we dedicate to games. And the work that we do with game developers all over the world makes the GeForce architecture the best in the world for PC game. The work that we do with workstations, whether it's automotive, manufacturing, digital content creation, digital broadcast, the augmented reality imagery that you saw on CNN for the election where the virtual sets look so real, it's almost like the broadcaster or the commentator was inside a pretty amazing room, all of that stuff is done using NVIDIA's Quadro GPUs. That's very software-intensive. And the vast majority of the value we deliver is software. And then, of course, high-performance computing with Tesla, tools, compilers, libraries, the computational mathematicians we have all around the world to help people optimize their software, the solution architects that are out in the field working with large customers like Oak Ridge National Labs, so that we can help them build their supercomputers. These businesses, the Tesla business, the Quadro business, the GeForce PC gaming business, are incredibly software-intensive. And there, our margins are very good, and the pricing is stable. And the reason for that is because we add a lot of value. And so my expectation is, as we continue to solidify our positioning in the marketplace and we continue to add value to our customers, the pricing should be stable.",328

The point I was making before is it's -- like Jen-Hsun said, the price is stable, depending on the segment your in. So if you're in a high-end segment, you have a certain ASP. And then, the only point about Fermi is, as we move through a new generation, the older generations go further down the stack. So they are lower ASPs.",68
