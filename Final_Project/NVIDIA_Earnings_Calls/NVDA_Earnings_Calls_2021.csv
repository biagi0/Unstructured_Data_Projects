Q4 was another record quarter, with revenue exceeding $5 billion and year-on-year growth accelerating to 61%. Full year revenue was also a record at $16.7 billion, up 53%.  
Our Gaming business have reached record revenue of $2.5 billion in Q4, up 10% sequentially and up 67% from a year earlier. Full year Gaming revenue was a record at $7.8 billion, up 41%. Demand is incredible for our new GeForce RTX 30 series products based on the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture. In early December, we launched the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, which joined the previously launched RTX 3090, 3080 and 3070.  
The entire 30 series lineup has been hard to keep in stock, and we exited Q4 with channel inventories even lower than when we started. Although we are increasing supply, channel inventories will likely remain low throughout Q1. GeForce RTX 30 Series graphics cards were a holiday sensation, due not just to their amazing performance, but also to their rich features, including our second-generation RTX ray tracing technology and DLSS, AI-powered performance accelerator, which massively boosts frame rates in graphically demanding titles.  
Three dozen games now all support RTX, including the top battle royal game, Fortnite; the top role-playing game, Cyberpunk 2077; the top massively multiplayer online game, World of Warcraft; and the best-selling game of all time, Minecraft.  
RTX has clearly set the new standard in gaming.  
Building on this momentum, at CES in January, we introduced a wave of Ampere architecture gaming products, including our biggest ever laptop launch, powered by GeForce RTX 3060, 3070 and 3080 laptop GPUs and with our third-generation Max-Q technology. These new thin and lightweight gaming laptops increased performance and energy efficiency by up to 2x from the prior generation.  
RTX 3060 laptops starts $999 and are faster than the previous generation laptops, which sold for $2,500. The incredible performance, design and price points of these new laptops will delight the growing universe of gamers and creators as well as students and professionals. The gaming laptop market has grown sevenfold in the past 7 years, and momentum is building. With top OEMs bringing to market a record 70-plus laptop models based on the GeForce RTX 30 Series, GeForce laptops, as a whole, are the fastest-growing and one of the largest gaming platforms.  
Also at CES, we announced the GeForce RTX 3060 GPU priced at $329, extending the 30 Series desktop lineup further into the mainstream. We expect strong demand when it launches this Friday as 60 class GPUs have traditionally been our most popular products.  
Starting with the 3060, we're taking an important step to maximize the supply of GeForce GPUs for gamers. Users are constantly discovering new applications for our powerful programmable GPUs and cryptocurrency mining is one of them. With rising ethereum prices, there are indications that miners are behind GPUs. We would like GeForce GPUs to end up with gamers, so we have created a new special software drivers that will detect the ethereum mining algorithm, cutting in half the mining efficiency of the GeForce RTX 3060.  
We suspect the significant increase in the ethereum  network hash rate observed over the past few months was driven by a combination of previously installed mining capacity that was reactivated as well as new sales of GPUs and ASICs. Since our GPUs are sold to graphics card manufacturers and then onto distribution, we don't have the ability to accurately track or quantify their end use. And all estimates suggest that cryptomining contributed $100 million to $300 million to our Q4 revenue, a relatively small portion of our Gaming revenue in Q4.  
Cryptocurrencies have recently started to be accepted by companies and financial institutions and show increased signs of staying power. Through the desk -- to address industrial ethereum mining demand, last week, we announced a new line of NVIDIA CMPs or cryptomining processors. Shipments will start in March. CMPs lack display outputs and have other optimizations that improve cryptomining power efficiency. CMP products will let us gain some visibility into the contribution of cryptomining to our overall revenue.  
For Q1, we estimate that CMP will contribute approximately $50 million. We plan to sell these products to industrial miners. We will quantify their contribution each quarter for transparency.  
Over the past year, it has become clear that we've entered a new era in which gaming is an integral part of global culture. The number of concurrent users on Steam has more than doubled since 2018 and continues to hit new records. In 2020 alone, more than 100 billion hours of gaming content was seen on YouTube and 0.5 billion people watched eSports. Increasingly, we aren't just gaming, we're also watching sports, attending concerts, creating content and connecting with our friends in virtual environments.  
Additionally, we are excited about the new experiences like VR. Significantly more content is now available, including arguably the first VR killer app, Beat Saber. And there's now almost 2 million VR users on Steam. And with these powerful structural shifts, we expect our Gaming business to remain on a robust growth trajectory. The GeForce  RTX 30 Series GPUs have kicked off a powerful upgrade cycle, and we estimate only around 15% of GeForce gamers own an RTX class GPU, which is needed to experience the beautiful ray trace graphics of modern games.  
Moreover, the universe of gamers is rapidly expanding. And the reach of GeForce has extended beyond gamers to some 45 million creators. In addition, Gaming revenue continues to benefit from a favorable mix shift as gamers and creators keep moving to higher-end GPUs. We expect another great year for GeForce.  
Earlier this month, we celebrated the 1-year anniversary of the GeForce NOW cloud gaming platform, which is has now over 6 million members strong. GeForce NOW offers 800 PCs from over 300 publishers, more than any other cloud gaming service, including 80 of the most played free-to-play games. Starting with support for our Windows PCs, Macs and Android devices, we added support in recent months to Chromebooks, iPhones and iPads. GFN has grown globally with more than 65 countries on our service and more added regularly by our GeForce NOW alliance partners.  
Moving to Pro Viz. Q4 revenue was $307 million, up 30% sequentially and down 10% year-on-year and ahead of our expectations. Full year revenue was $1.1 billion, was down 13%. Strong sequential growth was driven primarily by a recovery in desktop workstations as some customers returned to the office and enterprises resumed purchases that have been deferred by the pandemic.  
Notebook GPUs grew sequentially to a record as enterprises continue to support remote workforce initiatives. Looking ahead, the reopening of businesses will benefit desktop workstations, but longer-term workforce trends will likely shift our mix to notebook GPUs and cloud offerings.  
Health care was a standout vertical in the quarter, with significant orders from GE, Siemens and Oxford Nanopore Technologies, public sector and automotive also showed strength. Omniverse, our real-time 3D collaboration and simulation platform is now in open beta. Over 500 creators and professionals have tested Omniverse through our early access program. Omniverse is one of our most important and exciting platforms. We are delighted by its initial acceptance and look forward to sharing more details on its long-term growth opportunity in the coming months.  
Moving to automotive. Q4 revenue was $145 million, up 16% sequentially and down 11% year-on-year. Full year revenue of $536 million declined 23%, sequential growth was driven by continued recovery in the global automotive production volumes and growth in AI cockpit revenue. The year-on-year decline reflects the expected ramp down of legacy infotainment. NVIDIA has emerged as the industry's leading end-to-end full-spec technology provider for self-driving and AI-enabled vehicles. Orin, the SoC that drive -- self-driving platform was built on, delivers an unrivaled 254 trillion of operations per second of performance on industry-leading power efficiency, helping to revolutionize the transportation industry. 
Our technology leadership has driven a robust, rapidly growing set of opportunities. We have great momentum with an expanding list of electric vehicle OEMs, including Nio, SAIC, Li Auto and Xpeng, which are all using the NVIDIA DRIVE platform to power their next-generation of vehicles. We look forward to growing with them as they continue to scale. 
Our software-defined platform is the only solution that spans from the data center for training deep neural nets and running physically accurate simulations to a full stack in car solutions, scaling from ADAS to Level 5 fully autonomous functionality. Autonomous vehicle companies are harnessing this technology. Zoox recently unveiled its Level 5 bidirectional robotaxi powered by NVIDIA. Einride launched its next-generation cab-less autonomous truck using NVIDIA DRIVE Orin. And earlier this year, Mercedes announced a 56-inch wide MBUX Hyperscreen powered by NVIDIA AI cockpit technology. This win builds on our momentum with Mercedes first generation MBUX system, which is now in 1.8 million cars. 
We are in the early innings of a significant opportunity. We have built a multibillion-dollar design win pipeline for our self-driving AI cockpit solutions, which will drive a material inflection in revenue over the next few years. Our transformational partnership with Mercedes announced last June demonstrates the power of our evolving business model as we expand our addressable market and layer in software revenue. We are exceptionally well positioned to capitalize on the significant opportunity that lies ahead. 
Moving to Data Center. Revenue was $1.9 billion, which exceeded our expectations, was comparable to last quarter and up 97% from the year-ago period, which did not include Mellanox. Data Center compute revenue was up 45% year-on-year. Full year Data Center revenue rose 125% to a record $6.7 billion, including almost 70% growth from Data Center compute. 
From a sequential perspective, the Data Center compute's stronger-than-expected double digit growth more than offset the anticipated decline in Mellanox revenue, which included a large nonrecurring network sale to a single OEM in Q3. Compute growth was led by vertical industries, where OEM partners continued ramping up to 100 -- A100-based servers, and our own DGX system sales were strong. 
Vertical industries were well over 50% of Data Center revenue across compute and networking, with particular strength in supercomputing, financial services, higher education and consumer Internet verticals. Additionally, hyperscale customers continue to deploy the A100, driving both sequential growth and exceptionally strong year-on-year growth in Data Center compute. The A100 has been adopted by all major cloud customers globally and is being deployed by hyperscale customers for internal workloads. Still, we are in the early stages of adoption and expect continued growth this year. 
The ramp of the A100 has been smoother and accomplished by better visibility than prior generation. Its universal AI training and inference capabilities as well as support for a wider set of applications and outstanding performance are driving high customer utilization, a clear sign of the A100's value. 
Turning to Mellanox. We are seeing continued strong traction and robust momentum across our customer sets. Its revenue was up over 30% from Mellanox's Q4 revenue in calendar 2019, when we were still a stand-alone company. Year-on-year growth in the quarter was led by hyperscale and large consumer Internet customers which grew over 60% from last year, with several contributing record revenues. 
Consistent with our outlook, Mellanox had a sequential decline, impacted by a nonrecurring sales to a China OEM in Q3. We expect a return to sequential growth in Q1, driven by strong demand for our high-speed networking products, including the ramp of ConnectX adapters with CSPs and all major server OEMs in their upcoming refresh. 
We also see strong momentum in high-performance computing with HDR InfiniBand products. For example, we won 6 of the 7 supercomputers awarded over the past few months by EuroHPC. Starting next quarter, we will continue to provide color on networking as part of the Data Center market platform, but we will no longer break out Mellanox revenues separately. 
Looking forward, we are incredibly excited about the opportunities in Data Center. Accelerated computing is not only delivering super more -- long gains in performance but is also an energy-efficient and cost-effective method of computing. And virtually every industry is adopting technology with greater urgency of companies to adopt to the new world of more distributed workers and customers. 
As industries embark on this journey, they are also increasingly focused on combating climate change. To that end, the A100 performed AI computations with 1/20th the power consumption of CPUs. It powers our Selene supercomputer, which is #1 on the Green500 list of the world's most efficient supercomputers. 
Indeed, NVIDIA's powered machines recently captured 25 of the top 30 spots on the Green500 list. Accelerated computing is not only serving the exponential growth in demand for compute, they can also help bend the power consumption curve. With accelerated computing, NVIDIA is pioneering a path forward the computing industry. 
Before I move to the P&L and outlook, let me give you an update on our proposed acquisition of Arm. In September, we announced plans to acquire Arm from SoftBank Group in a transaction that will create the premier computing company for the age of AI. 
At that time, we said it would take approximately 18 months to secure regulatory approvals in the U.S., the U.K., the EU, China and other jurisdictions. Thorough reviews are typical with the deal of this size. This process is moving forward as expected. We are in constructive dialogue with the relevant authorities and are confident that regulators will see the benefits to the entire tech ecosystem. 
As we have said, this combination will spur competition. Together, Arm and NVIDIA will provide greater choice to the data center ecosystem, a compelling alternative CPU architecture for the market and further enhance Arm's offering in mobile and embedded. Our intention is to increase investment in arm's existing road map. Adding resources to stimulate growth in new markets, we love and intend to maintain Arm's open licensing model, a commitment guaranteed both by long-term legally binding contracts as well as our own interest in ensuring this investment is a profitable one for us. 
We are on the cusp of a new age of which AI fuels industries ranging from health care to scientific research to the environment. With this transaction, our vision is to boost Arm's potential so it can thrive in this new era and grow into promising new markets. 
Moving to the rest of the P&L. Q4 GAAP gross margins were 63.1% and non-GAAP gross margins were 65.5%. GAAP gross margins declined year-on-year due to amortization of developed technology acquired from Mellanox, partially offset by product mix. The sequential increase was due to higher margins for Gaming GPUs and lower IP-related costs, partially offset by lower margin mix in our Data Center portfolio. 
Non-GAAP gross margins increased by 10 basis points year-on-year and was flat sequentially, in line with our expectations. Q4 GAAP EPS was $2.31, up 51% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.10, up 64% from a year ago. Q4 cash from operations was a record $2.07 billion. 
With that, let me turn to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Revenue is expected to be $5.3 billion, plus or minus 2%, with most of the sequential growth driven by Gaming. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 63.8% and 66%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. The GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.67 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. 
For the full year, we expect to grow non-GAAP OpEx in the mid-20% range. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are both expected to be an expense of approximately $50 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 10%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. 
Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $300 million to $325 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information on our IR website. 
In closing, let me highlight a pending event for the financial community. We will be virtually attending the Raymond James Institutional Investors Conference on March 1; the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom Conference on March 3; and the Arete Virtual Semis Conference on March 3. In addition, we will be hosting a Virtual Investor Day on Monday, April 12, following the livestream of Jensen's opening keynote at our GPU Technology Conference. 
Our earnings call to discuss our first quarter and full -- our first quarter is scheduled for Wednesday, May 26. 
We will now open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions.",2753

You're now a couple of quarters into the ramp of A100, and curious if you could speak to whether you've seen any surprises here. Any areas of specific strength worth calling out, and any changes to how you're thinking about the size of this opportunity?",57
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2021",2021-02-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3840.0,2222657.0,86338365.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,5,"Yes. Thanks a lot, C.J. So as you know, A100 is a very different type of GPU. This is our first universal computing GPU. It's great at high-performance computing. It's great at data analytics. It's great training. And also for our highest GPU, it's also the first time that is incredible for imprint. It's some 20x faster than previous generation. We introduced this, some really, really exciting new computational format like TF32, TensorFloat-32 for training. And with a multi-instance GPU, turning our GPU, 1 GPU into a whole bunch of smaller GPUs, autonomous GPUs to improve performance and reducing latency. 
And so the capability is really quite exciting. We're seeing strength in hyperscalers as they continue to accelerate their adoption of AI. Some of the new applications we've spoken about a couple of times before, the transition to deep learning for conversational AI, speech recognition to natural language understanding, all the way to speech synthesis is now based on AI -- based on deep learning. 
The other area that's growing incredibly fast is the deep learning recommender models. Just about everything that you do on the Internet is based on recommenders. There are hundreds of different recommenders out there, whether you're shopping or recommending music or recommending news or recommending search and so all the recommending ads. And so all of these different types of applications are driving that.
For the first time, we saw our industrial application -- industrial data center growing to be larger than hyperscale. And we're seeing industrial applications across scientific computing, where simulation-based approaches are now being fused with AI approaches for weather simulation, genomics, molecular dynamic simulation, quantum chemistry, even simulating quantum computing, which is one of the really exciting areas. 
We're seeing AI being deployed for big data analytics, RAPIDS, which is NVIDIA's created open source platform for data analytics. Spark 3.0, which NVIDIA really led and is now GPU-accelerated. So now you could have big data in the cloud while doing big data analytics in the cloud on all of the CSP  platforms. 
You could -- we're seeing a lot of excitement around financial services. Financial services and consumer Internet services are all really growing nicely. And so A100 adoption is just starting. I mean we're going to see several couple of years of continued growth yet ahead of us, well, as AI gets adopted in clouds and industries.",397

32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2021",2021-02-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3840.0,2222657.0,86338367.0,Question,Vivek Arya,,Analysts,7,"Just a clarification and then a question for Jensen. On the clarification, Colette, I was hoping if you could give a little more color around Q1. Do you still expect the Data Center to grow sequentially in Q1? I know you said that most of the growth coming -- will come from Gaming, but any color on the Data Center would be useful. 
And then Jensen, the question for you is, in your press release, you used the phrase, AI driving the smartphone moment for every industry. Could you help us quantify what that means? And where I'm going with that is, is there a number in terms of what percentage of servers are shipping today with your accelerators? And where can that ratio go over time? Is that a fair way of looking at the adoption of your technology and AI?",142
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2021",2021-02-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3840.0,2222657.0,86338368.0,Answer,Colette Kress,,Executives,8,"So thank you, Vivek. Your question regarding the guidance as we lead into Q1. We had indicated that, yes, a good percentage of our growth between Q4 and Q1 rolls down from Gaming. But we also do expect Data Center to grow. Most of our sequential growth coming from Gaming. But keep in mind, we also expect all of our market platforms will likely be able to grow quarter-over-quarter.",69
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2021",2021-02-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3840.0,2222657.0,86338369.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,9,"Because we're entering in the third phase of AI. The first phase of AI was when we invented the computing platforms, the new chips, the new systems, the new system software, the new middleware, the new way of working, the new way of developing software, which the industry, the world is now starting to call ML ops. The way that software is developed and the way that it's deployed is completely different than the past. 
Something -- in fact, I heard a great term, Software 2.0, and it makes a lot of sense. It's a computer that is writing software. The way that you develop software is completely different. The way you compute is different. And that was our first phase, and that started in the journey that was some 8, 9 years ago now. 
The second phase was the adoption of using this in an industrial way for clouds. And we saw it revolutionize new services, whether it's speech-oriented services or search-oriented services or recommender services, the way you shop, the way you use the Internet is completely different to that. And so that's really the second phase. And those 2 phases are still continuing to grow. And you're still seeing the growth associated with that. 
The third phase is the industrialization of AI. And some of the great examples, when I say kind of a smartphone moment, I meant that it's a device with AI. It's autonomous. And it's connected to a cloud service, and it's continuously learning. 
So some of the exciting examples that I saw that I've seen and we're working with companies all over the world. We have some 7,000 AI start-ups and working with. And almost all of them are developing something like this. And large industrial companies, whether it's John Deere or Walmart, they're all developing applications kind of lengthy. 
And basically, it's an autonomous system, autonomous machine, in our case, it's called Jetson. It's a robotics machine. That robotics machine is a car and it's called DRIVE. And it's running an autonomous -- an AI application on top, and AI is still on top, and this could be -- they could be moving device -- moving things around. It can be picking and placing. It could be just watching a warehouse and monitoring traffic and keeping traffic flow going it could be connected to a car. 
And whenever the -- whenever the fleet of cars needs to be retrained because of a new circumstance that was discovered, the cloud service would do the relearning and then we'd deploy into all of the autonomous devices. 
And so in the future, we're seeing that these industries, whether you're in retail or logistics or transportation or farming, ag tech to lawn mowers, consumer lawn mowers, they're not going to just be products that you buy and use from that point forward, but it will likely be a connected device with an AI service that runs on top of it. And so these industries are so excited about it because it gives them an opportunity to change the way that they interact with their customers. 
Rather than selling something once, they sell something and provide service that's on top of it, and they can stay engaged with the customers. The customers could get a product that's improving all of the time. Just like your smartphone, and that's kind of like -- that's the reason why I've been calling it a smartphone moment for all these industries. 
And we saw what happened to the smartphone revolution. And then we saw what happened to the smart microphone, the smart speaker revolution. You're going to see smart lawn mowers, smart tractors, smart air conditioners, smart elevators, smart building, smart warehouses, but robotic retail storage, entire store -- and the entire retail store is like a robot. And they will all have autonomous capability. They'll all be driven by AI. So what's new for the industry, therefore, is that all of the enterprises in the world used to have computers for IT to facilitate, to host their employees and their supply chain. But in the future, all of these industries, whether you're in medical imaging or in lawn mowers, you're going to have data centers that are hosting your products just like the CSPs. 
And so that's a brand-new industry. And we have a platform that we call EGX, which is the 5G Edge AI systems. And we have the autonomous systems we call AGX, which is what goes into Jetson and DRIVE. And between those 2 systems and the software stack that we have on top of it, we're in a great position to help these industries one at a time transform their business model from an object-oriented business model, a thing-based business model to a connected device business plan.",802

But I guess, on the Q1 guide, you're saying the Gaming is the majority of the growth. Was that an absolute statement? Or was that a percentage statement? Can you give us some idea of how you sort of rank the sequential percentage growth of, say, Gaming versus Data Center versus other, especially since it sounds like you've got $50 million in crypto-specific stuff that will go into the other. 
And then I guess, just briefly, could you give us some indication of where your supply situation and lead times are on your Ampere parts within Data Center? I think you said last quarter, they were many months on 6 months plus. Are they still looking like that? And is that sort of the limiting factor at this point in terms of what you can actually ship on the compute side of the data center?",154

Let me start off, Stacy, in terms of our guidance for Q1. As you know, we're still in the early innings of our Ampere architecture, our Ampere architecture, as it relates to Gaming as well as what it relates to Data Center. As we articulated in our call, we have been really seeing continued uplift of folks' adoption of A100, and it's going quite smoothly than what we had seen in prior overall versions. 
So when we think about our guidance for Q1, there's many different types of conclusions that will happen at the end of the quarter in terms of what we said. But all of our platforms can grow. But the majority of the growth from Q4 to Q1 will likely be Gaming.",126

Our company -- at the company level, we're supply-constrained. Our demand is greater than our supply. And however, for Data Center, so long as the customers work closely with us, and we do a good job planning between our companies, there should be a supply -- there shouldn't be a supply issue for Data Centers. We just have to do a good job planning. And we have direct relationships with each one of the world's CSPs, and we have direct relationships with all the OEMs. And we could do excellent planning between us. We shouldn't have a supply -- we shouldn't be supply-constrained there. But at the company level, we're supply-constrained, demand is greater than supply. And we have enough supply. We usually have enough supply to achieve better than the outlook. And we had that situation in Q4. We expect that situation in Q1. And we have enough supply to grow through the year. 
But supply is constrained and demand is really, really great. And so we just have to do a really good job planning. And meanwhile, one of the things that really came through for us is we have the world's best operations team. 
Our company is really -- really has an amazing operations team. We build the most complex products in the world, the most complex chips, the most complex packages, the most complex systems. And during Q4, they improved our cycle time. And during Q1, I'm expecting them to improve our cycle time again. And we really are based to have such an amazing operations team. And so during these times, it really comes in handy. But overall, at the company level, where we expect demand to be greater than supply, we have enough supply to do better than the outlook. And we have enough supply to grow each quarter throughout the year.",315

I guess Jensen, I know that the CMP stuff and the software driver stuff that you're doing for the 3060, that's going to help a lot. But I think that there's like 4 or 5 of the big currencies that are going to move or at least they're moving or on a path to move from proof of work to proof of stake, which is going to be a lot less computing-intensive. 
So I guess the question that I get a lot is how do you assess the degree to which that drives GPUs back into the secondary market? Is there any way that you can get kind of a handle on that?",119
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2021",2021-02-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3840.0,2222657.0,86338377.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,17,"Yes. If you look at the recent hashrate, first of all, the transition is going to take some time. It can't happen overnight. And so people have to build trust in the new versions. And so it'll take a little bit of time. But I hope it does. I mean I hope that people use their proof of stake over time. And a little bit of these questions don't have to be answered. However, I don't have that much optimism either that it will be all proof of stake. 
I think that proof of work is a very legitimate way of securing the currency. And in the beginning, while any currency is building its reputation, it's going to take something like a proof of work to do so. And so I think proof of work is going to be around for a bit. 
We developed CMP for this very reason, just so that there are different versions. We have different versions of our products for gaming, for professional visualization, for high-performance computing, for deep learning. It stands to reason we have the ability to do a different version for CMP. And we can sell it directly. The way that we go to market would be to go direct into the industrial miners. To -- and it's a great benefit to them so that they don't have to chase around spot markets. It's a great benefit to the gamers. And because they want a game, and the gaming demand is just incredible, it's off the chart. 
And so I think this is going to be really beneficial to everybody. The recent hashrate growth was really a result of several dynamics. The first dynamic is the installed base. Most people thought that the -- once again mining, the GPUs come back into the aftermarket. A small part does that. Some people do that. But the vast majority don't keep them. And the reason for that is because, obviously, they believe in ethereum. And so they're industrial miners, that's what they do. And so they keep it around for when the profitability returns and they could kick start their mining gear. 
We saw -- that's what we saw in the latter part of last year. We saw the hashrate starting to grow. Most of that was a result of the installed miners reactivating their equipment. It wasn't until earlier this year that we started to see demand in our own GPUs. And when that starts to happen, there are several different dynamics. There's the primary source these days come from powerful ASICs. And then there's some that comes from our GPU and other GPUs in the marketplace. 
And so I think that this is going to be a part of our business. It will grow extremely large, no matter what happens. And the reason for that is because when it starts to grow large, more ASICs comes in the market, which kind of mutes it. And when the market becomes smaller, it's harder for ASICs to sustain the R&D. And so the spot miners -- industrial miners come back, and then will create CMPs. And so we expect it to be kind of a -- to be a small part of our business as we go forward. 
Now one of the important things is to realize that in the near term, the -- because we're in the beginning parts of our Ampere ramp, only 2 quarters into it, into a multiyear cycle, this is also the first time that we've completely changed computer graphics. RTX using ray tracing is completely different than rasterization. And so this is a fundamental change in the way we do computer graphics, and the results have been spectacular. 
There is some 200 million installed base in desktop, some 50 million in laptop. And the vast majority of them, we've only upgraded, approximately, I think it's something like 15% of the installed base that's been upgraded to RTX. And so there's a giant installed base, and the installed base is growing, that we need to update to the next generation of computer graphics.",684

You've been very kind over the last couple of quarters to call out Mellanox, both when it was a positive driver and when it was a headwind. I'm kind of curious when you look into the fiscal first quarter, is there anything of distinction to mention around Mellanox versus core Data Center? And I guess as a follow-on, the key metric that a lot of investors are looking at is when does the core Data Center business year-over-year growth start to reaccelerate. 
And some of that is just simple math. You're just comping very hard compares from last year. But Jensen, how would you think about Data Center year-over-year growth in the context of a reopening trade or of any sort of new applications out there? I mean what happened -- what helped us last time around was the move to natural language AI, is there another big sort of AI application we should be thinking about as we think about Data Center growth reaccelerating?",173
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2021",2021-02-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3840.0,2222657.0,86338380.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,20,"Yes. We're expecting -- Mellanox was down this last quarter. And our compute business grew double digit and offset -- more than offset the decline in Mellanox. 
We expect Q1 to be a growth quarter with Mellanox, and we expect this coming year to be quite an exciting year of growth for Mellanox. The business is growing in Ethernet. It's growing for CSPs. It's growing in InfiniBand for high-performance computing and the switches have grown -- switch business grew 50% year-over-year. And so we're seeing really terrific growth there. 
One of the new initiatives, and we're going to see success towards the second half because the number of adoptions and number of engagements, is our new BlueField DPUs. It's used for virtualization for hyperscalers. It's also used for security. As you know quite well, the future of computing is cloud and it's multi-tenant cloud. And there's no VPN front door to the cloud. You've got millions of people who are using every aspect of your computing. So you need to have distributed firewalls, and you can have it just in one place. 
The intense focus of security across all of the data centers around the world is really creating a great condition for BlueField, which is really perfect for them. And so I expect our Mellanox networking business to grow very nicely this year. And we expect Q1 to be a great growth quarter for compute as well as Mellanox. A killer -- the great driving application for AI are settled. Last year, you're absolutely right that it was natural language understanding and the transformer model and the core of birth in other versions like that really made it possible for  us to enable all kinds of new applications. 
So you're going to see a natural language understanding do text completion and it's going to be integrated. I think it was just announced today that it was going to be integrated into Microsoft Word. We've been working with them on that for some time. And so there's some really exciting applications like that. But the new one that came -- that emerged recently are deep learning-based conversational AI, where the ASR, the speech recognition as well as the speech synthesis are now based on deep learning. It wasn't before. 
They were based on models that ran on CPUs. But now with the deepening models, the accuracy is much, much higher, and it has the ability to also mimic your voice and be a lot more natural. And so the ability to -- but these models are much more complex and much larger. 
The other big, huge driver is recommenders. This is something really worthwhile to take a look at. It's called deep learning recommender models. And recommenders have historically -- whether it's their shopping or personalizing websites or personalizing your store, recommending your basket, recommending your music, historically, it's been used a traditional machine learning algorithm. But because of the accuracy and the -- just the extraordinary economic impact that comes from an incremental 1% inaccuracy, for most of the world's large Internet businesses, people are moving very rapidly to deep learning-based model. 
And these models are gigantic. They're utterly gigantic. And this is an area that is really driving high-performance computers. So we -- I expect us to feel a lot of momentum. And the last one is the one that you I spoke about which has to do with industrial, 5G and edge IoT-type of applications for all of the different industries, whether it's retailer, logistics or transportation, agriculture or warehouses to factories. 
And so we're going to see AI and robotics in a very large number of applications and industries. And we're just seeing so much excitement there.",621

You just mentioned, Jensen, the BlueField-2 product poised to kind of ramp and materialize in the back half of the calendar year. How do you see that? Is it an attach rate? I think there's some discussions in the past about all servers could potentially, over time, incorporate this layer of acceleration. How quickly should we think about that ramp? 
And then the second question is can you just, at a high level, talk about how CPU -- how a CPU strategy -- you're thinking about that in the context of the broader data center market?",107
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2021",2021-02-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3840.0,2222657.0,86338383.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,23,"Sure. If I could just work backwards, I believe that every single data center node will be outfitted with a DPU someday. And that someday is probably, call it, 5 years from now. And the fundamental driver of it is going to be security. Every single application in the data center and every single node in the data center has to be individually secured. Zero-trust Computing, 0 -- or confidential computing and zero-trust computing, these initiatives are going to cause every data center to have every single application and every single node be secured. 
Which means every one of those computers have to have a control play that is isolated from the application plan. And all the applications cannot share the same resources because that application could be network, that application could be an intruder. No application could have access to the control. And yet today, the software-defined data centers, the software-defined networking, software-defined storage, all of the security agents are running in the same processors as the application, and that hasn't changed. 
You see the cloud -- the CSPs in the world moving in this direction. Every single data center will have to move in this direction. So every node will be a DPU process for the software, for the infrastructure. You're essentially going to see the data center infrastructure be offloaded from the application plan, and it will be something like a BlueField. So I think this is our next multibillion-dollar opportunity, CPUs.
We support every CPU in the world, and we're the only accelerated computing platform that accelerates every CPU. Ironically, the only thing we don't accelerate for AI is Arm, but we want to change that. Arm has such an exciting future because the nature of their business model and the nature of their architecture is perfect for the future of hyperscalers and data centers. 
You want the most energy efficiency in every single data center because every data center is power-constrained. We are going to be power constrained in every aspect of computing going forward. And so we would love to build around the Arm processor and invest in building a great ecosystem around it, so that all the world's peripherals and all the world's applications to work on any one of the CPUs that we know today. 
And we're going to start with high-performance computing and start with AI and all the areas that we have a lot of expertise in, build out our platform. So you're starting to see one industry leader after another embrace Arm. And I think that's terrific. But now we've got to energize it with all of the ecosystem support. It can't just be vertical applications, but we want to create a broad general Arm ecosystem.",457

Jensen, if you look at the past computing eras, typically, it's one ecosystem that captures 80% of the value of that computing era. And mainframe says IBM and many computers was stacked, PCs, Wintel, cell phones, Nokia and Apple. So if you don't get the ecosystem right, then you're splitting 20% of the market with a handful of players. So in this next era of computing, parallel processing or AI, I think you've articulated the most compelling architectural vision of the Data Center, of the future with Data Center scale computing devices with CPUs, GPUs, DPUs, integrated in the same box, serving all workloads, I imagine, virtualized environment. 
Can you help us understand where is the market in embracing that vision? And where is NVIDIA in building out that ecosystem for that Data Center scale computing vision? And then maybe as part of that, to what extent is CUDA the kernel for that ecosystem?",160
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2021",2021-02-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3840.0,2222657.0,86338386.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,26,"Yes. We're -- I think we've done a great job building out the platforms for several ecosystems around the world. And the domains that we do incredibly well at are the domains that I have to do with accelerated computing. We pioneered this approach. And we brought it to high-performance computing at first. And we accelerated -- sent to the computing and democratized supercomputing for all researchers, anybody who wants to have a supercomputer now can. And computing it will simply not be the obstacle to somebody's discovery. 
We did the same for artificial intelligence. We did the same for virtualization. We brought -- we expanded the reach of gaming tremendously. Our GeForce today is the largest gaming platform. It's the largest -- single largest body of computers that are used for gaming. And in each case, we expanded the market tremendously. But we would like to do the same for Data Center scale computing as it applies to virtualizing these applications. These applications are also in the process. They've historically required dedicated systems, but they're moving into a virtualized data center environment. And we are best at doing that. They run on our platform today. We have the ability to virtualize it and put it into the Data Center and make it remotely available. 
And so these applications, these domains are some of the most important domains in the world. And so we're in the process of doing that. By doing so, and making our architecture available to CSPs and OEMs, we could create this accelerated computing platform available to everybody. And so that's -- you're seeing our journey doing that. 
First, creating and architecting this platform and then putting it literally into every single data center in the world. But we would also like to -- the next step of our journey is the Phase III of AI, and it has to do with turning every endpoint into a data center. Whether it's a 5G tower, a warehouse, a retail store, a self-driving car, a self-driving truck. These are going to be -- they're all going to be essentially autonomous data centers. And they're going to run AI, but they're going to run a lot more. They're going to do security in real time. 
Networking is going to be incredible, it's going to run software to 5G and GP accelerated 5G we call AERIAL. And so these platforms are going to become data centers. They'll be secure. The software is protected and you can't tamper with it. If you temper with it, it, of course, won't run. And so the capability of these clouds will move all the way out to the edge. And we're in the best position to be able to do that. 
So I do think in this new world of post-Moore's Law, post-Dennard scaling, in this new world where AI and software, the right software in this new world where data centers are going to be literally everywhere and they're unprotected. There's no giant building with a whole bunch of people to secure it. And in this new world, where software is going to enable this autonomous future, I think we are perfectly positioned for it.",532

Q4 capped a truly breakout year for NVIDIA. The 2 biggest engines of our business, Gaming and Data Center, posted powerful growth. Gaming has become the world's largest media and entertainment industry and will grow to be much larger. And again gamers will create, will play, they'll learn, they'll connect. The medium of gaming can host any type of game and eventually evolve into countless metaverses, some for play, some for work. Gaining a simultaneously a great technology and a great business driver for our company. 
This year, we also closed our Mellanox acquisition and successfully united the amazing talent of our companies. Combined, we possess deep expertise in all aspects of computing and networking to drive the architecture of modern data centers. Cloud computing and hyperscalers have transformed the data center into the new unit of computing. Chips and servers are just elements of the data center scale computers now. With our expertise in AI computing, full-stack accelerated computing, our deep network to computing expertise and cloud-to-edge platforms, NVIDIA is helping to drive a great computer industry transformation. And our planned acquisition of Arm, the world's most popular and energy-efficient CPU company, will help position NVIDIA to lead in the age of AI. 
This year was extraordinary. The pandemic will pass, but the world has been changed forever. Technology adoption is accelerating across every industry. Companies and products need to be more remote and autonomous. This will drive data centers, AI and robotics.

Q1 was exceptionally strong with revenue of $5.66 billion and year-on-year growth accelerating to 84%. We set a record in total revenue in Gaming, Data Center and Professional Visualization, driven by our best-ever product lineup and structural tailwinds across our businesses.
Starting with Gaming. Revenue of $2.8 billion was up 11% sequentially and up 106% from a year earlier. This is the third consecutive quarter of accelerating year-on-year growth beginning with the fall launch of our GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs. Based on the Ampere GPU architecture, the 30 Series has been our most successful launch ever, driving incredible demand and setting records for both desktop and laptop GPU sales.
Channel inventories are still lean, and we expect to remain supply-constrained into the second half of the year. With our Ampere GPU architecture now ramping across the stack in both desktop and laptops, we expect the RTX upgrade cycle to kick into high gear as the vast majority of our GPU installed base needs to upgrade.
Laptops continue to drive strong growth this quarter as we started ramping the Ampere GPU architecture across our lineup. Earlier this month, all major PC OEMs launched GeForce RTX 30 Series laptops based on the 3080, 3070 and 3060 as part of their spring refresh. In addition, mainstream versions based on the 3050 and 3050 Ti will be available this summer just in time for back to school, starting at price points as low as $799. This is the largest ever wave of GeForce gaming laptops, over 140 in total, as OEMs address the rising demand from gamers, creators and students for NVIDIA's powered laptops.
The RTX 30 Series delivers our biggest generational leap in performance ever. It also features our second-generation ray tracing technology and frame rate-boosting, AI-powered DLSS. The RTX is a reset for graphics with over 60 accelerated games. This quarter, we added many more, including Call of Duty Modern Warfare, Crysis Remastered and Outriders. We also announced that DLSS is now available in Unreal Engine 4 and soon in the Unity game engine, enabling game developers to accelerate frame rates with minimal effort.
The RTX 30 Series also offers NVIDIA Reflex, a new technology that reduces system latency. Reflex is emerging as a must-have feature for eSports gamers who play competitive titles like Call of Duty: Warzone, Fortnite, VALORANT and Apex Legends. We estimate that about 75% of GeForce gamers play eSports games, and 99% of eSports pros compete on GeForce.
We believe gaming also benefited from crypto mining demand, although it's hard to determine to what extent. We've taken actions to optimize GeForce GPUs for gamers while separately addressing mining demand with cryptocurrency mining processors, or CMPs. Last week, we announced that newly manufactured GeForce RTX 3080, RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 Ti graphic cards will have their Ethereum mining capabilities reduced by half and carry a low hash rate, or LHR identifier. Along with the updated RTX 3060, this should allow our partners to get more GeForce cards into the hands of gamers at better prices.
To help address mining demand, CMP products launched this quarter, optimized for mining performance and efficiency. Because they don't need the specifications required of a GeForce GPU, they don't impact the supply of GeForce GPUs to gamers. CMP revenue was $155 million in Q1, reported as part of the OEM and other category. And our Q2 outlook assumes CMP sales of $400 million.
Our GeForce NOW cloud gaming platform passed 10 million registered numbers this quarter. GFN offers nearly 1,000 PC games from over 300 publishers, more than any other cloud gaming service, including 80 of the most popular free-to-play games. GFN expands the reach of GeForce to billions of underpowered Windows PCs, Macs, Chromebooks, Android devices, iPhones and iPads. GFN is offered in over 70 countries with our latest expansions including Australia, Singapore and South America.
Moving to Pro Viz. Q1 revenue was $372 million, up 21%, both sequentially and year-on-year. Strong notebook growth was driven by a new sleek and powerful RTX-powered mobile workstations with Max-Q technology, and the enterprises continue to support remote workforce initiatives. Desktop workstations rebounded as enterprise resumed the spending that has been deferred during the lockdown with continued growth likely as offices open. Key verticals driving Q1 demand include manufacturing, health care, automotive and media and entertainment.
At GTC, we announced the coming general availability of NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise, the world's first technology platform that enables global 3D design teams to collaborate in real time in a shared space, working across multiple software speeds. This incredible technology build on NVIDIA's entire body of work and is supported by a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Early adopters include sophisticated design teams at some of the world's leading companies such as BMW Group, Foster + Partners and WPP.
Over 400 companies have been evaluating Omniverse, and nearly 17,000 users have downloaded the open beta. Omniverse is offered as a software subscription on a per user and a per server basis. As the world becomes more digital, virtual and collaborative, we see a significant revenue opportunity for Omniverse.
We also announced powerful new Ampere architecture GPUs for next-generation desktop and laptop workstation. The new RTX-powered workstations will be available from all major OEMs.
Moving to automotive. Q1 revenue was $154 million, up 6% sequentially and down 1% year-on-year. Growth in AI cockpit revenue was partially offset by the expected decline in legacy infotainment revenue. 
We extended our technology leadership with the announcement of the next-generation NVIDIA DRIVE Atlan SoC. Atlan will deliver an unrivaled 1,000 trillion operations per second of performance and integrate data center class NVIDIA BlueField networking and security technologies to enhance vehicle performance and safety, making it a true data center on wheels. Atlan, which targets automakers' 2025 models, will follow the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin SoC, which delivers 254 TOPS that has been selected by leading vehicle makers for production time lines starting next year.
The NVIDIA DRIVE platform has achieved global adoption across the transportation industry. Our automotive design win pipeline now exceeds $8 billion through fiscal 2027. Most recently, Volvo Cars announced that it will use NVIDIA DRIVE Orin, building on our next great momentum with some of the largest automakers, including Mercedes Benz, SAIC and Hyundai Motor Group. 
In robotaxis, we added GM Cruise to the growing number of companies adopting the NVIDIA DRIVE platform, which includes Amazon Zoox and DiDi. We've also had a great traction with new energy vehicle makers. Our latest wins include Faraday Future, R Auto, IM Motors and VinFast, which joined previously announced wins with SAIC, NIO, Xpeng and Li Auto. In trucking, Navistar is partnered with TuSimple in selecting NVIDIA DRIVE for autonomous driving, joining previously announced Volvo Autonomous Solutions and Plus.
NVIDIA is helping to revolutionize the transportation industry. Our full stack software-defined AV and AI cockpit platform spans silicon, systems, software and AI data center infrastructure, enabling over-the-air upgrades to enhance safety and majority of driving throughout the vehicle's lifetime. Starting with our lead partner, Mercedes-Benz, NVIDIA DRIVE can transform the automotive industry with amazing technologies delivered through new software and services business models.
Moving to Data Center. Revenue topped $2 billion for the first time, growing 8% sequentially and up 79% from the year ago quarter, which did not include Mellanox. Hyperscale customers led our growth this quarter as they built infrastructure to commercialize AI in their services. In addition, cloud providers have adopted the A100 to support growing demand for AI from enterprises, start-ups and research organizations.
Customers are deploying NVIDIA's A100 and DGX platforms to train deep neural networks with rising computational intensity led by 2 of the fastest-growing areas of AI, natural language understanding and deep recommendators. In March, Google Cloud Platform announced general availability of the A100 with early customers, including Square for its cash application and Alphabet's DeepMind. The A100 is deployed across all major hyperscale and cloud service providers globally, and we see strengthening demand in the coming quarters.
Every industry is becoming a technology industry and accelerating investments in AI infrastructure, both through the cloud and on-premise. Our vertical industries grew both sequentially and year-on-year, led by consumer Internet companies. For example, Naver, a leading Internet technology company in Korea and Japan, is training giant AI language models at scale on DGX SuperPOD to pioneer new services across e-commerce, search, entertainment and payment applications. 
We continue to gain traction in inference with hyperscale and vertical industry customers across a broadening portfolio of GPUs. We had record shipments of GPUs used for inference. Inference growth is driving not just the T4, which was up strongly in the quarter, but also the universal A100 Tensor Core GPU as well as the new Ampere architecture-based A10 and A30 GPUs, all excellent at training as well as inferencing.
Customers are increasingly migrating from CPUs to GPUs for AI inference for 2 chief reasons. First, GPUs can better keep up with the exponential growth in the size and the complexity of deep neural networks and respond with the required low latency. In April's MLPerf AI inference benchmark, NVIDIA achieved the top results across every category, spanning computer vision, medical imaging, recommendator systems, speech recognition and natural language processing.
And second, NVIDIA's full stack inference platform, including Triton Inference Server software, simplifies the complexity of deploying AI applications by supporting models for all major frameworks and optimizing from different query types, including batch, real time and streaming. Triton is supported by several partners in their cloud services, including Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Tencent.
Examples of how customers use NVIDIA's inference platform include Microsoft for grammar checking in Office, the United States Postal Service for real-time package analytics, T-Mobile for customer service, Pinterest for image search and GE Healthcare for heart disease detection.
We also had strong results with Mellanox networking products. Like our compute business, strong growth was driven by hyperscale customers across both Ethernet and InfiniBand. We achieved key design wins and proof-of-concept trials for the NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPU with cloud service providers and consumer Internet companies. 
We also unveiled BlueField-3, the first DPU built for AI and accelerated computing with support from VMware, NetApp Splunk, Cloudflare and others. BlueField-3 is the industry's first 400-gig DPU and delivers the equivalent data center services of up to 300 CPU cores. It transforms traditional server infrastructure into zero-trust environment in which every user is authenticated by offloading and isolating data center services from business applications. With BlueField-3, our DPU road map will deliver an unrivaled 100x performance increase over a 3-year period. 
As we look back at the first full year since closing the Mellanox acquisition, we are extremely pleased with how the business has performed. It has not only exceeded our financial projections, but it has been instrumental in key new platforms like the DGX SuperPOD and the BlueField DPU, enabling our data center scale computing strategy.
In April, we held our largest ever GPU Technology Conference with more than 200,000 registrants from 195 countries. Jensen's keynote had over 14 million views. At GTC, we announced our first data center CPU, NVIDIA Grace, targeted at processing massive next-generation AI models with trillions of parameters. The Arm-based processor will enable 10x the performance and energy efficiency of today's fastest servers. With Grace, NVIDIA has a 3-chip strategy with GPU, DPU and now CPU. The Swiss National Supercomputing Center and the U.S. Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory are the first to announce plans to build Grace-powered supercomputers. Grace will be available in early 2023.
GTC is first and foremost for developers. We announced NVIDIA developed and optimized pretrained model availability on the NVIDIA GPU Cloud registry. Developers can choose a pretrained model and adapt it to fit their specific needs using NVIDIA TAO, our transfer learning software. TAO fine tunes the model with customers' own small data set to give models a custom fit without the cost, time and massive data sets required to train a neural network from scratch. Once a model is optimized and ready for deployment, users can integrate it with an NVIDIA application framework that fits their use.
For example, the NVIDIA Jarvis framework for interactive conversational AI is now generally available and used by customers such as T-Mobile and Snap. And the NVIDIA Merlin framework for deep recommendators is an open beta with customers such as Snap and Tencent. With the chosen application framework, users can launch NVIDIA Fleet Command software to deploy and manage the AI application across a variety of NVIDIA GPU-powered devices. 
For our enterprise customers, we unveiled a new enterprise-grade software offering available as a perpetual license or subscription. NVIDIA AI Enterprise is a comprehensive suite of AI software that speeds development and deployment of AI workloads and simplifies management of enterprise AI infrastructure. Through our partnership with VMware, hundreds of thousands of vSphere customers will be able to purchase NVIDIA AI Enterprise with the same familiar pricing model that IT managers use to procure VMware infrastructure software.
We also made several announcements at GTC about accelerating the delivery of both NVIDIA AI and accelerated computing to enterprises and edge users among the world's largest industries. Leading server OEMs launched NVIDIA-certified systems, which are industry standard servers based on the NVIDIA EGX platform. They run NVIDIA AI Enterprise software and are supported by the NVIDIA A30 and A10 GPUs. Initial customers include Lockheed Martin and Mass General Brigham.
In addition, we announced the NVIDIA AI-on-5G platform supported on NVIDIA EGX servers to enable high-performance 5G RAM and AI applications. The AI-on-5G platform leverages the NVIDIA Aerial software and the NVIDIA BlueField-2 A100 converged card, which combines our GPUs and DPUs. We are teaming with Fujitsu, Google Cloud, Mavenir, Radisys and Wind River in developing solutions based on our AI-on-5G platform to speed the creation of smart cities and factories, advanced hospitals and intelligent stores.
Another highlight at GTC was the announcement of a broad range of initiatives to strengthen the Arm ecosystem across cloud data centers, HPC, enterprise and edge and PCs. In the cloud, we are bringing together AWS Graviton2 processors and NVIDIA GPUs to provide a range of benefits, including lower-cost support for richer game streaming experiences and greater performance for Arm-based workloads.
In HPC, we are bringing together an Ampere Altra CPU with NVIDIA GPUs, DPUs and NVIDIA HPC software developer kit. Initial supercomputing centers deploying it include Oak Ridge and Los Alamos National Labs. In the enterprise and edge, we are bringing together Marvell Arm-based OCTEON processors and the NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate video analytics and cybersecurity solutions. And in PCs, we are bringing together MediaTek's Arm-based processors with NVIDIA's RTX GPUs to enable realistic ray trace graphics and cutting-edge AI in a new class of Arm-based laptops.
On our Arm acquisition, we are making steady progress in working with the regulators across key regions. We remain on track to close the transaction within our original time frame of early 2022. Arm's IP is widely used, but the company needs a partner that can help it achieve new heights. NVIDIA is uniquely positioned to enhance Arm's capabilities. And we are committed to invest in developing the Arm ecosystem, enhancing R&D, adding IP and turbocharging its development to grow into new markets in the data center, IoT and embedded devices, areas where it only has a light footprint or in some cases, none at all.
Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was down 100 basis points from a year earlier and up 100 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP gross margin was up 40 basis points from a year earlier and up 70 points sequentially. The sequential non-GAAP increase was largely driven by a more favorable mix within data center and the addition of CMP products.
Q1 GAAP EPS was $3.03, up 106% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.66, up 103% from a year ago. Q1 cash flow from operations was $1.9 billion.
Let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. We expect broad-based sequential year-on-year revenue growth in all of our market platforms. Our outlook includes $400 million in CMP. Aside from CMP, the sequential revenue increase in our Q2 outlook is driven largely by Data Center and Gaming. In Data Center, we expect sequential growth in both compute and networking. In Gaming, with the move to low hash rate GeForce CPUs and increasing the amount of CMP products, we are making a significant effort to serve miners with CMPs and provide more GeForce cards to gamers. If there is additional CMP demand, we have supply flexibility to support it. We believe these actions, combined with strong gaming demand, will drive an increase in our core Gaming business for Q2.
Now to look at our outlook for Q2. Revenue is expected to be $6.3 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 64.6% and 66.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.76 billion and $1.26 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are both expected to be an expense of approximately $50 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 10%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $300 million to $325 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.
In closing, let me highlight that Jeff Fisher and Manuvir Das will keynote Computex on the evening of May 31 U.S. time as well as several upcoming events for the financial community. We will be virtually attending the Evercore TMT Conference on June 7, the BofA 2021 Global Technology Conference on June 9 and the NASDAQ Virtual Investor Conference on June 16. Our earnings call to discuss our second quarter results is scheduled for Wednesday, August 18.

I know of the 600 to 650 in growth, you said 250 is coming from CMP and both Gaming and Data Center will be up. Can we assume that they're up about equally, so you're getting about 200 roughly from each of those? 
And I guess second part of that is, within Data Center, I'm wondering, can you speak to the networking piece? It sounds like maybe it was up a bit more modestly than it's been up the past few quarters. I'm just wondering what the outlook is there.",104

Thanks so much for the question on our guidance. So I first want to start off with we see demand really across all of our markets. All of our different market platforms, we do plan to grow sequentially. You are correct that we are expecting an increase in our CMP. And outside of our CMP growth, we expect the lion's share of our growth to come from our Data Center and Gaming.
In our Data Center business, right now, our product lineup couldn't be better. We have a strong overall portfolio, both for training and for inferencing, and we're seeing strong demand across our hyperscales and vertical industries. We've made a deliberate effort on the Gaming perspective to supply to our gamers the cards that they would like, given the strong demand that we see. So that will also support the sequential growth that we're receiving. So you are correct that we do see a growth sequentially coming from Data Center and Gaming, both contributing quite well to our growth. 
I didn't answer your second question, my apologies, on Mellanox. Additionally, Mellanox is an important part of our Data Center. It is quite integrated with our overall products. We did continue to see growth this last quarter, and we are also expecting them to sequentially grow as we move into Q2. They are a smaller part of our overall Data Center business, but again, we do expect them to grow.",241

And as you think about the purchase obligations that you reported, up 45% year-on-year, how much of that is related to long lead time Data Center? And how should we interpret that in terms of what kind of ramp we could see in the second half, particularly as you think about perhaps adding more growth from enterprise on top of what was hyperscale-driven growth in the April quarter?",92
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, May 26, 2021",2021-05-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3744.0,2310723.0,89113804.0,Answer,Colette Kress,,Executives,8,"Let me take the first part of your question regarding our purchasing, our purchasing of inventory and what we're seeing in just both our purchase commitments and our inventory. The market has definitely changed to where long lead times are required to build out our data center products. So we're on a steady stream to both commit longer term so that we can make sure that we can serve our customers with the great lineup of products that we have. So yes, a good part of those purchase commitments is really about the long lead times of the components to create the full systems. 
I'll turn the second part of the question over to Jensen.",115

32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, May 26, 2021",2021-05-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3744.0,2310723.0,89113807.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,11,"Yes. Yes. We're seeing strength across the board in data centers, and we're seeing strengthening demand. C.J., our Data Center, as you know, accelerates a range of applications, from scientific computing, both physical and life sciences; data analytics and classical machine learning; cloud computing and cloud graphics, which is becoming more important because of remote work; and very importantly, AI, both for training as well as inferencing for classical machine learning models like XGBoost all the way to deep learning-based models like conversational AI, natural language understanding, recommender systems and so on. 
And so we have a large suite of applications, and our NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA HPC SDKs accelerate these applications in data centers. They run on systems that range from HGX for the hyperscalers to DGX for on-prem to EGX for enterprise and edge all the way out to AGX autonomous systems. And this quarter at GTC, we announced one of our largest initiatives, and it's taken us several years. You've seen me working on it in open -- out in the open over the course of the last several years. Hence, it's called -- EGX is our enterprise AI platform. 
We're democratizing AI. We're bringing it out of cloud. We're bringing it to enterprises, and we're bringing it out to the edge. And the reason for that is because the vast majority of the world's automation that has to be done has data that has data sovereignty issues or data rate issues that can't move to the cloud easily. And so we got -- we have to move the computing to their premise and oftentimes all way out of the edge. 
The platform -- the platform has to be secure, has to be confidential. It has to be remotely manageable. And of course, it has to be high performance and it has to be cloud native and has to be built like the cloud, the modern way of building cloud data centers. And so these stacks has to be modern on the one hand. It has to be integrated into classical enterprise systems on the other hand, which is the reason why we work so closely with VMware and accelerated VMware's operating system, data center operating system and software-defined data center stacks on BlueField. 
Meanwhile, we ported NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA HPC onto VMware so that they could run distributed, large-scale, accelerated computing for the very first time. And that partnership -- that partnership was announced at VMworld. It was announced at GTC, and we're in the process of going to market with all of our enterprise partners. They're OEMs, they're value-added resellers, they're service -- they're solution integrators all over the world. 
And so this is a really large endeavor. And the early indications of it are really exciting. And the reason for that is because, as you know, our data center business is more than 50% vertical industry enterprise already. It's more than 50% vertical industry enterprises already. And by creating this easy-to-adapt and easy-to-integrate stack, it's going to allow them to move a lot faster. 
And so this is the next major wave of AI. This is a very exciting part of our initiative, and it's something that I've been working on for -- we've been working on for quite a long time. And so I'm delighted with the launch this quarter at GTC. 
The rest of the data center is doing great, too. As Colette mentioned, hyperscale demand is strengthening. We're seeing that for computing and networking You know that the world's cloud data centers are moving to deep learning because every small percentage that they get out of predictive inference drives billions and billions of dollars of economics for them. And so the movement towards deep learning shifts the data center workload away from CPUs because accelerators are so important. And so hyperscale, we're seeing great traction and great demand. 
And then lastly, supercomputing. Supercomputing centers all over the world are building out, and we're really in a great position there to fuse for the very first time simulation-based approaches as well as data-driven based approaches, what is called artificial intelligence. And so across the board, our data center is gaining momentum. And we see -- we just see great strength right now, and it's growing strength. And we've really set up for years of growth in data center. This is the largest segment of computing, as you know. And this segment of computing is going to continue to grow for some time to come.",753

I'm going to try to slip in 2 of them here. First of all, Colette, I think in the past, you talked about how much of your gaming installed base is kind of on the pre-ray tracing platforms, really kind of context behind the upgrade cycle that's still in front of us. That's kind of question one. 
And then on the heels of the last question, I'm just curious, things like VMware's Project Monterey, as we think about the BlueField-2 product and BlueField-3, how should we think about those starting to become -- or when should they become really material incremental revenue growth contributors for the company?",111

We've had a strong cycle already, but still, we probably have approximately 15% moving up a little bit from that at this time. So it's a great opportunity for us to continue to upgrade a good part of that installed base, not only just with our desktop GPUs, but the RTX laptops are also a great driver of growth and upgrading folks to RTX.",98

Aaron, great question on BlueField. First of all, the modern data center has to be rearchitected for several reasons. There are several fundamental reasons that makes it very, very clear that the architecture has to change. The first is it's cloud native, which means that a data center is shared for everybody. It's multi-tenant. You don't know who's coming and going, and it's exposed to everybody on the Internet. 
Number two, you have to assume that it's a zero-trust environment because you don't know who's using it. It used to be that we have perimeter security, but those days are gone because it's cloud native, it's remote access, it's multi-tenant, it's public cloud, the infrastructure is used for internal and external applications. So number two, it has to be zero trust. 
The third reason is something that started a long time ago, which is software-defined in every way because you don't want a whole bunch of bespoke custom gear inside the data center. You want to operate the data center with software. You want to be software-defined. The software-defined data center movement enabled this one pane of glass, a few IT managers orchestrating millions and millions of nodes of computers at one place. 
And the software runs what used to be storage, networking, security, virtualization, and all of that -- all of those things have become a lot larger and a lot more intensive. And it's consuming a lot of the data center. In fact, the estimate, depending on how you want to think about it, how much security you want to put on it, if you assume that is a zero-trust data center, probably half of the CPU cores inside that data center is running not applications. And that's kind of strange because you created the data center to run services and applications, which is the only thing that makes money. 
The other half of the computing is completely soaked up running the software-defined data center just to provide for those applications. And then you could imagine even accepting, if you like, as the cost of doing business. However, it co-mingles the infrastructure, the security plane and the application plane, and it exposes the data center to attackers. 
And so you fundamentally want to change the architecture as a result of that to offload the software-defined virtualization and the infrastructure operating system, if you will, and the security services to accelerate it because Moore's Law has ended and moving software that was running on one set of CPUs, which is really, really good already, to another set of CPUs isn't going to make it more effective. Separating it doesn't make it more effective. And so you want to offload that and take that application and software and accelerate it using accelerators, a form of accelerated computing. 
And so that's -- these things are fundamentally what BlueField is all about. And we created the processor that allows us to -- BlueField-2 replaces approximately 30 CPU cores. BlueField-3 replaces approximately 300 CPU cores just to put -- give you a sense of it. And then BlueField-4, we're in the process of building already. And so we've got a really aggressive pipeline to do this. 
Now how big is this market? The way to think about that is every single networking chip in the world -- every single networking chip in the world will be a smart networking chip. It will be a programmable accelerated infrastructure processor. And that's what the DPU is. It's a data center on a chip. And I believe every single server node will have it. It will replace today's mix with something like BlueField. And it will offload about half of the software processing that's consuming data centers today. But most importantly, it will enable this future world where every single packet, every single application is being monitored in real time all the time for intrusion. 
And so how big is that application? How big is that market? Just 25 million servers a year, that's the size of the market. And we know that servers are growing, and so that will give you a feeling for that. And then in the future, servers are going to move out to the edge. And all of those edge devices will have something like BlueField. 
And then how are we doing? We're doing POCs now with just about every Internet company. We're doing really exciting work there. We've included it in high-performance computing so that it's possible for supercomputers in the future to be cloud native, to be zero trust, to be secured and still be a super computer. 
And then we expect next year to have a meaningful, if not significant, revenues contribution from BlueField, and this is going to be a really large growth market for us. You can tell I'm excited about this, and I put a lot of my energy into it. The company is working really hard on it.

32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, May 26, 2021",2021-05-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3744.0,2310723.0,89113815.0,Question,Vivek Arya,,Analysts,19,"Jensen, is NVIDIA able to ring-fence this crypto impact in your CMP product? So even if, let's say, crypto goes away for whatever reason, the decline is a lot more predictable and manageable than what we saw in the 2018-'19 cycle. And then kind of part B of that is, how do you think about your core PC gamer demand? Because when we see this kind of 106% year-on-year growth rate, it brings questions of sustainability. So give us your perspectives on these 2 topics. Just how does one ring-fence kind of the crypto effect? And what do you think about the sustainability of your core PC gamer demand?",109
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, May 26, 2021",2021-05-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3744.0,2310723.0,89113816.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,20,"Sure. Thanks. First of all, it's hard to estimate exactly how much and where crypto mining is being done. However, we can only assume that the vast majority of it is contributed by professional miners, especially when the amount of mining increases tremendously like it has. And so we created CMP, and CMP and GeForce are not fungible. You could use GeForce for mining, but you can't use CMP for gaming. CMP is -- yields better, and producing those doesn't take away from the supply of GeForce. And so it protects our GeForce supply for the gamers. 
And the question that you have is what happens when -- on the tail end of this. There are several things that we hope. And we learned a lot from the last time, but you never learn enough about this dynamic. What we hope is that the CMPs will satisfy the miners and will stay in mines -- in the professional mines. And we're trying to produce a fair amount of them, and we have -- we've secured a lot of demand for the CMPs, and we'll fulfill it. 
And what makes it different this time is several things. One, we're in the beginning of our RTX cycle, whereas Pascal was the last GTX. And not only that, it was at the tail end of the GTX cycle. That was the last GTX and that was the tail end of the GTX cycle. We're at the very beginning of the RTX 30 cycle. And because we've reinvented computer graphics, we reset the computer industry. And after 3 years, the entire graphics industry has followed. Every game developer has moved to ray tracing. Every content developer and every content tool has moved to ray tracing. And so if you move to ray tracing, these applications are so much better, and they simply run too slow on GTX. 
And so we're seeing a reset of the installed base, if you will. And at a time when the gaming market is the largest ever, we've got this incredible installed base of GeForce users. We've reinvented computer graphics, and we've reset the installed base and created an upgrade opportunity that's really exciting at a time when the market is -- the gaming market -- the gaming industry is really large. And what's really exciting on top of that is that gaming is no longer just gaming. But it's infused into sports, eSports. It's infused into art. It's infused into social. 
And so gaming has such a large cultural impact now. It's the largest form of entertainment. And I think that the experience we're going through is going to last a while. And so one, I hope that crypto will -- the CMP will steer our GeForce supply to gamers. We see strong demand, and I expect to see strong demand for quite some time because of the dynamics that I've described. And hopefully, in the combination of these 2, we'll see strong growth in -- through -- strong growth in our core game business through the year.",510

32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, May 26, 2021",2021-05-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3744.0,2310723.0,89113818.0,Question,John Pitzer,,Analysts,22,"Jensen, I have 2 hopefully quick questions. First, I harken back to the mantra you guys put out a couple of analyst days ago, ""The more you spend, the more you save."" And you've always been very successful as you brought down the cost of doing something to really drive penetration growth. And so I'm curious with the NVIDIA enterprise AI software stack. Is there a sense that you can give us as to how much that brings down the cost of deployment in AI inside the enterprise? And do you think whether COVID lockdown related or cost related, there's pent-up demand that this unlocks?
And then my second question is just around government subsidies. A lot of talks out of Washington about subsidizing the chip industry. A lot of that goes towards building fabs domestically. But when I look at AI, I can't think of anything more important to maintain sort of leadership in relative to national security. How do we think about NVIDIA and kind of the impact that these government subsidies might have on either you or your customers or your business trends?",186
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, May 26, 2021",2021-05-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3744.0,2310723.0,89113819.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,23,"The more you buy, the more you shall save. There's no question about that. And the reason for that is because we're in the business of accelerated computing. We don't accelerate every application. However, for the applications we do accelerate, the acceleration is so dramatic. And because we sell a component, the entire system, the TCO, the TCO of the entire system and all the services and all the people and the infrastructure and the energy cost has been reduced by X factors, sometimes 10x, sometimes 15x, sometimes 5x. 
And so the -- but when we set our minds on excelling a certain class of applications -- and recently, we worked on quantum so that we could help the quantum industry -- quantum computing industry, accelerate their simulators so that they could discover new algorithms and embed future computers. Even though it won't happen until 2030, for the next 20 years,  we're going to -- 15 years, we're going to have some really, really great work that we can do using NVIDIA GPUs to do quantum simulations. 
We recently did a lot of work in natural language understanding, in computational biology so that we could decode biology and understand how biology is -- to infer, to understand it and to predictably improve upon it and design new proteins. Those words are so vital, and that's what accelerated computing is all about. 
Our enterprise software -- and I really appreciate the question. Our enterprise software used to be just about the vGPU, which is virtualizing the GPU inside the VMware environment or inside the Red Hat environment and makes it possible for multiple users to use one GPU, which is the nature of enterprise virtualization. But now with NVIDIA AI, NVIDIA Omniverse, NVIDIA Fleet Command, whether you're doing collaboration or virtual simulations for robotics and digital twins, designing your factory, or you're doing data analytics, learning what the predictive features are that could create an AI model, predictive model, then you can deploy out at the edge using Fleet Command. 
We now have an end-to-end suite of software that is consistent with today's enterprise service agreements. It's consistent with today's enterprise business models and allows us to support customers directly and provide them with the necessary service promises that they expect because they're delivering -- they're trying to build a mission-critical application on top. 
And more importantly, by creating this -- productizing our software, we provide the ability for our large network of partners, OEM partners, value-added resellers, system integrators, solution providers. For this large network of hundreds of thousands of IT sales professionals that we are connected to through our network, we give them a product that they can take to market. 
And so the distribution channel, the sales channel of VMware, the sales channel of Cloudera, the sales channel of all of our partners in EDA and design, Autodesk, Dassault, so on and so forth, all of these sales channels and all of these partners are now partners in taking our stacks to market. And we have a fully integrated system that are open to the OEMs so that they could create systems that run the stack. And it's all certified, all tested, all benchmarked and, of course, very importantly, all supported. 
And so this new way of taking our products to market, whereas our cloud business is going to continue to grow and that part of AI is going to continue to grow, that business is direct. We sell components directly to them. We support them directly. But there are 10 of those customers in the world. For enterprises, there are thousands, industries far and wide. And so I think there's -- we now have a great stack and a great software stack that allows us to take it to the world's market so that everybody could buy more and save more.",644

So Colette, last quarter, you had kind of suggested that Q1 would be the trough, I guess, for the Gaming as well as the rest of the company, but Gaming in particular. And it would grow sequentially through the year. I guess given the strength we're seeing in the first half, do you still believe that, that is the case? And I kind of heard you guys, I think, kind of dance around that point a little bit in response to one of the other questions. But could you clarify that? Is that still your belief that, that core Gaming business can grow sequentially through the rest of the year? 
And I guess same question as well for Data Center, especially since it sounds like hyperscale is now coming back like after a few quarters of digestion and then all of the other tailwinds you've talked about. I mean is there any reason to think the Data Center itself shouldn't also grow sequentially like through the rest of the year?",174
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, May 26, 2021",2021-05-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3744.0,2310723.0,89113822.0,Answer,Colette Kress,,Executives,26,"Yes. Stacy, thanks for the question. So first, I'll start with when we talked about our Q1 results and when we're looking at Q1, we were really discussing a lot about what we expected between Q4 and Q1. Given what we knew was still high demand for Gaming, we believe we will continue to grow between Q4 and Q1, which often we don't. And we absolutely have the strength of overall demand to grow. What that then led was, again, continued growth from Q1 to Q2 as we are working hard to provide more supply for the strong demand that we see. We have talked about that we have additional supply coming. We expect to continue to grow as we move into the second half of the year as well as for Gaming. 
Now we only guide 1 quarter at a time, but our plan is to take the supply, serve the overall gamers, work on building out the channel. As we know, the channel is quite lean. And so yes, we do and still expect growth in the second half of the year, particularly when we see the lineup of games, the Holiday overall coming, the back-to-school, all very important cycles for us. And there's a great opportunity to upgrade this RTX installed base. 
Now in terms of Data Center, we'll work in terms of our guidance here. We have growth from Q1 to Q2 planned in our overall guidance. And we do see as things continue to open up a time to accelerate in the second half of the year for Data Center. We have, again, a great lineup of products here, couldn't be a better lineup now that we've also added the inferencing products and the host of overall applications that are using our software that we have. So this could be an opportunity as well to see that continued growth. We'll work in terms of serving the supply that we need for both of these markets. But yes, we can see definitely growth in the second half of the year.",344

Thank you for joining us today. NVIDIA computing platform is accelerating. Launched at GTC, we are now ramping new platforms and initiatives. There are several that I'll mention.
First, enabled by the fusion of NVIDIA RTX, NVIDIA AI, NVIDIA [ DGX ], we built Omniverse, a platform for virtual collaboration and virtual worlds to enable tens of millions of artists and designers to create together in their own metaverses. 
Second, we laid the foundation to be a 3-chip data center scale computing company with GPUs, DPUs and CPUs. 
Third, AI is the most powerful technology force of our time. We partner with cloud and consumer Internet companies to scale out and commercialize AI-powered services. And we're democratizing AI for every enterprise and every industry. With NVIDIA EGX-certified systems, the NVIDIA enterprise AI suite, pre-trained models for conversational AI, language understanding, recommender systems and our broad partnerships across the IT industry, we are removing the barriers for every enterprise to access state-of-the-art AI. 
Fourth, the work of NVIDIA Clara in using AI to revolutionize genomics and biology is deeply impactful for the health care industry, and I look forward to telling you a lot more about this in the future. 
And fifth, the electric, self-driving and software-defined car is coming. With NVIDIA DRIVE, we are partnering with the global transportation industry to reinvent the car architecture, reinvent mobility, reinvent driving and reinvent the business model of the industry. Transportation is going to be one of the world's largest technology industries. 
From gaming, metaverses, cloud computing, AI, robotics, self-driving cars, genomics, computational biology, NVIDIA is doing important work in innovating in the fastest-growing markets today. As you can see, on top of our computing platforms that span PC, HPC, cloud, enterprise to autonomous edge, we've also transformed our business model beyond chips. NVIDIA vGPU, NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Fleet Command and NVIDIA Omniverse adds enterprise software license and subscription to our business model. And NVIDIA GeForce NOW and NVIDIA DRIVE with Mercedes-Benz as the lead partner are end-to-end services on top of that. 
I want to thank all of the NVIDIA employees and partners for the amazing work you're doing. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thank you.",374

Q2 was another strong quarter, with revenue of $6.5 billion and year-on-year growth of 68%. We set records for total revenue as well as for gaming, data center and professional visualization. 
Starting with gaming, revenue was $3.1 billion, was up 11% sequentially and up 85% from a year earlier. Demand remained exceptionally strong, outpacing supply. We are now 4 quarters into Ampere architecture product cycle for gaming and it continues to be our best ever. 
At Computex in June, we announced 2 powerful new GPUs for gamers and creators, the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti, delivering 50% faster performance than their prior generation, with acclaimed features such as real-time retracing, NVIDIA DLSS AI rendering, reflex and broadcast. 
Laptop demand was also very strong. OEMs adopted Ampere architecture GPUs and a record number of designs from the top-of-the-line gaming laptops to those to Main Street price points as low as $799 that bring the power of GeForce CPUs to gamers, students and creators on-the-go. Ampere architecture powered laptops feature our third-generation Max-Q power optimization technology that enables ultrathin designs, such as the new Alienware x15, the world's most powerful sub-16-millimeter gaming laptop. 
NVIDIA RTX technology has reset computer graphics and spurred our biggest ever refresh cycle. Ampere has been our fastest ramping gaming GPU architecture on Steam and the combination of Turing and Ampere RTX GPUs have only upgraded about 20% of our installed base. 80% have yet to upgrade to RTX. And the audience for global e-sports will soon approach 0.5 billion people, while the number of those who livestream games is expected to reach over 700 million. The number of PC gamers on Steam is up almost 20% over the past year. 
More than 60 RTX games now support NVIDIA's RTX ray tracing or DLSS, including today's biggest game franchises such as Minecraft, Fortnite and Cyberpunk. New RTX games this quarter include Red Dead Redemption 2, one of the top-rated games of all time. Popular titles like Rainbow Six Siege and [indiscernible] and Minecraft RTX in China with over 400 million players. To competitive gamers, NVIDIA Reflex, which includes latency is now supported by 20 games.
Let me say a few words on cryptocurrency mining. In an effort to address the needs of miners and direct GeForce to gamers, we increased the supply of cryptocurrency mining processors or CMP, and introduced low hash rate GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability. Over 80% of our Ampere architecture-based GeForce shipments in the quarter were low hash rate GPUs. The combination of crypto to gaming revenue is difficult to quantify. CMP revenue, which is recognized in OEM, was $266 million, lower than our original $400 million estimate on reduced mining profitability, and we expect a minimal contribution from CMP going forward. 
GeForce now reached a new milestone this quarter surpassing 1,000 PC games, more than any other cloud gaming service. The premium tier is available for a subscription of $10 per month, giving gamers access to RTX class performance, even on an underpowered PC, Mac, Chromebook, iOS or Android device. 
Moving to pro visualization. Q2 revenue was a record $519 million, up 40% sequentially and up 156% year-on-year. Strong sequential revenue growth was led by desktop workstations, driven by demand to outfit design offices at home, as remote work becomes the norm across industries. This is also the first big quarter of the Ampere architecture ramp for pro visualization. Key verticals driving Q2 demand include automotive, public sector and health care. 
At SIGGRAPH last week, we announced an expansion of NVIDIA Omniverse, our simulation and collaboration platform that provides the foundation of the metaverse. Through our new integrations with Blender, the world's leading open source 3D animation tool and Adobe, we're opening the Omniverse platform to millions of additional users. We are also collaborating with Apple and Pixar to bring advanced physics capabilities to Pixar's Universal Scene Description framework, embracing open standards to provide 3D workflows to billions of devices. Omniverse Enterprise software is in the early access stage and will be generally available later this year on a subscription basis from NVIDIA's partners, including Dell, HP, Lenovo and many others. Over 500 companies are evaluating Omniverse Enterprise, including BMW, Volvo and Lockheed Martin, and more than 50,000 individual creators have downloaded Omniverse since it entered open beta in December. 
Moving to automotive, our Q2 revenue was $152 million, down 1% sequentially and up 3% year-on-year. Sequential revenue declines in infotainment were largely offset by growth in self-driving. Looking further out, we have substantial design wins set to ramp that we expect will drive a major inflection in revenue in the coming years. 
This quarter, we announced several additional wins.  Self-driving start-up, AutoX, unveiled its latest autonomous driving platform for RoboTaxis powered by NVIDIA DRIVE. The performance and safe capabilities of the software-defined NVIDIA DRIVE platform has enabled AutoX to become one of the first companies in the world to provide full self-driving mobility services without the need for a safety driver. 
In autonomous trucking, DRIVE ecosystem partner Plus signed a deal with Amazon to provide at least 1,000 self-driving system to Amazon's fleet of delivery vehicles. These systems are powered by NVIDIA DRIVE for high-performance, energy-efficient and centralized AI compute. An autonomous trucking start-up, Embark, is building on NVIDIA DRIVE. The system is being developed for trucks for 4 major OEMs: Freightliner, Navistar International, PACCAR and Volvo, representing the vast majority of the Class 8 or largest sized trucks in the U.S. The NVIDIA DRIVE platform is being rapidly adopted across the transportation industry from passenger-owned vehicles to RoboTaxi, to trucking and delivery vehicles. We believe everything that moves will be autonomous someday. 
Moving to data center. Revenue of $2.4 billion grew 16% sequentially and 35% from the year ago quarter, the year ago quarter, which was our first quarter to include Mellanox. Growth was driven by both hyperscale customers and vertical industries, each of which had record revenues. Our flagship A100 continued to ramp across hyperscale and cloud computing customers, with Microsoft Azure announcing general availability in June following AWS and Google Cloud Platform's general availability in prior quarters. 
Vertical industry demand was strong, with sequential growth led by financial services, supercomputing and telecom customers. We also had exceptional growth in inference, which reached a record more than doubling year-on-year. Revenue from inference-focused processors includes the new A30 GPU, which provides 4x the inference performance of the G4. Customers are also turning to NVIDIA GPUs to take AI to production and shifting from CPUs to GPUs driven by the stringent performance, latency and cost requirements of deploying and scaling deep learning AI workload. 
NVIDIA networking products posted solid results. We see momentum across regions driven by our technology leadership, with upgrades to high-speed products, such as ConnectX-6 as well as new customer wins across cloud service providers enterprise and high-performance computing. We extended our leadership in supercomputing, the latest top 500 list shows that NVIDIA technologies power 342 of the world's top 500 supercomputers, including 70% of all new systems and 8 of the top 10. To help companies harness the new industrial, high-performance computing revolution, we deliver a turnkey AI data center solution with the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD, the same technology that powers our new Cambridge-1 supercomputer in the U.K. and a number of others in the top 500. 
We expanded our AI software and subscription offerings, making it easier for enterprises to adopt AI from the initial development stage through to deployment and operations. We announced NVIDIA Base Command, our Software-as-a-Service offering for operating and managing large-scale, multiuser and multi-team AI development workloads on DGX SuperPOD. Base Command is the operating and management system software for distributed training clusters. 
We also announced general availability of NVIDIA Fleet Command, our managed Edge AI Software-as-a-Service offering. Fleet Command helps companies solve the problem of securely deploying and managing AI applications across thousands of locations, combining the efficiency and simplicity of central management with the cost, performance and data sovereignty benefits of real-time processing at the edge. Early adopters of Fleet Command includes some of the world's leading retail manufacturing and logistics companies and the specialty software companies that work with them. The new NVIDIA Base Command and Fleet Command software and subscription offerings followed last quarter's announcement of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite, which is in early access with general availability expected soon. Our enterprise software strategy is supported by the NVIDIA certified system program with server OEMs, which are bringing to market over 55 systems ready to run on NVIDIA's AI software out of the box to help enterprises simplify and accelerate their AI deployment. 
The NVIDIA ecosystem keeps getting stronger. NVIDIA Inception, our acceleration platform for AI start-ups just surpassed 8,500 members. With cumulative funding of over $60 billion and members in 90 countries, Inception is one of the largest AI start-up ecosystems in the world. CUDA now has been downloaded 27 million times since it launched 15 years ago, with 7 million in the last year alone. TensorRT for inference has been downloaded nearly 2.5 million times across more than 27,000 companies. And the total number of developers in the NVIDIA ecosystem now exceeds 2.6 million, up 4x in the past 4 years. 
Let me give you a quick update on Arm. In nearly 1 year since we initially agreed to combine with Arm, we have gotten to know the company, its business and its people much better. We believe more than ever in the power of our combination and the benefits it will deliver for Arm, for the U.K. and for its customers across the world in the era of AI. Arm has great potential. We love their business model and commit to keep its open licensing approach. And with NVIDIA's scale and capabilities, Arm will make more IP and sooner for their mobile and embedded customers, while expanding into data center, IoT and other new markets. 
NVIDIA accelerates computing, which starts with the CPU, whatever new markets are opened with the CPU and our accelerated computing opportunities. We've announced accelerated platforms for Amazon Graviton, Ampere Computing, MediaTek and Marvell, spanning cloud computing, AI, cloud gaming, supercomputing, edge AI to Chrome PCs. We plan to invest in the U.K., and we have with the Cambridge-1 supercomputer, and through Arm, making U.K. a global center in science, technology and AI. We are working through the regulatory process, although some Arm licensees have expressed concerns and objected to the transaction and discussions with regulators are taking longer than initially thought. We are confident in the deal and that regulators should recognize the benefit of the acquisition to Arm, its licensees and the industry. 
Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin of 64.8% for the second quarter was up 600 basis points from a year earlier, reflecting the absence of certain Mellanox acquisition related costs. GAAP gross margins was up 70 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP gross margins was 66.7%, up 70 basis points from a year earlier and up 50 basis points sequentially, reflecting higher ASPs within desktop GeForce GPUs of continued growth in high-end Ampere architectured products, partially offset by a mix shift within data center. Q2 GAAP EPS was $0.94, up 276% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.04, up 89% from a year earlier, adjusting for the 4-to-1 stock split effective this quarter. Q2 cash flow from operations was a record $2.7 billion. 
Let me turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. We expect another strong quarter, with sequential growth driven largely by accelerating demand in data center. In addition, we expect sequential growth in each of our 3 markets -- in each of our 3 other market platforms. Gaming demand is continuing to exceed supply as we expect channel inventories to remain below target levels as we exit Q3. 
The contribution of CMP to our revenue outlook is minimal. Revenue is expected to be $6.8 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 65.2% and 67%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.96 billion and $1.37 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are both expected to be an expense of approximately $60 million, excluding gains and losses on equity securities. GAAP and non-GAAP tax risks are supposed to be expected 11%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $200 million to $225 million.

I think near term, you mentioned the possibility of accelerating data center growth from the 35% rate. I was hoping if you could give us some more color around that confidence and visibility.
And then longer term, Jensen, we have seen a lot of announcements from NVIDIA about your enterprise software opportunity. I honestly don't know how to model that. It sounds very promising, but how should we model it? What problem are you trying to solve? Is it cannibalizing demand you have otherwise seen from your public cloud customers? Or is this incremental to growth? So just any guidance or any just insights into how to think about NVIDIA's enterprise software opportunity longer term?",128
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2021",2021-08-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,4132.0,2423398.0,92150468.0,Answer,"Jensen Huang;Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director",,Executives,5,"Yes, thanks for the question. We are seeing accelerated -- as we have already reported that we have record revenues in both hyperscale, cloud and industrial enterprise this last quarter. And we're seeing accelerated growth. The acceleration in hyperscale and cloud comes from the transition of the cloud service providers in taking their AI applications, which are now heavily deep learning-driven into production. 
There were some of the things that we've spoken about in the past that really makes NVIDIA the ideal platform to scale out with. And if my line is a little worse, let me apologize. The several platforms -- the several elements of our platform, number one, Ampere GPU, which is now a universal GPU for AI, for training but incredibly good for inference. It's terrific in its throughput, it's terrific in its fast response time as well, and therefore, the cost of deployment, the cost of operating AI applications is the lowest. 
The second is the introduction of TensorRT, which is our optimizing compiler that makes it possible for us to compile and optimize any AI application to our GPUs. And whether it's computer vision or natural language understanding, conversational AI, recommender systems, the type of applications that are deploying AI is really quite vast. 
And then lastly, this software inference server that we offer called Triton, which supports every one of our GPUs. It supports CPUs as well as GPUs. So every Internet service provider could operate their entire data center using Triton. These several things are really accelerating our growth, which is -- so the first element is the deployment, the transition of deep learning AI applications into large-scale deployment. 
In the enterprise, the application that is driving AI, as you know, every enterprise must be -- wants to move and race towards being a tech company and take advantage of connected cloud and connected devices and artificial intelligence to achieve it. We have an opportunity to deploy AI services out of the edge. And in order to do so, there are several things that has to happen. First, we have to create a computing platform that allows them to do training in the IT environment that they understand, which is virtualized, which is largely managed by VMware. And our collaboration with VMware, creating a new type of system that could be integrated with enterprise was -- has been quite a significant effort and it's in volume production today. 
The second is a server that allows the enterprise customers to deploy their AR models out to the edge. And the AI engine, the software suite that we've been developing over the last 10 years now have been integrated into this environment and allows the enterprises to basically run AI out of the box. There's 3 elements of our software products there. First is NVIDIA AI Enterprise and that puts -- that basically puts all of the state-of-the-art AI solvers and engines and libraries that we've industrialized and perfected over the years, made it available to enterprise to license. Second,is an operating system platform called Base Command that allows for distributed scale up software development in the -- for training and developing models. And then the third is Fleet Command, which is an operating system software product that lets you operate and deploy and manage the AI models out to the edge. 
These 3 software products, in combination with the server called NVIDIA-Certified, taken out through our network of partners, is our strategy to accelerate the adoption of AI by the enterprise customers. And so we're really enthusiastic about entering into the software business model. This is an opportunity that could represent, of course, tens of millions of servers. We believe all of them will be GPU accelerated. We believe that enterprises will be deploying and taking advantage of AI to revolutionize their industry. And using quite a traditional enterprise software licensing business model, this could represent billions of dollars of business opportunity for us.",660

You gave a little bit of color by segment. If I look at your gaming revenues, it's kind of like 3 quarters in a row, you've been up, call it, ballpark 10% or 11%. And my understanding is that was sort of a function of your ability to bring on supply. So I guess what does the supply addition look like as you're going from Q2 into Q3? And do you think you can still maintain that kind of sequential growth? Or does it dial down? Because I also need to -- I also would play that against your other commentary suggesting that the sequential growth, and I assume on a dollar basis was driven primarily by data centers. So how do I think about the interplay within those comments of sequential growth of gaming, especially given the trajectory we've had over the last several quarters?",156
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2021",2021-08-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,4132.0,2423398.0,92150471.0,Answer,Colette Kress,,Executives,8,"Yes. So let me start, and I'll let Jensen add a bit, Stacy, to your question. I guess we're providing the guidance for Q3 of $6.8 billion in revenue. Now excluding CMP, we expect our revenue to grow over $500 million sequentially. The lion's share of that sequential revenue increase will be coming from data center. We do expect gaming to be up slightly on a sequential basis. But remember, we are still supply constrained. Automotive and Pro Viz are also expected to be up slightly quarter-over-quarter. And from a CMP perspective, we'll probably just have minimal amounts in Q3. So our Q3 results don't have seasonality with them for gaming and are really about the supply that we believe we can have for Q3. I'll see if Jensen wants to add any more color.",135
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2021",2021-08-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,4132.0,2423398.0,92150472.0,Answer,"Jensen Huang;Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director",,Executives,9,"Yes. Thanks for the question. As you know, RTX is a fundamental reset of computer graphics. This is a technology called ray tracing that has been the holy grail of computer graphics for quite a long time in 35 years. In research -- in our NVIDIA research for 10 years, we finally made it possible to do real-time ray tracing with RTX. 
RTX demand is quite incredible. And as you know, we have a large install base of PC gamers. They use an architecture called GTX based on programmable shaders that we invented some 20 years ago. And now we've reset the entire installed base. And Ampere is obviously just an incredible selling. It's the best-selling GPU architecture in the history of our company. And yet we've only upgraded some 20% -- less than 20% of our total installed base. So there's another 80% of the world's PC gaming market that we have yet to upgrade to RTX. Meanwhile, the number of PC gamers in the world grew substantially, still grew 20% this last year. And so I think the -- we're right at the beginning of our RTX transition. 
Meanwhile, computer graphics has expanded into so many different new markets. RTX, we've known -- we've always believed we'll reinvent the way that people do design. And we're seeing that happening right now as we speak, as workstations is growing faster than ever and has achieved record revenues. And at the same time, because of all of our work with cloud gaming, we now see public clouds putting the cloud graphics, whether it's workstations or PC or private gaming console up in the cloud. So we're seeing strong demand in PCs, in laptops, in workstations and mobile workstations and cloud. And so RTX is really doing great. We're -- our challenge there is that demand is just so much great in supply and then as closely we'll do supply constraints.",320

For my question, I wanted to follow on, on Stacy's question about supply and Colette, maybe you could give us a little bit of commentary around supply constraints in gaming in the different tiers or price tiers of your gaming cards. I'm just trying to get a better understanding as to how you guys are managing supply across the different price tiers? And I guess it translates into a question of are the gaming ASPs that we're seeing in the October quarter guidance -- are those what you would call sustainable going forward? Or do you feel like that mix may change as supply comes online?",125

Thanks for the question on our overall mix as we go forward. First, our supply constraint in our gaming business is largely attributed to our desktop and notebook. That can mean a lot of different things from our components that are necessary to build so many of our products. But our mix is really important. 
Our mix as we are also seeing many of our gamers very interested in our higher-end, higher performance products. We will continue to see that as a driver of that overall lift, both our revenue and can lift our overall gross margins. So there's quite a few different pieces into our supply that we have to think about, but we are going to try and make the best solutions for our gamers at this time.",135

We're supply constrained in graphics -- we're supply constrained in graphics while we're delivering record revenues in graphics. Cloud gaming is growing, cloud graphics is growing. RTX made it possible for us to address the design and the creative workstations. Historically, the rendering of ray tracing and photo-realistic images has largely been done on CPUs and for the very first time, and we could actually accelerate it with NVIDIA GPUs and with RTX GPUs. And so the workstation market is really doing great. 
The backdrop of that, of course, is that people are building offices in their homes. And for many of the designers and creators around the world, some 20 million of them, they have to create -- they have to build a workstation or an office at home as well as they want at work, because remote work is the new norm. And meanwhile, of course, RTX has reached all of our consumer graphics, the few hundred million installed base of PC gamers, and it's time to upgrade. 
And so there's a whole bunch of reasons we're achieving record revenue as well as supply constrain. We have enough supply to meet our second half company growth plans. And in next year, we expect to be able to achieve our company's growth plans for next year. Meanwhile, we have and are securing a pretty significant long-term supply commitments as we expand into all these different market initiatives that we've set ourselves up for. And so I think the -- I would expect that we will see a supply constrained environment for the vast majority of next year is my guess at the moment. But a lot of that has to do with the time of our demand is just too great. RTX is really a once-in-a-generation reset of computer -- modern computer graphics. Nothing like this has happened. It's so convenient computer graphics. And so the invention is really quite groundbreaking and you can see us in that.",330

The Mellanox networking franchise has been a really strong and synergistic addition to the NVIDIA compute portfolio. I think kind of near to midterm, the team is benefiting from the transition to 200 and 400 gig networking connectivity and cloud and hyperscale. And then I think in addition to that, you guys are getting some good traction with the BlueField SmartNIC products. Can you just give us a sense on how the business is trending year-over-year? And do you expect continued quarter-over-quarter networking momentum into the second half of this year, especially as the cloud and hyperscalers are going to a server and CapEx spending cycle?",114
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2021",2021-08-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,4132.0,2423398.0,92150483.0,Answer,"Jensen Huang;Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director",,Executives,20,"Yes, really appreciate that question. Mellanox had a solid growth quarter. And the Mellanox networking business is really growing incredibly. There are 3 dynamics happening all at the same time. The first is the transition that you're talking about. You know that the world's data centers, hyperscale data centers are -- use this form of computing called disaggregated, which basically means that a single application is running on multiple servers at the same time. This is what makes it possible for them to scale out. The more users for an AI application or service, just have to add more servers. 
And so the ease of scale-out that disaggregated computing provides also puts enormous pressure on the networking. And Mellanox has the world's lowest latency and highest bandwidth and performance networking on the planet. And so the ability to scale out and the ability to provision disaggregated applications, it is really much, much better with Mellanox networking. So that's number one. 
Number two, almost every company in the world has to be a high-performance computing company. You see that the cloud service providers, one after another, are building effectively supercomputers. What historically was InfiniBand and supercomputing data -- supercomputing centers,  the cloud service providers have to build supercomputers themselves. And the reason for that is because of artificial intelligence in turning these gigantic models. The rate of growth of our network sizes -- AI model sizes is doubling every 2 months. It's doubling not every year or 2 years, it's doubling every 2 months. And so you could imagine the size. We're now talking about training AI models that are 100 trillion parameters large. The human brain has 150-plus trillion synapses and, so -- or neurons. And so that gives you a sense of the scale of AI models that people are developing. 
And so you will see supercomputers that are built out of Mellanox InfiniBand and the high-speed  networking along with NVIDIA GPU computing in more and more cloud service providers. You're also seeing it in enterprise for use in the discovery of drugs. There's a digital biology revolution going on as the computation is stable. At a large-scale computing that we're able to do now and AI, better understand biology and better and better understand chemistry and bringing both of those fields into the field of information sciences. And so you're seeing large supercomputers being built in enterprises around the world as well. And so the second dynamic has to do with our incredibly great networking, InfiniBand networking side as well, de facto standard in high-performance computing. 
And the third dynamic, is data centers doing stock work. In order to orchestrate and run a data center, they're just a few people, essentially running our entire data center, hundreds of thousands of servers as if it's just one computer in front of you, that entire data center is software-defined. And not the software that goes into that software device data center running on today's CPUs, it's the networking stack, the storage stack and now because of Zero Trust the security stack, all of that is putting enormous pressure on the available computing capacity for applications, which is ultimately what data centers are designed to do. 
And so the software-defined data center needs to have a place to take that infrastructure software and accelerate it, to offload it, to accelerate it and very importantly to isolate it from application plan so that intruders can't jump into the operating system, if you will, of your data center, the fabric of your data center. And so the answer to that is BlueField. The ability to offload, accelerate and isolate this -- the data center software infrastructure and to free up all of the CPUs to run what they're supposed to run, which is the application. 
Just about every data center in the world is moving towards a zero trust model and BlueField has just been incredibly well positioned. So these 3 dynamics, disaggregated computing, which means really strong with fast networking; every company using high-performance computing; and then lastly, software-defined data centers on zero trust. And so these are really important dynamics, and I appreciate the opportunity to tell you on that. You can just tell how super excited I'm about the prospects of this networking business and the employment that they have in building modern data centers.",725

I think you hit on a lot of my question around the data center in that last one. So maybe I'll just ask kind of on a P&L basis. One of the things that I see in the results or more importantly, the guide, is you're now, Colette, guiding over 67% gross margin potentially. I'm curious as we move forward, how do you think about the incremental operating gross margin upside still from here and how you're thinking about the operating margin leverage for the company from here through the P&L?",92

Colette, if you don't mind, let me take that and you could just follow-up with the details, that would be great. I think at the highest level -- I really appreciate the question. At the highest level, the important thing to realize is that artificial intelligence, it is the single greatest technology force that the computer industry has ever seen and potentially the world has ever seen. The automation opportunities, which drives productivity, which translates directly to the cost savings to the company, is enormous. And it opens up opportunities for technology and computing companies, like it ever never happened before. 
And let me just give you some example. The fact that we could apply so much technology to warehouse logistics, retail automation, customer call center automation is really quite unprecedented. The fact that we could automate truck driving and last mile delivery, providing an automated chauffeur. Those kind of services and benefits and products are never imaginable before. And so the size of the IT industry, if you will, the industry that computer companies like ourselves are part of, has expanded tremendously.
And so the thing that we want to do is to invest as smartly, but as quickly as we can to go after the large operating -- large business opportunities where we can make a real impact. And in doing so, while doing so, to do so in a way that is architecturally sensible, one of the things that is really an advantage of our company, it is the nature of the way that we build products, the nature of the way that we build software, our discipline around the architecture, which allows us to be so efficient while doing -- while addressing climate science on the one hand, digital biology on the other, artificial intelligence and robotics and self-driving cars. 
And of course, we already talked about computer graphics and videos. Using one architecture and having the ability to -- and having the discipline now for almost 30 years has given us incredible operating leverage. 
That's where the vast majority of our operating leverage comes from, which is architectural. The technology is architectural, our products are architectural in that way and the company has been built architecturally in that way. And so hopefully, as we go after these large market opportunities that AI has provided us, and we do so in a smart and disciplined way with great leverage through our architecture, we can continue to drive really great operating leverage for this company and for our shareholders.",423

Why only 80% and not 100%? And how confident are you that the CMP business being down as a reflection of crypto cooling off versus perhaps LHR not being that effective?

Let me start there and answer a couple of the questions about our strategy that we've put in place in this last couple of quarters. As you recall, what we put in place was the low hash rate cards as well as putting in the CMP cards. The low hash rate cards were to provide for more supply for our GeForce gamers that are out there. We articulated one of the metrics that we were looking is what percentage of those cards. In Ampere, we were able to sell with lowest hash cost. Almost all of our cards in Ampere are low hash rates, but also we are selling other types of cards as well. 
But at this time, as we move forward, we're much higher than 80%. But just at the end of this last quarter, we were approximately 80%. So yes, that is moving up. So the strategy is in place and will continue as we move into Q3. 
I'll move it to Jensen here to see if he can discuss further.",175

We moved incredibly fast this time with GMP and with our LHR settings for GeForce. And our entire strategy is about steering GeForce supplies to gamers. And we have every reason to believe that because of the DRIVE and team, which is really a measure of gamers, the rate of growth of our team adoption of Ampere GPUs, there are some others that were successful. But there's several reasons why it's just different this time. And the first reason of course is that LHR, which is new and the speed at which we responded with CMP to steer GeForce supply to gamers. Second is where at the very beginning of the Ampere and RTX cycles. As I mentioned earlier, RTX is a complete reinvention of computer graphics. Every evidence is that gamers are incredibly -- and game developers are incredibly excited about ray tracing. This form of computer rendering, graphics rendering is just dramatically more beautiful. 
And we're at the beginning of that cycle and only 20% has been upgraded so far. So we have 80% to grow in a market that is already quite large and installed base is quite large, but also growing. Last year, gamers grew 20% and just made by [indiscernible] The third reason is that our demand is strong in our channel. And you can see that everyday with the shortage of supply as quickly as we're shipping it. It's [indiscernible] all over the world. 
And then lastly, we just had more growth drivers today because of RTX than ever. And we have the biggest wave of NVIDIA laptops. Just the laptops is our fastest-growing segment of computing. And we have the largest wave of laptops coming. The demand for RTX and workstations, whereas previously, the workstation market was a slow-growing market, it's now a fast-growing market and has achieved record. And after more than a decade of working on cloud graphics, our cloud graphics is in great demand. And so all of these segments are seeing high demand and we're -- while we continue to be supply limited. And so I think the situations are very different. And RTX is making each difference.",376

I think in your prepared remarks, you said both would be up in the October quarter. But I'm interested to see if you're seeing any different trends there, particularly in the vertical business as perhaps business conditions normalize and companies return to the office and they adjust their spending plans accordingly.",76
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2021",2021-08-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,4132.0,2423398.0,92150494.0,Answer,Colette Kress,,Executives,31,"Yes. So let me start out with the question, and I'll let Jensen answer the tail. So far with our data center business, with our Q2 results, our vertical industries is still quite a strong percentage, essentially 50% of our data center business is going to our vertical industries. Our hyperscales make up the other portion of that, slightly below the 50%. And then we also have our supercomputing business with a very small percentage but doing quite, quite well. 
As we move into Q3, as we discussed, we will see an acceleration of both our vertical industries and our hyperscales as we move into Q3. With that backdrop, we'll see if Jensen has additional commentary.",116
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2021",2021-08-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,4132.0,2423398.0,92150495.0,Answer,"Jensen Huang;Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director",,Executives,32,"There's a fundamental difference in hyperscale use of HPC or AI versus the industrial use of HPC and AI. In the world of hyperscalers and internet service providers, they're making recommendations on movies and songs and articles and search results and so on and so forth. And the difference is the improvement in accuracy that deep learning and artificial intelligence, large recommender systems can provide us is really working for them. 
In the world of industries, the reason why artificial intelligence is transformative, recognizing that most of the things I just mentioned earlier, it's not really dynamic in the world's largest industries, whether it's health care or logistics or transportation and retail, the vast majority of the reasons why in some of the physical sciences industries, whether it's energy or transportation and for health care, is the simulation of physics, the simulation of the world was not achievable using traditional first principle simulation approaches. But artificial intelligence or data-driven approaches has completely shaken that up and put it on its head. 
And some examples, whether it's using artificial intelligence, so that you could feed up the simulation of the prediction of the protein structure of -- or the 3D structure of protein, which was recently achieved by a couple of very important networks, it's groundbreaking. And by understanding the protein structure, 3D structure, we understand its -- we can better understand its function and how it would adapt to other proteins and other chemicals. And it's a fundamental step of the process in drug discovery, and that has just taken a giant leap forward. 
In the areas of clinical science, it is now possible to consider using data-driven approaches to create models that overcome this -- not overcome but accelerate and make it possible for us to simulate much, much larger simulations of multiphysics geometry-aware simulations, which is basically climate science. These are really important field of work that wouldn't have been possible for another decade, at least. And just as we made possible using artificial intelligence, the realization of real-time ray tracing in every field of science, whether it's climate simulation, energy discovery, drug discovery, we're starting to see the industry recognizing that the fusion of first principle simulation and data-driven artificial intelligence approaches is going to get a giant leap up. And that is a second dynamic. 
The other dynamic for industry is for the very first time, they could deploy AI model out to the edge to do a better job with agriculture, to do a better job with asset protection and warehouses, to do a better job with automating retail. AI is going to make it possible for all of these types of automation to finally be realized. And so the dynamics are all very different. That last one has to do with Edge AI, which was just made possible by putting AI right at the point of data and right at point of action because you need to be low cost, you would need to be high performance and instantly responsive and we can't afford to stream all of the data to the cloud all the time. And so each one of them has a slightly different [indiscernible]",534

This looks like a really cool technology, but I tend to get very few questions from investors about it, but it looks to me like this could be potentially very meaningful technology for you longer term. Can you explain perhaps what capabilities and what markets this is going after? It looks like perhaps this is going to position you very well in augmented and virtual reality, but maybe it's a sort of different market or group of markets, it's a bit confusing to us. So if you could maybe help us understand it, I think would really appreciate it.",111
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2021",2021-08-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,4132.0,2423398.0,92150498.0,Answer,"Jensen Huang;Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director",,Executives,35,"I really appreciate the question. And it's one of the most important things we're doing. The Omniverse, Omniverse first of all, just what is it? It's a simulator. It's a simulator that's physically accurate and physically based. And it was made possible because of 2 fundamental technologies we invest and one of them is, of course, RTX, the ability to physically stimulate light behavior in the world, which is ray tracing. The second is the ability to compute or simulate the physics of -- simulate the artificial intelligence behavior of agents and objects inside the world. So we have the ability now to simulate physics in a realistic way, and we created an architecture that allows us to do it in the cloud, distribute it a computed way and to be able to scale it out to very large business. 
And the question is what would you do with such a thing? The simulator, those are simulators and simulation of virtual world with portals, we call them connectors, portals based on an industry standard, open standard that was pioneered by Pixar. And as we mentioned earlier, that we're partnering with Pixar and Apple to make it even broadly adopted, get more broadly adopted, it's called UFD, universal feed description. They're basically portals or wormholes into virtual worlds. And this virtual world will simulate, could be simulating a -- it could be a concert for consumers, it could be a theme park for consumers. In the world of the industries, you could use it for simulating robots, so the robots can learn how to be robots inside these virtual worlds before they're downloaded from the simulated to the real world. 
You could use it to stimulate factories, which is one of the early works that we've done with BMW that I showed at GTC. Factory of the future that is designed completely in Omniverse, simulated in Omniverse, robots trained in Omniverse with goods and materials that are its original, CAD data, put into the battery, the logistics plan like an ERP system, except this is an ERP system of physical goods and physical simulation simulated through this Omniverse world, and you could plan the entire factory in Omnivere. 
This entire factory now becomes what is called a digital tool. This -- it could be a factory, it could be a stadium, it could be an airport, it could be an entire city which could include the cars. These digital twins would allow us to simulate new algorithms, new AI, new -- and optimization algorithms before we deploy it into the physical world. And so what is Omniverse? Well, Omniverse is going to be an overlay, if you will,  of virtual worlds that increasingly people call the metaverse. And you've now heard several companies talk about the metaverse. We all come from different perspectives, some of it from a social perspective, some of it from a gaming perspective, some of it, in our case, from an industrial and design and engineering perspective. But the Omniverse is essentially an overlay of the Internet and overlay of the physical world is going to fuse all these different worlds together long term. 
And you'll be able to -- if you mentioned VR and AR, you'll be able to go into the Omniverse worlds using virtual reality, and so you wormhole into the virtual world using VR. You could have an AI or an object portal into our world using augmented reality so you could have a digital piece of art that you've somehow purchased and belongs to you because of NFC. And it's only enjoyed in the virtual world, and you can overlay it into your physical world with an AI. And so I'm fairly sure that at this point, that Omniverse or the metaverse is going to be a new economy that is larger than our current economy. 
And we'll have -- we'll enjoy a lot of our time in the future in Omnivere and in metaverse. And we'll do a lot of our work there. And we'll have a lot of robots. They're doing a lot of the work on our behalf. And we wake at morning as they show us results. And so Omniverse to us is an extension of our AI strategy, is an extension of our high-performance computing strategy, and it makes it possible for companies and industries to be able to create digital tools that simulate their physical version before they deploy it and while they're operating.",748

We had an excellent quarter fueled by surging demand for NVIDIA computing. Our pioneer work and accelerated computing continues to [indiscernible] computing and AI, enabled by NVIDIA Accelerated computing, developers are creating the most impactful technologies of our time, from natural language understanding and recommender systems to autonomous vehicles and logistics centers to digital biology and climate science research, the metaverse world that obeys the laws of physics. 
This quarter, we announced NVIDIA Base Command and Fleet Command to develop, deploy, scale and orchestrate the AI workloads that run on the NVIDIA AI enterprise software fleet. With our new enterprise software, a wide range of NVIDIA powered systems and global network of systems and integration partners, we can accelerate the world's largest industry as they raise the benefit from the transformative power of AI. 
We are thrilled to have launched NVIDIA Omniverse, a simulation platform nearly 5 years in the making that runs physically realistic virtual world and connects to other digital platforms. We imagine engineers, designers and even autonomous machines connecting to Omniverse to create digital twin simulated worlds that help train robots, operate autonomous factory, simulate fleets of autonomous vehicle, and even predict human impact on earth's climate. The future will have artificial intelligence augmenting our phones and the metaverse augmenting our physical world. It will be populated by real and AI visitors, and open new opportunities for artists, designers, scientists, and new businesses a whole new digital economy that will emerge.

Q3 was an outstanding quarter with revenue of $7.1 billion and year-on-year growth of 50%. We set records for total revenue as well as for gaming, data center and professional visualization.  
Starting with gaming. Revenue of $3.2 billion was up 5% sequentially and up 42% from a year earlier. Demand was strong across the board. While we continue to increase desktop GPU supply, we believe channel inventories remain low.  
Laptop GPUs also posted strong year-on-year growth, led by increased demand for high-end RTX laptops. NVIDIA RTX technology is driving our biggest-ever refresh cycle with gamers, and continues to expand our base with creatives.  
RTX introduced groundbreaking real-time ray tracing and AI-enabled super resolution capabilities, which are getting adopted at an accelerating pace. More than 200 games and applications now support NVIDIA RTX, including 125 with NVIDIA DLSS. This quarter alone, 45 new games shipped with DLSS. And NVIDIA Reflex latency-reducing technology is in top eSports titles, including VALORANT, Fortnite, Apex Legends and Overwatch. In addition, the Reflex ecosystem continues to grow, with Reflex technology now integrated in almost 50 gaming peripherals.  
NVIDIA Studio for creatives keeps expanding. Last month at the Adobe Max Creativity Conference, Adobe announced 2 powerful AI features for Adobe Lightroom and the Lightroom Classic, accelerated by NVIDIA RTX GPUs. In addition, several of our partners launched new studio systems, including Microsoft, HP and ASUS. We estimate that 1/4 of our installed base has adopted RTX GPUs. Looking ahead, we expect continued upgrades as well as growth from NVIDIA GeForce users, given rapidly expanding RTX support and the growing popularity of gaming, eSports, content creation and streaming.  
Our GPUs are capable of crypto money, but we don't have visibility into how much this impacts our overall GPU demand. In Q3, nearly all of our Ampere architecture gaming desktop GPU shipments were Lite Hash Rate to help steer GeForce supply to gamers. Crypto mining processor revenue was $105 million, which is included in our OEM and other. 
Our cloud gaming service, GeForce Now, has 2 major achievements this quarter. First, Electronic Arts brought more of its hit games to the server. And second, we announced the new GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership tier, priced at less than $100 for 6 months. GeForce NOW membership has more than doubled in this last year to over 14 million gamers who are streaming content from the 30 data centers in more than 80 countries.  
Moving to Pro Visualization. Q3 revenue of $577 million was up 11% sequentially and up 144% from the year ago quarter. The sequential rise was led by mobile workstations, with desktop workstations also growing as enterprise deployed systems to support hybrid work environment. Building on the strong initial ramp in Q2, Ampere architecture sales continue to grow. Leading verticals, including media and entertainment, health care, public sector and automotive.  
Last week, we announced general availability of Omniverse Enterprise, a platform for simulating physically accurate 3D world and digital trends. Initial market reception to Omniverse has been incredible. Professionals at over 700 companies are evaluating the platform, including BMW, Ericsson, Lockheed Martin and Sony Pictures. More than 70,000 individual creators have downloaded Omniverse since the open beta launch in December. There are approximately 40 million 3D designers in the global market.  
Moving to Automotive. Q3 revenue of $135 million declined 11% sequentially and increased 8% from the year ago quarter. The sequential decline was primarily driven by AI cockpit revenue, which has negatively been [ upended ] by automotive manufacturers' supply constraints. We announced that self-driving truck start-up Kodiak Robotics, automaker Lotus, autonomous bus manufacturer QCraft and EV startup WM Motor have adopted the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin platform for their next-generation vehicles. They join a large and rapidly growing list of companies adopting and developing an NVIDIA DRIVE, including auto OEMs, Tier 1 suppliers, NAVs, trucking companies, robo-taxis and software startups.  
Moving to data center. Record revenue of $2.9 billion grew 24% sequentially and 55% from the year ago quarter, with record revenue across both hyperscale and vertical industries. Strong growth was led by hyperscale customers, fueled by continued rapid adoption of Ampere architecture tensor core GPUs for both internal and external workloads.  Hyperscale compute revenue doubled year-on-year, driven by the scale out of natural language processing and recommender models and computing. 
Vertical industry growth was also strong, led by consumer Internet and broader cloud providers. For example, Oracle Cloud deployed NVIDIA GPUs for its launch of AI services such as tech analysis, speech recognition, computer vision and anomaly detection.  
We continue to achieve exceptional growth in inference, which again outpaced our overall Data Center growth. We have transitioned our lineup of inference-focused processors to the Ampere architecture such as the A40 GPU. We also released the latest version of our Triton Inference Server software, enabling compute-intensive inference workloads such as large language models to scale across multiple GPUs and nodes with real-time performance.  
Over 25,000 companies worldwide use NVIDIA AI inference. A great new example is Microsoft Teams, which has nearly 250 million monthly active users. It uses NVIDIA AI to convert speech to text real-time during video calls in 28 languages in a cost-effective way.  
We reached 3 milestones to help drive more mainstream enterprise adoption of NVIDIA AI. First, we announced the general availability of NVIDIA AI Enterprise, a comprehensive software suite of AI tools and frameworks that enables the hundreds of thousands of companies running NVIDIA -- running vSphere to virtualize AI workloads on NVIDIA-Certified Systems.  
Second, VMware announced a future update to vSphere with Tensor that is fully optimized for NVIDIA AI. And this combined with NVIDIA AI Enterprise, enterprises can efficiently manage cloud-native AI development and deployment on manual screen data center servers and files with existing IT tools.  
And third, we expanded our LaunchPad program globally with Equinix as our first digital infrastructure partner. NVIDIA LaunchPad is now available in 9 locations worldwide, providing enterprises with immediate access to NVIDIA software and infrastructure to help them prototype and test data science and AI workloads. LaunchPad features NVIDIA-Certified Systems and NVIDIA DGX systems running the entire NVIDIA AI software stack.  
In networking, revenue was impacted as demand outstrips supply. We saw momentum towards higher speed and new-generation products, including ConnectX-5 and 6. We announced the NVIDIA Quantum-2 400 gigabit per second end-to-end networking platform, consisting of the Quantum-2 switch, the ConnectX-7 network adapter and the BlueField-3 DPU. The NVIDIA Quantum-2 switch is available from a wide range of leading infrastructure and system vendors around the world.  
Earlier this week, the latest Top500 list of supercomputers showed continued momentum for our full-stack computing approach. NVIDIA technologies accelerate over 70% of the systems on the list, including over 90% of all new systems and 23 of the top 25 most energy-efficient systems.  
Turning to GTC. Last week, we hosted our GPU Technology Conference, which had over 270,000 registered attendees. Jensen's keynote has been viewed 25 million times over the past 8 days. While our spring GTC focused on new chips and systems, this edition focused on software, demonstrating our full computing stack. Let me cover some of the highlights.  
Our vision for Omniverse came to life at GTC. We significantly expanded this ecosystem and announced new capabilities. Omniverse Replicator is an engine for producing data to train robots, replicating augment's real-world data with massive, diverse and physically accurate synthetic data sets to help accelerate development of high-quality, high-performance AI across computing demand.  
NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar is our platform for generating interactive AI avatars. It connects several core NVIDIA SDKs including speech AI, computer vision, natural language understanding, recommendation engines and simulation. Applications including automated customer service, virtual collaboration and content creation. Replicator and Avatar joined several other announced features and capabilities for Omniverse, including AI, AR, VR and simulation-based technologies.  
We introduced 65 new and updated software development kits, bringing our total to more than 150 serving industries from gaming and design to AI, cybersecurity, 5G and robotics. One of the SDKs is our first 4 licensed AI model, NVIDIA Riva, for building conversational AI applications. Companies using Riva during the open beta include RingCentral for videoconference live caption and [ MTS ] for customer service chatbot. NVIDIA Riva Enterprise will be commercially available early next year for launching. 
We introduced the NVIDIA NeMo Megatron framework, optimized for training large language models on NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD infrastructure. This combination brings together production-ready, enterprise-grade hardware and software to help vertical industries develop language and industry-specific chatbots, personal systems, content generation and summarization. Early adopters include CD, JD.com and VinBrain. 
We unveiled BlueField DOCA 1.2, the latest version of our DPU programming [ vendor ] with new cybersecurity capabilities. DOCA is to our DPUs as CUDA is to our GPUs. It enables developers to build applications and services on top of our BlueField DPU. 
Our new capabilities make BlueField the ideal platform for the industry to build their own zero-trust security platforms. The leading cybersecurity companies are working with us to provision their next-generation firewall service on BlueField, including Checkpoint, Juniper, Fortinet, F5, Palo Alto Networks and VMware.  
And we released Clara Holoscan, an edge AI computing platform for medical instruments to improve decision-making tools in areas such as robo-assisted surgery, interventional radiology and radiation therapy planning. Other new or expanded SDKs or libraries unveiled at GTC include ReOpt for AI-optimized logistics, cuQuantum for quantum computing, Morpheus for cybersecurity, Modulus for physical-based (sic) [ physics-based ] machine learning and cuNumeric, a data-center-scale math library to bring accelerated computing to the large and growing Python ecosystem.  
All in, NVIDIA's computing platform continues to expand as a broadening set of SDK enable more and more GPU-accelerated applications and industry use cases. CUDA has been downloaded 30 million times, and our developer ecosystem is now nearing 3 million strong. The applications they develop on top of our SDK and the cloud to edge computing platform are helping to transform multitrillion dollar industries from health care to transportation to financial services, manufacturing, logistics and retail.  
In automotive, we announced NVIDIA DRIVE Concierge and DRIVE Chauffeur, AI software platforms that enhance a vehicle's performance features and safety. DRIVE Concierge built on Omniverse Avatar functions as an AI-based in-vehicle personal assistant, but enables automatic parking summoning capabilities. It also enhanced safety by monitoring the driver throughout the duration of the trip. 
DRIVE Chauffeur offers autonomous capabilities, relieving the driver of constantly having to control the car. It will also perform address to address driving when combined with DRIVE Hyperion 8 platform.
For robotics, we announced Jetson AGX Orin, the world's smallest, most powerful and energy-efficient AI supercomputer for robotics, autonomous machines and embedded computing device. Built on our Ampere architecture, Jetson AGX Orin provides 6x the processing of its predecessor and delivers 200 trillion operations per second, similar to a GPU-enabled server that fits into the palm of your hand. Jetson AGX Orin will be available in the first quarter of calendar 2022. 
Finally, we revealed plans to build Earth-2, the world's most powerful AI supercomputer dedicated to confronting climate change. The system would be the climate change counterpart to Cambridge-1, the U.K.'s most powerful AI supercomputer that we built for health care research. Earth-2 harnesses all the technologies we've embedded -- invented up to this moment. Let me discuss -- I'll provide you a brief update on our proposed acquisition of ARM. 
ARM with NVIDIA is a great opportunity for the industry and customers. With NVIDIA's scale, capabilities and robust understating of data center computing, acceleration in AI, we can assist ARM in expanding their reach into data center, IoT and physics and advance ARM's IP for decades to come. The combination of our companies can enhance competition in the industry as we work together on further building the world of AI. 
Regulators at the U.S. FTC have expressed concerns regarding the transaction, and we are engaged in discussions with them regarding revenues to address their concerns. The transaction has been under review by China's antitrust authority pending the former case initiation. Regulators in the U.K. and the EU have declined to [indiscernible] Phase 1 of the review on competition concerns. In the U.K., they have also voiced national security concerns. 
We have begun the Phase 2 process in the EU and U.K. jurisdictions. Despite these concerns and those raised by some ARM licensees, we continue to believe in the merits and the benefits of the acquisition to ARM, to its licensees and the industry. We believe these concerns and those raised by some ARM licensees, we continue to believe in the merit and benefit of the ARM acquisition. 
Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin for the third quarter was up 260 basis points from a year earlier, primarily due to higher-end mix within desktop, notebook GeForce GPUs. The year-on-year increase also benefited from a reduced impact of acquisition-related costs. GAAP gross margin was up 40 basis points sequentially, driven by growth in our data center Ampere architecture products, which is particularly offset by our mix in gaming. 
Non-gaming gross margin was up 150 basis points from a year earlier and up 30 basis points sequentially. Q3 GAAP EPS was $0.97, 83% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.17, up 60% from a year ago, adjusting for our stock split. 
Q3 cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion, up from $1.3 billion a year earlier and down from $2.7 billion in the prior quarter. The year-on-year increase primarily reflects higher operating income, particularly offset by prepayments for long-term supply agreements. 
Let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. We expect sequential growth to be driven by data center and gaming. -- more than offsetting a decline in CMP. Revenue is expected to be $7.4 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 65.3% and 67%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. 
GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.02 billion and $1.43 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are both expected to be an expense of approximately $60 million, excluding gains and losses from nonaffiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 11%, plus or minus 1%, excluding dispute items. 
Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $250 million to $275 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary, other information is also available on our IR website. 
In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the Credit Suisse 25th Annual Technology Conference in person on November 30. We will also be at the Wells Fargo Fifth Annual TMT Summit, virtually, on December 1; the UBS Global TMT Virtual Conference on December 6; and the Deutsche Bank Virtual AutoTech Conference on December 9. Our earnings call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 results is scheduled for Wednesday, February 16. 
With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you please poll today's questions?",2506

Congratulations on the results. I guess I wanted to ask about Omniverse. Obviously, a lot of excitement around that. I guess the simple question is, Jensen, how do you define success in Omniverse as we look out over the next, let's call it, 12 months? And how do we think about the subscription license opportunity for Omniverse? I know you've talked about 40 million total 3D designers. I think that actually doubled what you talked about back in August. So I'm just curious of how we, as financial analysts, should start to think about that opportunity materializing?",98
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2021",2021-11-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,4032.0,2444170.0,92833451.0,Answer,"Jensen Huang;Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director",,Executives,5,"Yes. Omniverse's success will be defined by, number one, developer engagement, connections with developers around the world; two, applications being developed by enterprises; three, the connection of designers and creators among themselves. Those are the nearest term. And I would say that in my type of definition of success. 
Near term also should be revenues. And Omniverse has real immediate applications as I demonstrated at the keynote. And I'll highlight a few of them right now. One of them, of course, is that it serves as a way to connect 3D and digital design world. Think of Adobe as a world. Think of Autodesk as a world because revenue is a world. These are design worlds in the sense that people are doing things in it, they're creating things in it, and it has its own database. 
We made it possible for these worlds to be connected for the very first time and for it to be shared like a cloud document. That's not been possible ever before. And you can now share work with each other. You can see how this work, you can collaborate. And so in a world of remote working, Omniverse's collaboration capability is going to be really appreciated. And that should happen right away. We would like to see that happen in very near term. And that drives, of course, more PC sales, more GPU sales, more workstation sales, more server sales. 
The second use case is digital twins. And you saw -- we saw examples of how several companies, they are using Omniverse to create digital twin of a city so that they could optimize radio placements and video energy used for [indiscernible]. You saw BMW using it for their factories. You're going to see people using it for warehouse -- logistics warehouse to plan and to optimize their warehouses and to plan their robots. 
And so digital twin applications are absolutely needed. And then remember, robots have several kinds. There's the physical robots that you saw and a physical robot with the self-driving car and a physical robot to do the car itself, turning it into a robot so that it could be an intelligent assistant. But I demonstrate probably the -- in my estimation, the largest application of robots in the future is avatars. We built Omniverse Avatar to make it easy for people to integrate some amazing technology from computer vision to speech recognition, natural language understanding, gesture recognition, facial animation, speech synthesis, recommender systems, all of that integrated into one system and running in real time. 
That avatar system is essentially a robotic system. And the way that you would do that is, for example, the 25 million-or-so retail stores, restaurants, places like airports and train stations and office buildings and such, where you're going to have intelligent avatars doing a lot of assistance. 
They might be doing check-out, they might be doing check-in, they might be doing customer support. And all of that could be done with avatars, as I've demonstrated. So the virtual robotics application, digital bots or avatars is going to be likely the largest robotics opportunity. So if you look at our licensing model, the way it basically works is that inside Omniverse, each one of the main users, new users -- and the main user could be one of the 20 million creatives or 20 million designers, we have the 40 million creatives and designers around the world, when they scale Omniverse, each one of the main users would be $1,000 per user per year. 
But don't forget that intelligent beings or intelligent users that can be connected to Omniverse will likely be much larger as digital bots than humans. So I've mentioned 40 million, but there are 100 million cars. And 100 million cars will all have -- all these have the capability to have something like an Omniverse Avatar. 
And so those 100 million cars could be $1,000 per car per year. And in the case of the 25 million or so places where you would have a digital avatar as customer support or check-out, smart retail or smart warehouse, it's smart whatever it is. Those avatars are also with -- each individual will have a main account. And so they would be $1,000 per avatar per year. 
And so those are the immediate tangible opportunities for us, and I demonstrated the application now. And then, of course, behind all of that, the -- call it, a couple of hundred million digital agents, intelligent agents, some of them human, some of robots, some of them avatars at $1,000 per agent per year. Behind it are NVIDIA GPUs in PCs, NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud and NVIDIA GPUs still on Omniverse servers. And my guess would be that the hardware part of it is probably going to be about half and then the licensing part of it is probably be about half of the time. And -- but this was really going to be one of the largest graphics opportunities that we've ever seen. And the reason why it's taking so long for this to manifest is because it requires 3 fundamental technologies to come together. I guess 4 fundamental technologies come together. 
First of all is to do the [ bracket ]. Second is physics simulation because we're talking about things in a world that has to be believable so it has to obey the laws of physics. And then third is artificial intelligence, as I've demonstrated in several stages now. And all of it runs on top of an Omniverse computer that has to do not just AI, not just physics, not just computer graphics, but all of it. 
And so what long term people -- why people are so excited about it is at the highest level, what it basically means is that long term, when we engage with Internet, which is largely 2D today, long term, every query would be 3D. And instead of just querying information, we would query and interact with people and avatars and things, places, and all of these things are in 3D. So hopefully, one of these days, that we will try to realize it as fast as we can. Every transaction that goes over the Internet touches a GPU. And today, that's a very small percentage, but hopefully, one of these days it will be a very, very high percentage. I hope that's helpful.",1070

There's gaming, then neural networking and AI and the blockchain and the ray tracing. And then like 5 or 6 years ago, you guys showed a bunch of virtual reality demos, which were really exciting at your Analyst Day. Excitement died down. Now it seems to be resurfacing, particularly with Omniverse Avatar capability and Facebook shining light on the opportunities. 
So the 2 questions from that are, how close is your Omniverse Avatar to morphing into like a mass market technology that everybody uses daily? You can talk about like -- you said that everybody is going to be a gamer, everybody going to be an Omniverse Avatar user. And maybe the bigger picture is, is it reasonable to think about a new killer app coming out every year? Is there a parallel that we should think about with previous computing markets that we could think about for the computing era that we're entering right now?",177
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2021",2021-11-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,4032.0,2444170.0,92833454.0,Answer,"Jensen Huang;Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director",,Executives,8,"I really appreciate that. Chips are enablers, but chips don't create markets. Software creates markets. I've explained over the years that accelerated computing is very different than general purpose computing. And the reason for that is because you can't just write a C compiler and compile quantum physics into a chip when it doesn't. You can't just compile showing your situation and have it distributed across multiple GPUs and multiple nodes and have it [indiscernible]. You just -- you can't do that for computer graphics. You can't do that for artificial intelligence. You can't do that for robotics. You can't do that for most of the interesting applications in the world. 
And because we really went out of theme with GPUs, that people are saying that not because it's not true, it's abundantly clear that the amount in instructional parallels will then be squeezed out of a system is, although not 0, is incredibly hard. It's just incredibly hard. And there's another approach. And we've been advocating accelerated computing for some time, and now people really see the benefit of it. But it does require a lot of work. And the work basically says for every domain, for every application, we have -- for every application in a large domain ideally, you have to have a full stack. And so whenever you want to open a new market by accelerating those applications or the domain of applications, you have to come up with a new stack. 
And the new stack is hard because you have to understand the application, you have to understand the algorithms, the mathematics, you have to understand computer science to distribute it across, to take something that was single threaded and make it multi-threaded and make something that was done sequentially and make its process in parallel. You break everything. You break storage, you break networking, you break everything. 
And so it takes a fair amount of expertise, and that's why we say that over the years, over the course of 30 years, we've become a full-stack company because we've been trying to solve this problem practically through decades. And so that's one. 
But the benefit, once you have the ability, then you can open new markets. And we played a very large role in democratizing artificial intelligence and making it possible for anybody to be able to do it. 
Our greatest contribution is I hope when it's all said and done, that we've democratized scientific computing so that researchers and scientists, computer scientists and data scientists, scientists of all kinds, were able to get access to this incredibly powerful tool that we call computers to do -- to advance research. 
And so every single year, we're filling up with these stacks, and we've got a whole bunch of stacks that we're working on. And many of them I'm working on in plain sight so that you see it coming, you just have to connect it together. One of the areas that we spoke about this time, of course, was Omniverse. You saw the pieces that are being built in over time. It took half a decade to start building Omniverse, but it's built on a quarter century of work. 
In the case of the Omniverse Avatar, you can literally point to Merlin recommender; Megatron, language -- large language model; Riva, the speech AI; all of our computer vision AIs that I've been demonstrating over the years; natural speed synthesis that you see every single year with i am ai, the opening credits, how we're using, developing an AI to be able to speak in a human way so that people feel more comfortable and more engaged with the AI; face, eye tracking, Maxine. And all of these technologies all kind of tie together. They were all being built in pieces from the integrated -- we have no intentions of integrating it to create what is called Omniverse Avatar. 
And now -- then you asked the question, how quickly will we deploy this? I believe Omniverse Avatar will be in drive-throughs of restaurants, fast food restaurants, check-outs of restaurants, in retail stores all over the world within less than 5 years. And we really use it in all kinds of different applications because there's such a great shortage of labor. And there's such a wonderful way that we can now engage in Avatar. And I think it could -- think it doesn't make mistakes, it never gets tired and it's always on. And we made it so that it's cloud-native. And so when you saw the keynote, I hope you'd agree that the interaction is continuous and the conversational form is so enjoyable. 
And so anyway, I think what you highlighted is, one, accelerating computing is a full-stack challenge; two, it takes software to open new markets. Chips won't open new markets. If you build another chip, you can steal somebody's share, but you can't open new markets. And it takes software to open new markets, and we have switched with software. And that's one of the reasons why we could engage such large market opportunity. 
And then lastly, with respect to Omniverse, I believe it's a near-term opportunity that we've been working on for some 3, 4, 5 years.",874

And I guess, not an Omniverse question, but I guess, Jensen, I'd like your commitment that you will not use Omniverse to target the sell-side research industry. 
But as my real question, can you speak to your data center visibility into 2022 and beyond? And within this outlook, can you talk to traditional cloud versus industry verticals? And then perhaps emerging opportunities like Omniverse and others. Would love to get a sense of kind of what you're seeing today. And then as part of that, how you're planning to secure foundry and other supply to support that growth.",99
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2021",2021-11-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,4032.0,2444170.0,92833457.0,Answer,"Jensen Huang;Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director",,Executives,11,"Thank you, C.J. First of all, we have secured guaranteed supply, very large amounts of it, quite a spectacular amount of it from the world's leading foundry and substrate in packaging and testing companies that are integral part of our supply chain. And so we have done that and feel very good about our supply situation, particularly starting in the second half of next year and going forward. 
I think this whole last year was a wake-up call for everybody to be much more mindful about not taking the supply chain for granted. And we were fortunate to have such great partners. But nonetheless, we've secured this with our future. 
With respect to data center, about half of our data center business comes from the cloud and cloud service providers, and the other half comes from enterprise, what we call enterprise companies. They're all -- in all kinds of industries. And about 1% of it comes from supercomputing centers. So 30%-or-so, cloud; 50%-or-so, enterprise; and 1% supercomputing centers. 
And we expect next year, the cloud service providers to scale out their deep learning and their AI workloads really aggressively. And we're seeing it right now. We've built a really fantastic platform, and -- number one. Number two, the work we've been doing with TensorRT, which is the run time that goes into the server that's called Triton is one of our best pieces of work. We're just so proud of it. And we said nearly 4 years ago, 3.5 years ago that inference is going to be one of the great computer science challenges, and we're really prudent to be so. And the reason for that is because sometimes it's so fast, sometimes it's latency, sometimes it's interactivity and the type of models we have to inference. It's just all over the math. It's not just computer vision or image recognition, it's all over the math. 
And the reason for that is we have so many different types of architectures. We have so many different ways to build different applications. And so the application is fabricated, and we're trying to -- we just have wonderful people working. We're now on our eighth generation on that. It's adopted all over the world for the 25,000 companies who are now using NVIDIA AI. 
And recently, at GTC, we announced 2 very, very big things. One, we reminded everybody that just months before, we have tried to support not just in every generation of NVIDIA GPUs, which there are so many versions -- could you imagine, without Triton, how would you possibly deploy AI across the entire fleet of NVIDIA servers, NVIDIA GPU servers that are all over the world? And so it's almost an essential tool just to operate and take advantage of all of NVIDIA's GPUs. These are the latest. 
Two, we support GPUs. And so it's no longer necessary for someone to have 2 inference servers, you can just have 1 inference server because the NVIDIA versions are already essential. Now everybody could just use Triton in every single server in the data center to be part of the inference capacity. 
And then we did something else that was a really big deal at GTC, which is this we call forced inference library cost bill. But basically, the most popular machine learning systems in inference models are based on trees, decision trees, and boosted gradient trees. And people might know it as XGBoost. 
And it's used all over the place in fraud detection, in recommender systems, and they're utilized in companies all over the world because it's just self-explanatory, you can build upon it. You don't worry about regressions if you build these under the trees. And we -- this GTC, we announced that we support that as well. And so all of a sudden, all of that workload that runs on GPUs not only do they run on Triton, it becomes accelerated. And then the last -- the next thing that we have announced was the tremendous interest in large language models. 
Triton now also supports multi-GPU and multi-node inference so that we could take something like an open AI, GPT-3, NVIDIA Megatron, 530B or anybody's giant model that's being developed all over the world in all these different languages and all these different domains and all these different deals of signers and what in the industry we can now inference it in real time. 
And I demonstrated it in one of the demos. There was a toy Jensen that the team built and it was able to, basically, answer questions in real time. And so that is just a giant breakthrough. And these are the type of workloads that's going to make it possible for us to continue to scale out, basically. 
So back to your original question. I think this year has been quite a big year for data centers. Customers are very mindful of securing their supply for their scale-out. And so we have a fair amount of visibility, and more visibility probably than ever of data centers. But in addition to the Triton adoption everywhere. 
And then finally, our brand-new workload, which is built on top of AI and graphics and simulation, which is Omniverse. And you saw the examples that I gave. These are real companies doing real work. And one of the areas that is -- has severe shortages around the world is customer support. Just genuine severe shortages all over the world. And we think the answer is Omniverse Avatar, and it runs in data centers. You could adapt Omniverse Avatar to do drive-throughs or retail check-out or customer service. And I've demonstrated that with Tokkio, a talking kiosk. You can use it for a teleoperated customer service, and we've demonstrated that with [ Maxine ]. We've demonstrated how you can use it even for videoconferencing. 
And then lastly, we demonstrated how we can use Omniverse Avatar for robotics, and for example, to create a concierge, what we call DRIVE Concierge for your car, turning it into an intelligent, it's like your customer support, intelligent agent. That's why I think Omniverse Avatar is going to be a really exciting driver for enterprises next year. So next year, NVIDIA is going to be -- we're seeing up a pretty, pretty terrific year for [ Omniverse ].",1053

On the near-term, Colette, you've suggested guidance into Q4 will be driven by data center and gaming. And you mentioned data center first. Does that mean that it's bigger? And if you could just help us like parse the contribution of each into Q4? 
And then into next year, given the commentary for the last question. Again, it sounds like you've got like a very strong outlook for data center, both from hyperscale and enterprise. And if I look at sort of the implied guidance, we give our data center for you is probably likely to grow 50% year-over-year in this fiscal year. Would it be crazy to think given all those drivers that it could grow by a similar amount next year as well? Like how should we be thinking about that given all of the drivers that you've been laying out?",163

Thanks, Stacy, for the question. Let's first focus in terms of our guidance for Q4 or statements that we made were, yes, about driven by revenue growth from data center and gaming sequentially. We could probably expect our data center to grow faster than our gaming probably both in terms of percentage-wise and absolute dollars. We also expect our key product to decline quarter-on-quarter to very negligible levels in Q4. So I hope that gives you a color on Q4. 
Now in terms of next year, we'll certainly turn the corner into the new fiscal year. We certainly provide guidance one quarter out. We've given some great discussion here about the opportunities in front of us, opportunities with the hyperscales, the opportunities with the verticals, Omniverse is a full-stack opportunity in front of us. We are securing supply for next year not just for the current year in Q4 to allow us to really grow into so much of this opportunity going forward. But at this time, we're going to wait until next year to provide guidance.",178

So Colette, you suggested the inventory purchase and supply agreements are up, I think, almost 68% year-on-year. Does that provide some directional correlation with how you are preparing for growth over the next 12 to 24 months? So that's one question. 
And then the bigger question, Jensen, that I have for you is, where are we in the AI adoption cycle? What percentage of servers are accelerated in hyperscale and vertical industry today? And where can those ratios get to?",87
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2021",2021-11-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,4032.0,2444170.0,92833463.0,Answer,Colette Kress,,Executives,17,"Thanks for the question. So let's first start in terms of supply or our supply purchase agreements. You have noted that we are discussing that we have made payments towards some of those commitments. Not only are we procuring for what we need in the quarter, what we need next year. And again, we are planning for growth next year, so we have been planning that supply purchases, we are also doing long-term supply purchases. These are areas of capacity agreements and/or many of our different suppliers. 
We made a payment within this quarter of approximately $1.6 billion out of total long-term capacity agreements of about $3.4 billion. So we still have more payments to make, and we will likely continue to be purchasing longer term to support our growth that we are planning for many years to come.",139

Today, of all the clouds and all the enterprise, less than 10%. That kind of gives you a sense of where you are. 
In terms of the workloads, it's also consistent with that in the sense that a lot of the workloads still only run on GPUs, which is the reason why in order for us to grow, we have to be a full-stack company. And we have to go find applications. We don't have to find them, we have plenty of them. Focus on applications that require acceleration or benefits tremendously from acceleration that if they were to get a million x speedup, which sounds insane, but it's not. Mathematically, I can prove it to you. And historically, I can even demonstrate to you that in many, many areas, we have seen knowing their speedups and have completely revolutionized those industries. Computer graphics is, of course, one of them. Omniverse would not be possible without. 
And so the work that we're doing with digital biology, protein synthesis, which is likely going to be one of the large industries in the world that doesn't exist today at all, protein engineering. And the protein economy is likely going to be very, very large. You can't do that unless you are able to get a million x speedup in -- I see the relation of protein dynamics. 
And so those are -- and not to mention some of the most imperative problems that we have to go and engage, climate science needs a million x, billion x speedup. And we are at a point where we can actually tackle it. And so in each one of these cases, we have to find -- we have to focus our resources to go and accelerate those applications, and that translates to growth. Until then, they'll run on GPUs. 
And if you look at a lot of today's speech synthesis and speech recognition systems, they're still using a fairly traditional or [ minister ] traditional deep learning approaches for CGI. NVIDIA's Riva is the world's first, I believe, that is end-to-end deep neural network. And we've worked with many companies in helping them advance there so that they could move their clouds to neural-based approaches. But that's one of the reasons why we do it, so that we could provide a reference. But we can also license it to enterprises around the world so that they could adapt it for their own use cases. And so one application after another, we have to get it accelerated. One domain after another, we have to get it accelerated. 
One of the ones that I was very excited about and something that we've been working on for so long is EDA, even our own industry, Electronic Design Automation. For the very first time, we announced the EDA using computer science computing, whether because of the artificial intelligence capability because EDA is a very large combinatorial optimization program. And using artificial intelligence, we could really improve the design quality and design time. So we're seeing all the major EDA vendors, from chip design to simulation to PCB design and optimization, design synthesis moving towards artificial intelligence and GPU acceleration in a very significant way. 
And then we see that with mechanical CAD and traditional CAD application. Now also jumping on to GPU acceleration. And again, very significant speedups. And so I'm super excited about the work that we're doing in each one of these domains because every time you do it, you open up a brand-new market. And customers who have never used them [indiscernible], now can because ultimately people don't buy chips. They're trying to solve problems. 
And without a full fact, without software expertise, we can't really commence the enabling technology, what the chip provides, and ultimately resolving the question for me.",644

So we have always been working on our gross margin and being able to absorb a lot of the cost changes along the way, architecture-to-architecture, year-to-year. So that's always baked in to our gross margins. 
Our gross margins right now are largely stable. Our incremental revenue, for example, what we're expecting next quarter will likely align to our current gross margin levels that we finished in terms of Q3. Our largest driver always continues to be mix. We have a lot of different mix that has vision related to high-end AR and RTX solutions, for example, and the software that's embedded in solutions have allowed us to increase the gross margin.
As we look forward, long term, software is sold separately. It can be another damper of gross margin increases in the future. But cost changes, cost increases have generally been a part of our gross margin for years.",150

We had an outstanding quarter. Demand for NVIDIA AI is strong, with hyperscalers and cloud services deploying at scale and enterprises broadening adoption. We now count more than 25,000 companies that are using NVIDIA AI. And with NVIDIA AI Enterprise Software Suite, our collaboration with VMware and our collaboration with Equinix to place NVIDIA LaunchPads across the world, every enterprise has an easy on-ramp to NVIDIA AI. Gaming and pro viz are surging. RTX opportunity continues to expand with the growing markets of gamers, creators, designers and now, professionals building home workstations. 
We are working hard to increase supply for the overwhelming demand this holiday season. Last week, GTC showcased the expanding universe of NVIDIA-accelerated computing. In combination with AI and data-center-scale computing, the model we pioneered is on the cusp of producing million x speedups that will revolutionize many important fields, already, AI, and upcoming, robotics, digital biology and what I hope, climate science. 
GTC highlighted our full-stack expertise in action. Built on CUDA and our acceleration libraries in data processing, in simulation, graphics, artificial intelligence, marketplace and domain-specific software is needed to solve customer problems. 
We also showed how software opens new growth opportunities for us, but the chips are the enablers, but it's the software that opens new growth opportunities. NVIDIA has 150 SDKs now, addressing many of the world's largest end markets. 
One of the major themes of this GTC was Omniverse, our simulation platform for virtual worlds and digital tools. Our body of work and expertise in graphics, physics simulation, AI, robotics, and full stack computing made Omniverse possible. 
At GTC, we showed how Omniverse is used to reinvent collaborative design, customer service avatars and video conferences and digital twins of factories, processing plants and even entire cities. This is just the tip of the iceberg of what's to come. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thank you.",320
