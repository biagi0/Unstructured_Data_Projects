32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2023",2023-02-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3625.0,2757369.0,103196725.0,Presenter Speech,Colette Kress,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Simona. Q4 revenue was $6.05 billion, up 2% sequentially, and down 21% year-on-year. Full year revenue was $27 billion, flat from the prior year. 
Starting with data center. Revenue was $3.62 billion was down 6% sequentially and up 11% year-on-year. Fiscal year revenue was $15 billion and up 41%. Hyperscale customer revenue posted strong sequential growth, though short of our expectations as some cloud service providers paused at the end of the year to recalibrate their build plans. Though we generally see tightening that reflects overall macroeconomic uncertainty, we believe this is a timing issue at the end market demand for GPUs and AI infrastructure is strong. 
Networking grew but a bit less than our expected on softer demand for general-purpose CPU infrastructure. The total data center sequential revenue decline was driven by lower sales in China, which was largely in line with our expectations, reflecting COVID and other domestic issues. 
With cloud adoption continuing to grow, we are serving an expanding list of fast-growing cloud service providers, including Oracle and GPU-specialized CSPs. Revenue growth from CSP customers last year significantly outpaced that of Data Center as a whole as more enterprise customers moved to a cloud-first approach. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, CSP customers drove about 40% of our Data Center revenue. 
Adoption of our new flagship H100 Data Center GPU is strong. In just the second quarter of its ramp, H100 revenue was already much higher than that of A100, which declined sequentially. This is a testament of the exceptional performance on the H100, which is as much as 9x faster than the A100 for training and up 30x cluster in inferencing of transformer-based large language models. The transformer engine of H100 arrived just in time to serve the development and scale out of inference of large language models. 
AI adoption is at an inflection point. OpenAI's ChatGPT has captured interest worldwide, allowing people to experience AI firsthand and showing what's possible with Generative AI. These new types of neural network models can improve productivity in a wide range of tasks, whether generating text like marketing copy, summarizing documents like [indiscernible], creating images for ads or video games or answering customer questions. Generative AI applications will help almost every industry do more faster. 
Generative large language models with over 100 billion parameters are the most advanced neural networks in today's world. NVIDIA's expertise spans across the AI supercomputers, algorithms, data processing and training methods that can bring these capabilities to enterprise. We look forward to helping customers with Generative AI opportunities. 
In addition to working with every major hyperscale cloud provider, we are engaged with many consumer Internet companies, enterprises and start-ups. The opportunity is significant and driving strong growth in the Data Center that will accelerate through the year. 
During the quarter, we made notable announcements in the financial services sector, one of our largest industry verticals. We announced a partnership with Deutsche Bank to accelerate the use of AI and machine learning in financial services. Together, we are developing a range of applications, including virtual customer service agents, speech AI, fraud detection and bank process automation, leveraging NVIDIA's full computing stack, both on-premise and in the cloud, including NVIDIA, AI enterprise software. We also announced that NVIDIA captured leading results for AI inference in a key financial services industry benchmark for applications such as asset price discovery. In networking, we see growing demand for our latest generation InfiniBand and HPC optimized Ethernet platforms fueled by AI. 
Generative AI foundation model sizes continue to grow at exponential rates, driving the need for high-performance networking to scale out multi-node accelerated workloads. Delivering unmatched performance, latency and in-network computing capabilities, InfiniBand is the clear choice for power-efficient cloud scale Generative AI. 
For smaller scale deployments, NVIDIA is bringing its full accelerated stack expertise and integrating it with the world's most advanced high-performance Ethernet fabrics. In the quarter, InfiniBand led our growth as our Quantum-2 40 gigabit per second platform is off to a great start, driven by demand across cloud, enterprise and supercomputing customers. In Ethernet, our 40 gigabit per second Spectrum-4 networking platform is gaining momentum as customers transition to higher speeds, next-generation adopters and switches. 
We remain focused on expanding our software and services. We released version 3.0 of NVIDIA AI enterprise with support for more than 50 NVIDIA AI frameworks and pretrained model and new workflows for contact center, intelligent virtual assistance, audio transcription and cybersecurity. Upcoming offerings include our NeMo and BioNeMo large language model services, which are currently in early access with customers. 
Now to Jensen to talk a bit more about our software and cloud business [indiscernible].",776

We will share more details about NVIDIA AI cloud services at our upcoming GTC so be sure to tune in. 
Now let me turn it back to Colette on gaming.",340
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2023",2023-02-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3625.0,2757369.0,103196727.0,Presenter Speech,Colette Kress,,Executives,4,"Thanks, Jensen. Gaming revenue of $1.83 billion was up 16% sequentially and down 46% from a year ago. Fiscal year revenue of $9.07 billion is down 27%. Sequential growth was driven by the strong reception of our 40 Series GeForce RTX GPUs based on the Ada Lovelace architecture. The year-on-year decline reflects the impact of channel inventory correction, which is largely behind us. And demand in the seasonally strong fourth quarter was solid in most regions. While China was somewhat impacted by disruptions related to COVID, we are encouraged by the early signs of recovery in that market. 
Gamers are responding enthusiastically to the new RTX 4090, 4080, 4070 Ti desktop GPUs, with many retail and online outlets quickly selling out of stock. The flagship RTX 4090 has quickly shot up in popularity on Steam to claim the top spot for the Ada architecture, reflecting gamers' desire for high-performance graphics. 
Earlier this month, the first phase of gaming laptops based on the Ada architecture reached retail shelves, delivering NVIDIA's largest-ever generational leap in performance and power efficiency. For the first time, we are bringing enthusiast-class GPU performance to laptops as slim as 14 inches, a fast-growing segment, previously limited to basic tasks and apps. 
In another first, we are bringing the 90 class GPUs, our most performing models, to laptops, thanks to the power efficiency of our fifth-generation Max-Q technology. All in, RTX 40 Series GPUs will power over 170 gaming and creator laptops, setting up for a great back-to-schools season. 
There are now over 400 games and applications supporting NVIDIA's RTX technology for real-time ray tracing and AI-powered graphics. The Ada architecture features DLSS 3, our third-generation AI-powered graphics, which massively boosts performance. One of the most advanced games, Cyberpunk 2077, recently added DLSS 3 enabling a 3 to 4x boost in frame rate performance at 4K resolution. 
Our GeForce NOW cloud gaming service continues to expand in multiple dimensions, users, titles and performance. It now has more than 25 million members in over 100 countries. Last month, it enabled RTX 4080 graphics horsepower in the new high-performance ultimate membership tier. Ultimate members can stream at up to 240 frames per second from a cloud with full ray tracing and DLSS 3. 
And just yesterday, we made an important announcement with Microsoft. We agreed to a 10-year partnership to bring to GeForce NOW Microsoft's lineup of Xbox PC games, which includes blockbusters like Minecraft, Halo and Flight Simulator. And upon the close of Microsoft's Activision acquisition, it will add titles like Call of Duty and Overwatch. 
Moving to Pro Visualization. Revenue of $226 million was up 13% sequentially and down 65% from a year ago. Fiscal year revenue of $1.54 billion was down 27%. Sequential growth was driven by desktop workstations with strengths in the automotive and manufacturing industrial verticals. The year-on-year decline reflects the impact of the channel inventory correction, which we expect to end in the first half of the year. 
Interest in NVIDIA's Omniverse continues to build with almost 300,000 downloads so far, 185 connectors to third-party design applications. The latest released of Omniverse has a number of features and enhancements, including support for 4K, real-time path tracing, Omniverse DeepSearch for AI-powered search through large untagged 3D databases, and Omniverse Cloud containers for AWS. 
Let's move to automotive. Revenue was a record $294 million, up 17% sequentially and up 135% from a year ago. Sequential growth was driven primarily by AI automotive solutions. New program ramps at both electric vehicle and traditional OEM customers helped drive this growth. Fiscal year revenue of $903 million was up 60%. 
At CES, we announced a strategic partnership with Foxconn to develop automated and autonomous vehicle platforms. This partnership will provide scale for volume, manufacturing to meet growing demand for the NVIDIA DRIVE platform. Foxconn will use NVIDIA DRIVE, Hyperion compute and sensor architecture for its electric vehicles. Foxconn will be a Tier 1 manufacturer producing electronic control units based on NVIDIA DRIVE Orin for the global automotive market. 
We also reached an important milestone this quarter. The NVIDIA DRIVE operating system received safety certification from TÜV SÜD, one of the most experienced and rigorous assessment bodies in the automotive industry. With industry-leading performance and functional safety, our platform meets a higher standards required for autonomous transportation. 
Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin was 63.3%, and non-GAAP gross margin was 66.1%. Fiscal year GAAP gross margin was 56.9%, and non-GAAP gross margin was 59.2%. Year-on-year, Q4 GAAP operating expenses were up 21%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 23%, primarily due to the higher compensation and data center infrastructure expenses. 
Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were flat, and non-GAAP operating expenses were down 1%. We plan to keep them relatively flat at this level over the coming quarters. Full year GAAP operating expenses were up 50%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 31%. 
We returned $1.15 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. At the end of Q4, we had approximately $7 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization through December 2023.
Let me look to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal '24. We expect sequential growth to be driven by each of our 4 major market platforms led by strong growth in data center and gaming. Revenue is expected to be $6.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 64.1% and 66.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. 
GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.53 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.78 billion. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $50 million, excluding gains and losses of nonaffiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 13%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. 
Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $350 million to $400 million for the first quarter and in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion for the full fiscal year 2024. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. 
In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the Morgan Stanley Technology Conference on March 6 in San Francisco and the Cowen Healthcare Conference on March 7 in Boston. We will also host GTC virtually with Jensen's keynote kicking off on March 21. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our first quarter of fiscal year '24 is scheduled for Wednesday, May 24. 
Now we will open up the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions?",1115

I think as we look at it, I think, straight up, the enterprise AI software suite, I think, is priced at around $6,000 per CPU socket. I think you've got pricing metrics a little bit higher for the cloud consumption model. I'm just curious, Colette, how do we start to think about that monetization contribution to the company's business model over the next couple of quarters relative to, I think, in the past, you've talked like a couple of hundred million or so? Just curious if you can unpack that a little bit.",114

Our plans in terms of software, we continue to see growth. Even in our Q4 results, we're making quite good progress in both working with our partners, onboarding more partners and increasing our software. You are correct. We've talked about our software revenues being in the hundreds of millions. And we're getting even stronger each day as Q4 was probably a record level in terms of our software levels. But there's more to unpack in terms of there, and I'm going to turn it to Jensen.",114

It starts from data processing to learning, training, to validations, to inference. And so this body of software is completely accelerated. It runs in every cloud. It runs on-prem. And it supports every framework, every model that we know of, and it's accelerated everywhere. 
By using NVIDIA AI, your entire machine learning operations is more efficient, and it is more cost effective. You save money by using accelerated software. Our announcement today of putting NVIDIA's infrastructure and have it be hosted from within the world's leading cloud service providers accelerates the enterprise's ability to utilize NVIDIA AI enterprise. It accelerates people's adoption of this machine learning pipeline, which is not for the faint of heart. It is a very extensive body of software. It is not deployed in enterprises broadly, but we believe that by hosting everything in the cloud, from the infrastructure through the operating system software, all the way through pretrained models, we can accelerate the adoption of Generative AI in enterprises. And so we're excited about this new extended part of our business model. We really believe that it will accelerate the adoption of software.",207

And then Jensen, my main question kind of related to 2 small related ones. The computing intensity for Generative AI, if it is very high, does it limit the market size to just a handful of hyperscalers? And on the other extreme, if the market gets very large, then doesn't it attract more competition for NVIDIA from cloud ASICs or other accelerator options that are out there in the market?",89

First, talking about our data center guidance that we provided for Q1. We do expect a sequential growth in terms of our data center, strong sequential growth. And we are also expecting a growth year-over-year for our data center. We actually expect a great year, with our year-over-year growth in data center probably accelerating past Q1.",61
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2023",2023-02-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3625.0,2757369.0,103196735.0,Answer,"Jensen Huang;Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director",,Executives,12,"Large language models are called large because they are quite large. However, remember that we've accelerated and advanced AI processing by a million x over the last decade. Moore's Law, in its best days, would have delivered 100x in a decade. By coming up with new processors, new systems, new interconnects, new frameworks and algorithms and working with data scientists, AI researchers on new models, across that entire span, we've made large language model processing a million times faster, a million times faster. 
What would have taken a couple of months in the beginning, now it happens in about 10 days. And of course, you still need a large infrastructure. And even the large infrastructure, we're introducing Hopper, which, with its transformer engine, its new NVLink switches and its new InfiniBand 400 gigabits per second data rates, we're able to take another leap in the processing of large language models. 
And so I think the -- by putting NVIDIA's DGX supercomputers into the cloud with NVIDIA DGX cloud, we're going to democratize the access of this infrastructure, and with accelerated training capabilities, really make this technology and this capability quite accessible. So that's one thought. 
The second is the number of large language models or foundation models that have to be developed is quite large. Different countries with different cultures and its body of knowledge are different. Different fields, different domains, whether it's imaging or it's biology or it's physics, each one of them need their own domain of foundation models. With large language models, of course, we now have a prior that could be used to accelerate the development of all these other fields, which is really quite exciting. 
The other thing to remember is that the number of companies in the world have their own proprietary data. The most valuable data in the world are proprietary. And they belong to the company. It's inside their company. It will never leave the company. And that body of data will also be harnessed to train new AI models for the very first time. And so we -- our strategy and our goal is to put the DGX infrastructure in the cloud so that we can make this capability available to every enterprise, every company in the world who would like to create proprietary data and so -- proprietary models. 
The second thing about competition. We've had competition for a long time. Our approach, our computing architecture, as you know, is quite different on several dimensions. Number one, it is universal, meaning you could use it for training, you can use it for inference, you can use it for models of all different types. It supports every framework. It supports every cloud. It's everywhere. It's cloud to private cloud, cloud to on-prem. It's all the way out to the edge. It could be an autonomous system. This 1 architecture allows developers to develop their AI models and deploy it everywhere. 
The second very large idea is that no AI in itself is an application. There's a preprocessing part of it and a post-processing part of it to turn it into an application or service. Most people don't talk about the pre and post processing because it's maybe not as sexy and not as interesting. However, it turns out that preprocessing and post-processing oftentimes consumes half or 2/3 of the overall workload. And so by accelerating the entire end-to-end pipeline, from preprocessing, from data ingestion, data processing, all the way to the preprocessing, all the way to post processing, we're able to accelerate the entire pipeline versus just accelerating half of the pipeline. 
The limit to speed up, even if you're instantly passed if you only accelerate half of the workload, is twice as fast. Whereas if you accelerate the entire workload, you could accelerate the workload maybe 10, 20, 50x faster, which is the reason why when you hear about NVIDIA accelerating applications, you routinely hear 10x, 20x, 50x speed up. And the reason for that is because we accelerate things end to end, not just the deep learning part of it, but using CUDA to accelerate everything from end to end. 
And so I think the universality of our computing -- accelerated computing platform, the fact that we're in every cloud, the fact that we're from cloud to edge, makes our architecture really quite accessible and very differentiated in this way. And most importantly, to all the service providers, because of the utilization is so high, because you can use it to accelerate the end-to-end workload and get such a good throughput, our architecture is the lowest operating cost. It's not -- the comparison is not even close. So -- anyhow, those are the 2 answers.",786

And so curious, part A, how have your conversations evolved post-ChatGPT with hyperscale and large-scale enterprises? And then secondly, as you think about Hopper with the transformative engine and Grace with high-bandwidth memory, how have you kind of your outlook for growth for those 2 product cycles evolved in the last few months?",69
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2023",2023-02-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3625.0,2757369.0,103196738.0,Answer,"Jensen Huang;Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director",,Executives,15,"ChatGPT is a wonderful piece of work, and the team did a great job, OpenAI did a great job with it. They stuck with it. And the accumulation of all of the breakthroughs led to a service with a model inside that surprised everybody with its versatility and its capability. 
What people -- People were surprised by, and this is in our -- and close within the industry is well understood. But the surprising capability of a single AI model that can perform tasks and skills that it was never trained to do. And for this language model to not just speak English, or can translate, of course, but not just speak human language, it can be prompted in human language, but output Python, output COBOL, a language that very few people even remember, output Python for Blender, a 3D program. So it's a program that writes a program for another program. 
We now realize -- the world now realizes that maybe human language is a perfectly good computer programming language, and that we've democratized computer programming for everyone, almost anyone who could explain in human language a particular task to be performed. This new computer -- when I say new era of computing, this new computing platform, this new computer could take whatever your prompt is, whatever your human-explained request is, and translate it to a sequence of instructions that you process it directly or it waits for you to decide whether you want to process it or not. 
And so this type of computer is utterly revolutionary in its application because it's democratized programming to so many people really has excited enterprises all over the world. Every single CSP, every single Internet service provider, and that, frankly, every single software company, because of what I just explained, that this is an AI model that can write a program for any program. Because of that reason, everybody who develops software is either alerted or shocked into alert or actively working on something that is like ChatGPT to be integrated into their application or integrated into their service. And so this is, as you can imagine, utterly worldwide. 
The activity around the AI infrastructure that we build, Hopper, and the activity around inferencing using Hopper and Ampere to inference large language models, has just gone through the roof in the last 60 days. And so there's no question that whatever our views are of this year as we enter the year has been fairly, dramatically changed as a result of the last 60, 90 days.",425

And I guess, we're all talking about the drivers of the services and the compute that you're going to host on top of these services with the different hyperscalers. But I think we've been kind of watching and wondering when your data center business might transition to more of a systems level business, meaning pairing NVLink and InfiniBand with your Hopper product, with your Grace product, and selling things more on a systems level. I wonder if you could step back, over the next 2 or 3 years, how do you think the mix of business in your data center segment evolves from maybe selling cards to systems and software? And what can that mean for the margins of that business over time?",136

First of all, as you know, our Data Center business is a GPU business only in the context of a conceptual GPU because what we actually sell to the cloud service providers is a panel, a fairly large computing panel of 8 Hoppers or 8 Amperes that's connected with NVLink switches that are connected with NVLink. And so this board represents essentially 1 GPU. It's 8 chips connected together into 1 GPU with a very high-speed chip-to-chip interconnect. And so we've been working on, if you will, multi-die computers for quite some time. And that is 1 GPU. 
So when we think about a GPU, we actually think about an HGX GPU, and that's 8 GPUs. We're going to continue to do that. And the thing that the cloud service providers are really excited about is by hosting our infrastructure for NVIDIA to offer because we have so many companies that we work directly with. We're working directly with 10,000 AI start-ups around the world, with enterprises in every industry. And all of those relationships today would really love to be able to deploy both into the cloud at least or into the cloud and on-prem and oftentimes multi-cloud. 
And so by having NVIDIA DGX and NVIDIA's infrastructure are full stack in their cloud, we're effectively attracting customers to the CSPs. This is a very, very exciting model for them. And they welcomed us with open arms. And we're going to be the best AI salespeople for the world's clouds. And for the customers, they now have an instantaneous infrastructure that is the most advanced. They have a team of people who are extremely good from the infrastructure to the acceleration software, the NVIDIA AI open -- operating system, all the way up to AI models. Within 1 entity, they have access to expertise across that entire span. 
And so this is a great model for customers. It's a great model for CSPs. And it's a great model for us. It lets us really run like the wind. As much as we will continue and continue to advance DGX AI supercomputers, it does take time to build AI supercomputers on-prem. It's hard no matter how you look at it. It takes time no matter how you look at it. And so now we have the ability to really prefetch a lot of that and get customers up and running as fast as possible.",408

Most of the focus right now is on text, but obviously, there are companies doing a lot of training on video and music. They're working on models there. And it seems like somebody who's training these big models has maybe, on the high end, at least 10,000 GPUs in the cloud that they've contracted and maybe tens of thousands of more to inference a widely deployed model. So it seems like the incremental TAM is easily in the several hundred thousands of GPUs and easily in the tens of billions of dollars. But I'm kind of wondering what this does to the TAM numbers you gave last year. I think you said $300 billion hardware TAM and $300 billion software TAM. So how do you kind of think about what the new TAM would be?",148
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2023",2023-02-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3625.0,2757369.0,103196744.0,Answer,"Jensen Huang;Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director",,Executives,21,"I think those numbers are really good anchor still. The difference is because of the, if you will, incredible capabilities and versatility of Generative AI and all of the converging breakthroughs that happened towards the middle and the end of last year, we're probably going to arrive at that TAM sooner than later. There's no question that this is a very big moment for the computer industry. Every single platform change, every inflection point in the way that people develop computers happened because it was easier to use, easier to program and more accessible. This happened with the PC revolution. This happened with the Internet revolution. This happened with mobile cloud. 
Remember, mobile cloud, because of the iPhone and the App Store, 5 million applications and counting emerged. There weren't 5 million mainframe applications. There weren't 5 million workstation applications. There weren't 5 million PC applications. And because it was so easy to develop and deploy amazing applications part cloud, part on the mobile device and so easy to distribute because of app stores, the same exact thing is now happening to AI. 
In non-computing era, did 1 computing platform, ChatGPT, reached 150 million people in 60, 90 days. I mean, this is quite an extraordinary thing. And people are using it to create all kinds of things. And so I think that what you're seeing now is just a torrent of new companies and new applications that are emerging. There's no question this is, in every way, a new computing era. And so I think the TAM that we explained and expressed, it really is even more realizable today and sooner than before.",274

The clarification, you said H100 revenue's higher than A100. Was that an overall statement? Or was that at the same point in time like after 2 quarters of shipments? 
And then for my actual question. I wanted to ask about auto, specifically the Mercedes opportunity. The Mercedes had an event today, and they were talking about software revenues for their MB Drive that could be single digit or low billion euros by mid-decade and mid-billion euros by the end of the decade. And I know you guys were supposedly splitting the software revenues 50-50. Is that kind of the order of magnitude of software revenues from the Mercedes deal that you guys are thinking of and over that similar time frame? Is that how we should be modeling that?",140
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2023",2023-02-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3625.0,2757369.0,103196747.0,Answer,Colette Kress,,Executives,24,"Great. Thanks, Stacy, for the question. Let me first start with your question you had about H100 and A100. We began initial shipments of H100 back in Q3. It was a great start. Many of them began that process many quarters ago. And this was a time for us to get production level to them in Q3. So Q4 was an important time for us to see a great ramp of H100 that we saw. What that means is our H100 was the focus of many of our CSPs within Q4, and they were all wanting to get -- both get up and running in cloud instances. And so we actually saw less of A100 in Q4 of what we saw in H100 at a larger amount. We tend to continue to sell both architectures going forward, but just in Q4, it was a strong quarter for [ H100 ]. 
Your additional questions that you had on Mercedes-Benz. I'm very pleased with the joint connection that we have with them and the work. We've been working very diligently about getting ready to come to market. And you're right. They did talk about the software opportunity. They talked about their software opportunity in 2 phases, about what they can do with DRIVE as well as what they can also do with Connect. They extended out to a position of probably about 10 years looking at the opportunity that they see in front of us. So it aligns with what our thoughts are with a long-term partner of that and sharing that revenue over time.",263

This is the only large luxury brand that has, across the board, from every -- from the entry all the way to the highest end of their luxury cars, to install every single one of them with a rich sensor set, every single one of them with an AI supercomputer, so that every future car in the Mercedes fleet will contribute to an installed base that could be upgradable and forever renewed for customers going forward. If you could just imagine what it looks like if the entire Mercedes fleet that is on the road today were completely programmable, that you can OTA, it would represent tens of millions of Mercedes that would represent revenue-generating opportunity. And that's the vision that Ola has. And what they're building for, I think, it's going to be extraordinary. The large installed base of luxury cars that will continue to renew for customers' benefits and also for revenue-generating benefits.",176

And if I think back facial recognition and then recommendation engines, natural language processing, Omniverse and now Generative AI engines, can you share with us your view? Is this what we should expect going forward, like a brand-new workload that drives demand to the next level for your products? 
And the reason I ask is because I found it interesting your comments in your script where you mentioned that your kind of view about the demand that Generative AI is going to drive for your products and now services is -- seems to be a lot better than what you thought just over the last 90 days. So -- and to the extent that there's new workloads that you're working on or new applications that can drive next levels of demand, would you care to share with us a little bit of what you think could drive it past what you're seeing today?",178
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2023",2023-02-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3625.0,2757369.0,103196751.0,Answer,"Jensen Huang;Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director",,Executives,28,"Yes, Mark, I really appreciate the question. First of all, I have new applications that you don't know about and new workloads that we've never shared that I would like to share with you at GTC. And so that's my hook to come to GTC, and I think you're going to be very surprised and quite delighted by the applications that we're going to talk about. 
Now there's a reason why it is the case that you're constantly hearing about new applications. The reason for that is, number one, NVIDIA is a multi-domain accelerated computing platform. It is not completely general purpose like a CPU because a CPU is 95%, 98% control functions and only 2% mathematics, which makes it completely flexible. We're not that way. We're an accelerated computing platform that works with the CPU that offloads the really heavy computing units, things that could be highly, highly paralyzed to offload them. But we're multi-domain. We could do particle systems. We could do fluids. We could do neurons. And we can do computer graphics. We can do rays. There are all kinds of different applications that we can accelerate, number one. 
Number two, our installed base is so large. This is the only accelerated computing platform, the only platform. Literally, the only one that is architecturally compatible across every single cloud from PCs to workstations, gamers to cars to on-prem. Every single computer is architecturally compatible, which means that a developer who developed something special would seek out our platform because they like the reach. They like the universal reach. They like the acceleration, number one. They like the ecosystem of programming tools and the ease of using it and the fact that they have so many people they can reach out to, to help them. There are millions of CUDA experts around the world, software all accelerated, tool all accelerated. And then very importantly, they like the reach. They like the fact that you can see -- they can reach so many users after they develop the software. And it is the reason why we just keep attracting new applications. 
And then finally, this is a very important point. Remember, the rate of CPU computing advance has slowed tremendously. And whereas back in the first 30 years of my career, at 10x in performance at about the same power every 5 years, and 10x every 5 years. That rate of continued advance has slowed. At a time when people still have really, really urging applications that they would like to bring to the world, and they can't afford to do that with the power keep going up. Everybody needs to be sustainable. You can't continue to consume power. By accelerating it, we can decrease the amount of power you use for any workload. And so all of these multitude of reasons is really driving people to use accelerated computing, and we keep discovering new exciting applications.",488

You saw some weakness on build plan in the January quarter, but you're guiding to year-over-year acceleration in April and through the year. So if you can just rank order for us the confidence in the acceleration, is that based on your H100 ramp or Generative AI sales coming through or the new AI services model? And also, if you can talk about what you're seeing on the enterprise vertical?",78

Thanks for the question. When we think about our growth, yes, we're going to grow sequentially in Q1 and do expect year-over-year growth in Q1 as well. It will likely accelerate there going forward. So what do we see as the drivers of that? Yes, we have multiple product cycles coming to market. We have H100 in market now. We are continuing with our new launches as well that are sometimes fueled with our GPU computing with our networking. And then we have Grace coming likely in the second half of the year. 
Additionally, Generative AI, it sparked interest definitely among our customers, whether those be CSPs, whether those be enterprises, whether those be start-ups. We expect that to be a part of our revenue growth this year. And then lastly, let's just not forget that given the end of Moore's Law, there's an era here of focusing on AI, focusing on accelerated computing. So as the economy improves, this is probably very important to the enterprises and it can be fueled by the existence of cloud first for the enterprises as they [indiscernible].

Can you give us some insight into what that looks like in the next few years and to the extent that some of your customers with these large language models are talking about 100x the complexity over that kind of time frame. I know Hopper is 6x better transformer performance. But what can you do to scale that up? And how much of that just reflects that it's going to be a much larger hardware expense down the road?",101
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2023",2023-02-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3625.0,2757369.0,103196758.0,Answer,"Jensen Huang;Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director",,Executives,35,"First, I'll start backwards. I believe the number of AI infrastructures are going to grow all over the world. And the reason for that is AI, the production of intelligence, is going to be manufacturing. There was a time when people manufacture just physical goods. In the future, there will be -- almost every company will manufacture soft goods. It just happens to be in the form of intelligence. Data comes in. That data center does exactly 1 thing and 1 thing only. It cranks on that data and it produces a new updated model. Where raw material comes in, a building or an infrastructure cranks on it, and something refined or improved comes out that is of great value, that's called the factory. And so I expect to see AI factories all over the world. Some of it will be hosted in cloud. Some of it will be on-prem. There will be some that are large, and there are some that will be mega large, and then there'll be some that are smaller. And so I fully expect that to happen, number one. 
Number two. Over the course of the next 10 years, I hope through new chips, new interconnects, new systems, new operating systems, new distributed computing algorithms and new AI algorithms and working with developers coming up with new models, I believe we're going to accelerate AI by another million x. There's a lot of ways for us to do that. And that's one of the reasons why NVIDIA is not just a chip company because the problem we're trying to solve is just too complex. You have to think across the entire stack all the way from the chip, all the way through the data center across the network through the software. And in the mind of one single company, we can think across that entire stack. And it's really quite a great playground for computer scientists for that reason because we can innovate across that entire stack. So my expectation is that you're going to see really gigantic breakthroughs in AI models in the next coming -- the AI platforms in the coming decade. But simultaneously, because of the incredible growth and adoption of this, you're going to see these AI factories everywhere.",378

Q1 revenue was $7.19 billion, up 19% sequentially and down 13% year-on-year. Strong sequential growth was driven by record data center revenue with our gaming and professional visualization platforms emerging from channel inventory corrections.
Starting with Data Center. Record revenue of $4.28 billion was up 18% sequentially and up 14% year-on-year on strong growth of our accelerated computing platform worldwide. Generative AI is driving exponential growth in compute requirements and a fast transition to NVIDIA accelerated computing, which is the most versatile, most energy-efficient and the lowest TCO approach to train and deploy AI. Generative AI drove significant upside in demand for our products, creating opportunities and broad-based global growth across our markets.
Let me give you some color across our 3 major customer categories: cloud service providers or CSPs, consumer Internet companies and enterprises. First, CSPs around the world are racing to deploy our flagship Hopper and Ampere architecture GPUs to meet the surge in interest from both enterprise and consumer AI applications for training and inference. Multiple CSPs announced the availability of H100 on their platforms, including private previews at Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, upcoming offerings at AWS and general availability at emerging GPU-specialized cloud providers like CoreWeave and Lambda. In addition to enterprise AI adoption, these CSPs are serving strong demand for H100 from generative AI pioneers.
Second, consumer Internet companies are also at the forefront of adopting generative AI and deep-learning-based recommendation systems, driving strong growth. For example, Meta has now deployed its H100-powered Grand Teton AI supercomputer for its AI production and research teams.
Third, enterprise demand for AI and accelerated computing is strong. We are seeing momentum in verticals such as automotive, financial services, health care and telecom where AI and accelerated computing are quickly becoming integral to customers' innovation road maps and competitive positioning. For example, Bloomberg announced it has a $50 billion parameter model, BloombergGPT, to help with financial natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, news classification and question answering.
Auto insurance company CCC Intelligent Solutions is using AI for estimating repairs. And AT&T is working with us on AI to improve fleet dispatches so their field technicians can better serve customers. Among other enterprise customers using NVIDIA AI are Deloitte for logistics and customer service, and Amgen for drug discovery and protein engineering.
This quarter, we started shipping DGX H100, our Hopper generation AI system, which customers can deploy on-prem. And with the launch of DGX Cloud through our partnership with Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, we deliver the promise of NVIDIA DGX to customers from the cloud. Whether the customers deploy DGX on-prem or via DGX Cloud, they get access to NVIDIA AI software, including NVIDIA-based command, end-to-end AI frameworks and pretrained models. We provide them with the blueprint for building and operating AI, spanning our expertise across systems, algorithms, data processing and training methods.
We also announced NVIDIA AI Foundations, which are model foundry services available on DGX Cloud that enable businesses to build, refine and operate custom large language models and generative AI models trained with their own proprietary data created for unique domain-specific tasks. They include NVIDIA NeMo for large language models, NVIDIA Picasso for images, video and 3D, and NVIDIA BioNeMo for life sciences. Each service has 6 elements: pretrained models, frameworks for data processing and curation, proprietary knowledge-based vector databases, systems for fine-tuning, aligning and guard railing, optimized inference engines, and support from NVIDIA experts to help enterprises fine-tune models for their custom use cases.
ServiceNow, a leading enterprise services platform is an early adopter of DGX Cloud and NeMo. They are developing custom large language models trained on data specifically for the ServiceNow platform. Our collaboration will let ServiceNow create new enterprise-grade generative AI offerings with the thousands of enterprises worldwide running on the ServiceNow platform, including for IT departments, customer service teams, employees and developers.
Generative AI is also driving a step function increase in inference workloads. Because of their size and complexities, these workloads require acceleration. The latest MLPerf industry benchmark released in April showed NVIDIA's inference platforms deliver performance that is orders of magnitude ahead of the industry with unmatched versatility across diverse workloads. To help customers deploy generative AI applications at scale, at GTC, we announced 4 major new inference platforms that leverage the NVIDIA AI software stack. These include L4 Tensor Core GPU for AI video, L40 for Omniverse and graphics rendering, H100 NBL for large language models and the Grace Hopper Superchip for LLMs, and also recommendation systems and vector databases. 
Google Cloud is the first CSP to adopt our L4 inference platform with the launch of its G2 virtual machines for generative AI inference and other workloads, such as Google Cloud Dataproc, Google AlphaFold and Google Cloud's Immersive Stream, which render 3D and AR experiences. In addition, Google is integrating our Triton Inference Server with Google Kubernetes engine and its cloud-based Vertex AI platform.
In networking, we saw strong demand at both CSPs and enterprise customers for generative AI and accelerated computing, which require high-performance networking like NVIDIA's Mellanox networking platforms. Demand relating to general purpose CPU infrastructure remains soft. As generative AI applications grow in size and complexity, high-performance networks become essential for delivering accelerated computing at data center scale to meet the enormous demand of both training and inferencing. Our 400-gig Quantum-2 InfiniBand platform is the gold standard for AI-dedicated infrastructure, with broad adoption across major cloud and consumer Internet platforms such as Microsoft Azure.
With the combination of in-network computing technology and the industry's only end-to-end data center scale optimized software stack, customers routinely enjoy a 20% increase in throughput for their sizable infrastructure investment. For multi-tenant cloud transitioning to support generative AI, our high-speed Ethernet platform with BlueField-3 DPUs and Spectrum-4 Ethernet switching offers the highest available Ethernet network performance. BlueField-3 is in production and has been adopted by multiple hyperscale and CSP customers, including Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud, CoreWeave, Baidu and others. We look forward to sharing more about our 400-gig spectrum for accelerated AI networking platform next week at the Computex Conference in Taiwan.
Lastly, our Grace data center CPU is sampling with customers. At this week's International Supercomputing Conference in Germany, the University of Bristol announced a new supercomputer based on the NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip, which is 6x more energy efficient than the previous supercomputer. This adds to the growing momentum for Grace with both CPU-only and CPU-GPU opportunities across AI and cloud and supercomputing applications. The coming wave of BlueField-3, Grace and Grace Hopper Superchips will enable a new generation of super energy-efficient accelerated data centers.
Now let's move to Gaming. Gaming revenue of $2.24 billion was up 22% sequentially and down 38% year-on-year. Strong sequential growth was driven by sales of the 40 Series GeForce RTX GPUs for both notebooks and desktops. Overall end demand was solid and consistent with seasonality, demonstrating resilience against a challenging consumer spending backdrop. The GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU laptops are off to a great start, featuring 4 NVIDIA inventions: RTX Path Tracing, DLSS 3 AI rendering, Reflex ultra-low latency rendering and Max-Q energy-efficient technologies. They deliver tremendous gains in industrial design, performance and battery life for gamers and creators.
Unlike our desktop offerings, 40 Series laptops support the NVIDIA Studio platform for software technologies, including acceleration for creative data science and AI workflows, and Omniverse, giving content creators unmatched tools and capabilities. In desktop, we ramped the RTX 4070, which joined the previously launched RTX 4090, 4080 and the 4070 Ti GPUs. The RTX 4070 is nearly 3x faster than the RTX 2070 and offers our large installed base a spectacular upgrade.
Last week, we launched the 60 family, RTX 4060 and 4060 Ti, bringing our newest architecture to the world's core gamers starting at just $299. These GPUs for the first time provide 2x the performance of the latest gaming console at mainstream price points. The 4060 Ti is available starting today, while the 4060 will be available in July.
Generative AI will be transformative to gaming and content creation from development to runtime. At the Microsoft Build Developer Conference earlier this week, we showcased how Windows PCs and workstations with NVIDIA RTX GPUs will be AI powered at their core. NVIDIA and Microsoft have collaborated on end-to-end software engineering, spanning from the Windows operating system to the NVIDIA graphics drivers and NeMo LLM framework to help make Windows on NVIDIA RTX Tensor Core GPUs a supercharged platform for generative AI.
Last quarter, we announced a partnership with Microsoft to bring Xbox PC games to GeForce NOW. The first game from this partnership, Gears 5, is now available with more set to be released in the coming months. There are now over 1,600 games on GeForce NOW, the richest content available on any cloud gaming service.
Moving to Pro Visualization. Revenue of $295 million was up 31% sequentially and down 53% year-on-year. Sequential growth was driven by stronger workstation demand across both mobile and desktop form factors, with strength in key verticals such as public sector, health care and automotive. We believe the channel inventory correction is behind us. The ramp of our Ada Lovelace GPU architecture in workstations kicks off with major product cycle. At GTC, we announced 6 new RTX GPUs for laptops and desktop workstations with further rollouts planned in the coming quarters.
Generative AI is a major new workload for NVIDIA-powered workstation. Our collaboration with Microsoft transforms Windows into the ideal platform for creators and designers harnessing generative AI to elevate their creativity and productivity. At GTC, we announced NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud and NVIDIA fully managed service, running in Microsoft Azure. That includes the full suite of Omniverse applications and NVIDIA OVX infrastructure. Using this full stack cloud environment, customers can design, develop, deploy and manage industrial metaverse applications. NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud will be available starting in the second half of this year. Microsoft and NVIDIA will also connect Office 365 applications with Omniverse.
Omniverse Cloud is being used by companies to digitize their workflows from design and engineering to smart factories and 3D content generation for marketing. The automotive industry has been a leading early adopter of Omniverse, including companies such as BMW Group, Geely Lotus, General Motors and Jaguar Land Rover. 
Moving to Automotive. Revenue was $296 million, up 1% sequentially and up 114% from a year ago. Our strong year-on-year growth was driven by the ramp of the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin across a number of new energy vehicles. As we announced in March, our automotive design win pipeline over the next 6 years now is down at $14 billion, up from $11 billion a year ago, giving us visibility into continued growth over the coming years.
Sequentially, growth moderated as some NEV customers in China are adjusting their production schedules to reflect slower-than-expected demand growth. We expect this dynamic to linger for the rest of the calendar year. During the quarter, we expanded our partnership with BYD, the world's leading manufacturer of NEVs. Our new design win will extend BYD's use of the DRIVE Orin to its next-generation, high-volume Dynasty and Ocean series of vehicles set to start production in calendar 2024.
Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins was 64.6%. Non-GAAP gross margins were 66.8%. Gross margins have now largely recovered to prior peak levels as we have absorbed higher costs and offset them by innovating and delivering higher-valued products as well as products incorporating more and more software. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were down 3% and non-GAAP operating expenses were down 1%. We have held OpEx at roughly the same level over the last -- past 4 quarters while working through the inventory corrections in Gaming and Professional Visualization. We now expect to increase investments in the business while also delivering operating leverage.
We returned $99 million to shareholders in the form of cash dividends. At the end of Q1, we have approximately $7 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization through December 2023.
Let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal '24. Total revenue is expected to be $11 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect this sequential growth to largely be driven by Data Center, reflecting a steep increase in demand related to generative AI and large language models. This demand has extended our Data Center visibility out a few quarters, and we have procured substantially higher supply for the second half of the year.
GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 68.6% and 70%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.71 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $90 million, excluding gains and losses from nonaffiliated investments.
GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 14%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $300 million to $350 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.
In closing, let me highlight some of the upcoming events. Jensen will give the Computex keynote address in person in Taipei this coming Monday, May 29, local time, which will be Sunday evening in the U.S. In addition, we will be attending the BofA Global Technology Conference in San Francisco on June 6 and Rosenblatt Virtual Technology Summit on the age of AI on June 7 and the New Street Future of Transportation Virtual Conference on June 12. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our second quarter fiscal '24 is scheduled for Wednesday, August 23.
Well, that covers our opening remarks. We're now going to open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions?",2313

Just one question on Data Center. Colette, you mentioned the vast majority of the sequential increase in revenue this quarter will come from Data Center. I was curious what the construct is there, if you can speak to what the key drivers are from April to July. And perhaps more importantly, you talked about visibility into the second half of the year. I'm guessing it's more of a supply problem at this point. What kind of sequential growth beyond the July quarter can your supply chain support at this point?",98
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, May 24, 2023",2023-05-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,4107.0,2821040.0,105067547.0,Answer,Colette Kress,,Executives,5,"Okay. So a lot of different questions there, so let me see if I can start, and I'm sure Jensen will have some following up comments. So when we talk about our sequential growth that were expected between Q1 and Q2, our generative AI large language models are driving this surge in demand, and it's broad-based across both our consumer Internet companies, our CSPs, our enterprises and our AI start-ups. It is also interest in both of our architectures, both of our Hopper latest architecture as well as our Ampere architecture. This is not surprising as we generally often sell both of our architectures at the same time.
This is also a key area where deep recommendators are driving growth. And we also expect to see growth both in our computing as well as in our networking business. So those are some of the key things that we have baked in when we think about the guidance that we have provided to Q2. We also surfaced in our opening remarks that we are working on both supply today for this quarter, but we have also procured a substantial amount of supply for the second half. We have some significant supply chain flow to serve our significant customer demand that we see, and this is demand that we see across a wide range of different customers.
They are building platforms for some of the largest enterprises but also setting things up at the CSPs and the large consumer Internet companies. So we have visibility right now for our data center demand that has probably extended out a few quarters, and this led us to working on quickly procuring that substantial supply for the second half.
I'm going to pause there and see if Jensen wants to add a little bit more.",300

Number one, where are we in terms of driving acceleration into servers to support AI? And as part of that, as you deal with longer cycle times with TSMC and your other partners, how are you thinking about managing the commitments there with where you want to manage your lead times in the coming years to best kind of match that supply and demand?",86
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, May 24, 2023",2023-05-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,4107.0,2821040.0,105067551.0,Answer,Jensen Huang,,Executives,9,"Yes, C.J., thanks for the question. I'll start backwards. The -- remember, we were in full production of both Ampere and Hopper when the ChatGPT moment came, and it helped everybody crystallize how to transition from the technology of large language models to a product and service based on a chatbot. The integration of guardrails and alignment systems with reinforcement learning human feedback, knowledge vector databases for proprietary knowledge, connection to search, all of that came together in a really wonderful way. And it's the reason why I call it the iPhone moment. All the technology came together and helped everybody realize what an amazing product it can be and what capabilities it can have.
And so we were already in full production. NVIDIA's supply chain flow and our supply chain is very significant as you know. And we build supercomputers in volume, and these are giant systems and we build them in volume. It includes, of course, the GPUs, but on our GPUs, the system boards have 35,000 other components. And the networking and the fiber optics and the incredible transceivers and the NICs, the SmartNICs, the switches, all of that has to come together in order for us to stand up a data center. And so we were already in full production when the moment came. We had to really significantly increase our procurement substantially for the second half, as Colette said.
Now let me talk about the bigger picture and why the entire world's data centers are moving toward accelerated computing. It's been known for some time, and you've heard me talk about it, that accelerated computing is a full stack problem but -- it is full stack challenged. But if you could successfully do it in a large number of application domain that's taken us 15 years, it's sufficiently that almost the entire data center's major applications could be accelerated. You could reduce the amount of energy consumed and the amount of cost for a data center substantially by an order of magnitude. It costs a lot of money to do it because you have to do all the software and everything and you have to build all the systems and so on and so forth, but we've been at it for 15 years.
And what happened is when generative AI came along, it triggered a killer app for this computing platform that's been in preparation for some time. And so now we see ourselves in 2 simultaneous transitions. The world's $1 trillion data center is nearly populated entirely by CPUs today. And I -- $1 trillion, $250 billion a year, it's growing of course. But over the last 4 years, call it $1 trillion worth of infrastructure installed, and it's all completely based on CPUs and dumb NICs. It's basically unaccelerated.
In the future, it's fairly clear now with this -- with generative AI becoming the primary workload of most of the world's data centers generating information, it is very clear now that -- and the fact that accelerated computing is so energy efficient, that the budget of a data center will shift very dramatically towards accelerated computing, and you're seeing that now. We're going through that moment right now as we speak, while the world's data center CapEx budget is limited. But at the same time, we're seeing incredible orders to retool the world's data centers.
And so I think you're starting -- you're seeing the beginning of, call it, a 10-year transition to basically recycle or reclaim the world's data centers and build it out as accelerated computing. You have a pretty dramatic shift in the spend of a data center from traditional computing and to accelerated computing with SmartNICs, smart switches, of course, GPUs and the workload is going to be predominantly generative AI.",632

Or do they sustain at Q2 level? So I just wanted to clarify that. And then, Jensen, my question is that given this very strong demand environment, what does it do to the competitive landscape? Does it invite more competition in terms of custom ASICs? Does it invite more competition in terms of other GPU solutions or other kinds of solutions? What -- how do you see the competitive landscape change over the next 2 to 3 years?",98
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, May 24, 2023",2023-05-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,4107.0,2821040.0,105067554.0,Answer,Colette Kress,,Executives,12,"Yes, Vivek, thanks for the question. Let me see if I can add a little bit more color. We believe that the supply that we will have for the second half of the year will be substantially larger than H1. So we are expecting not only the demand that we just saw in this last quarter, the demand that we have in Q2 for our forecast but also planning on seeing something in the second half of the year. We just have to be careful here, but we're not here to guide on the second half. But yes, we do plan a substantial increase in the second half compared to the first half.",113
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, May 24, 2023",2023-05-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,4107.0,2821040.0,105067555.0,Answer,Jensen Huang,,Executives,13,"Regarding competition, we have competition from every direction. Start-ups, really, really well funded and innovative start-ups, countless of them all over the world. We have competitions from existing semiconductor companies. We have competition from CSPs with internal projects, and many of you know about most of these. And so we're mindful of competition all the time, and we get competition all the time.
NVIDIA's value proposition at the core is we are the lowest cost solution. We're the lowest TCO solution. And the reason for that is because accelerated computing is 2 things that I talk about often, which is it's a full stack problem. It's a full stack challenge. You have to engineer all of the software and all the libraries and all the algorithms, integrate them into and optimize the frameworks and optimize it for the architecture of not just one chip but the architecture of an entire data center but all the way into the frameworks, all the way into the models.
And the amount of engineering and distributed computing, fundamental computer science work is really quite extraordinary. It is the hardest computing as we know. And so number one, it's a full stack challenge and you have to optimize it across the whole thing and across just a mind-blowing number of stacks. We have 400 acceleration libraries. As you know, the amount of libraries and frameworks that we accelerate is pretty mind blowing.
The second part is that generative AI is a large-scale problem, and it's a data center scale problem. It's another way of thinking that the computer is the data center or the data center is the computer. It's not the chip. It's the data center, and it's never happened like us before. And in this particular environment, your networking operating system, your distributed computing engines, your understanding of the architecture of the networking gear, the switches and the computing systems, the computing fabric, that entire system is your computer, and that's what you're trying to operate. And so in order to get the best performance, you have to understand full stack and understand data center scale. And that's what accelerated computing is.
The second thing is that utilization, which talks about the amount of the types of applications that you can accelerate and the versatility of your architecture, keeps that utilization high. If you can do one thing and doing one thing only incredibly fast, then your data center is largely underutilized, and it's hard to scale that out. NVIDIA's universal GPU and the fact that we accelerate so many stacks makes our utilization incredibly high. And so number one is throughput, and that's software-intensive problems and data center architecture problem. The second is digitalization versatility problem.
And the third is just data center expertise. We've built 5 data centers of our own, and we've helped companies all over the world build data centers. And we integrate our architecture into all the world's clouds. From the moment of delivery of the product to the standing up and the deployment, the time to operations of a data center is measured not -- it can -- if you're not good at it and not proficient at it, it could take months. Standing up a supercomputer, let's see, some of the largest supercomputers in the world were installed about 1.5 years ago, and now they're coming online.
And so it's not unheard of to see a delivery to operations of about a year. Our delivery to operation's measured in weeks. And that's -- we've taken data centers and supercomputers, and we've turned it into products. And the expertise of the team in doing that is incredible.
And so our value proposition is in final analysis. All of this technology translates into infrastructure, the highest throughput and the lowest possible cost. And so I think our market is, of course, very, very competitive, very large, but the challenge is really, really great.",655

As we kind of think about unpacking the various different growth drivers of the Data Center business going forward, I'm curious, Colette, of just how we should think about the monetization effect of software considering that the expansion of your cloud service agreements continues to grow. I'm curious of what -- where do you think we're at in terms of that approach, in terms of the AI enterprise software suite and other drivers of software-only revenue going forward?",82

Software is really important to our accelerated platforms. Not only do we have a substantial amount of software that we are including in our newest architecture and essentially all products that we have, we're now with many different models to help customers start their work in generative AI and accelerated computing.
So anything that we have here from DGX Cloud on providing those services, helping them build models or, as you've discussed, the importance of NVIDIA AI Enterprise, essentially, that operating system for AI, so all things should continue to grow as we go forward, both the architecture and the infrastructure as well as the -- both availability of the software and our ability to monetize that with it as well. I'll turn it over to Jensen if needs to comment.",135
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, May 24, 2023",2023-05-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,4107.0,2821040.0,105067559.0,Answer,Jensen Huang,,Executives,17,"Yes. We can see in real time the growth of generative AI in CSPs, both for training the models, refining the models as well as deploying the models. As Colette said earlier, inference is now a major driver of accelerated computing because generative AI is used so capably in so many applications already.
There are 2 segments that require a new stack of software, and the 2 segments are enterprise and industrials. Enterprise requires a new stack of software because many enterprises need to have all the capabilities that we've talked about, whether it's large language models, the ability to adapt them for your proprietary use case and your proprietary data and alignment to your own principles and your own operating domains. You want to have the ability to be able to do that in a high-performance computing sandbox, and we call that DGX Cloud, and to create that model.
Then you want to deploy your chatbot or your AI in any cloud because you have services and you have agreements with multiple cloud vendors and depending on the applications, you might deploy it on various clouds. And for the enterprise, we have NVIDIA AI Foundations for helping you create custom models and we have NVIDIA AI Enterprise. NVIDIA AI Enterprise is the only accelerated stack -- GPU accelerated stack in the world that is enterprise safe and enterprise supported. There are constant patching that you have to do. There are 4,000 different packages that build up NVIDIA AI Enterprise and represents the operating engine -- end-to-end operating engine of the entire AI workflow.
It's the only one of its kind from data ingestion, data processing. Obviously, in order to train an AI model, you have a lot of data you have to process and package up and curate and align. And there's just a whole bunch of stuff that you have to do to the data to prepare it for training. That amount of data could consume some 40%, 50%, 60% of your computing time. And so data processing is a very big deal. And then the second aspect of it is training the model, refining the model. And the third is deploying model for inferencing.
NVIDIA AI Enterprise supports and patches and security patches continuously all of those 4,000 packages of software. And for an enterprise that wants to deploy their engines just like they want to deploy Red Hat Linux, this is incredibly complicated software. In order to deploy that in every cloud and as well as on-prem, it has to be secure. It has to be supported. And so NVIDIA AI Enterprise is the second part.
The third is Omniverse. Just as people are starting to realize that you need to align an AI to ethics, the same for robotics, you need to align the AI for physics, and aligning an AI for ethics includes a technology called reinforcement learning human feedback. In the case of industrial applications and robotics, it's reinforcement learning Omniverse feedback. And Omniverse is a vital engine for software-defined and robotic applications and industries. And so Omniverse also needs to be a cloud service platform.
And so our software stack, the 3 software stacks, AI Foundations, AI Enterprise and Omniverse, runs in all of the world's clouds that we have partnerships, DGX Cloud partnerships with. Azure, we have partnerships on both AI as well as Omniverse. With GCP and Oracle, we have great partnerships in DGX Cloud for AI, and AI Enterprise is integrated into all 3 of them.
And so I think the -- in order for us to extend the reach of AI beyond the cloud and into the world's enterprise and into the world's industries, you need 2 new types of -- you need new software stacks in order to make that happen. And by putting it in the cloud, integrated into the world CSP clouds, it's a great way for us to partner with the sales and the marketing team and the leadership team of all the cloud vendors.",671

I know you need the low latency of InfiniBand for AI. But can you sort of talk about the attach rate of your InfiniBand solutions to what you're shipping on the core compute side and maybe whether that's similarly crowding out Ethernet like you are with -- on the compute side?

They both have their place. InfiniBand had a record quarter. We're going to have a giant record year. And InfiniBand has a really -- NVIDIA's Quantum InfiniBand has an exceptional road map. It's going to be really incredible.
The 2 networks are very different. InfiniBand is designed for an AI factory if you will. If that data center is running a few applications for a few people for a specific use case and is doing it continuously, and that infrastructure costs you, pick a number, $500 million, the difference between InfiniBand and Ethernet could be 15%, 20% in overall throughput. And if you spent $500 million on an infrastructure and the difference is 10% to 20%, and it's $100 million, InfiniBand's basically free. That's the reason why people use it.
InfiniBand is effectively free. The difference in data center throughput is just -- it's too great to ignore. And you're using it for that one application. And so however, if your data center is a cloud data center and it's multi-tenant, it's a bunch of little jobs, a bunch of little jobs and is shared by millions of people, then Ethernet is really the right answer. There's a new segment in the middle where the cloud is becoming a generative AI cloud. It's not an AI factory per se, but it's still a multi-tenant cloud, but it wants to run generative AI workloads.
This new segment is a wonderful opportunity. And at Computex -- I referred to it at the last GTC. At Computex, we're going to announce a major product line for this segment, which is for Ethernet-focused generative AI application type of clouds. But InfiniBand is doing fantastically, and we're doing record numbers quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year.",299

So you're talking about inference as being a very large opportunity. I guess 2 subparts of that. Is that because inference basically scales with like the usage versus like training is more of a one and done? And can you give us some sort of -- even if it's just like qualitatively, like do you think inference is bigger than training or vice versa? Like if it's bigger, how much bigger? Is it like the opportunity, is it 5x? Is it 10x? Is there anything you can give us on those 2 workloads within generative AI? Would be helpful.",110
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, May 24, 2023",2023-05-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,4107.0,2821040.0,105067567.0,Answer,Jensen Huang,,Executives,25,"Yes, I'll work backwards. You're never done with training. You're always -- every time you deploy, you're collecting new data. When you collect new data, you train with the new data. And so you're never done training. You're never done producing and processing a vector database that augments the large language model. You're never done with vectorizing all of the collected structured, unstructured data that you have. And so whether you're building a recommender system, a large language model, a vector database, these are probably the 3 major applications of -- the 3 core engines, if you will, of the future of computing as well as a bunch of other stuff.
But obviously, these are very -- 3 very important ones. They are always, always running. You're going to see that more and more companies realize they have a factory for intelligence -- an intelligence factory. And in that particular case, it's largely dedicated to training and processing data and vectorizing data and learning representation of the data, so on and so forth.
The inference part of it are APIs that are either open APIs that can be connected to all kinds of applications, APIs that are integrated into workflows but APIs of all kinds. There will be hundreds of APIs in a company. Some of them, they built themselves. Some of them, part that -- many of them could come from companies like ServiceNow and Adobe that we're partnering with in AI Foundations. And they'll create a whole bunch of generative AI APIs that companies can then connect into their workflows or use as an application. And of course, there'll be a whole bunch of Internet service companies.
And so I think you're seeing for the very first time, simultaneously, a very significant growth in the segment of AI factories as well as a market that -- a segment that really didn't exist before but now it's growing exponentially practically by the week for AI inference with APIs. The simple way to think about it in the end is that the world has a $1 trillion of data center installed and it used to be 100% CPUs. In the future, we know -- we've heard it in enough places, and I think this year's ISC keynote was actually about the end of Moore's Law.
We've seen it in a lot of places now that you can't reasonably scale out data centers with general purpose computing and that accelerated computing is the path forward. And now it's got a killer app. It's called generative AI. And so the easiest way to think about that is your $1 trillion infrastructure. Every quarter's capital, CapEx budget would lean very heavily into generative AI, into accelerated computing infrastructure, everywhere from the number of GPUs that would be used in the CapEx budget to the accelerated switches and accelerated networking chips that connect them all.
The easiest way to think about that is, over the next 4, 5, 10 years, most of that $1 trillion and then compensating, adjusting for all the growth in data center still, it will be largely generative AI. And so that's probably the easiest way to think about that, and that's training as well as inference.",537

It's pretty clear that this is a really big opportunity around large language models. But the cloud customers are also talking about trying to reduce cost per query by very significant amounts. Can you talk about the ramifications of that for you guys? Is that where some of the specialty inference products that you launched at GTC come in? And just how are you going to help your customers get the cost per query down?,89
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, May 24, 2023",2023-05-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,4107.0,2821040.0,105067570.0,Answer,Jensen Huang,,Executives,28,"Yes, that's a great question. Whether you're -- whether -- you start by building a large language model, and you use that large language model, very large version, and you could distill them into medium, small and tiny size. And the tiny sized ones, you could put in your phone and your PC and so on and so forth. And they all have good -- they all have -- it seems surprising, but they all can do the same thing. But obviously, the zero shot or the generalizability of the large language model, the biggest one is much more versatile and it can do a lot more amazing things.
And the large one would teach the smaller ones how to be good AIs, and so you use the large one to generate prompts to align the smaller ones and so on and so forth. And so you start by building very large ones, and then you also have to train a whole bunch of smaller ones. That's exactly the reason why we have so many different sizes of our inference. You saw that I announced L4; L40; H100 NVL, which also has H100. And then it has -- and then we have H100 HGX, and then we have H100 multi-node with NVLink. And so there's a -- you could have model sizes of any kind that you like.
The other thing that's important is these are models, but they're connected ultimately to applications. And the applications could have image in, video out, video in, text out, image in, proteins out, text in, 3D out, video in, in the future, 3D graphics out. So the input and the output requires a lot of pre and postprocessing. The pre and postprocessing can't be ignored. And this is one of the things that most of the specialized chip arguments fall apart. And it's because the length -- the model itself is only, call it, 25% of the data -- of the overall processing of inference. The rest of it is about preprocessing, postprocessing, security, decoding, all kinds of things like that.
And so I think the -- we -- the multi-modality aspect of inference, the multidiversity of inference that it's going to be done in the cloud on-prem, it's going to be done in multi-cloud. That's the reason why we have AI Enterprise in all the clouds. It's going to be done on-premise. It's the reason why we have a great partnership with Dell we just announced the other day called Project Helix. That's going to be integrated into third-party services. That's the reason why we have a great partnership with ServiceNow and Adobe because they're going to be creating a whole bunch of generative AI capabilities. And so there's a -- the diversity and the reach of generative AI is so broad, you need to have some very fundamental capabilities like what I just described in order to really address the whole space of it.",493

I really appreciate more of the focus or some of the focus today on your networking products. I mean it's really an integral part to sort of maximize the full performance of your compute platforms. I think your data center networking business is driving about $1 billion of revenues per quarter, plus or minus. That's 2.5x growth from 3 years ago, right, when you guys acquired Mellanox, so very strong growth.
But given the very high attach of your InfiniBand Ethernet solutions, your accelerated compute platforms, is the networking run rate stepping up in line with your compute shipments? And then what is the team doing to further unlock more networking bandwidth going forward just to keep pace with the significant increase in compute complexity, data sets, requirements for lower latency, better traffic predictability and so on?",144
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, May 24, 2023",2023-05-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,4107.0,2821040.0,105067573.0,Answer,Jensen Huang,,Executives,31,"Yes. Harlan, I really appreciate that. Nearly everybody who thinks about AI, they think about that chip, that accelerator chip. And in fact, this is the whole point nearly completely. And I've mentioned before that accelerated computing is about the stack, about the software. And networking, remember, we announced very, very early on this networking stack called DOCA, and we have an acceleration library called Magnum IO. These 2 pieces of software are some of the crown jewels of our company. Nobody ever talks about it because it's hard to understand, but it makes it possible for us to connect tens of thousands of GPUs.
How do you connect tens of thousands of GPUs if the operating system of the data center, which is the infrastructure, is not insanely great? And so that's the reason why we're so obsessed about networking in the company. And one of the great things that we have, we have Mellanox, as you know quite well, was the world's highest performance and the unambiguous leader in high-performance networking, is the reason why our 2 companies are together.
You also see that our network expands starting from NVLink, which is a computing fabric with really super low latency, and it communicates using memory references, not network packaged. And then we take NVLink. We connect it inside multiple GPUs, and I've described going beyond the GPU. And I'll talk a lot more about that at Computex in a few days. And then that gets connected to InfiniBand, which includes the NIC and the SmartNIC, BlueField-3 that we're in full production with and the switches. All of the fiber optics that are optimized end to end, these things are running at incredible line rates.
And then beyond that, if you want to connect the smart AI factory -- this AI factory into your computing fabric, we have a brand-new type of Ethernet that we'll be announcing at Computex. And so the -- this whole area of the computing fabric extending -- connecting all of these GPUs and computing units together all the way through the networking, through the switches, the software stack is insanely complicated. And so we're -- I'm delighted you understand it, and -- but we don't break it out particularly because we think of the whole thing as a computing platform as it should be.
We sell it to all of the world's data centers as components so that they can integrate it into whatever style or architecture that they would like and we can still run our software stack. That's the reason why we break it up. It's way more complicated the way that we do it, but it makes it possible for NVIDIA's computing architecture to be integrated into anybody's data center in the world from cloud of all different kinds to on-prem of all different kinds, all the way out to the edge to 5G. And so this way of doing it is really, really complicated, but it gives us incredible reach.",500

One of the things I wanted to dig into a little bit is the DGX Cloud offering. You guys have been working on this for some time behind the scenes, where you sell in the hardware to your hyperscale partners and then lease it back for your own business. And the rest of us kind of found out about it publicly a few months ago.
And as we look forward over the next number of quarters, as Colette discussed, to high visibility in the Data Center business, maybe you could talk a little bit about the mix you're seeing of hyperscale customers buying for their own first-party internal workloads versus their own sort of third party, their own customers versus what of that big upside in Data Center going forward is systems that you're selling in with potential to support your DGX Cloud offerings and what you've learned since you've launched it about the potential of that business.",165

It's -- without being too specific about numbers, but the ideal scenario, the ideal mix is something like 10% NVIDIA DGX Cloud and 90% the CSPs' clouds. And the reason -- and our DGX Cloud is the NVIDIA stack. It's the pure NVIDIA stack. It is architected the way we like and achieves the best possible performance. It gives us the ability to partner very deeply with the CSPs to create the highest-performing infrastructure, number one.
Number two, it allows us to partner with the CSPs to create markets. Like for example, we're partnering with Azure to bring Omniverse Cloud to the world's industries. And the world has never had a system like that, the computing stack with all the generative AI stuff and all the 3D stuff and the physics stuff, incredibly large database and really high-speed networks and low-latency networks, that kind of a virtual -- industrial virtual world has never existed before. And so we partnered with Microsoft to create Omniverse Cloud inside Azure Cloud.
And so it allows us, number two, to create new applications together and develop new markets together. And we go to market as one team. And we benefit by getting customers on our computing platform, and they benefit by having us in their cloud, number one. But number two, the amount of data and services and security services and all of the amazing things that Azure and GCP and OCI have, they can instantly have access to that through Omniverse Cloud.
And so it's a huge win-win. And for the customers, the way that NVIDIA's cloud works for these early applications, they could do it anywhere. So one standard stack runs in all the clouds. And if they would like to take their software and run it on the CSP's cloud themselves and manage it themselves, we're delighted by that because NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA AI Foundations and long term, this is going to take a little longer, but NVIDIA Omniverse will run in the CSP's clouds. Okay? So our goal really is to drive architecture, to partner deeply in creating new markets and the new applications that we're doing and provide our customers with the flexibilities to run NVIDIA everywhere, including on-prem.
And so that -- those were the primary reasons for it. And it's worked out incredibly. Our partnership with the 3 CSPs and that we currently have DGX Cloud in and their sales force and marketing teams, their leadership teams is really quite spectacular. It works great.",421

CPU scaling has slowed, yet computing demand is strong and now with generative AI, supercharged. Accelerated computing, a full stack and data center scale approach that NVIDIA pioneered is the best path forward. There's $1 trillion installed in the global data center infrastructure based on the general purpose computing method of the last era. Companies are now racing to deploy accelerated computing for the generative AI era.
Over the next decade, most of the world's data centers will be accelerated. We are significantly increasing our supply to meet their surging demand. Large language models can learn information encoded in many forms. Guided by large language models, generative AI models can generate amazing content with models to fine-tune, guardrail, align to guiding principles and to ground facts, generative AI is emerging from labs and is on its way to industrial applications.
As we scale with cloud and Internet service providers, we are also building platforms for the world's largest enterprises. Whether within one of our CSP partners or on-prem with Dell Helix, whether on a leading enterprise platform like ServiceNow and Adobe or bespoke with NVIDIA AI Foundations, we can help enterprises leverage their domain expertise and data to harness generative AI securely and safely.
We are ramping a wave of products in the coming quarters, including H100, our Grace and Grace Hopper Superchips and our BlueField-3 and Spectrum-4 networking platform. They are all in production. They will help deliver data center scale computing that is also energy efficient and sustainable computing. Join us next week at Computex, and we'll show you what's next. Thank you.",279

Q3 was another record quarter. Revenue of $18.1 billion was up 34% sequentially and up more than 200% year-on-year and well above our outlook of $16 billion. Starting with data center. The continued ramp of the NVIDIA HGX platform based on our Hopper Tensor Core GPU architecture, along with InfiniBand end-to-end networking, drove record revenue of $14.5 billion, up 41% sequentially and up 279% year-on-year.
NVIDIA HGX with InfiniBand together are essentially the reference architecture for AI supercomputers and data center infrastructures. Some of the most exciting generative AI applications are built and run on NVIDIA, including Adobe, Firefly, ChatGPT, Microsoft 365 Copilot, CoAssist, Now Assist with ServiceNow and Zoom AI Companion. Our data center compute revenue quadrupled from last year and networking revenue nearly tripled. Investment in infrastructure for training and inferencing large language models, deep learning recommender systems and generative AI applications is fueling strong broad-based demand for NVIDIA accelerated computing. Inferencing is now a major workload for NVIDIA AI computing. 
Consumer Internet companies and enterprises drove exceptional sequential growth in Q3, comprising approximately half of our data center revenue and outpacing total growth. Companies like Meta are in full production with deep learning recommender systems and also investing in generative AI to help advertisers optimize images and text. Most major consumer Internet companies are racing to ramp up generative AI deployment. The enterprise wave of AI adoption is now beginning. Enterprise software companies such as Adobe, Databricks, Snowflake and ServiceNow are adding AI copilots and assistants to their platforms. And broader enterprises are developing custom AI for vertical industry applications such as Tesla and autonomous driving. 
Cloud service providers drove roughly the other half of our data center revenue in the quarter. Demand was strong from all hyperscale CSPs as well as from a broadening set of GPU-specialized CSPs globally that are rapidly growing to address the new market opportunities in AI.
NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU instances are now generally available in virtually every cloud with instances and high demand. We have significantly increased supply every quarter this year to meet strong demand and expect to continue to do so next year. We will also have a broader and faster product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities.
Toward the end of the quarter, the U.S. government announced a new set of export control regulations for China and other markets, including Vietnam and certain countries in the Middle East. These regulations require licenses for the export of a number of our products including our Hopper and Ampere 100 and 800 series and several others. Our sales to China and other affected destinations derived from products that are now subject to licensing requirements have consistently contributed approximately 20% to 25% of data center revenue over the past few quarters. We expect that our sales to these destinations will decline significantly in the fourth quarter, though we believe they'll be more than offset by strong growth in other regions. 
The U.S. government designed the regulation to allow the U.S. industry to provide data center compute products to markets worldwide, including China, continuing to compete worldwide as the regulations encourage, promote U.S. technology leadership, spurs economic growth and support U.S. jobs. For the highest performance levels, the government requires licenses. For lower performance levels, the government requires a streamlined prior notification process. And for products even lower performance levels, the government does not require any notice at all. Following the government's clear guidelines, we are working to expand our data center product portfolio to offer compliant solutions for each regulatory category, including products for which the U.S. government does not wish to have advanced notice before each shipment.
We are working with some customers in China and the Middle East to pursue licenses from the U.S. government. It is too early to know whether these will be granted for any significant amount of revenue.
Many countries are awakening to the need to invest in sovereign AI infrastructure to support economic growth and industrial innovation. With investments in domestic compute capacity, nations can use their own data to train LLMs and support their local generative AI ecosystems. For example, we are working with India's government and largest tech companies, including Infosys, Reliance and Tata to boost their sovereign AI infrastructure. And French private cloud provider, Scaleway is building a regional AI cloud based on NVIDIA H100, InfiniBand and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software to fuel advancement across France and Europe. National investment in compute capacity is a new economic imperative, and serving the sovereign AI infrastructure market represents a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the next few years.
From a product perspective, the vast majority of revenue in Q3 was driven by the NVIDIA HGX platform based on our Hopper GPU architecture with lower contribution from the prior generation Ampere GPU architecture. The new L40S GPU built for industry standard servers began to ship, supporting training and inference workloads across a variety of customers.
This was also the first revenue quarter of our GH 200 Grace Hopper Secret chip, which combines our ARM-based Grace GPU with a Hopper GPU. Grace and Grace Hopper are ramping into a new multibillion-dollar product line. Grace Hopper instances are now available at GPU-specialized cloud providers and coming soon to Oracle Cloud. Grace Hopper is also getting significant traction with supercomputing customers, initial system shipments to Los Alamos National Lab and the Swiss National Supercomputing Center, took place in the third quarter.  
The U.K. government announced it will build 1 of the world's fastest AI supercomputer called Isambard-AI with almost 5,500 Grace Hopper Superchips. German supercomputing center, Jülich, also announced that it will build its next-generation AI supercomputer with close to 24,000 Grace Hopper Superchips and Quantum-2 InfiniBand, making it the world's most powerful AI supercomputer with over 90 exaflops of AI performance. 
All in, we estimate that the combined AI compute capacity of all the supercomputers built on Grace Hopper across the U.S., Europe and Japan next year will exceed 200 exaflops with more wins to come. Inference is contributing significantly to our data center demand as AI is now in full production for deep learning recommenders, chatbots, copilots and text-to-image generation. And this is just the beginning.
NVIDIA AI offers the best inference performance and versatility and thus, the lower power and cost of ownership. We are also driving a fast cost reduction curve. With the release of NVIDIA TensorRT LLM, we now achieved more than 2x the inference performance or half the cost of inferencing LLMs by NVIDIA GPUs.
We also announced the latest member of the Hopper family, the H200, which will be the first GPU to offer HBM3e, faster, larger memory to further accelerate generative AI and LLMs. It moves inference speed up to another 2x compared to H100 GPUs for running LLMs like Llama 2. Combined, TensorRT LLM and H200 increased performance or reduced cost by 4x in just 1 year without customers changing their stack. This is a benefit of CUDA and our architecture compatibility. Compared to the [ A100 ], H200 delivers an 18x performance increase for infancy models like GPT-3, allowing customers to move to larger models and with no increase in latency. Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud will be among the first CSPs to offer H200-based instances starting next year. 
At last week's Microsoft Ignite, we deepened and expanded our collaboration with Microsoft across the entire stock. We introduced an AI foundry service for the development and tuning of custom generative AI enterprise applications running on Azure. Customers can bring their domain knowledge and proprietary data and we help them build their AI models using our AI expertise and software stack in our DGX Cloud, all with enterprise-grade securities and support. SAP and Amdocs are the first customers of the NVIDIA AI foundry service on Microsoft Azure. In addition, Microsoft will launch new confidential computing instances based on the H100.
The H100 remains the top-performing and most versatile platform for AI training and by a wide margin, as shown in the latest MLPerf industry benchmark results. Our training cluster included more than 10,000 H100 GPUs or 3x more than in June, reflecting very efficient scaling. Efficient scaling is a key requirement in generative AI because LLMs are growing by an order of magnitude every year. Microsoft Azure achieved similar results on the nearly identical cluster, demonstrating the efficiency of NVIDIA AI in public cloud deployments.
Networking now exceeds a $10 billion annualized revenue run rate. Strong growth was driven by exceptional demand for InfiniBand, which grew fivefold year-on-year. InfiniBand is critical to gaining the scale and performance needed for training LLMs.
Microsoft made this very point last week highlighting that Azure uses over 29,000 miles of InfiniBand cabling, enough to circle the globe. We are expanding NVIDIA networking into the Ethernet space. Our new Spectrum-X end-to-end Ethernet offering with technologies, purpose-built for AI will be available in Q1 next year with support from leading OEMs, including Dell, HPE and Lenovo. Spectrum-X can achieve 1.6x higher networking performance for AI communication compared to traditional ethernet offerings.
Let me also provide an update on our software and services offerings, where we are starting to see excellent adoption. We are on track to exit the year at an annualized revenue run rate of $1 billion for recurring software, support and services offerings. We see 2 primary opportunities for growth over the intermediate term with our DGX Cloud service and with our NVIDIA AI Enterprise software. Each reflects the growth of enterprise AI training and enterprise AI inference, respectively.
Our latest DGX Cloud customer announcement was this morning as part of an AI research collaboration with Genentech; the biotechnology pioneer also plans to use our BioNeMo LLM framework to help accelerate and optimize their AI drug discovery platform. We now have enterprise AI partnerships with Adobe, Dropbox, Getty, SAP, ServiceNow, Snowflake and others to come.
Okay. Moving to gaming. Gaming revenue of $2.86 billion was up 15% sequentially and up more than 80% year-on-year, with strong demand in the important back-to-school shopping season, with NVIDIA RTX ray tracing and AI technologies now available at price points as low as $299. We enter the holidays with the best ever lineup for gamers and creators. Gaming has doubled relative to pre-COVID levels, even against the backdrop of lackluster PC market performance. This reflects the significant value we've brought to the gaming ecosystem with innovations like RTX and DLSS.
The number of games and applications supporting these technologies has exploded in that period, driving upgrade and attracting new buyers. The RTX ecosystem continues to grow. There are now over 475 RTX-enabled games and applications. Generative AI is quickly emerging as the new killer app for high-performance PCs, NVIDIA RTX GPUs define the most performant AI PCs and workstations. We just released TensorRT LLM for Windows, which speeds on-device LLM inference up by 4x. With an installed base of over 100 million, NVIDIA RTX is the natural platform for AI application developers. 
Finally, our GeForce NOW cloud gaming service continues to build momentum. Its library of PC games surpassed 1,700 titles, including the launches of Alan Wake 2, Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077, Phantom Liberty and Starfield.
Moving to ProViz. Revenue of $416 million was up 10% sequentially and up 108% year-on-year. NVIDIA RTX is the workstation platform of choice for professional design, engineering and simulation use cases, and AI is emerging as a powerful demand driver. Early applications include inference for AI imaging in health care and edge AI in smart spaces and the public sector. We launched a new line of desktop workstations based on NVIDIA RTX Ada Lovelace generation GPUs and ConnectX, SmartNICs, offering up to 2x the AI processing, ray tracing and graphics performance of the previous generations. These powerful new workstations are optimized for AI workloads such as fine-tuning AI models, training smaller models and running inference locally.
We continue to make progress on Omniverse, our software platform for designing, building and operating 3D virtual worlds. Mercedes-Benz is using Omniverse-powered digital twins to plan, design, build and operate its manufacturing and assembly facilities, helping it increase efficiency and reduce defects. [ Axon ] is also incorporating Omniverse into its manufacturing process, including end-to-end simulation for the entire robotics and automation pipeline, saving time and cost. We announced 2 new Omniverse cloud services for automotive, digitalization available on Microsoft Azure, a virtual factory simulation engine and autonomous vehicle simulation engine.
Moving to automotive. Revenue was $261 million, up 3% sequentially and up 4% year-on-year, primarily driven by continued growth in self-driving platforms based on NVIDIA DRIVE Orin SoC and the ramp of AI cockpit solutions with global OEM customers. We extended our automotive partnership with Foxconn to include NVIDIA DRIVE Thor, our next-generation automotive SoC. Foxconn has become the ODM for EVs. Our partnership provides Foxconn with a standard AV sensor and computing platform for their customers to easily build a state-of-an-art safe and secure software-defined car.
Now we're going to move to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin expanded to 74% and non-GAAP gross margin to 75%, driven by higher data center sales and lower net inventory reserves, including a 1 percentage point benefit from the release of previously reserved inventory related to the Ampere GPU architecture products. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 12% and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 10%, primarily reflecting increased compensation and benefits.
Let me turn to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Total revenue is expected to be $20 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect strong sequential growth to be driven by data center with continued strong demand for both compute and networking. Gaming will likely decline sequentially as it is now more aligned with notebook seasonality. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.5% and 75.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $3.17 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP Other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $200 million, excluding gains and losses from nonaffiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 15%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial information are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.
In closing, let me highlight some upcoming events for the financial community. We will attend the UBS Global Technology Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona on November 28, the Wells Fargo TMT Summit in Rancho Palos Verdes, California on November 29; the Arete Virtual Tech Conference on December 7 and the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco on January 8. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2024 is scheduled for Wednesday, February 21.

And then Jensen, the main question is for you. Where do you think we are in the adoption curve in terms of your shipments into the generative AI market? Because when I just look at the trajectory of your data center, its growth, it will be close to nearly 30% of all the spending in data center next year. So what metrics are you keeping an eye on to inform you that you can continue to grow? Just where are we in the adoption curve of your products into the generative AI market?",106

We had seen historically over the last several quarters that China and some of the other impacted destinations to be about 20% to 25% of our data center revenue. We are expecting in our guidance for that to decrease substantially as we move into Q4.
The export controls will have a negative effect on our China business, and we do not have good visibility into the magnitude of that impact even over the long term. We are, though, working to expand our data center product portfolio to possibly offer new regulation-compliant solutions that do not require a license. These products, they may become available in the next coming months. However, we don't expect their contribution to be material or meaningful as a percentage of the revenue in Q4.",156
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q3 2024 Earnings Call, Nov 21, 2023",2023-11-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,4190.0,2963626.0,108875060.0,Answer,Jensen Huang,,Executives,6,"Generative AI is the largest TAM expansion of software and hardware that we've seen in several decades. The -- at the core of it, what's really exciting is that what was largely a retrieval based computing approach, almost everything that you do is retrieved off of storage somewhere, has been augmented now, added with a generative method, and it's changed almost everything. You could see that text to text, text to image, text to video, text to 3D, text to protein, text to chemicals, these are things that were processed and typed in by humans in the past, and these are now generative approaches.
The way that we access data is changed. It used to be based on explicit queries. It is now based on natural language queries, intention queries, semantic queries. And so we're excited about the work that we're doing with SAP and Dropbox and many others that you're going to hear about.
And 1 of the areas that is really impactful is the software industry, which is about $1 trillion or so has been building tools that are manually used over the last couple of decades. And now there's a whole new segment of software called copilots and assistants. Instead of manually used, these tools will have copilots to help you use it. And so instead of licensing software, we will continue to do that, of course, but we will also hire copilots and assistants to help us use the -- use the software.
We'll connect all of these copilots and assistants into teams of AIs, which is going to be the modern version of software, modern version of enterprise business software. And so the transformation of software and the way that software is done is driving the hardware underneath. And you could see that it's transforming hardware in 2 ways. One is something that's largely independent of generative AI. There's 2 trends. One is related to accelerated computing. General purpose computing is too wasteful of energy and cost. And now that we have much, much better approaches called accelerated computing, you could save an order of magnitude of energy. You could save an order of magnitude of time or you can save an order of magnitude of cost by using acceleration. And so accelerated computing is transitioning, if you will, general purpose computing into this new approach.
And that has been augmented by a new class of data centers. This is the traditional data centers that you were just talking about, where we represent about 1/3 of that. But there's a new class of data centers. And this new class of data centers, unlike the data centers of the past where you have a lot of applications running used by a great many people that are different tenants that are using the same infrastructure and that data center stores a lot of files, these new data essentials are very few applications, if not, one application used by basically one tenant. And it processes data. It trains models, and it generates tokens. It generates AI. And we call these new data centers AI factories.
We're seeing AI factories being built out everywhere in just about every country. And so if you look at the way -- where we are in the expansion, the transition into this new computing approach, the first wave, you saw with large language model start-ups, generative AI start-ups and consumer Internet companies. And we're in the process of ramping that. Meanwhile, while that's being ramped, you see that we're starting to partner with enterprise software companies who would like to build chatbots and copilots and assistants to augment the tools that they have on their platforms.
You're seeing GPU-specialized CSPs cropping up all over the world, and they're dedicated to doing really one thing, which is processing AI. You're seeing sovereign AI infrastructures, people -- countries that now recognize that they have to utilize their own data, keep their own data, keep their own culture, process that data and develop their own AI. You see that in India, several -- about a year ago in Sweden. You're seeing it in Japan. Last week, a big announcement in France.
But the number of sovereign AI clouds that are being built is really quite significant. And my guess is that almost every major region will have -- and surely, every major country will have their own AI cloud. And so I think you're seeing just new developments as the generative AI wave propagates through every industry, every company, every region. And so we're at the beginning of this inflection, this computing transition.",768

I wanted to ask about kind of the networking side of the business. Given the growth rates that you've now cited, I think it's 155% year-over-year and strong growth sequentially, it looks like that business is like almost approaching a $2.5 billion to $3 billion quarterly level. I'm curious of how you see Ethernet involved -- evolving and maybe how you would characterize your differentiation of Spectrum-X relative to the traditional Ethernet stack as we start to think about that becoming part of the networking narrative above and maybe beyond just InfiniBand as we look into next year.",99
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q3 2024 Earnings Call, Nov 21, 2023",2023-11-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,4190.0,2963626.0,108875063.0,Answer,Jensen Huang,,Executives,9,"Yes. Thanks for the question. Our networking business is already at a $10 billion plus run rate. And it's going to get much larger. And as you mentioned, we added a new networking platform to our networking business recently. The vast majority of the dedicated large-scale AI factories standardized on InfiniBand. And the reason for that is not only because of its data rate and not only just the latency, but the way that it moves traffic around the network is really important. The way that you process AI and the -- a multi-tenant hyperscale Ethernet environment, the traffic pattern is just radically different. And with InfiniBand and with software-defined networks, we could do congestion control, adaptive routing, performance isolation and noise isolation, not to mention, of course, the data rate and the low latency that -- and the very low overhead of InfiniBand that's natural part of InfiniBand.
And so InfiniBand is not so much just a network. It's also a computing fabric. We put a lot of software-defined capabilities into the fabric, including computation. We'll do floating point calculations and computation right on the switch and right in the fabric itself. And so that's the reason why that difference in Ethernet versus InfiniBand where InfiniBand versus Ethernet for AI factories is so dramatic.
And the difference is profound, and the reason for that is because you've just invested in a $2 billion infrastructure for AI factories. A 20%, 25%, 30% difference in overall effectiveness, especially as you scale up, is measured in hundreds of millions of dollars of value. And if you were renting that infrastructure over the course of 4 or 5 years, it really, really adds up. And so InfiniBand's value proposition is undeniable for AI factories.
However, as we move AI into enterprise, this is enterprise computing where we'd like to enable every company to be able to build their own custom AIs. We're building custom AIs in our company based on our proprietary data, our proprietary type of skills. For example, the -- recently, we spoke about one of the models that we're creating. It's called ChipNeMo. We're building many others. There'll be tens, hundreds of custom AI models that we create inside our company.
And our company is -- for all of our employee use, that doesn't have to be as high performance as the AI factories we use to train the models. And so we would like the AI to be able to run an Ethernet environment. And so what we've done is we invented this new platform that extends Ethernet. It doesn't replace the Ethernet. It's 100% compliant with Ethernet, and it's optimized for east-west traffic, which is where the computing fabric is. It adds to Ethernet with an end-to-end solution with BlueField as well as our Spectrum switch that allows us to perform some of the capabilities that we have in InfiniBand, not all but some, and we achieve excellent results.
And the way we go to market is we go to market with our large enterprise partners who already offer our computing solution. And so HP, Dell and Lenovo have the NVIDIA AI stack, the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software stack. And now they integrate with BlueField as well as bundle -- take to market their Spectrum switch, and they'll be able to offer enterprise customers all over the world with their vast sales force and vast network of resellers the -- in a fully integrated, if you will, fully optimized at least end-to-end AI solution. And so that's basically bringing AI to Ethernet for the world's enterprise.",598

I wondered if you could talk a little bit more about Grace Hopper and how you see the ability to leverage kind of the microprocessor, how you see that as a TAM expander. And what applications do you see using Grace Hopper versus more traditional H100 applications?",48
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q3 2024 Earnings Call, Nov 21, 2023",2023-11-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,4190.0,2963626.0,108875066.0,Answer,Jensen Huang,,Executives,12,"Yes. Thanks for your question. Grace Hopper is in production in high-volume production now. We're expecting next year just with all of the design wins that we have in high-performance computing and AI, AI infrastructures. We are on a very, very fast ramp with our first data center CPU to a multibillion-dollar product line. This is going to be a very large product line for us.
The capability of Grace Hopper is really quite spectacular. It has the ability to create computing nodes that simultaneously has very fast memory as well as very large memory. In the areas of vector databases or semantic search, what is called RAG, retrieval augmented generation, so that you could have a generative AI model, be able to refer to proprietary data or factful data before it generates a response, that data is quite large.
And you could also have applications or generative models where the context length is very high. You basically stored an entire book into its system memory before you ask the questions. And so the context length could be quite large. This way, the generative models have the ability to still be able to naturally interact with you on one hand; on the other hand, be able to refer to factual data, proprietary data or domain-specific data, your data and be contextually relevant and reduce hallucination. And so the -- that particular use case, for example, is really quite fantastic for Grace Hopper.
It also serves the customers that really care to have a different CPU than x86. Maybe it's European supercomputing centers or European companies who would like to build up their own ARM ecosystem and like to build up a stack or CSPs that have decided that they would like to pivot to ARM because their own custom CPUs are based on ARM. There are a variety of different reasons that drives the success of Grace Hopper, but we're off to just an extraordinary start. This is a home run product.",332

I know there's a few moving parts. I guess, on one hand, the purchase commitments went up a lot again. But on the other hand, the China bands would arguably pull in when you can fill the demand beyond China. So I know we're not even into 2024 yet, and it doesn't sound like, Jensen, you think that next year would be a peak in your data center revenue, but I just wanted to sort of explicitly ask you that. Do you think that data center can grow even into 2025?",106
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q3 2024 Earnings Call, Nov 21, 2023",2023-11-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,4190.0,2963626.0,108875069.0,Answer,Jensen Huang,,Executives,15,"Absolutely believe that data center can grow through 2025. And there are, of course, several reasons for that. We are expanding our supply quite significantly. We have already [ wanted ] the broadest and largest and most capable supply chain in the world.
Remember, people think that the GPU is a chip, but the HGX, H100, the Hopper HGX, has 35,000 parts. It weighs 70 pounds. Eight of the chips are Hopper. The other 35,000 are not. It is -- it has -- even its passive components are incredible, high-voltage parts, high-frequency parts, high-current parts. It is a supercomputer and therefore, the only way to test the supercomputer's with another supercomputer. Even the manufacturing of it is complicated. The testing of it is complicated. The shipping of it is complicated and installation is complicated. And so every aspect of our HGX supply chain is complicated.
And the remarkable team that we have here has really scaled out the supply chain incredibly, not to mention all of our HGXs are connected with NVIDIA networking, and the networking, the transceivers, the NICs, the cables, the switches, the amount of complexity there is just incredible. And so I'm just -- first of all, I'm just super proud of the team for scaling up this incredible supply chain. We are absolutely world class.
But meanwhile, we're adding new customers and new products. So we have new supply. We have new customers, as I was mentioning earlier. Different regions are standing up GPU specialist clouds, sovereign AI clouds coming up from all over the world as people realize that they can't afford to export their country's knowledge, their country's culture for somebody else to then resell AI back to them. They have to -- they should. They have the skills and fairly with us, in combination, we can help them do that, build up their national AI. And so the first thing that they have to do is create their AI cloud, national AI cloud.
You're also seeing us now growing into enterprise. The enterprise market has 2 paths. One path -- or if I could say 3 paths. The first path, of course, is the off-the-shelf AI. And there are -- of course, ChatGPT is a fabulous off-the-shelf AI. There'll be others. There's also a proprietary AI because these software companies like ServiceNow and SAP, and there are many, many others, can't afford to have their company's intelligence be outsourced to somebody else. And they are about building tools. And on top of their tools, they should build custom and proprietary and domain-specific copilots and assistants that they can then rent to their customer base.
This is -- they're sitting on a gold mine. Almost every major tools company in the world is sitting on gold mine, and they recognize that. They have to go build their own custom AIs. We have a new service called an AI Foundry, where we leverage NVIDIA's capabilities to be able to serve them in that.
And then the next one is enterprises building their own custom AIs, their own custom chatbots, their own custom RAGs. And this capability is spreading all over the world. And the way that we're going to serve that marketplace is with the entire stacks of systems, which includes our compute, our networking and our switches running our software stack called NVIDIA AI Enterprise, taking it through our market partners, HP, Dell and Lenovo, so on and so forth.
And so we're just -- we're seeing the waves of generative AI starting from the start-ups and CSPs moving to consumer Internet companies, moving to enterprise software platforms, moving to enterprise companies. And then -- and ultimately, one of the areas that you guys have seen us spend a lot of energy on has to do with industrial generative AI. This is where NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse comes together. And that is a really, really exciting work. And so I think the -- we're at the beginning of a, basically across the board, industrial transition to generative AI, to accelerated computing. This is going to affect every company, every industry, every country.",689

Colette, you mentioned that you'll be introducing regulation-compliant products over the next couple of months, yet the contribution to Q4 revenue should be relatively limited. Is that a timing issue? And could it be a source of reacceleration in growth for data center in April and beyond? Or are the price points such that the contribution to revenue going forward should be relatively limited?
And then the question for Jensen, the AI foundry service announcement from last week, I just wanted to ask about that and hopefully have you expand on it. How is the monetization model going to work? Is it primarily services and software revenue? How should we think about the long-term opportunity set? And is this going to be exclusive to Microsoft?

It's a significant process to both design and develop these new products. As we discussed, we're going to make sure that we are in full discussions with the U.S. government of our intent in these products as well. Given our state about where we are in the quarter, we're already several weeks into the quarter. That's just going to take some time for us to go through and discussing with our customers their needs and desires of these 2 products that we have.
Moving forward, whether that's medium term or long term, it's just hard to say both the ideas of what we can produce with the U.S. government and with the interest of our China customers. So we stay still focused on finding that right balance for our China customers, but it's hard to say at this time.",156

There is a glaring opportunity in the world for AI foundry, and it makes so much sense. First, every company has its core intelligence. It makes up our company, our data, our domain expertise. In the case of many companies, we create tools. And most of the software companies in the world are tool platforms. And those tools are used by people today. And in the future, it's going to be used by people augmented with a whole bunch of AIs that we hire.
And these AI platforms just got to go across the world, and you'll see. And we've already announced a few, SAP, ServiceNow, Dropbox, Getty. Many others are coming. And the reason for that is because they have their own proprietary AI. They want their own proprietary AI. They can't afford to outsource their intelligence and hand out their data and hand out their flywheel for other companies to build the AI for them. And so they come to us.
We have several things that are really essential in the foundry just as TSMC is a foundry. You have to have AI technology. And as you know, we have just an incredible depth of AI capability, AI technology capability. And then second, you have to have the best practice, known practice, the skills of processing data through the invention of AI models to create AIs that are guardrails, fine-tuned, so on and so forth -- that are safe, so on and so forth.
And the third thing is you need factories, and that's what DGX Cloud is. Our AI models are called AI Foundations. Our process, if you will, our CAD system for creating AIs are called NeMo, and they run on NVIDIA's factories we call DGX Cloud. Our monetization model is that, with each one of our partners, they rent a sandbox on DGX Cloud where we work together. They bring their data. They bring their domain expertise. We'd bring our researchers and engineers. We help them build their custom AI. We help them make that custom AI incredible.
Then that customer AI becomes theirs, and they deploy it on a run time that is enterprise grade, enterprise optimized or outperformance optimized, runs across everything NVIDIA. We have a giant installed base in the cloud on-prem anywhere. And it's secure, securely patched, constantly patched and optimized and supported. And we call that NVIDIA AI Enterprise. 
NVIDIA AI Enterprise is $4,500 per GP per year. That's our business model. Our business model is basically a license. Our customers then, with that basic license, can build their monetization model on top of. In a lot of ways, we're wholesale. They become retail. They could have a per -- they could have subscription license based. They could per instance or they could do per usage. There's a lot of different ways that they could take to create their own business model, but ours is basically like a software license, like an operating system. And so our business model is help you create your custom models. You run those custom models on NVIDIA AI Enterprise. And it's off to a great start. NVIDIA AI Enterprise is going to be a very large business for us.",540

And I guess along those lines, can you give us a feeling for where your lead times are right now in data center? And does the China redirection such as this, is it lowering those lead times because you've got parts that are sort of immediately available to ship?",84

Stacy, let me see if I can help you understand. Yes, they are still situations where we are working on both improving our supply each and every quarter. We've done a really solid job of ramping every quarter, which has defined our revenue.
But with the absence of China, for our outlook for Q4, sure, there could have been some things that we are not supply constrained that we could have sold to China but we no longer can. So could our guidance have been a little higher in our Q4? Yes. We are still working on improving our supply and plan on continuing and growing all throughout next year as well towards that.",115

Jensen, I had a two-part question for you, and it comes off of sort of one premise. And the premise is I still get a lot of questions from investors thinking about AI training as being NVIDIA's dominant domain and that somehow as inference, even large model inference takes more and more of the TAM that the market will become more competitive. You'll be less differentiated, et cetera, et cetera. So I guess the 2 parts of the question are, number one, maybe you could spend a little bit of time talking about the evolution of the inference workload as we move to LLMs and how your company is positioned for that rather than smaller model inference. And second, up until a month or 2 ago, I never really got any questions at all about the data processing piece of the AI workload. So the pieces of manipulating the data before training, between training and inference, after inference, and I think that's a large part of the workload now, maybe you could talk about how CUDA is enabling acceleration of those pieces of the workload.",190
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q3 2024 Earnings Call, Nov 21, 2023",2023-11-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,4190.0,2963626.0,108875079.0,Answer,Jensen Huang,,Executives,25,"Sure. Inference, inference is complicated. It's actually incredibly complicated. If you -- we, this quarter, announced one of the most exciting new engines, optimizing compilers called TensorRT LLM. The reception has been incredible. You go to GitHub. It's been downloaded a ton, a whole lot of stars integrated into stacks and frameworks all over the world almost instantaneously. And there are several reasons for that, obviously. 
We could create TensorRT LLM because CUDA's programmable. If CUDA and our GPUs were not so programmable, it would really be hard for us to improve software stacks at the pace that we do. TensorRT LLM on the same GPU, without anybody touching anything, improves the performance by a factor of 2.
And then on top of that, of course, the pace of our innovation is so high. H200 increases it by another factor of 2. And so our inference performance, another way of saying inference cost, just reduced by a factor of 4 within about a year's time. And so that's really, really hard to keep up with.
Now the reason why everybody likes our inference engine is because our installed base. And we've been dedicated to our installed base for 20 years, 20-plus years. We have an installed base that is not only largest in every single cloud. It's in every -- available from every enterprise system maker. It's used by companies of just about every industry. And any time you see an NVIDIA GPU, it runs our stack. It's architecturally compatible. It's something we've been dedicated to for a very long time. We're very disciplined about it. We make it, if you will -- architecture compatibility is job one.
And that has conveyed to the world the certainty of our platform stability. NVIDIA's platform stability, certainty is the reason why everybody builds on us first and the reason why everybody optimizes on us first. All the engineering and all the work that you do, all the invention of technologies that you build on top of NVIDIA accrues to the -- and benefits everybody that uses our GPUs, and we have such a large installed base large -- millions and millions of GPUs in cloud, 100 million GPUs from people's PCs, just about every workstation in the world, and they're all architecturally compatible.
And so if you're an inference platform and you're deploying an inference application, you are basically an application provider. And as a software application provider, you're looking for a large installed base.
Data processing, before you could train a model, you have to curate the data. You have to dedupe the data. Maybe you have to augment the data with synthetic data. So you process the -- clean the data, align the data, normalize the data. All of that data is measured not in bytes and megabytes. It's measured in terabytes and petabytes. And the amount of data processing that you do before data engineering, before that you do training is quite significant. It could represent 30%, 40%, 50% of the amount of work that you ultimately do. In what you -- in ultimately creating a data-driven machine learning service. And so data processing is just a massive part.
We accelerate Spark. We accelerate Python. One of the coolest things that we just did that is called cuDF pandas, without one line of code, pandas, which is the single most successful data science framework in the world, Pandas now is accelerated by NVIDIA CUDA and just out of the box without a line of code. And so the acceleration is really quite terrific, and people are just incredibly excited about. And pandas was designed for one purpose and one purpose only, really data processing for data science. And so NVIDIA CUDA gives you all of that.",627

The team recently announced a more aggressive new product cadence and data center from 2 years to now every year with higher levels of segmentation, training, optimization, inferencing, CPU, GPU, DPU networking. How do we think about your R&D OpEx growth that looks to support a more aggressive and expanding forward road map? But more importantly, what is the team doing to manage and drive execution through all of this complexity?",114
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q3 2024 Earnings Call, Nov 21, 2023",2023-11-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,4190.0,2963626.0,108875082.0,Answer,Jensen Huang,,Executives,28,"Gosh, boy, that's just really excellent. You just wrote NVIDIA's business plan. And you described our strategy. First of all, there is a fundamental reason why we accelerate our execution. And the reason for that is because it fundamentally drives down cost. When -- the combination of TensorRT LLM and H200 reduced the cost for our customers for large model inference by a factor of 4, and so that includes, of course, our speeds and feeds, but mostly, it's because of our software. Mostly, the software benefits because of the architecture. And so we want to accelerate our road map for that reason.
The second reason is to expand the reach of generative AI. The world's number of data center configurations, this is kind of the amazing thing. NVIDIA is in every cloud, but not one cloud is the same. NVIDIA is working with every single cloud service provider and not one of their networking control plane security posture is the same. Everybody's platform is different, and yet we're integrated into all of their stacks, all of their data centers, and we work incredibly well with all of them.
And not to mention, we then take the whole thing, and we create AI factories that are stand-alone. We take our platform. We can put them into supercomputers. We can put them into enterprise. Bringing AI to enterprise is something -- generative AI to enterprise is something nobody has ever done before. And we're right now in the process of going to market with all of that.
And so the complexity includes, of course, all the technologies and segments and the pace. It includes the fact that we are architecturally compatible across every single one of those. It includes all of the domain-specific libraries that we create. The reason why you -- every computer company without thinking can integrate NVIDIA into their road map and take it to market and the reason for that is because there's market demand for it. There's market demand in health care. There's market demand in manufacturing. There's market demand, and of course, in AI, in financial services and supercomputing and quantum computing. The list of markets and segments that we have domain-specific libraries is incredibly broad.
And then finally, now we have an end-to-end solution for data centers. InfiniBand network -- InfiniBand networking, Ethernet networking, x86, ARM, just about every permutation combination of solutions, technology solutions and software stacks provided. And that translates to having the largest number of ecosystem software developers, the largest ecosystem of system makers, the largest and broadest distribution partnership network, and ultimately, the greatest reach. And that takes -- surely, that takes a lot of energy.
But the thing that really holds it together, and this is a great decision that we made decades ago, which is everything is architecturally compatible. When you -- when we develop a domain-specific language that runs on one GPU, it runs on every GPU. When we optimize TensorRT for the cloud, we optimized it for enterprise. When we do something that brings in a new feature, a new library, a new feature or a new developer, they instantly get the benefit of all of our reach.
And so that discipline, that architecture compatible discipline that has lasted more than a couple of decades now is one of the reasons why NVIDIA is still really, really efficient. I mean we're 28,000 people large and serving just about every single company, every single industry, every single market around the world.",584

Large language model start-ups, consumer Internet companies and global cloud service providers are the first movers. The next waves are starting to build. Nations and regional CSPs are building AI clouds to serve local demand. Enterprise software companies like Adobe and Dropbox, SAP and ServiceNow are adding AI copilots and assistants to their platforms. And enterprises in the world's largest industries are creating custom AIs to automate and boost productivity.
The generative AI era is in full steam and has created the need for a new type of data center and AI factory, optimized for refining data and training and inference and generating AI. AI factory workloads are different and incremental to legacy data center workloads supporting IT tasks. AI factories run copilots and AI assistants, which are significant software TAM expansion and are driving significant new investment, expanding the $1 trillion traditional data center infrastructure installed base, empowering the AI industrial revolution.
NVIDIA H100 HGX with InfiniBand and the NVIDIA AI software stack define an AI factory today. As we expand our supply chain to meet the world's demand, we are also building new growth drivers for the next wave of AI. We highlighted 3 elements to our new growth strategy that are hitting their stride, CPU, networking and software and services.
Grace is NVIDIA's first data center CPU. Grace and Grace Hopper are in full production and ramping into a new multibillion-dollar product line next year. Irrespective of the CPU choice, we can help customers build an AI factory. NVIDIA networking now exceeds a $10 billion annualized revenue run rate. InfiniBand grew fivefold year-over-year and is positioned for excellent growth ahead as the networking of AI factories.
Enterprises are also racing to adopt AI, and Ethernet is the standard networking. This week, we announced an Ethernet for AI platform for enterprises. NVIDIA Spectrum-X is an end-to-end solution of BlueField SuperNIC, Spectrum-4 Ethernet switch and software that boosts Ethernet performance by up to 1.6x for AI workloads. Dell, HPE and Lenovo have joined us to bring a full generative AI solution of NVIDIA AI computing, networking and software to the world's enterprises.
NVIDIA software and services is on track to exit the year at an annualized run rate of $1 billion. Enterprise software platforms like ServiceNow and SAP need to build and operate proprietary AI. Enterprises need to build and deploy custom AI copilots. We have the AI technology, expertise and scale to help customers build custom models. With their proprietary data on NVIDIA DGX Cloud and deploy the AI applications on enterprise-grade NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA is essentially an AI foundry. NVIDIA's GPUs, CPUs, networking, AI foundry services and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software are all growth engines in full throttle. 
Thanks for joining us today. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.",486

32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Aug 23, 2023",2023-08-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3881.0,3080814.0,111696773.0,Presenter Speech,Colette Kress,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Simona. We had an exceptional quarter. Record Q2 revenue of $13.51 billion was up 88% sequentially and up 101% year-on-year and above our outlook of $11 billion. Let me first start with Data Center. Record revenue of $10.32 billion was up 141% sequentially and up 171% year-on-year. 
Data Center compute revenue nearly tripled year-on-year, driven primarily by accelerating demand from cloud service providers and large consumer Internet companies for our HGX platform, the engine of generative AI and large language models. Major companies, including AWS, Google Cloud, Meta, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud, as well as a growing number of GPU cloud providers, are deploying, in volume, HGX systems based on our Hopper and Ampere architecture Tensor Core GPUs. 
Networking revenue almost doubled year-on-year, driven by our end-to-end InfiniBand networking platform, the gold standard for AI. There is tremendous demand for NVIDIA accelerated computing and AI platforms. Our supply partners have been exceptional in ramping capacity to support our needs. 
Our data center supply chain, including HGX, with 35,000 parts and highly complex networking, has been built up over the past decade. We have also developed and qualified additional capacity and suppliers for key steps in the manufacturing process, such as CoWoS packaging. We expect supply to increase each quarter through next year. 
By geography, Data Center growth was strongest in the U.S., as customers direct their capital investments to AI and accelerated computing. China demand was within the historical range of 20% to 25% of our Data Center revenue, including compute and networking solutions. At this time, let me take a moment to address recent reports on the potential for increased regulations on our exports to China. 
We believe the current regulation is achieving the intended results. Given the strength of demand for our products worldwide, we do not anticipate that additional export restrictions on our Data Center GPUs, if adopted, would have an immediate material impact to our financial results. However, over the long term, restrictions prohibiting the sale of our Data Center GPUs to China, if implemented, will result in a permanent loss of an opportunity for the U.S. industry to compete and lead in one of the world's largest markets. 
Our cloud service providers drove exceptionally strong demand for HGX systems in the quarter as they undertake a generational transition to upgrade their data center infrastructure for the new era of accelerated computing and AI. The NVIDIA HGX platform is culminating of nearly 2 decades of full-stack innovation across silicon, systems, interconnects, networking, software and algorithms. Instances powered by the NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs are now generally available at AWS, Microsoft Azure and several GPU cloud providers, with others on the way shortly. 
Consumer Internet companies also drove the very strong demand. Their investments in data center infrastructure purpose-built for AI are already generating significant returns. For example, Meta recently highlighted that since launching Reels, AI recommendations have driven a more than 24% increase in time spent on Instagram. 
Enterprises are also racing to deploy generative AI, driving strong consumption of NVIDIA-powered instances in the cloud as well as demand for on-premise infrastructure. Whether we serve customers in the cloud or on-prem through partners or direct, their applications can run seamlessly on NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, with access to our acceleration libraries, pretrained models and APIs. 
We announced a partnership with Snowflake to provide enterprises with accelerated clouds to create customized generative AI applications using their own proprietary data, all securely within the Snowflake Data Cloud. With the NVIDIA NeMo platform for developing large language models, enterprises will be able to make custom LLMs for advanced AI services, including chatbots, search and summarization, right from the Snowflake Data Cloud. 
Virtually every industry can benefit from generative AI. For example, AI copilots, such as those just announced by Microsoft, can boost the productivity of over 1 billion office workers and tens of millions of software engineers. Billions of professionals in legal services, sales, customer support and education will be available to leverage AI systems trained in their field. AI copilots and assistants are set to create new multi-hundred billion dollar market opportunities for our customers. 
We are seeing some of the earliest applications of generative AI in marketing, media and entertainment. WPP, the world's largest marketing and communication services organization, is developing a content engine using NVIDIA Omniverse to enable artists and designers to integrate generative AI into 3D content creation. 
WPP designers can create images from text prompts while responsibly trained generative AI tools and content from NVIDIA partners such as Adobe and Getty Images using NVIDIA Picasso, a foundry for custom generative AI models for visual design. Visual content provider Shutterstock is also using NVIDIA Picasso to build tools and services that enable users to create 3D scene background with the help of generative AI. 
We've partnered with ServiceNow and Accenture to launch the AI Lighthouse program, fast-tracking the development of enterprise AI capabilities. AI Lighthouse unites the ServiceNow enterprise automation platform and engine with NVIDIA-accelerated computing and with Accenture's consulting and deployment services. 
We are collaborating also with Hugging Face to simplify the creation of new and custom AI models for enterprises. Hugging Face will offer a new service for enterprises to train and tune advanced AI models, powered by NVIDIA DGX cloud. 
And just yesterday, VMware and NVIDIA announced a major new enterprise offering called VMware Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA, a fully integrated platform featuring AI software and accelerated computing from NVIDIA with multi-cloud software for enterprises running VMware. VMware's hundreds of thousands of enterprise customers will have access to the infrastructure, AI and cloud management software needed to customize models and run generative AI applications such as intelligent chatbots, assistants, search and summarization. 
We also announced new NVIDIA AI Enterprise-ready servers featuring the new NVIDIA L40S GPU built for the industry-standard data center server ecosystem and BlueField-3 DPU data center infrastructure processor. L40S is not limited by CoWoS supply and is shipping to the world's leading server system makers. L40S is a universal data center processor designed for high-volume data center scaling out to accelerate the most compute-intensive applications, including AI training and inferencing through the designing, visualization, video processing and NVIDIA Omniverse industrial digitalization. 
NVIDIA AI Enterprise-ready servers are fully optimized for VMware Cloud Foundation and Private AI Foundation. Nearly 100 configurations of NVIDIA AI Enterprise-ready servers will soon be available from the world's leading enterprise IT computing companies, including Dell, HPE and Lenovo. 
The GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, which combines our ARM-based Grace CPU with Hopper GPU, entered full production and will be available this quarter in OEM servers. It is also shipping to multiple supercomputing customers, including Los Alamos National Labs and the Swiss National Computing Center. 
And NVIDIA and SoftBank are collaborating on a platform based on GH200 for generative AI and 5G/6G applications. The second generation version of our Grace Hopper Superchip with the latest HBM3e memory will be available in Q2 of calendar 2024. 
We announced the DGX GH200, a new class of large-memory AI supercomputer for giant AI language model recommendator systems and data analytics. This is the first use of the new NVIDIA NVLink Switch System, enabling all of its 256 Grace Hopper Superchips to work together as 1, a huge jump compared to our prior generation connecting just 8 GPUs over NVLink. The DGX GH200 systems are expected to be available by the end of the year. Google Cloud, Meta and Microsoft among the first to gain access. 
Strong networking growth was driven primarily by InfiniBand infrastructure to connect HGX GPU systems. Thanks to its end-to-end optimization and in-network computing capabilities, InfiniBand delivers more than double the performance of traditional Ethernet for AI. For billions of dollar AI infrastructures, the value from the increased throughput of InfiniBand is worth hundreds of [indiscernible] and pays for the network. In addition, only InfiniBand can scale to hundreds of thousands of GPUs. It is the network of choice for leading AI practitioners. 
For Ethernet-based cloud data centers that seek to optimize their AI performance, we announced NVIDIA Spectrum-X, an accelerated networking platform designed to optimize Ethernet for AI workloads. Spectrum-X couples the Spectrum or Ethernet switch with the BlueField-3 DPU, achieving 1.5x better overall AI performance and power efficiency versus traditional Ethernet. BlueField-3 DPU is a major success. It is in qualification with major OEMs and ramping across multiple CSPs and consumer internet companies. 
Now moving to Gaming. Gaming revenue of $2.49 billion was up 11% sequentially and 22% year-on-year. Growth was fueled by GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs for laptops and desktops. End customer demand was solid and consistent with seasonality. We believe global end demand has returned to growth after last year's slowdown. We have a large upgrade opportunity ahead of us. Just 47% of our installed base have upgraded to RTX and about 20% have a GPU with an RTX 3060 or higher performance. 
Laptop GPUs posted strong growth in the key back-to-school season, led by RTX 4060 GPUs. NVIDIA's GPU-powered laptops have gained in popularity, and their shipments are now outpacing desktop GPUs from several regions around the world. This is likely to shift the [ seasonality ] of our overall gaming revenue a bit, with Q2 and Q3 as the stronger quarters of the year, reflecting the back-to-school and holiday build schedules for laptops. 
In desktop, we launched the GeForce RTX 4060 and the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti GPUs, bringing the Ada Lovelace Architecture down to price points as low as $299. The ecosystem of RTX and DLSS games continue to expand. 35 new games added to DLSS support, including blockbusters such as Diablo IV and Baldur's Gate 3. There's now over 330 RTX-accelerated games and apps. 
We are bringing generative AI to Gaming. At Computex, we announced NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine, or ACE, for games, a custom AI model and foundry service. Developers can use this service to bring intelligence to nonplayer characters. And it harnesses a number of NVIDIA Omniverse and AI technologies, including NeMo, Riva and Audio2Face. 
Now moving to Professional Visualization. Revenue of $375 million was up 28% sequentially and down 24% year-on-year. The Ada architecture ramp drove strong growth in Q2, rolling out initially in laptop workstations with a refresh of desktop workstations coming in Q3. These will include the powerful new RTX systems with up to 4 NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPUs, providing more than 5,800 teraflops of AI performance and 192 gigabytes of GPU memory. 
They can be configured with NVIDIA AI Enterprise or NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise. We also announced 3 new desktop workstation GPUs based on the Ada generation -- the NVIDIA RTX 5000, 4500 and 4000 -- offering up to 2x the RT core throughput and up to 2x faster AR training performance compared to the previous generation. 
In addition to traditional workloads such as 3D design and content creation, new workloads in generative AI, large language model development and data science are expanding the opportunity in pro visualization for our RTX technology. One of the key themes in Jensen's keynote at SIGGRAPH  earlier this month was the conversion of graphics and AI. 
This is where NVIDIA Omniverse is positioned. Omniverse is OpenUSD's native platform. OpenUSD is a universal interchange that is quickly becoming the standard for the 3D world, much like HTML is the universal language for the 2D [indiscernible]. Together, Adobe, Apple, Autodesk, Pixar and NVIDIA form the Alliance for OpenUSD. Our mission is to accelerate OpenUSD's development and adoption. We announced new and upcoming Omniverse Cloud APIs, including RunUSD and ChatUSD to bring generative AI to open the workload. 
Moving to Automotive. Revenue was $253 million, down 15% sequentially and up 15% year-on-year. Solid year-on-year growth was driven by the ramp of self-driving platforms based on NVIDIA DRIVE [ or ] SoCs with a number of new energy vehicle makers. The sequential decline reflects lower overall automotive demand, particularly in China. 
We announced a partnership with MediaTek to bring drivers and passengers new experiences inside the car. MediaTek will develop automotive SoCs and integrate a new product line of NVIDIA GPU chiplets. The partnership covers a wide range of vehicle segments from luxury to entry level. 
Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins expanded to 70.1% and non-GAAP gross margin to 71.2%, driven by higher Data Center sales. Our Data Center products include a significant amount of software and complexity, which is also helping drive our gross margin. 
Sequential GAAP operating expenses were up 6% and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 5%, primarily reflecting increased compensation and benefits. We returned approximately $3.4 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. Our Board of Directors has just approved an additional $25 billion in stock repurchases to add to our remaining $4 billion of authorization as of the end of Q2.
Let me turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Demand for our Data Center platform where AI is tremendous and broad-based across industries and customers. Our demand visibility extends into next year. Our supply over the next several quarters will continue to ramp as we lower cycle times and work with our supply partners to add capacity. 
Additionally, the new L40S GPU will help address the growing demand for many types of workloads from cloud to enterprise. For Q3, total revenue is expected to be $16 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect sequential growth to be driven largely by Data Center, with Gaming and Pro Vis also contributing.
GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 71.5% and 72.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.95 billion and $2 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $100 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 14.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.
In closing, let me highlight some upcoming events for the financial community. We will attend the Jefferies Tech Summit on August 30 in Chicago, the Goldman Sachs Conference on September 5 in San Francisco, the Evercore Semiconductor Conference on September 6 as well as the Citi Tech Conference on September 7, both in New York, and BofA Virtual AI Conference on September 11. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our third quarter of fiscal 2024 is scheduled for Tuesday, November 21. 
Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Could you please poll for questions for us? Thank you.",2448

Jensen, I wanted to ask a question of you regarding the really quickly emerging application of large model inference. So I think it's pretty well understood by the majority of investors that you guys have very much a lockdown share of the training market. A lot of the smaller market -- smaller model inference workloads have been done on ASICs or CPUs in the past. 
And with many of these GPT and other really large models, there's this new workload that's accelerating super-duper quickly on large model inference. And I think your Grace Hopper Superchip products and others are pretty well aligned for that. But could you maybe talk to us about how you're seeing the inference market segment between small model inference and large model inference, and how your product portfolio is positioned for that?",139
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Aug 23, 2023",2023-08-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3881.0,3080814.0,111696776.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,5,"Yes, thanks a lot. So let's take a quick step back. These large language models are fairly -- are pretty phenomenal. It does several things, of course. It has the ability to understand unstructured language. But at its core, what it has learned is the structure of human language. And it has encoded -- or within it -- compressed within it a large amount of human knowledge that it has learned by the corpuses that it's studied.
What happens is you create these large language models and you create as large as you can, and then you derive from it smaller versions of the model, essentially teacher-student models. It's a process called distillation. And so when you see these smaller models, it's very likely the case that they were derived from or distilled from or learned from larger models, just as you have professors and teachers and students and so on and so forth. 
And you're going to see this going forward. And so you start from a very large model, and it has a large amount of generality and generalization and what's called zero-shot capability. And so for a lot of applications and questions or skills that you haven't trained it specifically on, these large language models miraculously has the capability to perform them. That's what makes it so magical.
On the other hand, you would like to have these capabilities in all kinds of computing devices, and so what you do is you distill them down. These smaller models might have excellent capabilities on a particular skill, but they don't generalize as well. They don't have what is called as good zero-shot capabilities. And so they all have their own unique capabilities, but you start from very large models.",291

Colette, if you could please clarify how much incremental supply do you expect to come online in the next year? Do you think it's up 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%? So just any sense of how much supply, because you said it's growing every quarter.
And then, Jensen, the question for you is when we look at the overall hyperscaler spending, that pie is not really growing that much. So what is giving you the confidence that they can continue to carve out more of that pie for generative AI? Just give us your sense of how sustainable is this demand as we look over the next 1 to 2 years? 
So if I take your implied Q3 outlook of Data Center, $12 billion, $13 billion, what does that say about how many servers are already AI accelerated? Where is that going? So just give us some confidence that the growth that you are seeing is sustainable into the next 1 to 2 years.",171

Yes, we do expect to continue increasing ramping our supply over the next quarters as well as into next fiscal year. In terms of percent, it's not something that we have here. It is a work across so many different suppliers, so many different parts, of building an HGX and many of our other new products that are coming to market. But we are very pleased with both the support that we have with our suppliers and the long time that we have spent with them improving the supply.",97

And that $1 trillion of data centers is in the process of transitioning into accelerated computing and generative AI. We're seeing 2 simultaneous platform shifts at the same time. 
One is accelerated computing. And the reason for that is because it's the most cost-effective, most energy-effective and the most performant way of doing computing now. So what you're seeing -- and then all of a sudden, enabled by generative AI -- enabled by accelerated computing, generative AI came along. 
And this incredible application now gives everyone 2 reasons to transition, to do a platform shift from general purpose computing, the classical way of doing computing, to this new way of doing computing, accelerated computing. It's about $1 trillion worth of data centers, call it, $0.25 trillion of capital spend each year. 
You're seeing the data centers around the world are taking that capital spend and focusing it on the 2 most important trends of computing today, accelerated computing and generative AI. And so I think this is not a near-term thing. This is a long-term industry transition, and we're seeing these 2 platform shifts happening at the same time.",212

What I'm really trying to get at is how much is like pricing or content or however you want to define that versus units actually driving the growth going forward. Can you give us any color around that?",71
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Aug 23, 2023",2023-08-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3881.0,3080814.0,111696783.0,Answer,Colette Kress,,Executives,12,"Sure, Stacy. Let me help. Within the quarter, our HGX systems were a very significant part of our Data Center as well as our Data Center growth that we had seen. Those systems include our HGX of our Hopper architecture but also our Ampere architecture. Yes, we are still selling both of these architectures in the market. 
Now when you think about that, what does that mean from both the systems as a unit, of course, is growing quite substantially. And that is driving in terms of the revenue increases. So both of these things are the drivers of the revenue inside Data Center.
Our DGXs are always a portion of additional systems that we will sell. Those are great opportunities for enterprise customers and many other different types of customers that we're seeing, even in our consumer Internet companies. 
The importance there is also coming together with software that we sell with our DGXs, but that's a portion of our sales that we're doing. The rest of the GPUs, we have new GPUs coming to market that we talked about, the L40S, and they will add continued growth going forward. But again, the largest driver of our revenue within this last quarter was definitely the HGX systems.",208
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Aug 23, 2023",2023-08-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3881.0,3080814.0,111696784.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,13,"And Stacy, if I could just add something. You say it's H100, and I know you know what your mental image in your mind. But the H100 is 35,000 parts, 70 pounds, nearly 1 trillion transistors in combination. It takes a robot to build -- well, many robots to build, because it's 70 pounds to lift. And it takes a supercomputer to test a supercomputer. 
And so these things are technology marvels and the manufacturing of them is really intensive. And so I think we call it H100 as if it's a chip that comes off of a fab, but H100s go out really as HGXs sent to the world's hyperscalers and they're really, really quite large system components, if you will.",122

Jensen, it seems like a key part of the success -- your success in the market is delivering the software ecosystem along with the chip and the hardware platform. And I had a 2-part question on this. I was wondering if you could just help us understand the evolution of your software ecosystem, the critical elements. And is there a way to quantify your lead on this dimension, like how many person years you've invested in building it? And then part 2, I was wondering if you would care to share with us your view on the -- what percentage of the value of the NVIDIA platform is hardware differentiation versus software differentiation?",117
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Aug 23, 2023",2023-08-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3881.0,3080814.0,111696787.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,16,"Yes, Mark, I really appreciate the question. Let me see if I could use some metrics. So we have a runtime called NVIDIA AI Enterprise. This is one part of our software stack. And this is, if you will, the runtime that just about every company uses for the end-to-end of machine learning, from data processing, the training of any model that you like to do on any framework you like to do, the inference and the deployment, the scaling it out into a data center. It could be a scale-out for a hyperscale data center. It could be a scale-out for enterprise data center, for example, on VMware.
You can do this on any of our GPUs. We have hundreds of millions of GPUs in the field and millions of GPUs in the cloud, in just about every single cloud. And it runs in a single GPU configuration as well as multi-GPU per compute or multinode. It also has multiple sessions or multiple computing instances per GPU. 
So from multiple instances per GPU to multiple GPUs, multiple nodes to entire data center scale. So this run time called NVIDIA AI Enterprise has something like 4,500 software packages, software libraries, and has something like 10,000 dependencies among each other. And that run time is, as I mentioned, continuously updated and optimized for our installed base, for our stack. 
And that's just one example of what it would take to get accelerated computing to work. The number of code combinations and type of application combinations is really quite insane. And it's taken us 2 decades to get here. But what I would characterize as probably our -- the elements of our company, if you will, are several. 
I would say, number 1 is architecture. The flexibility, the versatility and the performance of our architecture makes it possible for us to do all the things that I just said, from data processing to training to inference, for preprocessing of the data before you do the inference, to the post processing of the data, tokenizing of languages so that you could then train with it. The amount of -- the workflow is much more intense than just training or inference. 
But anyways, that's where we're focused, and it's fine. But when people actually use these computing systems, it's quite -- requires a lot of applications. And so the combination of our architecture makes it possible for us to deliver the lowest cost of ownership. And the reason for that is because we accelerate so many different things.
The second characteristic of our company is the installed base. You have to ask yourself, why is it that all the software developers come to our platform? And the reason for that is because software developers seek a large installed base so that they can reach the largest number of end users, so that they could build a business or get a return on the investments that they make.
And then the third characteristic is reach. We're in the cloud today, both for public cloud, public-facing cloud, because we have so many customers that use it -- so many developers and customers that use our platform. CSPs are delighted to put it up in the cloud. They use it for internal consumption to develop and train and to operate recommender systems or search or data processing engines and whatnot, all the way to training and inference. 
And so we're in the cloud, we're in enterprise. Yesterday, we had a very big announcement. It's really worthwhile to take a look at that. VMware is the operating system of the world's enterprise. And we've been working together for several years now, and we're going to bring together -- together, we're going to bring generative AI to the world's enterprises all the way out to the edge. 
And so reach is another reason. And because of reach, all of the world's system makers are anxious to put NVIDIA's platform in their systems. And so we have a very broad distribution from all of the world's OEMs and ODMs and so on and so forth because of our reach. 
And then lastly, because of our scale and velocity, we're able to sustain this really complex stack of software and hardware, networking and compute and across all of these different usage models and different computing environments. And we're able to do all this while accelerating the velocity of our engineering.
It seems like we're introducing a new architecture every 2 years. Now we're introducing a new architecture, a new product just about every 6 months. And so these properties make it possible for the ecosystem to build their company and their business on top of us. And so those, in combination, makes us special.",793

32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Aug 23, 2023",2023-08-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3881.0,3080814.0,111696790.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,19,"Yes. Atif, let me take that for you. The L40S is really designed for a different type of application. H100 is designed for large-scale language models and processing just very large models and a great deal of data. And so that's not L40S' focus. L40S' focus is to be able to fine-tune models, fine-tune pretrained models, and it'll do that incredibly well. It has a transform engine, it's got a lot of performance, you can get multiple GPUs in a server. 
It's designed for hyperscale scale-out, meaning it's easy to install L40S servers into the world's hyperscale data centers. It comes in a standard rack, standard server, and everything about it is standard. And so it's easy to install. L40S also is, with the software stack around it, and along with BlueField-3 and all the work that we did with VMware and the work that we did with Snowflake and ServiceNow and so many other enterprise partners, L40S is designed for the world's enterprise IT systems. And that's the reason why HPE, Dell, and Lenovo and some 20 other system makers building about 100 different configurations of enterprise servers are going to work with us to take generative AI to the world's enterprise.
And so L40S is really designed for a different type of scale-out, if you will. It's, of course, large language models. It's, of course, generative AI, but it's a different use case. And so the L40S is going to -- is off to a great start. And the world's enterprise and hyperscalers are really clamoring to get L40S deployed.",262

As good as these numbers are, you sort of more than tripled your revenue in a couple of quarters, there's a demand in some cases for multiples of what people are getting. 
So can you talk about that? How much unfulfilled demand do you think there is? And you talked about visibility extending into next year. Do you have line of sight into when you get to see supply/demand equilibrium here?",98
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Aug 23, 2023",2023-08-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3881.0,3080814.0,111696793.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,22,"Yes. We have excellent visibility through the year and into next year. And we're already planning the next-generation infrastructure with the leading CSPs and data center builders. The demand -- the easiest way to think about the demand is -- the world is transitioning from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. That's the easiest way to think about the demand. 
The best way for companies to increase their throughput, improve their energy efficiency, improve their cost efficiency, is to divert their capital budget to accelerated computing and generative AI. Because by doing that, you're going to offload so much workload off of the CPUs that the available CPUs is -- in your data center will get boosted. And so what you're seeing companies do now is recognizing this -- the tipping point here, recognizing the beginning of this transition and diverting their capital investment to accelerated computing and generative AI. 
And so that's probably the easiest way to think about the opportunity ahead of us. This isn't a singular application that is driving the demand, but this is a new computing platform, if you will, a new computing transition that's happening. And data centers all over the world are responding to this and shifting in a broad-based way.",207

Based on your remarks, it sounded like CSPs and Consumer Internet may have been a larger percentage of your business. If you can kind of clarify that or confirm that, that would be super helpful.
And then Jensen, a question for you. Given your position as the key enabler of AI, the breadth of engagements and the visibility you have into customer projects, I'm curious how confident you are that there will be enough applications or use cases for your customers to generate a reasonable return on their investments.

So thank you, Toshiya, on the question regarding our types of customers that we have in our Data Center business. And we look at it in terms of combining our compute as well as our networking together. Our CSPs, our large CSPs, are contributing a little bit more than 50% of our revenue within Q2. And the next largest category will be our consumer Internet companies. And then the last piece of that will be our enterprise and high-performance computing.",81

It is recognized for some time now that general purpose computing is just not -- and brute forcing general purpose computing, using general purpose computing at scale is no longer the best way to go forward. It's too energy costly, it's too expensive, and the performance of the applications are too slow.
And finally, the world has a new way of doing it. It's called accelerated computing, and what kicked it into turbocharge is generative AI. But accelerated computing could be used for all kinds of different applications that's already in the data center. And by using it, you offload the CPUs. You save a ton of money, an order of magnitude in cost, an order of magnitude and energy and the throughput is higher. And that's what the industry is really responding to.
Going forward, the best way to invest in the data center is to divert the capital investment from general purpose computing and focus it on generative AI and accelerated computing. Generative AI provides a new way of generating productivity, a new way of generating new services to offer to your customers, and accelerated computing helps you save money and save power. And the number of applications is, well, tons. Lots of developers, lots of applications, lots of libraries. It's ready to be deployed. 
And so I think the data centers around the world recognize this, that this is the best way to deploy resources, deploy capital going forward for data centers. This is true for the world's clouds, and you're seeing a whole crop of new GPU specialty -- GPU specialized cloud service providers. One of the famous ones is CoreWeave, and they're doing incredibly well. 
But you're seeing the regional GPU specialists service providers all over the world now. And it's because they all recognize the same thing, that the best way to invest their capital going forward is to put it into accelerated computing and generative AI. 
But we're also seeing that enterprises want to do that. But in order for enterprises to do it, you have to support the management system, the operating system, the security and software-defined data center approach of enterprises, and that's called VMware. And we've been working several years with VMware to make it possible for VMware to support not just the virtualization of CPUs but a virtualization of GPUs as well as the distributed computing capabilities of GPUs, supporting NVIDIA's BlueField for high-performance networking. 
And all of the generative AI libraries that we've been working on is now going to be offered as a special SKU by VMware's sales force, which is, as we all know, quite large because they reach some several hundred thousand VMware customers around the world. And this new SKU is going to be called VMware Private AI Foundation. And this will be a new SKU that makes it possible for enterprises.
And in combination with HP, Dell, and Lenovo's new server offerings based on L40S, any enterprise could have a state-of-the-art AI data center and be able to engage generative AI. And so I think the answer to that question is hard to predict exactly what's going to happen quarter-to-quarter. But I think the trend is very, very clear now that we're seeing a platform shift.",565

In other words, is like half of your compute shipping with your networking solutions? More than half, less than half? And is this something that maybe you can use to prioritize allocation of the GPUs?",55

We let customers decide what networking they would like to use. And for the customers that are building very large infrastructure, InfiniBand is, I hate to say it, kind of a no-brainer. And the reason for that because the efficiency of InfiniBand is so significant. Some 10%, 15%, 20% higher throughput for $1 billion infrastructure translates to enormous savings. 
Basically, the networking is free. And so if you have a single application, if you will, infrastructure, or it's largely dedicated to large language models or large AI systems, InfiniBand is really, really a terrific choice. 
However, if you're hosting for a lot of different users and Ethernet is really core to the way you manage your data center, we have an excellent solution there that we had just recently announced, and it's called Spectrum-X. Well, we're going to bring the capabilities, if you will -- not all of it, but some of it, of the capabilities of InfiniBand to Ethernet, so that we can also, within the environment of Ethernet, allow you to -- enable you to get excellent generative AI capabilities.
So Spectrum-X is just ramping now. It requires BlueField-3, and it supports both our Spectrum-2 and Spectrum-3 Ethernet switches. And the additional performance is really spectacular. BlueField-3 makes it possible and a whole bunch of software that goes along with it. 
BlueField, as all of you know, is a project really dear to my heart, and it's off to just a tremendous start. I think it's a home run. And this is the -- the concept of in-network computing and putting a lot of software in the computing fabric is being realized with BlueField-3, and it is going to be a home run.",299

Can you talk about the reception that you're seeing and how the momentum is going? And then Colette, can you also talk about your software business? What is the run rate right now and the materiality of that business? And it does seem like it's already helping margins a bit.",58

DGX Cloud's strategy is to achieve several things. Number one, to enable a really close partnership between us and the world's CSPs. We recognize that many of our -- we work with some 30,000 companies around the world, 15,000 of them are startups, thousands of them are generative AI companies. And the fastest-growing segment, of course, is generative AI. 
We're working with all of the world's AI start-ups. And ultimately, they would like to be able to land in one of the world's leading clouds. And so we built DGX Cloud as a footprint inside the world's leading clouds so that we could simultaneously work with all of our AI partners and help land them easily in one of our cloud partners.
The second benefit is that it allows our CSPs and ourselves to work really closely together to improve the performance of hyperscale clouds, which is historically designed for multi-tenancy and not designed for high-performance distributed computing like generative AI. And so to be able to work closely architecturally, to have our engineers work hand in hand to improve the networking performance and the computing performance has been really powerful, really terrific.
And then thirdly, of course, NVIDIA uses very large infrastructures ourselves. And our self-driving car team, our NVIDIA research team, our generative AI team, our language model team, the amount of infrastructure that we need is quite significant. And none of our optimizing compilers are possible without our DGX systems. Even compilers these days require AI, and optimizing software and infrastructure software requires AI to even develop. It's been well publicized that our engineering uses AI to design our chips.
And so the internal -- our own consumption of AI, our robotics team, so on and so forth, Omniverse teams, so on and so forth, all needs AI. And so our internal consumption is quite large as well, and we land that in DGX Cloud. And so DGX Cloud has multiple use cases, multiple drivers, and it's been off to just an enormous success. And our CSPs love it, the developers love it and our own internal engineers are clamoring to have more of it. And it's a great way for us to engage and work closely with all of the AI ecosystem around the world.",387

In part of our opening remarks that we made as well, remember, software is a part of almost all of our products, whether they're our Data Center products, GPU systems or any of our products within Gaming and our future Automotive products. You're correct, we're also selling it in a standalone business. And that standalone software continues to grow, where we are providing both the software services, upgrades across there as well.
Now we're seeing, at this point, probably hundreds of billions of dollars annually for our software business, and we are looking at NVIDIA AI Enterprise to be included with many of the products that we're selling, such as our DGX, such as our PCIe versions of our H100. And I think we're going to see more availability even with our CSP marketplaces. So we're off to a great start, and I do believe we'll see this continue to grow going forward.",167

The industry is simultaneously going through 2 platform transitions, accelerated computing and generative AI. Data centers are making a platform shift from general purpose to accelerated computing. The $1 trillion of global data centers will transition to accelerated computing to achieve an order of magnitude better performance, energy efficiency and cost. Accelerated computing-enabled generative AI, which is now driving a platform shift in software and enabling new, never-before possible applications.
Together, accelerated computing and generative AI are driving a broad-based computer industry platform shift. Our demand is tremendous. We are significantly expanding our production capacity. Supply will substantially increase for the rest of this year and next year. NVIDIA has been preparing for this for over 2 decades and has created a new computing platform that the world's industry -- world's industries can build upon.
What makes NVIDIA special are, one, architecture. NVIDIA accelerates everything from data processing, training, inference, every AI model, real-time speech to computer vision and giant recommenders to vector databases. The performance and versatility of our architecture translates to the lowest data center TCO and best energy efficiency.
Two, installed base. NVIDIA has hundreds of millions of CUDA-compatible GPUs worldwide. Developers need a large installed base to reach end users and grow their business. NVIDIA is the developer's preferred platform. More developers create more applications that make NVIDIA more valuable for customers. 
Three, reach. NVIDIA is in clouds, enterprise data centers, industrial edge, PCs, workstations, instruments and robotics. Each has fundamentally unique computing models and ecosystems. System suppliers like OEMs, computer OEMs, can confidently invest in NVIDIA because we offer significant market demand and reach.
Scale and velocity. NVIDIA has achieved significant scale and is 100% invested in accelerated computing and generative AI. Our ecosystem partners can trust that we have the expertise, focus and scale to deliver a strong road map and reach to help them grow. We are accelerating because of the additive results of these capabilities. We're upgrading and adding new products about every 6 months versus every 2 years to address the expanding universe of generative AI.
While we increase the output of H100 for training and inference of large language models, we're ramping up our new L40S universal GPU for scale, for cloud scale-out and enterprise servers. Spectrum-X, which consists of our Ethernet switch, BlueField-3 Super NIC and software helps customers who want the best possible AI performance on Ethernet infrastructures. Customers are already working on next-generation accelerated computing and generative AI with our Grace Hopper.
We're extending NVIDIA AI to the world's enterprises that demand generative AI, but with the model privacy, security and sovereignty. Together with the world's leading enterprise IT companies, Accenture, Adobe, Getty, Hugging Face, Snowflake, ServiceNow, VMware and WPP and our enterprise system partners, Dell, HPE, and Lenovo, we are bringing generative AI to the world's enterprise. We're building NVIDIA Omniverse to digitalize and enable the world's multitrillion-dollar heavy industries to use generative AI to automate how they build and operate physical assets and achieve greater productivity.
Generative AI starts in the cloud, but the most significant opportunities are in the world's largest industries, where companies can realize trillions of dollars of productivity gains. It is an exciting time for NVIDIA, our customers, partners and the entire ecosystem to drive this generational shift in computing. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.",566
