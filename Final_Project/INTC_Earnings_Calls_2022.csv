First, let me say welcome to Dave, who is joining us for his first earnings call. Many of you know Dave well and know his track record of successfully driving shareholder value. We're very excited to have him join our team. I also want to take a moment to thank George for his many contributions during the critical period in the company's transformation. Everyone here at Intel wishes him all the best in his future endeavors as he begins his planned retirement in May. 
Q4 was a tremendous finish to a transformational year where we beat expectations on both the top and bottom line. We exceeded our guidance for the quarter by over $1 billion on the top line, finishing with our best quarter and our best full year revenue ever. We had a record quarter for DCG, where we grew 20% year-on-year and where we continue to be the partner of choice for cloud and data center customers. We expect that our Xeon shipments in December alone exceeded the total server CPU shipments by any single competitor for all of 2021. 
We had a record year for our client business. And in Q4, we outperformed our plan and delivered another $10 billion quarter, highlighting again that the PC is more essential than ever. Continuing our momentum as the market leader in ADAS and AV solutions, Mobileye grew more than 40% year-on-year in 2021, delivering a 14th consecutive year of revenue growth. And finally, IOTG had another $1 billion quarter to cap a record year as the need for compute at the edge continues to grow. 
Supporting these record results, our manufacturing network continued its superb execution throughout the year. As an IDM, we were able to rapidly adjust to support customers' mix changes, often with a normal lead time, and manufactured more than 2 million wafers. We broke ground on 2 new fabs in Arizona 3 months ahead of schedule as part of the largest overall manufacturing expansion in Intel's history and all while managing a challenging COVID environment and focusing on the safety of our employees, suppliers and partners. 
We also took several in a series of key steps to shape our business. To begin with, we've recently completed the first close of the sale of our NAND business on time, a critical step in optimizing our portfolio in line with our new strategy. Second, we began unfolding our plan to find innovative ways to sustainably unlock shareholder value with the announcement of our intent to take Mobileye public in 2022. Third, just last week, we announced our new manufacturing site in Ohio, which will support our future growth and advances our plan to create a more geographically balanced, resilient supply chain. While there is a lot left to do, we're building momentum, and we intend to continue our laser focus on execution, innovation and growing the business. 
Finally, Q4 was a sacred moment for the entire technology industry as we led the 50th anniversary celebration of the Intel 4004, the chip that changed the world. Microprocessor technology sparked by the Intel 4004 allows us to stay connected during the pandemic. It has opened up new ways to work and learn. It has removed geographical boundaries and changed almost every aspect of our lives. We are committed to accelerate this impact for the next 50 years as the insatiable need for compute that started with the 4004 continues to drive the value of Moore's Law. At IDM, we outlined a long-term path toward more than 10x density improvement in packaging and a 30% to 50% area improvement in transistor scaling. As the steward of Moore's Law, we remain committed to keeping it alive for the next decade and beyond. 
Looking across the industry, 2021 was dominated by 2 recurring themes, unprecedented demand and ecosystem supply constraints. The strong demand we saw throughout 2021 continued in Q4, and markets remained robust across all our businesses. We expect this trend to continue as the digitization of everything, driven by the 4 superpowers of AI, pervasive connectivity, ubiquitous compute and cloud-to-edge infrastructure leads to an era of sustainable growth. 
2021 marked the best year in a decade for the PC industry, with third parties reporting a growth rate of approximately 15%, driven by higher PC density, shorter replacement cycles and increased market penetration. In Q4, we also saw the strong recovery in the channel as increased supply led to a record sell-through for Intel, and we started to see inventories return to prepandemic levels. The data center market was strong across all geographies in Q4, led by the enterprise where the market continued to recover from COVID lows. We expect the data center, network and edge markets to continue to have robust growth as hyperscalers lay out multiyear cloud CapEx investment plans. 
The ongoing need for data privacy and security drives additional edge and on-prem deployments. 5G network and edge build-outs are scaling and workloads like AI continue to expand. This unprecedented demand continues to be tempered by supply chain constraints as shortages in substrates, components and foundry silicon has limited our customers' ability to ship finished systems. Across the industry, this was most acutely felt in the client market, particularly in notebooks, but constraints have widely impacted other markets, including automotive, the Internet of Things and the data center. 
As we predicted, these ecosystem constraints are expected to persist through 2022 and into 2023, with incremental improvements over this period. The industry will continue to see challenges in a variety of areas, including specialty and overall foundry shortages, substrates as well as third-party silicon. While constraints will remain, our IDM 2.0 strategy affords us a superior position to navigate this environment. With control over our manufacturing network and supply chain, we are able to react to rapid changes in demand that help solve challenges for our customers, suppliers and partners. Equally important as an IDM, we remain more resilient to foundry price increases as only a minority of our volume is produced by third parties. 
Turning from the ecosystem to Intel. We made incredible progress over the last year improving our execution in technology development, manufacturing and product leadership. With unprecedented transparency, we laid out an ambitious path to deliver 5 process nodes in 4 years and regain process performance parity by 2024 and unquestioned leadership by 2025. We are shipping Intel 7 in volume today. And as I was able to say last quarter and can reaffirm today, we remain on or ahead of schedule for Intel 4, 3, 20A and 18A against the time lines we laid out in July. 
Our manufacturing execution continued to improve. And in Q4, as we ship a record number of servers and we have more than a 30% year-on-year reduction in 10-nanometer wafer costs, we had record quarterly increase in our substrate capacity with our vendors, and we accelerated our pace of innovation with a record number of PDK releases and new product introductions in our factories. 
Finally, as part of our strategy to use both internal and external manufacturing, we signed multiple long-term supply agreements ranging from foundry partners to substrates to equipment suppliers that will support the growth of our business for years to come. In particular, we announced the deepening of our ASML partnership and our leadership position with the second generation of EUV High-NA. 
In client, we had another $10 billion quarter, and 2021 was our sixth straight year of revenue growth. We feel great about our position within the sustainably larger client market, and we had an all-time record shipments with customers like Dell. We have a great product lineup starting with Tiger Lake, which has now shipped over 100 million units, making it the fastest-ramping notebook in our history. We are extending our leadership position further with products like our 12th generation Alder Lake, the fastest client processor ever, which is now shipping to over 140 customers in 30 countries around the world. As our first performance hybrid product, it features the highest-performance CPU core Intel has ever built as well as the efficient cores optimized for power. It leads the industry transition on DDR5 and PCIe 5 to enhance gaming and creator experiences. 
The Alder Lake family will scale across every PC segment from ultra thin and light laptops to enthusiast desktops, where we've now set new overclocking records to mobile gaming, where the Core i9-12900HK, the world's best mobile gaming processor, is up to 40% faster than the prior generation. Following on the success of Alder Lake, we will continue to build momentum later this year when we expect to introduce Raptor Lake, which is already booted in our labs. 
In addition to leadership products, we are also driving platform innovations. And at CES, we unveiled our third-gen Evo platform. This new generation includes features like intelligent collaboration to optimize remote work and learning experiences as well as Thunderbolt 4 and WiFi 6E. With no legacy WiFi interference, WiFi 6E will enable incredible performance with low latency, the biggest WiFi advancement in 20 years. We are further reinvigorating the PC ecosystem with technologies like Screenovate, which provides a seamless multi-device and screen-sharing experience, which will begin rolling out on select Intel Evo platforms starting later this year. Driven by the strong product and platform lineup, we feel confident in our ability to compete and drive growth going forward. 
Our Data Center Group had its best quarter ever as customers continued rebuilding their confidence in choosing Intel. Enabled by our IDM advantage, Ice Lake servers shipped more than 1 million units, equal to the amount we had shipped in the prior 3 quarters combined. All of our OEMs are currently shipping systems, and all of our major cloud customers have announced instances, including our third instance with Amazon Web Services. Going forward, our road map only gets better, and we expect to ship initial SKUs of Sapphire Rapids to select customers in Q1. 
Sapphire Rapids will offer significant performance improvements across a range of workloads, including AI, where we are targeting up to 30x total gain for Xeon. This demonstrates that a general-purpose CPU with built-in AI acceleration can solve even more customer use cases that once necessitated GPU acceleration. Customers remain excited about Sapphire Rapids, and it has been chosen, along with HPE, to power the new Kestrel supercomputer. Built for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Kestrel will accelerate discovery of renewable power. Once completed in 2023, Kestrel will have more than 5x greater capability than NREL's existing system with approximately 44 petaflops of peak performance. 
Beyond the core data center, we continue to build on our leadership position from the network to the edge with our comprehensive portfolio of hardware and software solutions. We are leading the transformation of the network where Xeon and FlexRAN software are used in almost all DRAM commercial deployments. We are driving AI inferencing adoption at the edge with our OpenVINO software and partners like BMW Group and Samsung in the factory and medical environments. And we are extending the IPU ecosystem and accelerating the creation of fully programmable network by collaborating on new FPGA-based IPU solutions with Inspur, Ruijie Networks and Silicom. 
In our discrete and accelerated graphics business, we are starting the year very quickly. Alchemist, the first product in our Intel Arc Discrete Graphics lineup, is now shipping to customers with more than 50 new mobile and desktop designs, including with Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Samsung and others. Our Arc family of products will scale from mainstream up to the performance graphics segment and will be available in the market later this quarter. 
In high-performance computing, our Ponte Vecchio GPU is already sampling to customers. With 100 billion transistors, Ponte Vecchio has our highest compute density ever and along with Sapphire Rapids will power the 2 exaflop Aurora supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory. There are over 100 HPC applications running on Ponte Vecchio, which, enabled by 1 API, provides a unified and open programming model across CPU and GPU. We are working with numerous partners and customers, including Atos, Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Quanta and Super Micro to deploy our HPC-tuned CPUs and GPUs in their latest systems. 
Our IFS business continues to see strong and enthusiastic customer support. We have a strong pipeline of potential customers, and IP development with the ecosystem is progressing well. We are shipping for revenue on our packaging solutions, and we continue to expect customer test chips in our factories on our Intel 16 process this year. Innovations like RibbonFET and PowerVia are proving to be very attractive features to potential customers, and the Intel 18A design kit has now been released to 3 RAMP-C customers. Overall, we are ahead of where I thought we'd be, and I am thrilled with the progress of our IFS team. 
In mobility, Mobileye continues to be an industry leader in both ADAS and AV, and we recently hit a significant milestone shipping our 100th million EyeQ SoC. At CES, we gave a glimpse of the future with the EyeQ Ultra, which will do the work of 10 EyeQ 5 SoCs in a single package and was designed to deliver the optimum power and performance for a fully self-driving vehicle. In Q4, we also introduced our first autonomous on-demand service in Paris in collaboration with the RATP Group. Paris is the latest in a list of locations where Mobileye is piloting autonomous vehicle test fleets, including New York, Munich, Detroit, Tokyo, Israel and China. Looking ahead, we still expect to launch commercial robotaxi services in Munich and Tel Aviv in 2022. 
As we announced in December, we are working to take Mobileye public to unlock shareholder value. We are making good progress, and we'll share more as we go through the year. You'll hear a lot more about how we are rearchitecting our business for growth as part of our upcoming Investor Day. We will lay out details on how we are leveraging our core strengths to accelerate our plans and how we are uniquely positioned to create value. We'll give you the proof points you should expect to see in 2022 that show that we are on track for our long-term plan, all backed up by the transparency and accountability that our new reportable segments will provide. 
Let me close by saying again that Q4 was an incredibly strong finish to a great 2021. And I believe that, with growing markets, our strong product road map and our increasingly solid execution, 2022 will only be better. In fact, just in the past 24 hours, we were pleased to see the ruling from the general court in Europe and their decision to overturn the EUR 1.1 billion fine. The semiconductor industry has never been more competitive than it is today, and we look forward to continuing to invest and grow in Europe. 
At the same time, here in the U.S., we were very excited to see the progress on the Chips Act with the House introducing their version of the bill yesterday. The President and other members of the administration have been clear on the importance of this transformational investment, and it's encouraging to see the strong bipartisan and bicameral support as we continue to work together to address the long-term impacts of the semiconductor shortage, restore U.S. leadership in this critical industry and rebalance the global supply chain. 
With that, let me turn it over to Dave.",2586

First, let me say how happy I am to be part of Intel. It's a really exciting time, and I'm looking forward to the opportunity to support Intel's transformation and plans for growth. I think we have a great opportunity to drive compelling returns and shareholder value, which all starts with the plans that we will lay out for you at Investor Day in February. 
Q4 was a record quarter, delivering a stronger-than-expected finish to another record year. Both DCG and IOTG achieved record quarters, with CCG, IOTG and Mobileye delivering full year record revenue. Q4 revenue was $19.5 billion, exceeding our guidance by $1.2 billion. The revenue beat was broad-based, led by stronger-than-expected enterprise and government demand in data center, desktop PC strength and better-than-expected notebook demand. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 55.4%, exceeding our guidance by 190 basis points due to strong flow-through on higher revenue. Q4 EPS was $1.09, $0.19 above our guide due to strong operational performance. For full year 2021, we achieved record revenue of $74.7 billion, up $1.2 billion from our previous guidance and up 2% year-over-year. 2021 gross margin was 57.7%, and EPS was $5.47, up $0.37 year-over-year. We generated $11.3 billion of free cash flow in 2021, approximately $1 billion lower than prior expectations as higher net income was offset by Q4 working capital fluctuations. 
Now turning to our business units. CCG delivered record annual revenue, its sixth straight year of revenue growth, up 1% year-over-year and up 6% when excluding the modem and connected home divestitures. For the quarter, revenue was $10.1 billion, up 5% sequentially on strong commercial demand. Platform ASPs were up 15% year-over-year on a richer mix, driven by strong demand for our highest-performing platforms and industry-wide constraints leading our customers to prioritize limited components to higher-end systems. Operating profit was down 3% year-over-year on increased spending to further strengthen our product and platform road map. 
The Data Center Group delivered a record $7.3 billion in revenue for Q4, up 12% sequentially and up 20% year-over-year on strong enterprise and government demand. Full year revenue was down 1% due to a slower-than-expected recovery earlier in the year as well as competitive pressure, partially offset by stronger enterprise and government and communications service provider demand. Platform ASPs were up 3% sequentially and 4% year-over-year on improved mix to our highest-performing products. Operating profit in Q4 was down 17% year-over-year, primarily due to the previously disclosed Intel federal-related onetime charge and 10-nanometer product ramp. Full year operating profit was down due to lower revenue, with an increased mix of 10-nanometer products, Intel 4 start-up charges and increased investment in our product road map. 
IOTG achieved record Q4 and full year revenue. Q4 revenue was $1.1 billion, up 36% year-over-year on broad-based strength, led by the industrial and retail segments. Full year revenue was $4 billion, up 33% year-over-year as the business saw a strong recovery from COVID-related impacts. Operating profit for the year was $1 billion, up 110% year-over-year. 
PSG delivered $484 million in Q4 revenue, up 15% year-over-year and up slightly quarter-over-quarter as industry-wide supply constraints continue to severely limit revenue growth. Full year revenue was $1.9 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Operating profit was $51 million, up 19% year-over-year. If not for the external supply constraints, we believe the PSG business would have delivered over $500 million in additional revenue in 2021. 
Mobileye reported Q4 revenue of $356 million and $1.4 billion for full year, up 43% year-over-year. Full year operating profit was $460 million, up 91% year-over-year. 
Before moving on to Q1 guidance, I want to briefly discuss changes to our non-GAAP reporting beginning in 2022 that we touched on in our Q3 earnings. First, in an effort to more closely align with our semiconductor peers and allow for more consistent comparability between periods, we'll be removing stock-based compensation and all gains and losses related to our ICAP portfolio from our non-GAAP results. Despite this change, we'll continue to closely evaluate stock-based compensation to ensure we're in line with industry benchmarks and optimize ICAP investments to advance our strategy and maximize ROI. 
Second, we're modifying our segment reporting to align with our revised organizational structure and business strategy. Moving forward, we will report results under the following business units: Client Computing, which includes our historical CCG business plus workstation revenue; Data Center and Artificial Intelligence, which includes our data center CPU products plus our PSG business; Networking and Edge, which includes our IOTG business plus our networking-focused products previously included in DCG; Accelerated Computing and Graphics, which includes all discrete graphics products; Mobileye, which is unchanged from our prior segmentation; and Intel Foundry Services, which includes revenue from our wafer and packaging offerings. 
This new reporting structure enables transparent accountability relative to how well we are managing and executing against the 6 business units that will be further communicated at Investor Day in February. 
Moving to our Q1 outlook. We continue to see strong demand across all our businesses, and note that Q1 includes the impact of an additional 14th week. We expect results to be tempered by continued industry-wide component constraints, normal seasonality and PC notebook inventory burn as OEMs work through inventory imbalances created by ecosystem constraints that have limited their ability to ship systems in certain segments. 
We expect Q1 revenue of $18.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year, but up 2% when adjusting for an approximately $600 million onetime corporate revenue item recognized in Q1 '21. As we signaled in our Q3 call, gross margin will be impacted by our 10-nanometer product ramp and increased process technology investment. The aforementioned onetime corporate revenue item in Q1 '21 will also impact the year-on-year compare. We are forecasting gross margin of 52%, EPS of approximately $0.80 and a tax rate of approximately 15%. 
Note that we will provide full year 2022 guidance and more details on our long-term financial model as part of our Investor Day on February 17. We hope to see you there in person for a full day of presentations and Q&A sessions with our most senior leaders. 
Finally, I want to thank George for his 3 years at Intel, delivering outstanding results and making many of the changes necessary to begin our transition to a growth company.

Pat, it's great to see a second quarter of year-over-year growth in DCG and an acceleration over the calendar third quarter. But if you look underneath the covers, there's sort of 2 stories at play. Enterprises coming back extremely strong. But if you look at the cloud part of the business, I think this is the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year declines. 
And so I guess there's 2 parts to my question. One, when do you see a return to year-over-year growth in cloud? And two, to the extent that the investment community has a bias that everything eventually ends up in the cloud, what is kind of your long-term view of the sustainability of this enterprise demand?",122
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2022",2022-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3581.0,2478141.0,93923255.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,9,"Yes.Thanks, John, and thanks for the comments on a great finish to a great year. So as we look at the DCG business, we just say we started out behind early in the year digestion. And we've sort of been catching up and building momentum in the cloud piece of that business all year long. And we do see that momentum carrying into next year. So that creates some of the year-on-year quarterly compares that you described. 
E&G, really a tremendous second half and a really strong Q4 for that business where we have higher market share and have seen just a great environment. what we're hearing from our customers is that the momentum in E&G continues in the next year with very strong backlog positions, and it would have been even stronger had it not been for other supply constraints and match sets that we see. And as you may have heard me talk about before, we don't see everything going to the cloud. We see this balance of on-prem and cloud-based delivery. And cloud continues to grow faster than on-prem, but workloads continue to grow on-prem. 
Also, we expect to see an acceleration of edge-based -- and I spoke about this at our innovation conference, where the big story as we get out to 2 or 3 years from now is going to be accelerating edge growth. And that's an area that Intel has a very strong position in the edge, very high market share, leadership platforms in 5G in inference and AI. So overall, we expect to see it very balanced across our portfolio. We do see strength to see growth in our cloud business next year, continued sustainability of E&G. But the real story over the next couple of years we see as explosive edge growth.",301

And thank you to George, and congrats to Dave. So with all that out of the way, Pat, I want to talk about the PC market. I know you've been one of the more optimistic folks on that. And the fourth quarter results showed a little bit of evidence as to why you're optimistic. But you also talked about some interesting inventory dynamics in there, where channel inventory was rising. 
Can you talk a little bit about your expectations for this year? Again, not front-running the Analyst Day too much, but the expectations for growth for the year and a little bit more on how you reconcile inventory rising with shortages still persisting?",121
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2022",2022-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3581.0,2478141.0,93923258.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,12,"Yes. Thank you. And 2021 was really good, if not great year, for the PC. And I think most of the forecasts now are coming in estimating about 15% growth last year. As we're seeing IDC Canalys modest growth in the market next year. So as you've heard me -- and I think this matches exactly what Sacha said yesterday -- we'll just say a structurally larger market for us for next year and a couple of percent growth in that. So we see that we will be able to have continued growth in our client business. And obviously, with a stronger and stronger product line, we see ourselves in a very good position for our client market share. 
Now the inventory position is one where we have just been at historically low inventories for an extended period of time, just racing to catch up with demand. And so we would say that some of this is just getting to inventory levels that are even approaching what we consider normal for a business of this size and one that's managing these still significant supply constraints at different areas, power controllers, display led controllers, other aspects of substrates and different component pieces. So a lot of these challenges have really led to, I'll just say, supply issues throughout the customer base. 
So as we go to next year, we hope to see some of those starting to moderate and turn to a more normal behavior in the industry, in particular, the channel inventory levels, the ones that were essentially 0, right, for almost all of the year. And now we're starting to see just a little bit of build back in that area, which particularly, for our channel and distribution partners, sort of for the first time, giving them something to sell for the whole year. So a lot of response positively there. 
Overall, we still see that the PC is now becoming this essential part in increasingly work from home, learn from home environment, Windows 11, a strong upgrade cycle being introduced by that. So a lot of good tailwinds and a great product line. It's going to be a great year for us in the client space.",368

I wonder if you could talk about the capital spending a little bit. And again, I don't want to tread on material you're going to cover at the Analyst Day. But the footprint in Ohio, the various comments that you've made about not being able to foresee having too much capacity in the next couple of years, as you think about that, how much of that is your existing x86 business versus foundry and other opportunities? And any sense for the capital spending you felt through this year, how much of that is going to be buildings versus equipment?",100

Thanks, Joe. And I'll kick it off and ask Dave to comment as well. Overall, we would just say that supply constraints, we just have a lot of catching up to do in building out the capital footprint. And some of that is catching up. Some of that's building for the new process technologies are 5 of those in 4 years. But it also is leveraging the smart cap strategy that we've laid out, where, boy, I lost for having a free shell today that we could be ramping into. We simply have to build some more shell capacity. And then we'll be determining where is the best use and how to fill that as we start to build out those shelves. 
Everything that we've described, our Arizona build-out, our Ohio build-out, we do expect that, that will be satisfying both our internal products as well as creating capacity corridors for our foundry business as well. At Analyst Day, we'll be shaping that with more clarity. And Dave will be giving updates on a number of the capital aspects at the foundry -- for foundry as well as for internal capacity there.

Maybe I'll just comment a little bit on it. When we do a year-over-year comparison, obviously, Q4 of last year was a huge quarter for CCG, particularly with the consumer and entry SKUs. And so what we've seen really starting with the second half, in particular, for 2021 is a rotation out of the consumer and entry area into the what we call our big core notebooks and our desktop, which desktop had really dropped off. And now we're seeing kind of a strong recovery there. So we -- if we think a little bit about the growth of CCG year-over-year, we certainly look to be growing lower than the TAM. 
But if you take into account the fact that we -- you look at our exit of modem and our exit of Home Gateway and the impact that, that had on a year-over-year comparison, that's about 6 points of growth. And then the customer's decision to go vertical on -- a large customer decided to go vertical, that's about another 6 points. So the overall growth, the pattern is a little different because of the mix year-over-year. But the growth relative to the TAM, when you take into account these changes, is much more in line with the overall growth of the industry.",215

It looks like a lot of good early engagements. If I'm a potential IFS customer and I start my design today, realistically, right, I'm not expecting my chip design to be ready for manufacturing conservatively for at least 2 years because that's just how long the design cycle times are for these leading-edge chips. And it seems consistent with your prior commentary on IFS customers more focused on your 20 and 18A nodes, which is kind of 2024-2025 time frame. 
So if I think about the real big CapEx outlay to support IFS, my assumption is that it's probably not until 2024 or maybe even 2025 time frame. Is that kind of the right way to think about it that most of the CapEx spend for IFS is probably 2 to 3 years' delay and more of the CapEx spend over the next 2, 3 years is to support growth of the core compute businesses?",170

Your comments sort of dimensionalize it almost right. The key thing, to augment what you said, is that to be able to put the capital in place in '24, '25, you have to be building the shells in '22, '23. So that's what we've -- and why, for instance, the Ohio announcement, we said, hey, we are building shells so that we can fill it with our products and with foundry customers as well. But clearly, when we get to Intel 3 as well as Intel 18A ramps for foundry customers, those capital investments, most of that being back-end loaded, right, when you're putting equipment in place, really ramp up in '24 and '25. But we've got to start building the shell capacity for those in '22 and '23. 
Your other comments, we do expect some of the Intel 16 customers that some of those products will start ramping next year. So we do expect some of those design starts that are already underway today to start giving us some revenues for our foundry offerings on Intel 16 in '23. We would expect Intel 3 to start contributing in '24 and Intel 18A in '25 and beyond. So it's sort of that nice ramp. But we've also said, ""Hey, we already have packaging customers, and those revenues have already started in Q4 of this year. And obviously, some of the services, some of these are paid for services as well. 
So those will start contributing even before then. But overall, the world wants more capacity. The world is looking for leading-edge foundry capabilities. We've seen very strong interest from many different sectors. And I'll just say, across whether it's leading-edge, high-performance computing, mobile customers, industrial customers and clearly, automotive customers, a very broad swath of customers who are interested in the Intel foundry services and great momentum that we're seeing.",311

I actually had a near and longer-term question on gross margins. So in the near term, I'm wondering, the 52%, how does this kind of evolve through the year? I know you're not trying to give a specific number right now. But what are the puts and takes and kind of the key drivers? Is this the floor or ceiling or kind of the average level that we should be thinking about? 
And then longer-term impact, how do we reconcile that your main competitor who is kind of just fabless is pretty much at the same gross margins without having to spend any of the CapEx that Intel plans to spend? When can Intel start using the pricing power in the markets where you have very large incumbency?",131

Let me start, and Pat can certainly provide us color around pricing. So you're right that we are going to provide a lot more details around the year at the Investor Day and give you actually some perspective over the longer term. But I think I can help you think through a little bit about the trend based on the following commentary. 
So in our third quarter earnings call that Pat and George were representing Intel, we said that we had to make investments, both in terms of newer process technologies and the start-up costs associated with that and we needed to ramp 10-nanometer. And that was going to put pressure on gross margins. And they create -- they presented a range of somewhere between 51% and 53% was the gross margin level that we would need to operate at while we were getting ourselves caught up from a technology perspective. So we're in that range for their guidance, the 52%. And we feel very good about 51% to 53% range for the year. 
So that's -- so when you look at this number, it can bounce around a little bit. But the 51% to 53% range we've given, we feel real confidence around for the time being. Now after that, as we get back to a leadership position in terms of technology and in terms of products, of course, there's absolutely opportunity to improve upon that. And we will, I think, provide you good evidence of that at the Investor Day in February. So that should give you some incentive to come.",264
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2022",2022-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3581.0,2478141.0,93923275.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,29,"And a couple of comments on the longer-term margin picture, as we said, leadership products, when we get to process leadership, right, and the nice cadence for those process technologies, those will become nicely accelerants. And we said that we will see our margins recover in the latter part of the 5-year window that we gave guidance on our last earnings call. So we do see those as contributors, and we'll see our margins rise over time as a result. 
Additionally, we do expect our long-term margins to be a composite of our foundry business, which will be on the lower end of the margin range that we'll operate the company in and combining that with the higher end of our leadership products as those occur. So we'll be giving a better characterization of that at the -- at our investor meeting as well. 
Further, we'd say, over time, we think we have a structurally superior margin model for our business where I think everybody is seeing acute inflation and foundry costs and others in the industry where our factory network will give us a lot more opportunities to create a more balanced cost structure that others in the industry will not be able to accomplish. 
So overall, we see great margin outlook, great cash flow and free cash flow opportunities over the horizon, and we'll characterize those much more carefully as part of our investor meeting. But we see the advantages of our business model over anybody else in the industry to be quite substantial for supply, for margin creation, for cash flow generation. And all of these will come together in a very powerful way.",278

The Mobileye spinout, things are progressing smoothly. We'll give updates on that as appropriate as we go out over time. But -- and as we said, it will be a partial spin, so we still see continuing and substantive value creation for Mobileye having a high relationship with Intel. So we'll be updating on that as things progress there. I won't say that's the last one that we'll consider for such moves. 
We see this as a formula for value creation that may have other areas that could benefit from such approaches from the Intel family as we look to the future. And we said this is a model for value creation that we think is a powerful one and one that we'll be exercising in the industry, but we have no other specifics to talk about at this time.

And obviously, Sapphire Rapids is going to be a lot more competitive. But Gen was also going to be ramping kind of right on top of it. So -- is there kind of a line in the sand that you think of that you won't let share go below x percentage? Can you just talk big picture about how you think about market share in server? Is there a threshold over which you'd use price to get more competitive?",94

And overall, we do see that the product line is getting more competitive. Sapphire Rapids will be a stronger product. But we're already seeing that the product line is getting more competitive with Ice Lake. And our Q4 numbers on Ice Lake were very good. And we see the Q4 equaled all of the shipments of the first 3 quarters of the year. So Ice Lake is an improvement. Sapphire Rapids gets better. We do expect that there's going to be a bit of to and fro with the competitive alternatives where they'll deliver a product, we'll deliver the next product. 
And as you've heard me say, we are on a path to sustained unquestioned leadership into this area. It's going to take us a few generations until we're unquestionably in a leadership position, but we believe our product teams, our packaging teams and our process technologies, our factory capacity, all of these give us the tools to create leadership products. And then we combine that with our platform leadership and our software technologies, we have a path to unquestioned leadership over time. 
Obviously, we believe we're going to have a superior cost structure, as we've already touched on, given that many of our server products come from our factories. So we're going to be in a better margin and cost position and capacity. We think we have a lot of tools to address market share over time.

The revenue very strong, but the operating margin, I think, was down 10 points year-over-year. And I wanted to dig into that a little bit. The slides and the release mentioned an Intel federal charge, if you guys could quantify that. But the bigger part of the question is now with the Ice Lake ramp, there's a lot more volume in DCG that's going on to the 10-nanometer node. 
And my question, Pat, is do we need to evolve the product set to where we get to Granite Rapids and we get off of 10-nanometer before we see margin improvement in DCG? Or is there going to Sapphire Rapids in a tiled approach with smaller tiles while still on 10? Is that enough for the margins to recover?",136

Yes. So I mean, just in the strict walk of the operating margins of the DCG business. So it's -- some of the things I talked about in terms of the aggregate story around gross margins, there's the ramp of 10-nanometer for the data center space. There's higher start-up costs associated with new process technologies, so that's certainly driving it. We also had a onetime charge in our E&G business for a federal charge that also negatively impacted the operating margins. 
And then lastly, as we talked about, we are continuing to ramp up our investment in terms of product technology in R&D. And so we had some increased OpEx investment that also drove it. But all of this is kind of executing to the plan that Pat laid out a quarter or so ago. And so this is all part of where we wanted to be at this point to drive the future of the company.",160

And I'd say, over time, we absolutely expect that we're going to improve the operating margin of this business again. And we haven't ramped the new node for 5 years in our data center business. And that's something that -- it's an embarrassing thing to say on the one hand. And obviously, as a result, we've been in an area that we shouldn't have had operating margins that high in this business. It's just been that we've been running on very mature nodes well past the time that a normal cycle should be. And now we're aggressively ramping 10. We're also starting to ramp the cost of 7 and 4 as well. 
So all of these taken together, I think you're seeing a very unusual period in the gross margins and operating margins of this business. We fully expect that this is a very healthy business for us long term. And as we're going through the cycle of new process technologies, investments in the business, nothing here is surprising to us. And you can expect that over the long term this is a great business for Intel as we ramp leadership process technologies with unquestioned leadership products, we're going to do well here.",204

So definitely, the federal charge not repeating itself in the first quarter is certainly helpful. And there are a couple of mix benefits that we're seeing. But the charges associated with ramping 10-nanometer, particularly in the data center space, and the start-up costs on Intel 4 are predominantly what's driving the reduced gross margins. But again, it's exactly where we thought we would be in the first fiscal quarter. I mean this is the number that we were planning to drive the business to. And ultimately, the ROI on all the investments we're making that drive headwinds in the gross margins for the first quarter will turn around and drive a very good ROI down the road.",118

And I spoke to Speaker Pelosi at length on this subject just yesterday as there you expect it will be debated on the floor next week. And hopefully, following what we expect will be passage in the house, a reconciliation process. So I'd say everybody is now more optimistic on this coming across the line in the near future. 
Now obviously, I think we and others have viewed the passage of this as an accelerant for our investment plans. And as I've said very clearly, hey, we're going to build a site in Ohio. It could either be small or it could be big and fast. And with the passage of the Chips Act, it's going to be bigger, and we're going to build it out faster as a result. And we think that's good for our company. Even more important, it's good for our nation as we rebuild a resilient, globally balanced supply chain. And the events of just yesterday, getting the bill on the House floor, I think, is a very, very good sign for all that will get us across the line. 
But even more so, right, we see acts in Europe that are gaining momentum as well in the EU Chips Act as well. And we've been quite involved in that domain, and we hope to see our expansion plans accelerate in Europe as well. So overall, all of these things will simply benefit the industry, but it certainly will accelerate our investment plans as it makes us more competitive globally to be for our products, but even more so for our foundry business as well. So thank you for that question. 
And with that, let me, again -- I do want to say thank you to Dave joining us for the first time. George, thank you again for your support, for the years that you've contributed in this critical period of the company. And I do want to remind you of the strategies. We're going to build the team, improve the execution. As we look back in 2021, we've made tremendous progress across all areas that we've laid out. We still do have a lot of work to do, but we're focused, energized and momentum is building. And I look forward to sharing our progress with you as we continue on this amazing journey. And Investor Day is coming up. We're going to lay out the strategy. We've got a lot to say. And this is a great business. We finished a great year. Thank you all for joining us today.",576

Q1 was another solid quarter where we beat on the top line, exceeded our guidance on gross margin and EPS, and where we continue to execute on our long-term growth strategy to unlock a $1 trillion market opportunity. As we laid out at our recent Investor Day, our strategy is built around 4 key pillars. We will deliver leadership products anchored on open and secure platforms powered by at-scale manufacturing and supercharged by our people. In Q1, we made great progress in all of these areas, and we are continuing to hold our full year revenue outlook.
In our data center and AI group, we began shipping initial SKUs of Sapphire Rapids to select customers as planned. We also unveiled our expanded dual-track Xeon road map that strengthens our position in both per core performance and performance per watt for cloud and enterprise workloads. We launched our Arc A-Series GPUs for laptops, taking our first steps to give the graphics industry a much needed new addition. Mobileye demonstrated its Level 4 self-driving system in Jerusalem, a major milestone in preparation for its upcoming robotaxi services.
We continue to add to our talent with strong industry leaders like Christoph Schell, who recently joined us from HP as our Chief Commercial Officer. And finally, we took another major step in creating a balanced semiconductor supply chain with the announcement of our plans for new investments in Europe. We also held the grand opening of our latest leading-edge factory in Oregon, including a new name for the campus, the Gordon Moore Park at Ronler Acres, which recognizes our founder and the site's unique contribution to driving Moore's Law.
Q1 also marked a special moment for Intel as we announced our plans to further reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and develop more sustainable technology solutions, including using 100% renewable energy across our global operations by 2030 and achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions in our global operations by 2040.
Overall, Q1 was a great start to the year as we continue to execute on the path to our long-term growth story. We still have a lot of work to do, but we are executing at a torrid pace, and I remain confident in our path forward. 
Before I get into specific updates for each of our business units, let me start with some observations of what we are seeing in the industry. I continue to believe we are just at the beginning of a long-term growth cycle across semiconductors. We continue to see some match set limitations in areas like Ethernet, some softening in low-end consumer PC and some inventory adjustments, as we discussed on our last call. But overall, the demand signals from customers continue to be robust in areas like enterprise, cloud, AI, graphics and networking.
Semiconductors are the fuel of innovation and transformation across a wide range of industries. In the supply chain, lockdowns in Shanghai and the war in Ukraine have demonstrated more than ever that the world needs more resilient and more geographically-balanced semiconductor manufacturing. The chip shortage costs the U.S. economy $240 billion last year and we expect the industry will continue to see challenges until at least 2024 in areas like foundry capacity and tool availability.
As an IDM, we believe we are in a good position in the industry to manage through these constraints. In fact, Intel is rising to meet this challenge. Following our announcements in Arizona, New Mexico and Ohio, we recently announced a series of investments in Europe, spanning our existing operations as well as our new investments in France and Germany, the Silicon Junction. These investments position Intel to meet the future growth and represent a significant step toward our moonshot goal of having half the world's semiconductor manufacturing located in the U.S. and Europe.
The pace at which we can reach this goal is dependent on the actions of the U.S. and other governments. America showed leadership when Congress passed the CHIPS Act, but the global situation has grown even more serious since then. The EU has been very aggressive in moving legislation forward to meet this challenge, and I recently testified before the Senate to highlight the critical need for the U.S. to fund the CHIPS Act. I continue to encourage Congress to fund this critical legislation and enable us to move faster towards making a balanced semiconductor supply chain a reality.
Turning now to Intel. We continue to make great progress on our plans to deliver 5 process nodes in 4 years. Intel 7 is ramping extremely well with Alder Lake and on Intel 4, Meteor Lake has now successfully booted Windows 12 and Linux. The speed at which the team was able to achieve this milestone is a significant sign of the health of both Meteor Lake and our Intel 4 process technology.
We plan to deliver several additional milestones in 2022, demonstrating our process technology development remains on track. This includes early Sierra Forest preproduction wafers on Intel 3, IP test wafers on Intel 28 and foundry customer test chips and initial IP shovels on Intel 18A. Simply put, we remain on and, in some places, ahead of schedule to deliver 5 nodes in 4 years.
Our manufacturing network continues to perform well in a challenging environment. For the first time in years, Intel fabs and our substrate supply are close to meeting our customers' demand. Using our IDM advantage, the team was able to remix almost 3 million units within lead time to meet changing demand signals. For example, we were able to partner with Meta to improve their Xeon supply and meet their needs. Finally, our supply chain resilience showed as our teams work tirelessly to mitigate any significant disruptions to our factory operations from the war in Ukraine, supplier shutdowns and COVID lockdowns in China.
Turning to our business groups. At our Investor Day, we laid out our long-term growth strategy centered around 6 distinct but highly complementary business units, a structure that provides investment flexibility, increased market resilience and enhanced transparency for investors. And in fact, we will report our results in this structure for the first time today.
Our client group continues to deliver world-class platforms, positioning us to win share, grow ASP and win share of market. There is broad ecosystem agreement that the long-term PC market is sustainably larger going forward driven by PC density, refresh rates and increased penetration as the PC remains the essential tool for work, learn and play. We are seeing particular strength in gaming and in commercial PCs that is somewhat tempered by a slower consumer inflationary pressure and customer inventory management, which Dave will talk more to later.
Our 12th gen Alder Lake family continues to ramp in Q1, and we have already shipped more than 15 million units. This family now has more than 250 designs planned this year from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, LG, Samsung and others. And it includes the world's fastest desktop processor, the Core i9-1200KS (sic) [ Core i9-12900KS]. Alder Lake will scale across every segment, including for businesses of all sizes with the launch of our latest vPro platform. vPro offers industry-leading manageability and security for business, including the first and only hardware-based ransomware detector with Intel Threat Detection. The strength of our client road map continues with Raptor Lake, where we are shipping both desktop and mobile samples to our customers today, and we plan to follow that with Meteor Lake in 2023.
In data center, DCAI had strong year-on-year growth as customers continue to choose Intel. And as we continue to deliver increasing value and innovation, we are seeing strength in both hyperscaler and enterprise, and we expect the market to grow double digits going forward, driven by workloads like AI and security. Here, too, we are seeing ecosystem supply constraints, particularly in Ethernet that have limited end system shipments, which we expect to be a headwind through the year. Our third-generation Intel Scalable processor Ice Lake has now shipped almost 4 million units, and Amazon Web Services recently announced general availability of its EC2 I4i Instance designed for storage and I/O intensive workloads. This is the 48th AWS Instance powered by Ice Lake.
I am also pleased to say that as committed, we began shipping initial SKUs of our fourth gen Intel Xeon Scalable processor, Sapphire Rapids, to select customers in Q1. These are the first of many SKUs for Sapphire Rapids with more due to ramp throughout the remainder of the year. We also unveiled our expanded dual-track Xeon road map using performance and efficient cores delivered in a common platform, maximizing customer investments and on the cadence they prefer. Our first-generation E-core Xeon will be Sierra Forest, which is designed to maximize performance per watt, providing high-density, ultraefficient compute for the cloud.
For workloads that benefit from high performance per core and low latency like AI, we have our redefined Granite Rapids on Intel 3 with a new and improved P core. The strength of Intel Agilex and Stratix 10 FPGAs generated record revenue as we continue to win designs and ramp into key markets. Intel FPGA-based IPUs are deployed in volume at 5 of the top 6 cloud service providers, and we continue to win designs with comm service providers utilizing Intel's latest generation FPGAs and eASICs.
Our launch of the Habana Gaudi-based AWS EC2 DL1 Instance has shown end customers how they can reduce training costs by as much as 40% versus GPU-based instances. One of the early customers, Mobileye, is now using DL1 for training their object detection models. Gaudi 2 is already sampling the customers and demonstrating leadership performance versus competitive GPUs on multiple workloads. Finally, we continue to build our extensive data center software capabilities and recently announced the acquisition of Granulate. Granulate is a SaaS service that improves performance in cloud costs with its autonomous dynamic optimization service to unmodified customer workloads.
The network and edge market continues to be strong with the transformation from proprietary fixed-function devices to fully programmable, software-defined infrastructure. Our Network and Edge Group is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this transition and had record revenue in Q1.
At Mobile World Congress, NEX launched our newest Xeon D processor, built specifically for software-defined infrastructure across the network and edge. Our latest Xeon D has more than 70 leading companies working on designs, including Cisco, Juniper Networks and Rakuten Symphony. We believe that in the network, O-RAN and vRAN have reached a tipping point as the preferred model of all future network deployments. Nearly all commercial deployments running today are using Xeon and our FlexRAN software. We have more than 10 engagements with major global operators that we expect to be in high-volume commercial deployment within the next 2 years.
We also launched a new version of our OpenVINO software toolkit, with downloads growing 70% year-over-year. Built on the foundation of one API, OpenVINO has enabled hundreds of thousands of developers to dramatically accelerate performance on rapidly growing AI workloads at the edge, including Zeblok Computational who is using OpenVINO to deliver their Ai-MicroCloud solution to cities everywhere.
Going forward, the scale out of 5G, the explosion of AI inferencing and the growth of low latency workloads will further drive the need for compute at the edge. They will eventually begin to shift compute from the cloud, making the edge the next wave of semiconductor growth. With a broad portfolio of hardware, software and deep ecosystem partnerships, NEX remains positioned to lead the transformation across the network and to win the edge.
Moving to our emerging businesses. Our accelerated computing systems and graphics group builds on our installed base of CPUs, IP and software and leverages a thriving open ecosystem to disrupt a large and growing market. In Q1, AXG had strong growth and celebrated a major milestone with the official launch of the Intel Arc A-Series portfolio for laptops. Alchemist, the first of these products, has been shipping to customers since early Q1 with designs from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Samsung and others.
The A-Series enables up to a 2x performance improvement in graphics versus integrated graphics and incorporates Intel Deep Link technology, which utilizes Intel integrated graphics to increase application performance by up to 30%. The first laptops with Intel Arc 3 GPUs are available now. These will be followed by even more powerful designs with Intel Arc 5 and Intel Arc 7, along with desktop and workstation offerings later this year. 
In the data center, our flagship Ponte Vecchio GPU for high-performance computing and AI is sampling to customers. Ponte Vecchio, along with Sapphire Rapids with high-bandwidth memory, will power the 2 exaFLOP Aurora Supercomputer at Oregon National Laboratory. In addition, Arctic Sound, our general purpose data center GPU designed for industry-leading media graphics and AI inference capabilities, will be available in the second half of the year.
Finally, in Q1, we announced our intent to contribute to the development of blockchain technologies. Intel will help advance this technology in a responsible and sustainable way by developing energy-efficient computing technologies at scale. Blockscale, our first blockchain accelerator, is sampling today and will ship in production later this year. AXG remains on track to deliver over $1 billion in revenue this year.
Our Intel foundry services hit a $1 billion run rate for the first time as we continue to make progress towards being the trusted provider of foundry services. Our overall customer pipeline remains robust, and we now have more than 10 qualified opportunities in advanced stages of engagement across our process and package offerings that collectively represent a deal value of greater than $5 billion. We have over 30 test chips committed to Intel 16 this year, and we expect the first Intel 3 and Intel 18A customer test chips to tape out in the second half of 2022. Our work with our 5 target anchor customers is progressing well. We expect additional updates later this year.
Finally, we have seen tremendous enthusiasm from customers for our acquisition of Tower. Tower shareholders recently approved the proposed acquisition. We have completed regulatory review in 2 jurisdictions outside the U.S. and hope to close the transaction as soon as possible. Building on its market leadership in ADAS and AV solutions, Mobileye Advanced system launches have continued, including the next-generation BMW 7 Series with the leading-edge combination of iQ5 and an 8-megapixel camera as well as BMW Highway Assistant, which enables hands-free driving on separated roadways up to 80 miles per hour.
We also added Miami and Stuttgart to our global AV testing program, bringing the total number of places where we have tested AVs to 10 cities in 6 countries across 3 continents. Additionally, we recently showcased Mobileye's Level 4 self-driving system in action for the first time with a robotaxi navigating the streets of Jerusalem. Mobileye expects to launch its commercial robotaxi services in Munich and Tel Aviv by the end of 2022. 
And finally, we remain committed to unlocking shareholder value and are working on our plans to take Mobileye public in 2022. In March, we announced that we confidentially submitted a draft registration statement with the SEC. The IPO is proceeding smoothly, and we continue to make good progress as we work with the SEC to refine our Form S-1.
Before turning it over to Dave, I wanted to close with a few thoughts. First, I look forward to hosting our customers, partners and analysts at our Intel Vision event in Dallas on May 10 and 11. This will be our second Intel ON series event dedicated to the future of business and technology.
Next, as I said at our Investor Day, we believe we have a tremendous growth story over the next several years. We're investing in innovation and embracing an open approach to compute platforms and manufacturing. We continue to add to our incredible pool of technical talent. And of course, we remain intensely focused on rebuilding our execution machine.
Finally, we'll continue to highlight our progress in key operational milestones as we manage within the financial framework we laid out in February. I know I speak for over 120,000 Intel employees when I say that while we have work to do, our best days are ahead. With that, let me turn it over to Dave.",2731
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2022",2022-04-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3615.0,2547679.0,96349855.0,Presenter Speech,David Zinsner,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 was a solid quarter, exceeding revenue, gross margin percentage and EPS guidance despite continued ecosystem supply chain constraints, inflationary pressures and macroeconomic uncertainty. 3 of our 6 newly formed business segments, NEX, Mobileye and IFS, achieved record quarterly revenue.
Revenue was $18.4 billion, slightly exceeding our guidance, led primarily by broad-based strength in our NEX business. Gross margin for the quarter was 53%, exceeding our guidance by 100 basis points on improved manufacturing yields and lower factory costs. EPS was $0.87, $0.07 above our guide on higher gross profit and slightly lower operating expenses. Operational cash flow for the quarter was $5.9 billion, and we received an additional $4.6 billion from the McAfee equity sale. Total cash and investments increased by $9.7 billion in the quarter to $39 billion, driven by the NAND divestiture and McAfee sale. CapEx for the quarter was $4.6 billion.
Now turning to our newly formed business unit results. CCG revenue was $9.3 billion, down 13% year-over-year on ramp down of the Apple CPU and modem business, the expected OEM inventory burn we cited in our Q4 call as well as lower consumer and education demand. CPU ASPs were up greater than 25% year-over-year on richer mix and strong demand for our high-end mobile and desktop products across both our commercial and consumer segments. Operating profit was down 34% year-over-year on lower revenue, increased 10-nanometer and Intel 7 mix and increased spending to further strengthen our product and platform road map.
DCAI revenue was $6 billion, up 22% year-over-year on strong Xeon demand from both our hyperscale and enterprise customers. DCAI operating profit was flat year-over-year as increased revenue was offset by increased 10-nanometer mix, factory start-up charges and increased investments in our technology and product road map.
NEX achieved all-time record quarterly revenue of $2.2 billion, up 23% year-over-year on broad-based strength across the cloud, networking and niche product lines. Operating profit was $366 million, up 51% year-over-year on higher revenue, offset by increased investments. Mobileye achieved all-time record quarterly revenue of $394 million, up 11% sequentially and 5% in comparison to Q1 '21, which saw exceptionally strong auto production and pipeline rebuilding due to COVID-related recovery last year. Operating profit was $148 million, down 13% year-over-year on increased investment in next-generation products.
AXG revenue was $219 million, up 21% year-over-year on the ramp of its supercompute and Alchemist discrete GPU products. Operating loss was $390 million versus an operating loss of $176 million in Q1 '21, with the increase driven by new product qualification reserves on our Alchemist and Arctic Sound products, production ramp charges and increased investment.
IFS revenue was $283 million, up 175% year-over-year on increased IMF tool shipments, increased automotive demand and initial revenue from Amazon and Cisco. Operating loss was $31 million, roughly flat year-over-year as revenue and gross margin increases were offset by increased investments to build out the custom foundry business.
Moving to our full year and Q2 guidance. As Pat mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong end user demand for our products across each of our business units and we reaffirm our revenue guidance of $76 billion, as lower than previously expected PC revenue is offset by NEX growth and DCAI hyperscale customer strength. More specifically, in our PC business, we continue to see strong commercial demand, offset by low-end consumer and education softness and the impact of no longer shipping to customers in Russia and Belarus. Further, component supply constraints continue to be a challenge with the most recent COVID lockdowns in Shanghai, further increasing supply chain risks and contributing to inflationary pressures that are having a negative impact on PC TAM for the year.
As a result, we're seeing OEMs continue to lower inventory levels to better match demand and align with other system components. We expect elements of this inventory burn to continue in Q2, subsiding in the second half of the year. Although these headwinds have reduced our CCG revenue forecast, we expect CCG revenue to increase in the second half of the year as a return to normal seasonality boost demand, OEM inventory burn subsides and the ramp of our leadership Alder Lake and Raptor Lake products position us to compete per share.
For DCAI, we also expect to see a stronger second half of the year as hyperscale customer demand remains robust, component supply improves and the ramp of Ice Lake and Sapphire Rapids increased competitiveness. For NEX, we expect the strength we saw in Q1 to continue with growth throughout the year, fueled by improving component supply, continued 5G ramp and transformation at the edge. For AXG, we continue to expect full year revenue greater than $1 billion, driven by the launch and ramp of the Alchemist, Arctic Sound-M, Ponte Vecchio and Blockscale products. Finally, we expect to see second half growth in each of our 2 remaining businesses, Mobileye and IFS, as they ramp new products and secure new customers.
For gross margin, we're guiding 52%, in line with the 51% to 53% range previously communicated. Note that the inflationary environment creates a headwind that we are continuing to monitor, but we remain confident in our ability to mitigate the impact through continued cost reduction programs as well as increased pricing in certain segments of the business. For EPS, we're guiding $3.60, $0.10 higher than prior guide on the Q1 beat and a slightly improved tax rate of 12%. Finally, net CapEx guidance of $27 billion and moderately negative adjusted free cash flow for the year remain unchanged. We have made significant progress on our smart capital initiatives, and we'll continue to manage within the framework communicated at Investor Day.
Moving to Q2 guidance. For revenue, we're guiding $18 billion, down 2% sequentially on the short-term headwinds detailed earlier and the impact of an additional 14th week in Q1. For the lockdowns in Shanghai, we're estimating the impact to be relatively contained under the assumption that these restrictions are nearing an end. Even under a short lockdown, we anticipate it will take some time for the supply chain to normalize. And if the lockdowns persist or spread beyond Shanghai, we could see more material impacts to our outlook.
For gross margin, we're guiding 51%, down approximately 200 basis points sequentially on increased 10-nanometer and Intel 7 mix and Raptor Lake prequalification reserves. We had always expected Q2 gross margin to be at the low end of our range and with our full year guide of 52%, we expect gross margin to inflect upward in the second half of the year as revenue increases and inventory reserve sell-through. Finally, we're guiding a tax rate of 12% and EPS of $0.70, down $0.17 sequentially on lower gross profit and higher OpEx.

Your inventory is up internally, but you're talking about some of the inabilities to ship with match sets, et cetera, going forward. So can you guys just give a little more color on where the specific Intel inventory is versus a more generic inventory and shortage problem, specifically in the PC side of your business, it seems?",75

Thank you, Ross. And I'll just start out by saying, again, I'm really pleased with the execution of our team and what had plenty of turbulence in Q1, and to meet and beat in Q1 was really spectacular. Now on the inventory piece, we did talk about that we are building 10-nanometer inventory. We have new products that we're ramping into the marketplace. And we do see some of those will be reversals as we go into the latter part of the year as that inventory will start flowing through the product area. So we would say this is very typical management of new product ramps and specifically around Sapphire Rapids, Alder Lake. We'll start seeing Raptor Lake as well. So those will be the key areas that you'll see that inventory shift occurring.
Also, as we've indicated, we did see our customers' inventory burn down in Q1. We expect some of that to be in Q2 as well. But by the second half, we expect those adjustments and obviously the strength of second half outlook, we do expect much of that inventory burn to have finished in the first half and a strong second half as we're ramping our new products that will have much better performance feature, some of that with higher costs, but also coming with higher ASPs.",222

But in that light, obviously, we've got PCs that maybe look like they're at risk. You talked about China shutdowns that if they last longer, that could bring risk. You talked about issues, I guess, with server builds that your customers that you said would persist.
I guess what gives you the confidence that things actually will be inflecting? And it looks like you're looking for kind of a hockey stick across all of your businesses in the second half to first? Like how do investors get confidence that that's after the way things are going to be playing out and that you've built enough conservatism in the guide? I guess, long story short, I'm asking why hold the annual guide back in the wake of all that?",165

Thank you, Stacy. And clearly, we overachieved in Q1, right? Q2, we were -- it's a little bit lighter, right? Given some of those, we've taken it down a bit, given some of those factors, but not substantially. This is very in line with what we expected. We were always forecasting a stronger second half of the year. And that's what gives us confidence. We have built into our year guide some room, right, for things to happen. Like any good company would we built some expectations that not everything goes right. And that's why we're very confident in reaffirming our overall yearly revenue guidance.
Now let's tease apart some of the factors that give us that confidence. First, we'd say, hey, we see strong growth in our DCAI business. We see strong growth in our NEX business. And particularly those areas, those are long lead time businesses with our customers. We have strong views of the business expectations that we have. We do see strength in the enterprise and governance business. First half to second half, you always see the normal cyclicality of the client business. And particularly in the second half, we're going into a much stronger product line with Alder Lake and Raptor Lake and the reversal of inventories for Raptor Lake and Sapphire Rapids starting to hit there as well, which will be very nice to improve both operating -- gross margins as well as the revenue outlook.
And then, right, we have an extraordinary set of products that were coming in the second half of the year. When you think about AXG, we have all of the discrete products ramping in addition to the mobile ones that we launched in Q1. We have our new GPU products with Arctic Sound. We have Ponte Vecchio ramping. We also have our blockchain products ramping. We have the new Xeon and NEX ramping. IFS is ramping. We see strength in our Mobileye business. So all of these give us confidence in the second half.
And this is very consistent with the outlook that we gave in our Investor Day. We were always expecting this to be the characteristic of first half and second half. And obviously, a small beat in Q1, a little bit of weakness in Q2 that we've accounted for these disruptions and strength in the second half. We are on track to do exactly what we said at the Investor Day, and we're building momentum to accomplish exactly that, with the great execution that we saw in the first quarter around products, around manufacturing, around dealing with supply chain challenges. This machine is building momentum. We're confident in our second half outlook.",448

I guess given the change in segments, would love to try to set the stage here for what expectations should look like for the big 3, CCG, DCAI and NEX into Q2.

Thanks, C.J. And overall, this is the first quarter we're giving clear updates against the 6 business units. Clearly, that means things like DCAI, we're pulling out the NEX business from what might have been counted for before as part of data center. And we're giving clear views of how those businesses are performing, respectively.
Overall, what we said in the client business, we'll see the seasonality plus a bit in the client business because of the strength of the product line. In DCAI, we see growth through the second half of the year. And we had strong year-on-year growth in the data center and AI business in Q1. And NEX, we expect that we're growing faster than the market. This is a good business for us. We're uniquely well positioned, and we see the strength of the network and edge being an area of particular growth. We were well over 20% growth rate in that business in Q1. So -- well, I don't think we'll see those kind of growth rates for the rest of the year, but a very strong growth business.
But I'd also highlight that we are seeing the growth businesses, IFS, AXG and Mobileye being very strong growers for us, and they'll start more meaningfully as we go into the second half of the year, which is a little bit of the answer to Stacy's question before, solid growth across all of the business areas of the company, and we're starting to start seeing these new areas contribute in meaningful ways. So overall, affirming the second half of the year, seeing strength in all of the business areas, the product, the execution, all of them getting stronger.",283

And maybe for you, Dave, first, you mentioned 100 basis points driven by improved yields. It's like really music to my ears, as you can imagine. And I'd love to see a bit more. Visibly, this came as a surprise. So what's happening there? And could we hope for like continued improved yields on Intel 7 driving some positive surprise on the gross margin? Or should we assume that this node has a very little room to improve? 
And maybe for Pat on the same topic, Intel 7. I don't know if it reflects reality, but there is a lot of noise in the market about products ramping slowly, which is a cadence at which Sapphire Rapids is ramping. It seems a bit slow, a bit difficult. So my question in all candor is do these nodes, 10-nanometer and Intel 7, make it difficult to get to the market with products? Is that slowing the pace at which Intel can execute on the velocity of the road map? And should we expect things to go much, much faster when you move to Intel 4 and Intel 3?",199
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2022",2022-04-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3615.0,2547679.0,96349870.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,18,"So I'll start, and then I'll ask Dave to jump in. So overall, as we said, our 5 nodes in 4 years, we're performing well. Intel 7 is ramping more rapidly than we would have expected. Intel 4, we updated that we have a Meteor Lake now powered on, which is our first product on Intel 4. Intel 3, we'll see the test wafers on that with our leadership products with Sierra Forest. In fact, just today, we taped out our first Granite Rapids compute die as well. We'll have the test wafers on 20A and 18A, which we expect to be a big foundry node as well. So I'll say, overall, the technology pipeline is doing tremendously well and really proud of our teams there. 
Intel 10, it's ramping very well. We're seeing good yields on that, as Dave reflected, which overall gives us good momentum. In terms of products, Alder Lake has been a star, and it's ramping comfortably ahead of our expectations there, which has reaffirmed the health of Intel 7. Sapphire Rapids that you called out, it was first PRQ this quarter, and many of the additional SKUs, PRQ in Q2 and the second half of the year, and that's why you might be getting some of that views of the more muted ramp there. But we delivered on exactly what we said. First quarter PRQs of Sapphire Rapids, and we'll see strength in that as we go through the rest of the year. Also, Ice Lake has ramped very nicely now for our 10-nanometer server part. So overall, the technology and the manufacturing machine are performing quite well and really bode well for our outlook for this year and the years to come.
So Dave, if you might add?",295

So we had a good quarter in the first quarter in terms of yields. We are going to see a little bit of pressure on 10-nanometer in the second quarter. That's part of the reason we're seeing margins down to the low end of our stated range of 51%. But we do expect 10-nanometer to become a tailwind for us as costs improve through the back half of the year. And although Intel 7 is behind that, we're expecting the same from Intel 7.",85

Thank you, Harlan. And overall, AXG is on track. And we launched the mobile SKUs. We'll have the desktop SKUs coming in Q2. And we'll have more SKUs as we go through the year as well. We'll be filling out the product line. A lot of work, right, in qualifying games. And if you're a gamer, you know that there's just a lot of individual optimization work on some of the key titles. So that work is underway, working with our OEMs to populate their portfolios of products as well. So I'll say you're going to see more and more of that hitting the market, and we'll be filling out -- we have the 3 versions. We'll have the 5, 7 and 9 versions of the products coming out as we go build up that portfolio this year.
And also, as I alluded to, AXG just has a boatload of products that is coming out across different segments, our high-performance computing products, our GPU products for data center, our blockchain of products. So in addition to the discrete graphics products, we have just a lot of products coming out of it. So overall, it's on track for the volume goals as well as for hitting the $1 billion revenue goal that we said at Investor Day as we go build, as we said, over the 5-year horizon to a $10-plus billion business.
We see this as a great opportunity for us. And we have some unfair advantages with technologies like Deep Link, where we really get to build on the strong robust installed base that we have, the many years of software work that we've built into the foundations of the PC platform. So these are reasons that we do think that we have a great opportunity to build a major new business for us and one that's -- we're coming from a very small place into a very large market, a great growth opportunity for Intel that we're executing on aggressively.",333

Overall, CapEx is lumpy as we go through the year. And as such, we think overall that we'll still be on track to the overall CapEx target that we laid out. We are working very aggressively with the equipment companies. And we have deep, strong, long-term relationships there. And clearly, some of the '23 and '24 equipment goals are ones that we're working on aggressively right now, but we do feel comfortable that we have the supply chain lined up to meet our equipment objectives and really importantly, to meet the factory ramp cycles that we've laid out for the marketplace as we're opening up the new factories like we just announced. Our Oregon fab coming online. We have the next -- we're starting to take equipment now into our Ireland. We'll soon be doing that for our Israel fab ramp. We'll be groundbreaking on Ohio later this year. We'll be talking more about the German fab.
So one by one, we're just executing on an aggressive build-out of our capital network, and really quite pleased with the relationship that we have with the equipment companies to make that possible. That said, there definitely is some pressure on the equipment supply chain. We're also working closely with the equipment vendors. Many of them use Intel FPGAs. So we're working closely to make sure that we prioritize that piece of the demand to support them in that requirement. Dave, anything else you'd add?",254

I would just add that we did expect this quarter to be a bit lower than the quarterly average for the year to get to the $27 billion. So it's not a complete surprise, although it was lumpy, as you said, and did come in a little bit lighter. But we feel good.
I would say the other thing is that when you look at it, I think we feel confident about the $28 billion growth CapEx. The $27 billion net CapEx obviously assumes a $1 billion of capital offsets. And I'd say the early read, and of course, we're still early in the year, but looks quite good. So there's a potential we could actually do a bit better on the offset side, so that the net CapEx could potentially be a little bit [ low ].",139

The revenue, I guess, went from $5 billion to $6 billion from last year, and you have operating margin down, I guess, 7 points. And I guess it's no surprise after some of the disclosures that we had last year. But maybe you could tease that apart a little bit mix between enterprise and cloud, were there big changes there? And I guess the real question, Pat, is what gets that margin moving in the right direction? Is it the move to Sapphire where you have multi-die products that might yield better? Is it revenue growth? I'm just trying to understand the drivers to turn around the operating margin in that segment as we go forward.",128
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2022",2022-04-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3615.0,2547679.0,96349885.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,33,"Yes. And I'll start on that one. Overall, the DCAI performed a little bit better than we expected for Q1. So I'd say, overall, this is what we expected. The biggest factor on margins was the ramp of the 10-nanometer product line and the costs associated with that. So that was the biggest factor associated with it. As we're looking at that, there also was, I'll say, relative strength in the cloud piece of that business, the hyperscalers and the enterprise piece of the business was a little bit more constrained by match set. So we did see a little bit of that effect in Q1.
As we go through the rest of the year, we do see good outlooks on both the hyperscaler as well as on the enterprise and government side. We're working aggressively to solve the match set problems. So we are hopeful that we'll be able to do a bit better in that area if we are able to address some of the shortages that we've seen in areas like Ethernet. Obviously, as we go into the second half of the year, the product line gets stronger. As we see Sapphire Rapids ramp, we'll be launching products like Sapphire Rapids. HBM and the HPC segment will be ramping Ice Lake more aggressively with higher volumes as we go into the second half of the year. So all of those start moving the product line in the right direction and margins commensurately with it.
We also have gotten great response for the longer-term view of our segment and road map. And as we've laid out, we'll have both the efficient cores as well as the performance cores which better satisfy the market requirements. And I believe that will be a factor of better pricing as better -- as well as better margins over time because you're not trying to stretch one product across really 2 distinct segments of the marketplace and really having highly optimized products for both the hyperscaler as well as the broader enterprise requirements.
So overall, we think that the strategy that we've laid out, we've gotten great response from our customers for it. And as I already indicated, we're executing as we set Sapphire Rapids' first PRQ this quarter, many more as we go through the rest of the year, and we'll be ramping that aggressively and seeing a good response from the customers. And I'd also say, particularly with Sapphire Rapids, every hyperscaler, every OEM has many SKUs lined up for this. This product will be extremely well respected, accepted and broadly deployed in the marketplace this year.

I guess the first question is, TSMC is kind of pushing out the timing of the high-volume 3-nanometer EUV. And I guess the first question is sort of how that impacts your GPU and your CPU road map? And then I had a follow-up where really, Dave, I wanted to ask you on how you're going to account for subsidies. Are you going to account for those kind of in a contra account, so that as the depreciation ramps, you could offset some of that with that contra account coming from subsidies?",95

And on the first part of it, clearly, the implications of foundry timing is something we have to work very carefully. And there is not just a question of the timing of a node, it's also the capacity of nodes. And with some of those changes that have been reported in the industry, we're just working through that with our product teams to make sure that we're aligning well to the availability of the foundry technologies.
But I would say that our IDM model just gives us fundamentally an advantaged business model here, where given the majority of our volumes are internal, we are able to balance between what we use externally for wafers and what we use internally for wafers. And thus, we're able to do a much better job satisfying our customers and having a more competitive product line.
I'd also again add, Tim, that our execution of our 5 nodes in 4 years on or ahead of schedule across it. This just reinforces the competitiveness that we've described where we do see ourselves coming back to a position of unquestioned process technology leadership, and we're building out the manufacturing capacity at scale to deliver that to our customers. So IDM 2.0, well leveraging the foundries, but even more importantly, building leadership technologies with that scale manufacturing to deliver the most robust product line in the industry.

So it somewhat depends on the -- which capital offset you're talking about. The grant are usually aligned with a certain set of assets. And so they are contra and they get depreciated over the same life cycle of the asset. Things like [indiscernible] we talked about is a bit more of a financing arrangement. So it doesn't necessarily have an impact on the P&L, but it will be shown on the capital statement as a capital offset, like a partner contribution that will reduce our -- the cash flow burn we have.
Prepays are handled more or less like they show up as an asset on the balance sheet. And as you ship products, you reduce that account. So it's somewhat dependent on which one we're talking about. But the one I think that you're talking about is the government incentives, and yes, you're right there, they're contra accounts. They're on the contra.",156

And the answer is yes, we're going to be delivering the GPU products first for mobile, as we said, next for desktop. It will be game-centric as we're bringing them out of the marketplace. But we're also going to have a full lineup and we see actually some very unique advantages as we think about media, some of the professional developers where we're already demonstrating radically advantaged positions like on some of the advanced graphics and media artist product lines.
So these will be areas of strength, particularly when we bring our Arctic Sound product into the marketplace later this year. This will be well optimized for GPU environments and particularly will be strong in areas like encoding and media processing as well that if you think about cloud, you can certainly think about AI and training workloads, but many clouds are actually spending far more time on transcoding and media operations. So that will be an area of unique strength of our Arctic Sound product line. 
So -- and if you think about that taken together, we'll be competing in the integrated graphics, the discrete graphics, the GPU business. The high-performance computing business will really be leveraging that technology across the entire space of the market. And that's part of the reason that we're very encouraged by our ability to ramp this into a very significant business for Intel, and one where we have a lot of advantages to build upon.",245

Can you talk about how the ecosystem is coming together given that this is a new platform, especially in DDR5 and PCIe 5.0, et cetera? My question -- the real question is I just want to understand what your expectation for the ramp is versus the previous generations. Do you think this is going to be faster ramp versus Ice Lake? Or this is going to be a slower ramp? And also, when do you expect we'll see a public cloud instance based on Sapphire Rapids?",97
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2022",2022-04-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3615.0,2547679.0,96349896.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,44,"Yes. Great question, Srini. And clearly, one of the things that Intel as the market leader, right, the volume leader, it is this ability to ramp key new technologies. And with the Sapphire platform comes DDR5. And if we were talking 90 days ago, we were fighting through some challenges on DDR5 with the memory suppliers and really working on debugging those interfaces. We now feel very confident that multiple suppliers are now qualified. We're seeing good momentum from the memory partners in this area. They're ramping up their supply chains for the Sapphire platform, right? It's really that one that brings a major new memory technology into the marketplace and really reinforces Intel as the leader in data center and server market.
Overall, we're modeling very carefully, your exact question about looking at this versus the Ice Lake ramp. And our objective is to ramp this platform meaningfully faster than we did the Ice Lake platform. We're doing a lot of work for the software stack, the validation of that, making sure that we've really worked through all of the early sitings that customers would have, driving down the defect rates in the platform that our customers can ramp this at volume. And as I already indicated, we're seeing a tremendous amount of SKUs and instance types across all of the OEMs as well as all of the hyperscalers in the marketplace, and we're looking forward to those being broadly available in the second half of the year.
As we -- and I think then maybe just wrapping up the call today, we're grateful for all of you joining us the opportunity to update you on the business. It's great that we start the year with a beat. We are looking at the momentum of the execution machine of Intel seeing solid progress. So 5 nodes in 4 years, Alder Lake, Sapphire Rapids, Arc launch, increasing momentum with our customers. We remain true to this building out of a geographically balanced and more resilient supply chain. And there's just lots of good things in flight that gives us confidence, not only in Q2 but to reaffirm our guidance for the year.
And our leadership team, we're fired up, and we believe that this is the greatest turnaround story in history, and it's my honor as the CEO of this great company to be able to be part of this leadership team. So thank you all for joining us today.",410

While we continue to make solid progress on our strategy, Q2 results were disappointing, below the standards we have set for the company and below the commitments we have made to you, our shareholders. The sudden and rapid decline in economic activity was the largest driver of the shortfall, but Q2 also reflected our own execution issues in areas like product design, DCAI and the ramp of AXG offerings. We have an obligation to remain vigilant and to respond to changing business conditions while not losing sight of our long-term goals and opportunities. We will look to do both by adjusting and refocusing our spending levels in the near term at the same time as we accelerate the deployment of our smart capital strategy and improve product execution. Collectively, these actions will begin to show dividends in the second half of the year, allowing us to return gross margins to our target range by Q4 and maintain our initial free cash flow outlook for 2022.  
While still early in our journey, we remain laser-focused on executing to our strategy to deliver leadership products, anchored on open and secure platforms, powered by at-scale manufacturing and supercharged by our people. The current economic backdrop only strengthens our result, and we are embracing this environment to accelerate our transformation.  
For example, regaining our leadership begins with Moore's Law and the capacity to deliver it at scale. Over the last 18 months, we've taken the right steps to establish a strong footing for our TD roadmap. We are well into the ramp of Intel 7, now shipping in excess of 35 million units. Intel 4 is ready for volume production in second half of this year, and Intel 3, 20A and 18A are all at or ahead of schedule.  
We've received additional strong third-party validation for TD, IFS and our manufacturing group just this week when we announced MediaTek as our next major foundry customer, a great example of our One Intel culture. 
I want to congratulate our teams on what we expect to be many announcements as we execute to become an at-scale, leading edge, geographically diversified systems foundry. But we must also be clear eyed as we look into the second half. We are planning for volatility as the world adjusts to the end of a 2-plus year pandemic and the unprecedented stimulus governments used to fight it. 
Across the economy, supply chain issues have both limited the ability to meet demand in some areas and driven inventory well above normal levels in others. We are prepared to manage through a slowdown typical of the normal cycles the semiconductor industry has experienced over the last 50 years. While the depth and duration are still difficult to predict, we have a proven track record of being able to adjust and succeed in any environment.  
Let me address some of the specific actions we are taking. First, we further sharpened our focus in Q2, selling our Drone business and making the difficult decision to wind down our efforts in Optane as we embrace CXL, a standard which Intel Corporation pioneered. These add to actions last year in NAND in the sale of McAfee. In total, we have now exited 6 businesses since my return, providing roughly $1.5 billion for investments aligned with our IDM 2.0 strategy.  
We are also lowering core expenses in calendar year '22, and we'll look to take additional actions in the second half of the year, which Dave will address later. Importantly, expense discipline is not impacting the strategy, and we remain firmly on track to achieve process performance parity in 2024 and unquestioned leadership in 2025. This goal is our true North Star.  
Second, our ability to invest aggressively and fulfill our commitment to a strong and growing dividend is anchored by the progress we are making in deploying our smart capital strategy. We are thrilled to see the bipartisan vote in the Congress this week and expect CHIPS Act to be on the President's desk shortly. 
We have been integrally involved in moving this groundbreaking legislation forward. This progress, combined with the strong momentum in Europe, will reshape our industry and bring us toward a geographically balanced, resilient supply chain that we are uniquely positioned to enable and benefit from. Access to mission-aligned pools of capital supports the accelerated pursuit of our strategy and will enable our torrid pace.  
Third, I rejoined Intel to reenergize and reestablish a culture of execution and innovation. With process technology and capacity expansion both now trending very well, we have the critical foundation we need for improved product execution. We have rebuilt our leadership team, now fully assembled for the first time. And together, we have reestablished OKRs throughout the organization to drive common purpose and, importantly, a system of accountability.  
In the coming months, we will begin to share more with the investment community on the next evolution of our TikTok model to drive consistent and predictable cadence of process and design innovation.  
As we look beyond the near term, the semiconductor industry continues to be at the beginning of a new structural growth phase driven by 4 superpowers: one, ubiquitous compute; two, pervasive connectivity; three, cloud-to-edge infrastructure; and four, AI. Combined, these drivers support a semiconductor industry eclipsing $1 trillion by 2030. What remains very clear even during this period of uncertainty is the growing importance of silicon to the global economy and to each of our daily lives.  
However, as a result of macro weaknesses, we now expect the PC TAM to decline roughly 10% in calendar year '22, characterized by broadening consumer weakness and relative strength in enterprise and higher-end SKUs. Importantly, our Q2 PC unit volumes suggests we are shipping below consumption as some of our largest customers are reducing inventory levels at a rate not seen in the last decade and, along with some pricing actions, should allow for sequential growth into the second half even as some customers manage inventory lower.  
While COVID-related dynamics, like work-from-home and school-from-home, pulled forward some demand, they also solidified the PC as an essential tool in the post-pandemic world. For example, PC and Chromebook usage remains historically high even as the pandemic's most acute impacts diminished. Markedly higher per PC usage and a larger installed base, including 600 million PCs that are 4 years and older, supports a PC TAM sustainably above 300 million units.  
Data center trends are still well entrenched. Data has been growing exponentially at a 50% CAGR for over 20 years. But until recently, it has been uneconomical to turn that data into true actionable insights. With the advent of AI, along with CPUs, GPUs and accelerators, we now have the tools to access and use more of the data we create, driving significantly higher compute demand and a multiyear CAGR in the data center TAM of at least mid-teens.  
Despite these drivers, demand will not be immune from economic headwinds. In addition to match set issues, which have constrained shipments for multiple quarters, increasing economic concerns are leading to a reduction in second half demand. As a result, we have lowered our server TAM assumptions to reflect more modest growth in 2022.  
Against this backdrop, let me highlight key developments in our businesses. In response to supply chain and match set issues, we closely collaborated with our customers and suppliers to effectively address their most critical needs. We rapidly adjusted to changing market conditions, made cost reductions and leveraged smart capital to execute towards our IDM 2.0 strategy.  
Despite significantly lower revenue impacting overall gross margins, Q2 saw continued strong performance in our factory network, and we exceeded our wafer cost goals with 10-nanometer unit cost declining approximately 8% year-on-year. In TD, we continued to deliver on the promise of Moore's Law and our ambitions to deliver 1 trillion transistors in the device by 2030.  
Intel 4 details were released at the recent VLSI conference to positive reviews, and we've now taped in the first stepping of the Granite Rapids CPU and expect to power on this quarter. In the second half of this year, we plan to tape in numerous internal and foundry customer test chips on various process nodes, including Intel 3 and Intel 18A.  
In our client business, Alder Lake momentum continues. We have the strongest PC lineup in 5-plus years, and we remain unapologetic about our growing leadership and share position. We are building on Alder Lake leadership with Raptor Lake in the second half of this year and Meteor Lake in 2023, exemplifying how our innovative design decisions can drive leadership performance even before reestablishing best-in-class transistor technology.  
In Q2, we launched the 12th Gen Intel Core HX processors, the final products in our Alder Lake family. The Alder Lake family is now powering more than 525 designs from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, LG, Microsoft, Samsung and others. To date, we've shipped well in excess of 35 million units of Alder Lake. 
Within the current market, we are also seeing relative strength in the premium segments we serve across consumer and commercial. We expect to build on this momentum with the launch of our next-gen product family, Raptor Lake, starting with our desktop SKUs this fall, followed by our mobile family by the end of the year. The Raptor Lake family will offer customers significant advantages, including double-digit performance gains, gen-on-gen and socket compatibility with Alder Lake.  And in 2023, we will deliver our first disaggregated CPU built on Intel 4, Meteor Lake, which is showing good health in both our and our customers' labs.  
Turning to DCAI, as we stated at Investor Day, over the next couple of years, as we rebuild our server product portfolio, we expect to grow slower than the overall data center market. It's not a fact we like but the forecast we see.  We have a singular focus to regain performance and TCO leadership across all workloads and use cases from enterprise to cloud. 
The advantage of our incumbency position remains underappreciated and provides significant opportunity to drive outsized advantages to our customers. For example, we expanded our supply agreement with Meta, leveraging our IDM advantage to ensure Meta can meet its expanding compute needs. Also in Q2, we agreed to expand our partnership with AWS to include the co-development of multigenerational data center solutions optimized for AWS infrastructure. And Intel is a strategic customer for internal workloads, including EDA. We expect these custom Xeon solutions will bring greater levels of differentiation and a durable TCO advantage to AWS and their customers, including Intel.  
In addition, NVIDIA announced the selection of Sapphire Rapids for use in their new DGX H100, which will couple Sapphire Rapids with NVIDIA's Hopper GPUs to deliver unprecedented AI performance.  
Beyond Xeon-based CPUs, we launched our next-generation Gaudi2 AI accelerator in the quarter, with a whopping 4x improvement generation to generation. And in the most recent MLPerf training benchmark test, Gaudi2 has a substantial lead in ResNet-50 and BERT benchmarks.  
In the second quarter, we also began delivering our software strategy with the acquisition of Granulate, expanding our platform capabilities with real-time AI-driven continuous optimizations for cloud computing and the initial release of Amber, our security attestation service. Since we acquired Granulate, their customer pipeline has doubled and their revenue pipeline has tripled.  
Finally, Programmable Solutions achieved record 2Q revenue and was just shy of an all-time record revenue quarter driven by strong demand, including the ramp of the flagship Agilex FPGA family and improving supply.  
In NEX, we had an outstanding Q2. We achieved record revenue in PRQ-ed Mount Evans, an IPU we co-developed and are now beginning to ramp with a large hyperscale partner with additional customers in 2023. In addition, our latest Xeon D processor built specifically for software-defined infrastructure across the network and edge, launched at this year's Mobile World Congress and is ramping with leading companies, including Cisco, Juniper Networks and Rakuten Symphony.  
Across the network edge, we're continuing to see interest to deploy more compute and AI capabilities. For example, Ferrovial, a multinational Spanish infrastructure company is using our edge computing, AI and connectivity technologies to deploy roadside solutions that can identify wrong way drivers, warn of oncoming hazards and more.  
In Singapore, Singtel has deployed a network solution with Xeon Smart Edge and OpenVINO to improve user experience for use cases like entertainment, industrial, smart manufacturing, smart transportation and smart city.  
Lastly, ABB is helping utility providers modernize their electric grid and create a more sustainable energy market by adopting standardized rugged servers based on third-gen Intel Xeon. NEX continues to clearly benefit from networks that are increasingly moving towards software and AI that is increasingly moving to the edge, and we expect another revenue record quarter in Q3.  
For AXG, while we will not hit our GPU unit target, we remain on track to deliver over $1 billion in revenue this year. In Q2, we started to ramp Intel Art Graphics for laptops and OEMs, including Samsung, Lenovo, Acer, HP and Asus. COVID-related supply chain issues and our own software readiness challenges caused the availability delays that we continue to work to overcome.  
Intel Arc A5 and A7 desktop cards will start to ship in Q3. Our energy-efficient blockchain accelerator, Blockscale, achieved a major milestone in Q2 with revenue shipments to our lead customers going from tape-in to shipping in less than a year. We expect to ship millions of units this year, not originally in our forecast. 
Our data center GPU, codenamed Arctic Sound-M, has started production and is now shipping to customers, supporting a diverse range of workloads starting with media streaming and cloud gaming, followed by support for AI visual inference and virtual desktops.  
In high-performance computing, we highlighted the installation of the Argonne National Lab Aurora Supercomputer at our Intel Vision events in May, and we are on track to deliver over 10,000 blades in 2022, enabling over 2 exaflops of peak performance. We also announced new partnerships, including the Barcelona Supercomputing Center to set up a pioneering RISC-V zettascale lab and our continued collaboration with the University of Cambridge to evolve their current lab from exascale to zettascale. 
Our IFS momentum continues, creating a geographically balanced secure and resilient semiconductor supply chain as well as access to our transistor technology is driving strong customer interest in our foundry business. In addition to the MediaTek agreement that we announced earlier this week, we now have active engagements with 6 of the top 10 fabless customers across our offerings, including 18A. 
Overall, we are engaged with 30 customers for test chips, and now have more than 10 qualified opportunities in advanced stages across our process and package offerings that collectively represents a deal value of greater than $6 billion. 
Augmenting our organic activity is our proposed acquisition of Tower Semiconductor. We now have regulatory approval or clearance in 4 geographies, including the U.S., and we still expect the acquisition to close by early next year. 
In Q2, we also launched the IFS Cloud Alliance, a partnership with leading cloud providers, including Microsoft Azure and AWS and EDA tool providers, including Ansys, Cadence, Siemens EDA and Synopsys. The IFS Cloud Alliance is the next phase of our accelerator ecosystem program that will enable secure design environments in the cloud, improving foundry customer design efficiency and accelerating time to market. 
Lastly, in Mobileye, we achieved another record quarter in revenue in Q2, and we continue to be poised to unlock further value with our proposed IPO later this year, pending market conditions. Mobileye's backlog continues to grow, with first half 2022 design wins generating 37 million units of projected future business compared to 16 million units actually shipped in the first half. As a result to Mobileye's high-definition map product called REM, we are currently crowdsourcing 43 million miles per day on average from approximately 1.5 million vehicles. This data is automatically built into a map, which currently covers greater than 90% of all roads in both Europe and U.S., which will support systems across the entire driving assist to autonomous vehicle spectrum. 
Looking ahead, before turning it over to Dave, I want to close with a few thoughts. First, after a very successful Intel Vision event in Q2, I am looking forward to hosting Intel Innovation on September 27 and 28, our core technical conference for global developers, architects and engineering leaders. I hope to see many of you joining me there. 
Second, as I said when we began our journey, Intel will be a source of innovation, driving new businesses and additional TAM in large and growing markets. Taken together, we have already announced over 10 new revenue-producing product lines so far this year, which are just beginning to ramp, and we expect to announce more in the second half and calendar year '23. The foundations for our growth story are taking shape. I know I speak for all of our employees when I say that, while we have work to do, our best days are ahead.",2847
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2022",2022-07-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,4061.0,2608275.0,98382404.0,Presenter Speech,David Zinsner,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Pat. Good afternoon, everyone. As Pat referenced, Q2 was a challenging quarter, negatively impacted by multiple factors. First, a weakening and uncertain macroeconomic environment impacted by inflation, higher interest rates and the war in Ukraine. Second, a much larger-than-expected OEM inventory correction as our customers adjust to this new macroeconomic environment. Third, worse-than-expected COVID-driven demand reductions and supply dislocations in China and other parts of the supply chain. Due to the difficult macroeconomic environment, together with our own execution challenges, our results for the quarter were well below expectations and necessitate a significant revision to our full year financial guidance. 
That said, we're taking the actions necessary to maintain our prior full year adjusted free cash flow guidance, including a slowdown in hiring, CapEx reductions and the expectation for increased capital offsets, consistent with our smart capital strategy. We remain fully committed to the business strategy and long-term financial model presented during this year's investor meeting in February. 
Revenue was $15.3 billion, 15% below our original Q2 guidance as our CCG and DCAI businesses both underperformed our expectations. Note that even in this challenging environment, our NEX and Mobileye businesses achieved all-time record quarterly revenue. Gross margin for the quarter was approximately 45%, 600 basis points below guidance on lower revenue and Sapphire Rapids preproduction charges, offset by lower manufacturing costs. 
EPS was $0.29, $0.41 below our guide on lower revenue and gross profit, offset by lower operating expenses. Operational cash flow for the quarter was $800 million. CapEx for the quarter was $7.2 billion, resulting in an adjusted cash flow of negative $6.4 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong with cash and investments of $27.5 billion, modest leverage and a strong investment-grade credit profile. 
Now turning to our business unit results. CCG revenue was $7.7 billion, below expectations and down 25% year-over-year on global TAM weakness, particularly in the consumer education and small-medium business markets. The shortfall was also driven by OEM inventory reductions as we work with our customers to lower their inventory, protect market share and continue to manage through match set constraints. 
CPU ASPs were up 11% year-over-year on richer mix and strong demand for our high-end mobile and desktop products across both our commercial and consumer segments. Operating profit was $1.1 billion, down 73% year-over-year, on lower revenue, increased 10-nanometer and Intel 7 mix and increased spending to further strengthen our product and platform roadmap. 
DCAI revenue was $4.6 billion, below expectations and down 16% year-over-year on OEM inventory reductions, mix-related ASP decline and competitive pressures. Operating profit was $214 million, down 90% year-over-year on lower revenue, higher advanced node start-up costs, increased investment in the product roadmap and Sapphire Rapids' preproduction charges. 
NEX achieved all-time record quarterly revenue of $2.3 billion, up 11% year-over-year on strength in data center networking products, specifically networking Ethernet and 5G. Operating profit was $241 million, down 60% year-over-year on mix shift to networking Ethernet and 5G, increased investment in process technology and lower sell-through of reserved inventory. 
AXG revenue was $186 million, up 5% year-over-year on the ramp of supercompute and Alchemist discrete GPU products. Operating loss was $507 million versus an operating loss of $168 million in Q2 '21, with the increase driven by inventory reserves on our Ponte Vecchio and Alchemist products, and increased investment to deliver the roadmap of visual supercompute and custom accelerated graphics products. 
Mobileye achieved all-time record quarterly revenue of $460 million, up 41% year-over-year, outperforming the rate of increase of global automotive production, which was relatively flat year-over-year. Operating profit was $190 million, up 43% year-over-year on higher revenue, partially offset by increased investment in next-generation ADAS products. 
IFS revenue was $122 million, down 54% year-over-year, driven by lower mass tool sales, as well as revenue decrease in the automotive segment due to customer shortages in the automotive market. Operating loss was $155 million versus an operating profit of $52 million in Q2 '21, driven by lower revenue and increased investment to build out the custom foundry business. 
Before we transition to full year and Q3 guidance, after 6 months on the job, let me provide my perspectives on the opportunities I see and focus areas to improve our financial performance and achieve our long-term goals. 
At the highest level, I see opportunities to improve in 2 areas. First, ensuring we are allocating our capital to the programs that are clearly aligned to our revised business strategy and generate maximum long-term value to our shareholders. As Pat mentioned, 2 good examples of continuing to optimize our portfolio are exiting the Optane and Drone businesses. We continue to deeply evaluate all opportunities to more narrowly focus our resources on the highest value programs, increasing the probability of success for each of these programs. 
Second, driving structural product cost and operational expense efficiency across the company, taking full advantage of our IDM 2.0 strategy. A major focus for me is driving Intel to world-class product cost. Key to this is executing our 5 nodes and 4-year strategy, but there are many more aspects to achieving this goal with programs in flight to dramatically reduce product cost. Likewise, there are opportunities in OpEx to ensure we are achieving world-class efficiency in everything we do. With my history in the memory business where every penny counts, I know there are large opportunities for Intel to improve and deliver maximum output per dollar. As part of these focus areas, we expect to see restructuring charges in Q3, and I'll continue to provide regular updates on these efforts. 
Moving to our full year and Q3 guidance. For the remainder of the year, we expect macroeconomic conditions to continue to soften with the potential for a recessionary scenario to materialize. There's also risk for continued COVID-related impacts on demand and the supply chain to continue throughout the year. As a result of this high level of uncertainty, we're moving to a range-based approach to revenue guidance for the rest of the year. 
For full year revenue, we are now guiding a range of $65 billion to $68 billion, down from our prior guidance of $76 billion, driven by lower expectations for our CCG and DCAI businesses. More specifically, in our PC business, as Pat discussed, we now see TAM decreasing approximately 10% year-over-year due to the softening macroeconomic environment and inflationary pressures. Although these headwinds have reduced our CCG revenue forecast, we expect CCG revenue to increase in the second half of the year due to seasonal strength, OEM inventory returning to balanced levels, inflation-related price increases to take effect and the ramp of our leadership Alder Lake and Raptor Lake products to position us to compete for share. 
For DCAI, we expect to see second half revenue growth relative to Q2 levels, but growth will remain muted as competitive and macroeconomic headwinds persist, OEM inventory reductions continue and component constraints impact certain segments. 
For NEX, we expect another record quarter in Q3 and continued growth throughout the year. NEX revenue tailwinds will be fueled by new product introductions, data center and telco networking demand and continued improvement in pricing and component supply. 
For AXG, we continue to expect full year revenue greater than $1 billion, driven by the launch and ramp of the Alchemist, Arctic Sound-M, Ponte Vecchio and Blockscale products. And finally, we expect to see second half growth in each of our 2 remaining businesses, Mobileye and IFS as they ramp new products and secure new customers. 
For full year gross margin, we're guiding to 49% at the midpoint of revenue guidance with the expectation that gross margin will return to the low end of our target range of 51% to 53% in Q4 as revenue increases, we achieve scale on new product ramps and costs continue to improve. We're forecasting a tax rate of approximately 8% and EPS of $2.30 at the midpoint of the revenue guidance. 
For net CapEx, we're revising down our forecast to $23 billion, $4 billion less than our previous guidance as we moderately adjust our investment in capacity and take advantage of potentially larger than originally forecast capital [ assets ], highlighting significant progress on our smart capital strategy. We expect these actions to offset lower than originally forecast operating cash flow, allowing us to reaffirm adjusted free cash flow of negative $1 billion to negative $2 billion for the year. 
Finally, we paid dividends of $1.5 billion, a 5% increase year-over-year, and remain committed to growing the dividend over time. 
Now moving to Q3 guidance. Given the aforementioned market environment, we're guiding revenue of $15 billion to $16 billion. At the midpoint of the revenue guidance, we're guiding gross margin of 46.5%, a tax rate of 13% and earnings per share of $0.35. 
In closing, the market turbulence and updated outlook are disappointing. However, we believe our turnaround is clearly taking shape and expect Q2 and Q3 to be the financial bottom for the company. 
We remain completely committed to the strategy and financial model communicated at Investor Day. The long-term financial opportunity of compelling revenue growth and free cash flow at 20% of revenue remains. And I believe this downturn represents an opportunity to more quickly make the transformations necessary to achieve these goals. 
With that, let me turn it back over to John and get to your questions.",1553

Would love to hear what gives you confidence that inventory correction and the supply chain issues will be behind you. And as part of that, do you think a PC TAM of down 10% is conservative enough or is that something where there might be further risk ahead?",64
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2022",2022-07-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,4061.0,2608275.0,98382408.0,Answer,David Zinsner,,Executives,7,"So when you look at the fourth quarter, first of all, we are, at this point, given the inventory burns in both CCG and DCAI, shipping it below the rate of consumption for those markets. And so there is a natural recovery that occurs that we would expect as we progress through the rest of the year once inventory is in a good place. So we do feel we're at the bottom here in terms of revenue in the Q2, Q3 time frame, and Q4 would recover just based on that alone. 
I'd say the other thing is we've got a good set of products coming out over the course of the second half of the year. And I think we're kind of operating with wind at our sails in terms of product offerings in all of our businesses. 
And then third, we are increasing pricing, and pricing generally takes effect in the fourth quarter. We've done a fair amount of time. The advantage of the IDM strategy is we can absorb a lot of inflationary impacts that others can't. And so we were able to kind of go a little longer in terms of the price increases. But at this point, now that some of those pricing inflationary increases have turned out to be more permanent, where there is a certain amount of that, that we do need to pass on to the customers and they're comfortable to do that. And so that also is a factor. 
And then lastly, I would just say the fourth quarter is generally just a seasonally strong quarter for us and particularly in the PC space. So I think all of those factors give us really good confidence that Q2, Q3 represent the bottom for revenue. And at the fourth quarter, we'll see some strength.",302

On the PC TAM, before we were above the market. And with our down revision, we're now exactly aligned with the market. We were over 350 million units before. Now market ranges are 310 million to 325 million. Our range is consistent with that, C.J. So we don't see ourselves ahead of the market like we were before. We were more optimistic now we're firmly in line with the market.
Clearly, the market has shifted heavily on the consumer side, but there remains strength on the enterprise side, which also gives us confidence. So in addition to the strength of the product roadmap, which Dave said, we also see the enterprise market remaining very healthy. And our position in the higher price points in the enterprise, these are good markets for us. And as we're on the back of Alder Lake, over 35 million units, Raptor Lake ramping, we're just coming into a great cycle of the overall business. 
We'd also say that the PC is strong as that work-from-home, school-from-home device usage numbers are up significantly for the time that people use their PCs. We also have a strong replacement cycle in front of us. We now have over 600 million PCs that are over 4 years old. We're definitely seeing that roll through the enterprise markets, again, where we have stronger market share and better ASPs. 
So all of that taken together, we think we've ranged it, and that's consistent with the financial guidance that we've given you for the rest of the year.",280

I mean, I can understand the PC market being weak, but for data center to be almost 25% below expectations, that seems very strange to me. So I'm just curious why Intel took these actions. 
And then when we look at your data center revenue, especially in the reported quarter, most enterprise and cloud customers reported their sales and spending kind of in line with expectations. So is it mostly competitive pressures? If you could just help us understand what the thought process was for Q2.",102
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2022",2022-07-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,4061.0,2608275.0,98382412.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,11,"Yes. Thanks, Vivek. I think that officially is actually 2 questions. But anyway, we'll take them both. On the market side, we'll say we were well into the quarter and we saw the market characteristics change quite suddenly, right? And that resulted in both the sell-through in the marketplace, but also these significant inventory adjustments. We work with our customers on those inventory adjustments. And as we said, these are like once in 10-year kind of inventory adjustments because the customers were working through the quarter, catching up to demand that was short for years, right? 
And all of a sudden, as they saw that shifting, they took quite significant adjustments to their inventory positions. And we wanted to be in a position that we had some thoughtful view of what the market was for the future. So that's the reason that brought us to today. We think that we've given you a clear view of where the market is coming into the future. 
The DCAI point, as I said in my formal comments, we were disappointed. Some of that was driven by the macro. It was also match set issues that we've been struggling with as well and Ethernet components, power supply components, et cetera, have been challenged. But as we also said, we have some of our own unique execution issues, and we kept the quality bar high on Sapphire Rapids. And thus, we did another stepping, which was a forecast, which puts some inventory and reserve issues in front of us as opposed to high ASP, new product revenue. So some of those things were unique issues to us that we were addressing. 
That said, we do feel like the progress on the data center, right, is clear in front of us. We have -- Emerald is looking very good. We'll be powering on Sapphire or Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids shortly. All of that taken together, we feel our competitive position is improving. We also see that's -- we know where the market share is, and wins like we announced with AWS and Meta, we are going to focus on every socket, every workload, every customer quite aggressively on both AWS and Meta. These were substantial wins for us this quarter, and we hope to be announcing several others like that as we go forward. 
We're also bringing new capabilities. As we sort of said in our formal comments, the size of our footprint here is underappreciated. And we're going to be focusing on really benefiting from that and bringing new capabilities against that enormous footprint with capabilities like Granulate and our Amber Security Service, things that allow us to bring more value to our customers, as well as harvest more revenue from that enormous installed base. 
So all of that taken together, we feel like we are owning up to the challenges that we had in data center, but we have a clear view of how we write this business for the future and are well underway on doing exactly that.",506

That was largely the impact of the decline in revenue. But keep in mind, we're also investing a lot, for all the reasons that Pat said, to bring out great products that wow our customers. And so that investment does also weigh down on the operating profitability of the business. 
We do see that getting better. We took, as Pat mentioned, reserves on Sapphire Rapids. And those are kind of a one-off thing that dissipate as we go through the second half of the year. We also expect revenue to improve as we progress through the year. Those things combined should improve operating margins in the near term. In the long term, we see this business as a business that gives us greater than corporate average operating margins, gross margins and operating margins for that [ matter ]. It has traditionally actually for us and for the industry. 
And so it's a matter of just putting our nose down and executing to get those results, and we feel very confident we'll get there.",196

You guys just mentioned some reserves we need to take for Sapphire, and the time lines have been pushed out. So I guess the questions are, one, Pat, can you give us a more specific timing on where things are with Sapphire Rapids, not just early units, but actual volume production? 
And secondly, this push out, how does this impact the time lines for Emerald and Granite? Do you see those pushing out sort of congruent with the push out here? Or are those time lines going to be held and maybe the platforms be a little bit different? I'm just curious on the roadmap.",128

And giving a bit more detail on Sapphire, we're already ramping a number of SKUs of Sapphire Rapids already. They began ramping last quarter. So we have a number of those ramping. The particular issue that we highlighted wasn't affecting those SKUs, so those continue to ramp. So we did another tape out, which I'll say, for the larger volume SKUs, and those will be volume shipping in the second half of the year. So you'll see us ramping those and launching those. So we're fully on track for that, and we feel like we're over all of the issues that we've had in bringing that product to marketplace. So we feel very comfortable with that. 
We're then working very closely -- emerald goes into the Sapphire platform. So we're working very closely with our customers on the timing there. The product is looking very healthy. So we're nicely on track. So that will be a '23 product. And then Granite and Sierra Forest is the '24 product. And just to remind everybody, this is a major new platform. We believe this is a major step forward as we go into Granite Rapids but also was our first E-core product with Sierra Forest, right? 
And this, we believe, is really sort of -- this ability to have a fleet offering where a lot of cloud workloads, they just say, give me a great container and let me run that quite thermally efficient TCO efficiently, and that's what Sierra Forest will do and then Granite Rapids, clearly, the performance leader in the marketplace. So both of those will be '24 products. And again, right, we're powering on that this next quarter. So we're looking very healthy -- or this quarter, I should say, in Q3. So looking very good so far. So we just say the road map is healthy, looking on track, and our execution here must improve. Many of these products were well underway when we showed up. 
As we said, the culture, right, of execution needs to be rebuilt. And we are working heavily to rebuild the culture of this team. And in fact, we just completed our employee engagement survey, and this is the most significant year-on-year improvements in history. Many of our employment -- employee engagement survey results now are now best in the industry. We've totally reversed the brain drain that we had. So teams are excited, the momentum is building and many of these products -- hey, we're launching the new products with the revised -- and you'll hear us talk more about our TikTok execution discipline going forward. But a lot of these products were underway, so they weren't launched with the new execution and methodology discipline, so we're working through those. And as each one of these gets better, our execution and confidence in those deliveries is improving, culture is improving. We're making great progress.",484

Is it just a preproduction reserve? Or is there something else going on? And my question is, based on your comments about the recovery profile for DCG, and I guess, DCAI in the second half, it seems like PC market is -- at least your expectation is that the PC market will recover quicker than DCAI. I'm a little bit surprised by that because you have Sapphire ramping, and I don't know if the inventory situation was worse in DC versus in PC. So I'm just surprised by the fact that you're saying that PC will recover faster than DCAI. If you can classify that, that will be helpful.",122

So yes, you're right, Sapphire Rapids. We reserve the production inventory when it's -- before it has gone, what we call, PRQ, so it's a quality metric. And so we reserve all of the product. And since the main -- as Pat said, the main SKUs have not, at this point, reached PRQ, we continue to reserve them. Once they do, which we expect later this year, then we stop, first of all, reserving the production inventory. And then the likelihood is some of this will also sell. And so we'll be able to recover some portion of that reserve likely as we progress through the end of this year and next year. 
On CCG and DCAI, I think the inventory correction in CCG was definitely more pronounced. And so you get this -- the benefit of the shipping back to the consumption level is more pronounced when things recover. That's #1. We also will see more pricing improvement in CCG than DCAI. They're both -- we're adjusting pricing, but the pricing is more significant in CCG. And so that also gives CCG a lift in the later part of the year.",193

So important thing is that when you look at growth CapEx, it's about 25% of the reduction. About 75% of the reduction is actually increased capital offset. So it's not a significant adjustment to the growth number. It's almost entirely on the equipment side, the reduction, and some of it is just timing of receipts of equipment.

What I think has become really positive for us is the capital offsets. Maybe I'll talk a little bit about it, and you can go into details about chips, if you want, Pat. We just are, in general, way more optimistic about what we're going to get in terms of capital assets. In fact, I think our forecast for the year is 4x what it was when we talked about it at Investor Day. 
And so clearly, for this year, we're going to see strong offsets. And I think given what happened today, I think we're going to have good offsets in the coming years as well. So I think that will really help us kind of keep the guardrails intact. I mean, obviously, on a long-term basis, we're always looking at our CapEx in relationship to demand. We're building supply to meet demand and modulating that as the signals change on the demand front. 
At this point, I think given the long lead times of building out these factories, we're very confident that the growth rates of our markets are going to be quite healthy, and we're going to need the supply to come online. May we modulate or make tiny adjustments to it over the course of years? Yes, but I wouldn't say it's going to be a significant magnitude. 
But we -- but still at the end of the day, we feel very good about the guardrails we talked about. It's going to be more like mid-30s net CapEx intensity. Our investment phase that goes through 2024, and then '25, '26, we'll see a step down as we start to get the benefits of that in terms of revenue growth and margin growth, and will normalize more into the mid-20s.",303

And as Dave was alluding to, the passage today by the house of the CHIPS Act following the Senate passage on Tuesday, this is historic legislation.

And that also is something that we pointed to, and we've been very active, and I've been very active. This is great for the semiconductor industry. This is beneficial to Intel. This was one of the pieces of the smart capital program, as we described back at Investor Day. And now seeing this come across the line will clearly be part of that ability for us to invest aggressively in the strategy that we described to you. 
We see this as an accelerant to our strategy and something that will give us the capacity to both meet our product needs, as well as our foundry customer needs as well. This is powerful and something that we are thrilled to have come across the line just today. We look forward to this being on the President's desk in the next couple of days and signed into law.

Were you just referring to Sapphire Rapids or was this a general statement across several of your product segments, including client and graphics? And can you just articulate like what some of these product design issues are? Are they architectural issues, performance issues, design closure, changing customer requirements? Any help there would be great. 
Obviously, as you mentioned, many of these programs were already underway when you joined the team. But what is it specifically that you're doing now to ensure better design execution going forward?",110
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2022",2022-07-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,4061.0,2608275.0,98382428.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,27,"Yes, Harlan. And if I would, just to step back slightly, right, I view the recovery rebuilding in 3 different chapters: one was TD and manufacturing, best transistors capacity; second, design and products. We have to deliver the products that we say to our customers. And if they ask for it Monday at noon, Monday at 11:59, it is there, right, and the volume is the same, at the performance levels, power levels, et cetera. And the third chapter is building growth, right, and establishing the new products, the new product lines for growth. 
And obviously, we've laid the foundations for all 3. As TD and manufacturing are now making good progress, the focus really is get the product and design execution superb again. And I point back to that sort of TikTok discipline that we had in the past, that was a key part of what we're doing. And that's exactly what we have underway, rebuilding that kind of product disciplined execution. 
Clearly, the Sapphire Rapids miss that we had, we're raising the quality bars for that. We weren't shipping at the quality levels, the security levels that we needed to in the past. And clearly, we shouldn't have had that bug in the product in the first place. So that caused another stepping for the volume release. Our software release on our discrete graphics, right, was clearly underperforming. We thought that we would be able to leverage the integrated graphics software stack, and it was wholly inadequate for the performance levels, gaming compatibility, et cetera, that we needed. So we're not hitting our 4 million unit goal in the discrete graphics space, even as we're now catching up and getting better software releases. 
We also, I'll say, the time lines for our products as we've committed them to customers, hey, we don't think we're competitive with the best-in-class in the industry. Our design time lines, we have to get them better, and we're focused on doing that, and that's for some of the longer roadmap term items where we have to be best-in-class in our design cycles, design costs, power envelopes, architectural leadership, things that you would expect from Intel in the past, and we're rebuilding those muscles for the future. 
So those would be the 2 examples we point to specifically that were visible this quarter, but we just have a lot more work to do. And as I said, it takes -- these are 3-, 4-year long projects. These were -- many of them were underway. We're putting in place these disciplines now. And the products that are being launched with this entirely new methodology and alignment, they don't come out for a couple of more years. So we're still working through that inventory of designs that were in process, a lot of work to do, a lot of rebuilding and that's where a lot of my attention is being focused on.

If you could talk in IFS, so more on the MediaTek announcement, the products growth and potentially expand that to advanced products were referenced, design cooperation. I also want to ask a bit more on the CHIPS Act, how it changes your approach to the business. And for David, if the capital offsets assume some of the U.S. benefits, how could it impact the tax rate?",69

On IFS, clearly, MediaTek, they're the largest fabless supplier from Taiwan made. They're seeking to have a broadening of their supply chain. And as we've said, our strategy is to provide a pathway for customers to have a globally balanced resilient supply chain. As I also mentioned in the formal comments, 6 of 10 of the largest foundry customers in the world, we now have active engagement. So the pipeline of customers grew. We added another $1 billion to the pipeline this quarter. MediaTek was an Intel 16 announcement, one of the more mature offerings in the portfolio, which makes sense, right? Intel 3, Intel 18A, these are yet to be, I'll say, designable products, and we have test chips underway, but we're not yet to the point that the PDKs or the design libraries would be adequate for people to make design commitments quite at this point in time. 
But overall, great progress on IFS. We're thrilled with the MediaTek announcement and a robust pipeline of customers continues to build because this idea of a geographically balanced, resilient supply chain, Intel giving the best transistors and capacity corridors. And I'd also say that our IFS strategy pivots on this idea of system foundry. The world is moving -- were moving from a board to a system and package. And a system package needs advanced 2.5 and 3D package, an area of Intel's leadership, interconnect standards. We've announced the standardization of UCIE. We're leading that. Software assets, another area of advantage for us. And we'll engage with and deliver this across portfolio process technologies, ours and others. This idea of System Foundry is gaining a clear interest to our customers as well. 
With respect to CHIPS and capital, we'll say we were driving this for the last 1.5 years, and we're fully expecting this to be the case in time. We're thrilled to get it done. That said, we also initiated such an effort with Europe. And that's making great progress as well. And as Dave said, we're also looking through other capital partners as well, which we hope to be able to talk about more in the future with you as well.",364

Our expectation is there'll be a process, and that process will take us into 2023 before we start receiving money from CHIPS. So not assumed in 2022, although we're assuming that we will see some in 2023. 
As you point out, the CHIPS Act or the bill that was passed is a combination of grant money and tax credits. I think it's a little early to determine exactly how all that is administered and makes its way into our P&L. So we'll table that until that becomes clear to us exactly how things shake out, and we'll give you more color once we have a better assessment of that.",125

You said that Sapphire Rapids was on time, and it's ramping in volume in the second half. But you also said data center growth in the second half was going to be pretty muted off of a base that's really low. And then you also said that data center pricing improvements in the second half would be less than what you're seeing in clients. So it doesn't really sound like the Sapphire Rapids ramp is helping at all. What is going on with that? Like how should I be thinking about the impact of that Sapphire Rapids ramp as that ramps into volume? Or is it a question is like most of the volume coming into 2023? Or why isn't it having more of an impact in the second half as it ramps?",138
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2022",2022-07-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,4061.0,2608275.0,98382435.0,Answer,David Zinsner,,Executives,34,"We said in the prepared remarks that it's later than we expected, Sapphire Rapids. It's ramping later. We have some SKUs out, which is good, but the main SKUs are not out and they happen later in the year. And of course, they'll contribute way more significantly to next year than they're going to contribute to this year. 
We do see an opportunity in the client space, given our Alder Lake position for pricing increases that are really passing on inflation, and we know customers understand that. Obviously, our competitive positions are not as strong in the DCAI business. And so there are opportunities to adjust pricing but not across the board. So that is impacting us a bit.",120

Like we said, we started shipping some of the SKUs earlier in the year, right? Those weren't some of the higher-volume SKUs. The volume ramp SKUs were pushed out, right, as we said, Stacy, and they will start ramping late in the year. But the bigger financial impact definitely is next year. Sapphire Rapids, right, it's still a leadership product. We continue to get great reviews from our customers on the product areas like AI performance that we're competing with low -- the mid-tier of NVIDIA-dedicated AI processors. The security capabilities as part of it, unquestioned, the accelerators in it, unquestioned, leadership. We're also getting more and more momentum from our software optimizations that come with it as well. 
So all of those taken together, a lot of enthusiasm. Every cloud vendor, every data center vendor, et cetera, is enthusiastic for this product. And we're now, as I say, in the final days of getting it completed and beginning those customer volume ramps. And obviously, financially, we'll start to see some of those inventory reserves reversing as well. But yes, this was not our finest hour in execution. We're rebuilding our execution machine. And this product, a lot of enthusiasm for it in the marketplace as we deliver it.",210

So while Sapphire Rapids is delayed, it sounds like something on the order of half a year, Pat, in the press release, it noted that the later nodes are still on track -- or ahead of the track, I think, was the language. As outsiders, what can we look to sort of judge and determine whether Intel is continuing to be on pace as we progress through the quarters? Aside from just the sort of summary statements in the press release, is there some other metric you could disclose to us or some way we can better understand whether Intel is getting back on track and keeping these commitments to deliver these products as you've scheduled it?",131

Maybe as we just run through the 5 nodes quickly, Intel 7 done, volume shipments, we said 5 nodes, 4 years, Intel 7, 35 million units, you can go rip one apart. I'm sure our competitors have done teardowns on it, done. Intel 4, right, we said is, hey, Meteor Lake, looking good at this point. It's now broadly sampled to customers. And it's looking very healthy as well. 
Also, we had the independent analysis of our detailed updates that we gave at the VLSI conference recently. And if you go look at some of the reports from that, people were pleasantly surprised. They said, ""Oh, Intel 4, it looks as good as some of the 3-nanometer competitors."" So this is looking pretty good. And certainly, we'll be giving more of those technical updates going forward on the real performance. 
Also, we've given updates on Granite Rapids, one of the lead vehicles of Intel 3. We also have said that we'll give you updates on 20A and 18A test chip updates and others. We'll also have independent assessments of those as we announce foundry customers, right, which will be another point of validation that you'll see. 
So we're going to keep giving you more and more points of validation as we go along for it. Trust me, these are analyzed. The performance of each one of these process nodes, the defect density of each of these process nodes, the maturity of the design collateral, the resonance from the foundry customers for each one is being scrutinized extraordinarily well. And with that, I think you'll get more and more confidence that what we're saying is not only verified by us but independently by industry sources as well. 
So with that, let me just wrap up our time. First, I'd like to say, thank you. We're grateful for you joining us today, opportunity that you've given us to update you on our business. 
We'd summarize 3 key messages as we finish. We're not satisfied with the quarter and the financial results that we gave you today, we have growing confidence in the strategy and we are optimistic finally about the future. We deserve some tough questions this quarter but also appreciate that they're fair and relevant to the business. Transformations are not easy, but nothing worthwhile ever is. And despite the headwinds that we're seeing, we demonstrated substantial progress on IFS, NEX business, records, PSG, record in that business, the CHIPS passage today, huge, clear customer wins like AWS and Meta and NVIDIA. And for the last question, great progress on our TD milestones and our manufacturing milestones. 
With that, we look forward to updating you again next quarter. Thank you.",450

Despite growing economic headwinds, Q3 revenue was flat sequentially and only modestly below the midpoint of our guidance. In June, we were one of the first companies to highlight an abrupt and pronounced slowdown in demand, which has brought it beyond our initial expectations and is now having an industry-wide impact across the electronic supply chain. We are adjusting our Q4 outlook, and we are planning for the economic uncertainty to persist into 2023.  
While we are not satisfied with our results, we remain laser-focused on controlling what we can, and we are pleased that our PC share stabilized in Q2 and is now showing meaningful improvement in Q3. Our server share, while not where we want it to be, is tracking in line with our expectations, and we are encouraged by good execution in the quarter against our product road map. In addition, we are intensifying our cost reduction and efficiency efforts, and we are aggressively moving into the next phase of IDM 2.0 geared to unlocking the full potential of the IDM advantage.  
This afternoon, I will focus my comments in 3 areas: one, the key trends and dynamics that shape Q3 and are informing our outlook; two, the progress we are making on IDM 2.0, including our momentum on process and product road maps and our recent announcement that we are implementing an internal foundry model; and three, the actions underway to drive cost savings and efficiency gains aimed at accelerating our transformation.  
Specific to trends we are seeing, along with further deterioration in consumer PC demand in Q3, enterprise demand has begun to slow. We expect PC units to decline mid- to high teens to approximately 295 million units in calendar year '22. Our own Q3 results reflect a strong product portfolio with Raptor Lake building on Alder Lake's momentum as well as working closely with customers to optimize their inventory, our market share and business objectives.  
We are still shipping below PC consumption and the inventory correction continued in Q3, but not as quickly as we forecasted. Importantly, however, PC usage remains strong, demonstrating the increased utility and value of the PC and ultimately supporting a TAM well above pre-pandemic levels. We are targeting a calendar year '23 PC unit TAM of between 270 million and 295 million units with a strong brand and product line driving additional share, especially at premium ASPs.  
The data center TAM is holding up better, although enterprise in China continue to show signs of weakness as to some but not all cloud customers. Across our infrastructure and industrial exposed businesses, NEX demand was very solid, though not immune from the weakening economy.  
PSG continues to be a true standout with record Q3 revenue, up over 25% year-over-year. PSG backlog is robust, and it continues to be an area where we are supply chain-limited.  
Despite the challenging business environment, we made solid progress toward our long-term transformation in Q3, and we remain fully committed to using the macro uncertainty to accelerate our efforts. Each quarter, our confidence grows in achieving our goal of 5 nodes in 4 years. But until 4, we are progressing towards a high-volume manufacturing and will tape out the production stepping at Meteor Lake in Q4. The first stepping of Granite Rapids is out of the fab, yielding well with Intel 3 continuing to progress on schedule. Intel 4 and 3 are our first nodes deploying EUV and will represent a major step forward in terms of transistor performance per watt and density.  
On Intel 20A and 18A, the first nodes to benefit from RibbonFET and PowerVia, our first internal test chips, and those of a major potential foundry customer have taped out with silicon running in the fab. We continue to be on track to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025.  
IFS is a major beneficiary of our TD progress, and we are excited to welcome NVIDIA to the RAMP-C program, which enables both commercial foundry customers and the U.S. Department of Defense to take advantage of Intel's at-scale investments in leading-edge technologies. Since Q2, IFS has expanded engagements to 7 out of the 10 largest foundry customers, coupled with consistent pipeline growth to include 35 customer test chips. In addition, IFS increased qualified opportunities by $1 billion to over $7 billion in deal value, all before we welcome the Tower team with the expected completion of the merger in Q1 '23.  
On the product front, we had a busy quarter. Within client, as mentioned earlier, we added to the strong Alder Lake momentum with the launch of Raptor Lake desktop in Q3, driving a more than a 40% improvement in multi-thread performance, unquestioned leadership in gaming, 6 gigahertz out of the box and record-setting overclocking. We currently have over 500 OEM design wins. We launched Intel Unison to deliver best-in-industry multi-device user experience. In addition, we saw a meaningful development progress across multiple OEM designs on Intel 4-based Meteor Lake with volume ramps in 2023.  
We now have all elements of the AXG portfolio in production with A770 giving our discrete graphics efforts a strong boost. The Flex family is building a strong pipeline of data center use cases, and Ponte Vecchio is now production for HPC offerings and production blades deployed for lead customers. Combined with Sapphire Rapids and Sapphire Rapids HBM, PVC is the basis for strong traction with HPC customers like Argonne National Laboratory and Germany's Leibniz Supercomputing Centre.  
CSPs and telcos alike continue to move to software-based 5G vRAN and O-RAN deployments. We announced Sapphire Rapids EE with vRAN Boost for in-line acceleration of 5G and network workloads. Edge and AI are proving a powerful combination for us with OpenVINO momentum building with customers like Chipotle, and we launched the Intel Geti computer vision software platform for RapidAI training with early customers such as Braven, Royal Brompton and Harefield hospitals. Further evidence of our AI portfolio taking shape was seen by Red Hat announcing support for Gaudi, Cnvrg.io and OpenVINO. 
Inspur announced Gaudi2 with Sapphire Rapids for advanced AI use cases. Amazon will be accelerating large transform models with Gaudi instances in EC2. 
This was also a very strong quarter for DCAI execution. Sapphire Rapids volume SKUs have now PRQed for a high-quality leadership product and a very strong volume ramp expected. Google gave the first preview of its C3 instances showing Sapphire Rapids capabilities as well as our leadership IPU, the E3200 or Mount Evans.  
We also saw strong milestones in the next 3 generations of server products. Emerald Rapids is showing good progress and is on track for calendar year '23. Granite Rapids is very healthy running multiple operating systems across many configurations. And with Sierra Forest, our first E-core product, providing world-class performance per watt are both solidly on track for '24.  
It's obvious, but we're stating our strategy is only as good as our execution. We have been taking aggressive action to rebuild our execution engine, driving execution excellence across our people, design and development and operations. In Q1, I discussed our return to OKRs and their importance to our culture.  
Last quarter, I touched upon the next evolution of our tick-tock model, or tick-tock 2, as a disciplined approach to consistent, predictable product execution. This quarter, I wanted to spend a bit of time on operational excellence and discuss our recently announced IDM 2.0 Acceleration Office, or IAO, ushering in the next phase of our IDM 2.0 strategy.  
During the first phase of IDM 2.0, we aggressively focus on making the needed investments to approve our TD road map to regain transistor leadership and to ensure we have at-scale manufacturing capacity by building ahead on shells. Improvements in both areas now enables us to move forward with our next set of priorities, evolving our systems, business practices and culture to embrace an internal foundry model and establish a leadership cost structure. This means we will create what I like to call a new and clean API for the company by establishing consistent processes, systems and guardrails between our manufacturing teams and our business units. This will place our BUs on the same economic footing as external IFS customers and will allow our manufacturing group and BUs to be more agile, make better decisions and uncover efficiency and cost savings.  
We have already identified 9 different subcategories for operational improvement that our teams will aggressively pursue. For example, product teams will be heavily incented to drive the high-quality A0 steppings, as they see the full cost of steppings, validation cycles, hot lots and capacity changes. Factories will move to rigorous capacity loading cycles, transparency of cost for loading changes and efficiency of capital utilization, structural and variable wafer costs.  
In addition to establishing better incentives, this new approach will provide transparency on our financial execution, allowing us to better benchmark ourselves against other foundries and drive to best-in-class performance. It will also provide improved transparency to our owners as we expect to share full internal foundry P&L into calendar year '24, ultimately, allowing you to better judge how we are creating value and allocating your capital.  
A key benefit of IDM 2.0 is to unlock our full financial potential by capturing multiple profit pools not available to any one of our peers across architecture, design, wafer manufacturing, advanced packaging, supply chain and software. These pools were only partially [indiscernible] long-term margin targets we established at Investor Day in February.  
Simple math would suggest there is meaningful upside to those targets as we execute and exploit the margin-stacking potential IDM 2.0 provides. Best-in-class semiconductor companies achieved gross margin in the 60s and operating margins in the 40s. And we aim to be best-in-class. This next phase of IDM 2.0 is a significant evolution in how we think and operate as a company. But just as we optimize to drive outside returns in the IDM 1.0 era, we will optimize to achieve best-in-class returns in the IDM 2.0 era. It's what engineers do, and we have the best engineers on the planet.  
Complementing and augmenting these efforts will be an intensified focus to reduce costs and drive efficiencies in everything we do. As we stated during Q2 earnings, we have an obligation to our owners to be good stewards of your capital. We are responding to the current environment by taking aggressive actions to reduce costs across COGS and OpEx while mindfully protecting the investments needed to accelerate our transformation, ensure we are well positioned for long-term market growth.  
In addition to reducing near-term costs, we have also identified structural cost reductions and efficiency drivers, which Dave will outline a bit later.  
In aggregate, our efforts should drive $3 billion in annual savings in the near term and $8 billion to $10 billion by the end of 2025. Not captured in these estimates are the start-up costs to support 5 nodes in 4 years which will begin to subside beyond calendar year '26, adding an additional $2 billion in COGS savings. Inclusive in our efforts will be steps to optimize our head count. These are difficult decisions affecting our loyal Intel family, but we need to balance increased investment in areas like leadership and TD product and capacity in Ohio and Germany with efficiency measures elsewhere as we drive to have best-in-class structures.  
We will also continue to use our smart capital approach to support and inform our capital spending aspirations, aggressively building ahead on shells while aligning equipment purchases and installs with customer demand.  
We continue to see skips like our partnership with Brookfield as an innovative financial structure to more closely align fab build-out costs with fab output returns. Likewise, we see U.S. and EU chips as vital to enable us to establish a geographically diverse and secure supply chain for the semiconductor industry. We are confident in reaccelerating free cash flow growth and driving industry-leading free cash flow margins once we get through this period of economic uncertainty affecting the entire industry and our own elevated investments to accelerate our transformation.  
Lastly, I was particularly pleased to join the Mobileye team earlier this week in New York to witness firsthand the successful completion of their IPO, especially in a difficult market. We believe that this will help unlock Mobileye's full operational and financial potential and is an additional avenue to create value for our owners. We remain committed to optimizing our value creation efforts through portfolio honing, reallocation of resources to higher returns, higher-growth businesses, M&A and where applicable, divestitures.  
Before turning it over to Dave, I want to close by saying I continue to be heartened and impressed by the dedication and commitment of all of our employees by far, the most important owners of this great company. They are passionately committed like me to reestablish Intel as a dominant driver of innovation and by the opportunity to improve the lives of everyone on the planet.  
It was also rewarding to see that same drive and dedication in the faces of our broader developer community at Intel Innovation, the rebirth of Intel IDF in September. We are the building blocks, an enabler of their vision and aspirations, and it is our commitment to them to be great partners and collaborators. Our ambitions are equal by our passions and our efforts across manufacturing, design, products and foundry are well on their way to driving our transformation and creating the flywheel, which is IDM 2.0.",2249

We had a solid third quarter despite the macroeconomic headwinds impacting the semiconductor industry. We expect these headwinds to persist and as a result, we're lowering our expectations for the fourth quarter. We will continue to be laser-focused on the things that we can control and use economic uncertainty to accelerate our transformation and drive cost cutting and efficiency gains. 
Moving to Q3 results. Revenue was $15.3 billion, flat sequentially and only modestly below the midpoint of our guide. Q3 revenue benefited from CCG's strength, offset by declining TAMs in DCAI and NEX. Gross margin for the quarter was 46%, below our guide, but largely in line relative to lower Q3 revenue. Q3 gross margin increased 100 basis points sequentially on lower inventory reserves. 
EPS was $0.59, $0.24 above our guide largely on lower-than-forecasted taxes. Adjusting for the lower tax rate, EPS would have been $0.37, $0.02 above our guide on better expense management. 
Operational cash flow for the quarter was $1 billion. Net CapEx for the quarter was $7.3 billion, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $6.3 billion. And we paid dividends of $1.5 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong with cash balances of $23 billion, modest leverage and a strong investment-grade credit profile. 
Turning to our business unit results. CCG revenue was $8.1 billion, up 6% sequentially, driven by higher ASPs on better mix and also benefiting from our efforts to work with customers to maximize our share position ahead of Q4 price increases. CCG revenue was down 17% year-over-year as customers continue to reduce inventory and we continue to under ship demand. 
Demand weakness year-over-year was most pronounced in the consumer, education and small medium business markets. Operating profit was $1.7 billion, up $570 million sequentially and down 54% year-over-year on lower revenue, increased 10-nanometer and Intel 7 mix and increased spending to further strengthen our product road map. 
DCAI revenue was $4.2 billion, down 27% year-over-year on TAM reductions and continued competitive pressures even as market share continues to track in line with our expectations. Operating profit was $17 million, below expectations and down significantly year-over-year. Profitability was impacted by lower revenue, higher advanced node start-up costs and higher product costs on transition to 10 nanometers. 
We also continue to invest aggressively in the product road map. NEX revenue was $2.3 billion, up 14% year-over-year on increased demand for 5G, Ethernet and edge products, partially offset by lower network Xeon demand. In Q3, we started to see macro-driven demand softness and customer inventory management impact NEX. Operating profit was $75 million, down 85% year-over-year due to the impact of softer demand on inventory valuation and increased road map investment. 
AXG revenue was $185 million, up 8% year-over-year on the ramp of our Blockscale products. Operating loss was $378 million, $129 million better sequentially, but $156 million worse than year-over-year due to softer demand and product readiness impacting inventory valuation as well as increased investment to deliver the visual, supercompute and custom accelerated graphics road maps. 
Mobileye revenue was $450 million, up $124 million from Q3 2021, primarily driven by higher demand for EyeQ products. Operating income was $142 million, up $15 million from Q3 2021, primarily due to higher revenue. IFS revenue was $171 million, down 2% year-over-year, driven by automotive weakness with customers citing third-party component shortages, partially offset by growth in core foundry and IMS businesses. Operating loss was $103 million versus an operating loss of $44 million in Q3 '21 on increased spending to enable our foundry growth strategy. 
Turning to Q4 guidance. Given the deteriorating macro environment and based on input from our customers, we're now guiding Q4 revenue in a range of $14 billion to $15 billion with sequential decline driven by lower CCG revenue as customers reduced inventory lower NEX TAM and continued DCAI headwinds. We're forecasting gross margin of 45%, a tax rate of 14% and EPS of $0.20 at the midpoint of revenue guidance. 
For Q4 adjusted free cash flow, we expect to see a meaningful sequential increase driven by working capital improvements and a $2 billion reduction in net CapEx, adjusting for a lower demand environment. These benefits will be partially offset by lower revenue. And as a result, we're reducing our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance to negative $2 billion to negative $4 billion. There is also a possibility that a portion of expected capital offsets could move from Q4 to Q1, shifting the cash flow benefit into next year. 
Consistent with our short-term financial model discussed at our Investor Day in February, our continued intent is to manage, adjust this free cash flow at approximately breakeven as we go through this period of accelerated and elevated investments supported by our smart capital approach and the multiple pools of capital available to finance our strategy. 
Now turning to our long-term outlook and the changes we're making to transform the business. Beyond Q4, there's a high degree of macroeconomic uncertainty, and it appears that the current challenging market environment will extend well into 2023 with the potential for a global recession. Further, as I discussed in Q2 earnings, it's imperative that we drive for world-class product cost and operational efficiency to achieve our long-term financial model. As Pat detailed earlier, to accelerate this transformation, we're forming the IDM 2.0 Acceleration Office and doubling down on our efforts to reduce costs and find efficiencies across the organization. 
We'll start with a focus on driving $3 billion of cost reduction in 2023, 1/3 in cost of sales and 2/3 in operating expenses. Note that our Q3 results include GAAP restructuring charges of $664 million that reflect initial efforts to rightsize our business and deliver these savings. In Q4, we expect to have additional restructuring charges of similar magnitude as we further rationalize our 2023 financial plan. 
Longer term, we will execute on continued structural cost savings and efficiency gains, which we expect to drive $8 billion to $10 billion in annual savings by the end of 2025, split roughly 2/3 in cost of sales and 1/3 in operating expense. These savings will be realized through multiple initiatives to optimize the business, including portfolio cuts, rightsizing of our support organizations, more stringent cost controls in all aspects of our spending and improved sales and marketing efficiency. 
As Pat outlined, also critical to driving this transformation is the implementation of our internal foundry operating model, dramatically increasing financial accountability and transparency, enabling all organizations to drive to world-class product cost and efficiency benchmarks. In addition, as we emerge from 5 nodes in 4 years and slower technology development cadence, we expect an additional approximately 200 basis points of gross margin after 2026. We expect these efforts to provide potential upside to the financial targets we provided at the February Investor Day. 
This will be a multiyear journey, but as Pat said earlier, best-in-class semiconductor companies have a financial profile that includes gross margins in the 60s and operating margins in the 40s, and we aim to be best-in-class. In the short term, we will continue to manage to the OpEx, net capital intensity and adjusted free cash flow guardrails established and drive back to a gross margin percentage range of 51% to 53% once economic conditions improve and revenue growth returns. 
In closing, we remain committed to the strategy and financial model communicated at Investor Day. The compelling long-term financial opportunity of strong revenue growth across our 6 business units and free cash flow at 20% of revenue remains. And I believe this downturn represents an opportunity to more quickly make the transformation necessary to achieve these goals. 
With that, let me turn it back over to John and get to your questions.",1293

So if you're willing to talk a little bit about the puts and takes in the market. You talked about the PC market being but down about 5%, Pat. But overall, from your segments, where do you see either market headwinds or tailwinds or individual Intel-specific areas for market share gains or still challenges into 2023?",73
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2022",2022-10-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3745.0,2666610.0,100318653.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,7,"Yes. Thank you, Ross. I'll start off on that. And like we said, it's just the macroeconomic, unpredictable, tough market outlook. And inside of that, it's just hard to see any points of good news on the horizon, inflation in the U.S., the situation in Europe with energy and the war and in Asia. So against that backdrop, we're still looking to have economic headwinds as we go into next year. And with that in mind, obviously, lowering our guide for Q4. 
As we think about it, at the industry level, obviously, some of that helps to accelerate some of the rebalancing of the supply chain, and some of that will help our business like lowering of DDR memory costs will decrease the premiums on DDR5 that makes Sapphire Rapids a more compelling platform. In other areas, we still have a rebalancing of the supply chain in front of us on some of the older nodes. 
When we look at our business units, the PC, more critical device than ever. And as Sacha talked about yesterday on his earnings call, 20% more active devices usage increasing. That said, we do expect that the TAM, as I indicated in my formal comments, is going to be a bit lower next year. We've given a range aligned with the industry. For servers, we have seen the slowdown in enterprise and to a lesser degree, in the cloud market, decreasing the TAM outlook there. We do, in our modeling, look at that as we're building our capacity. 
Obviously, our cost efforts have been very specific to give us flexibility for lowering the structural rate cost even as we stay true to the strategic investments that we're making and driving our transformation and disciplined cost modeling more quickly. 
So it really is a challenging environment, unpredictable environment, and we're staying true to the strategy, making cost adjustments and trying to balance market outlooks as we gain share, right, in some segments, and we fight for share in other segments. And I was very pleased with how the team executed in improving our execution in an environment that really was quite tough.",357

Where do you think those will be most acute in both directions, the good and the bad?",40

And we'd say, we saw no -- if we go to the areas, we're just entering in the AXG business and IFS. So everything there is gaining share. In the NEX business, we saw our businesses entirely driven by the macro. And our market share seems to have no real shift whatsoever, and we continue to be a grower in that segment. 
In PC, we had very market share gains this quarter, very strong product lines, so we think we're well positioned. And in data center, we grew slower than the market. And as the product line gets stronger, we will be in a position to regain share, regain ASP, obviously, ramp the Sapphire Rapids. But we still see ourselves not in a position that we're gaining share yet and expect that will be the case for a couple of more quarters.",143

It seems sort of like the first step in basically splitting the company into an external foundry and a fabless company. Can you sort of play that out? Is that the idea? And sort of how does this create value? I guess, I mean, obviously, if you look at GlobalFoundries' market cap, that's like 30% of your market cap. But how does it play out functionally? How it creates value?",78
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2022",2022-10-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3745.0,2666610.0,100318659.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,13,"Yes. When we definitely view that there are efficiencies for us to gain as we go through this internal foundry model, where we see numerous areas in the company that were not as rigorous as we need to be. In factory loadings, where we make lots of change in factory loadings and we would run the factories more efficiently or steppings aren't accountable, right, through cost modeling back to the business units, and thus, driving the high-quality A0 steppings. And stepping changes being fully reflected internally and the cost of those will make us more efficient. Leveraging third-party IP more aggressively will make us more efficient. 
And the combination of that is a big piece of why we're stepping to this internal foundry model, and we expect that we're going to start giving more financial transparency that way so that you can start to see the benefits in the margin stacking being realized of both being a product company as well as a fab foundry company. And that's what we're out to get with the structure that we're laying out. 
That said, we think that this tight coupling of the IDM 2.0 model is a powerful value generator for us, at least the 3 areas. One, the technology benefits that we get to have a rapid pace of technology innovation and co-optimization between product and process. The second is the cash flows and balance sheet benefits that we get by having these internal to be able to drive the large investments required in the manufacturing networks. And third is in the supply chain efficiency and flexibility being able to balance across the foundry and business unit structure. 
So these 3 areas for us are ones that we see that tight coupling bringing long-term meaningful value generation to the company and to our shareholders. But we're going to do it against the backdrop that we are going to be benchmarking ourselves against the best-in-class in each area and that transparency, right? We'll provide more visibility to you, our shareholders, but also drive our teams internally. And an engineering, manufacturing team when they see benchmark that you're holding up against them, it just unleashes energy into the future. And that's the excitement that we are working to create with this internal foundry model. And as we've launched it this quarter, we're already starting to see the roots of that permeate through our teams.",401

I guess just a follow-up on that. So like what's the line in the sand, Dave? I guess, it's a question more on cash flow. What is the line in the sand? I think before, you said that 2024 was going to be free cash flow neutral. Is that still the line in the sand where whatever you have to do, you'll cut CapEx as much as you can to be free cash flow neutral in 2024? Is that still the free cash flow line on the sand?",92

I mean we expect to manage in the near term, while we're in this investment phase to kind of a neutral-free cash flow over the course of '23, '24 combined. Obviously, our long-term goal is to is actually significantly improve cash flow, and we still feel like the model we gave at Investor Day is the right model that we can generate 20% free cash flow, as a percent of revenue. And obviously, this year, I think we showed very good discipline on the CapEx side. We brought our CapEx. I think when we started the year, we thought CapEx would be in the $27 billion range on a net basis. We've adjusted that down to $21 billion. But we still preserved what Pat thought was the most important things to invest in to make sure that we're ready to go as we launch new nodes, as we bring out the IFS business and gain more customer traction in that space. 
And then next year, the real protection on the cash flow now will be around these spending reductions. We have $3 billion of spending reductions we're going out to achieve in '23. No guidance yet on CapEx, but I would just say the model in the near term was to run essentially at 35% of revenue. And as Pat, I think, even mentioned at the Investor Day, we will manage to the model, and that's quite important to us. 
So we think we can manage both aspects of this, protect cash flow, be smart around spending, but continue to operate our strategy and our road map to get to leadership on process and product, to bring out these emerging businesses like the foundry business and like graphics.",289

Then clearly, the market seems to be reverting back to pre-pandemic levels of 260 million or so. And since that time before the pandemic, 1 large customer has moved away from x86, and there have been share shift. So what is the TAM next year is more like 250 to 260? What impact will it have on your cost and fab loading assumptions?",78
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2022",2022-10-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3745.0,2666610.0,100318665.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,19,"Yes. So first, the premise of the question, we clearly, over a number of quarters, we're above market forecast. That range that I described is exactly in line with the various forecast, our OEM feedback, the feedback from key software providers as well. So I'd say our range is now aligned with that industry range. 
Second point being that ranges larger than and well above pre-pandemic levels at that point. It is a structurally larger market. There's lots of units out there waiting to be replaced that are aging in the footprint, clear markets that are yet to have the PC penetration. So we feel quite comfortable. 
And as I noted in the earlier question, PC usage is high, as seen by Microsoft and their metrics, and our product line is positioned to gain share. So somewhat independent of the size of the TAM, we have a great product line, and our product line is also in our brand is well suited with a higher margin segments of the market that have been more resilient, right, to the market effects, low-end consumers where you've seen the biggest issues and our product line is very strong. Alder Lake, Raptor Lake, stunning numbers that we're getting and well on track with Meteor Lake. 
All of that said, obviously, you have to make some assumptions as you build a factory network and the range that we gave has a lot of room inside of it. And as we're demonstrating by the near-term cost cutting, that Dave described, we're trying to build flexibility into our factory network even as we adjust the cost structure, which is largely a fixed cost structure. And obviously, as we're ramping into the next-generation products, we're building into our Intel 4 and 3 product lines and the costs associated with that even as we balance both the near term and the strategic agenda. So we feel like we're well positioned to manage and thick or thin. And against that, with a strong product line, we believe we're a share gainer in this industry, and we're going to be quite aggressive to accomplish exactly that.",355

Do you think you are shipping to demand on the PC side? Or do you still think there is a channel inventory because as we head into Q1, that is often a seasonally softer period, but again, compares are very different this year? So I was just hoping to get your perspective on what the supply-demand balance is in the PC market as it exists kind of real time.",77
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2022",2022-10-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3745.0,2666610.0,100318668.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,22,"Yes. Our belief is that we ship below consumption levels. So in other words, inventory levels at the OEM and in the channels decreased over the last quarter. They didn't decrease as far as we were originally predicting. So consumption was a little bit weaker, but we still saw inventories systematically going down across the various routes to market throughout the quarter. We expect them to continue to go down next quarter at both the OEMs and at the channel level. And the numbers I gave on the TAM model would be our consumption models for next year, which are below the consumption models of this year. So a somewhat smaller number for next year but not dramatically different as we already said. 
So overall, I think we're getting to a better point of supply-demand equilibrium where we were way behind on demand and supply for many, many quarters in a row. Clearly, the last couple of quarters have been adjusting of inventory levels and we think that we're going to be in a better supply-demand balance situation as we go into next year.",184

So thanks for the question, Pierre. Yes. So keep in mind, as we look at this $8 billion to $10 billion of efficiency gains that we're talking about, we're actually making a pretty meaningful down payment on those efficiency gains in 2023. We expect to get $3 billion of savings versus '22 in '23. And keep in mind, actually, we have some fixed expenses that come on next year. So the cash savings is actually more like $5 billion of savings next year.  
Now as it relates to the 8 to 10, we think as we exit the 2025 period will roughly be in that $8 billion to $12 billion -- or $8 billion to $10 billion range. And as Pat kind of walked through, we just think we've already identified a lot of different efficiencies that will get us to this $8 billion. But also, as we start to manage the business in this internal foundry model, we think we'll find and cover a lot more opportunities to drive efficiency and savings. So we'll update you as we progress over the course of the next 3 years and let you know how we're doing in terms of our progress, but we have very good line of sight on the first $3 billion and pretty good line of sight on the full $8 billion to $10 billion.",230

Can you talk about -- it's very clear how it makes your foundry business better. From the standpoint of the CPU business back when you guys were on top in process, there was a pretty clear indication that it was the alignment of the device business with the fab that was kind of creating this really good outcome. Is there any trade-off that you make with this from the standpoint, looking at it from the standpoint of the microprocessor part of the business?",94
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2022",2022-10-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3745.0,2666610.0,100318677.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,31,"Yes. Thanks, Joe, and I'll start on that one. The simple answer is our job is to keep that 1 Intel synergy. And when I describe the 3 value vectors that I'm expecting to continue to really leverage around this technology collaboration, co-optimization of the microprocessor with the process technology is one that's high on that list. And we've made a lot of -- actually quite a lot of progress since I've been back driving that. And we're really seeing the benefits of that. And for instance, the great health that we described on Granite Rapids as an example about the momentum that we're seeing from Meteor Lake, there were clear examples. So I do believe that we're well underway at keeping that rich cycle of technical collaboration and co-optimization. 
But there's been many of these areas that I described that there hasn't been this intense accountability. Steppings were done too easily and without the quality A stepping. And some of that came through or stumbles as you went with 14 and 10 nanometers, but we lost the discipline of the understanding of what steppings cost and not just in the fab but also in the validation cycle. So we have to bring much more accountability and transparency to that. 
Also, we expedited all the time. While expedites are a good thing when you're bringing a new product to marketplace, but they also create fab inefficiencies, and the results of that are we're not being accountable for the fab efficiencies. Otherwise, our margins will be markedly higher than they are today. So to me, it's really maintaining the good things and the 3 I described, the technology benefits, balance sheet capital and the supply chain while driving a lot more transparency, automation, efficiency and the result will be, I believe, is a much better Intel for the long term, not just for the external foundry customers, as you suggest, but for my internal customers as well.",326

We measure them separately, but they actually do a very good job. In a lot of cases, they need to pull together to engage with customers, to develop products and so forth. And so I think we have a pretty good process and culture within Intel, where we can strike the right balance between creating some transparency and accountability for the internal foundry business, but also make sure that they're aligned to the overall Intel goals.",87

That's very helpful. In terms of the accounting in 2024 around this internal foundry structure, is the goal there to sort of have a transfer price between the foundry business and the rest of it, that kind of reflects the market price? Or just how -- it seems like the accounting of how you're going to determine where the profits could get tricky.",66

That's pretty much what we're thinking. I mean we will have our own foundry business. So we'll have a good sense, I think, of the market. And so that's how we'll approach it. I would say in '23, it's going to be a somewhat light touch. We'll do this through mostly kind of spreadsheet-oriented analytics. Eventually, we -- and Pat's been pretty vocal on this. We want to create more automation, systemization of everything that we're doing between the foundry and the product. So over time, this will get more robust, and ergo, we'll be able to drive more accountability, I think, as we progress through...",111

Here, this is a case where our internal processes and systems were optimized for IDM 1.0, right? We weren't having to say what is a sustainable wafer price that we should be designing against. And we were having a wafer cost view, right, which early in a process life is very high, right? And then it gets to mature, and how do design teams pick the right choice when you have such variability, whereas the foundry model gives a much more predictable wafer pricing that then enables a more efficient business unit model to pick the right technology choices to deliver the best products. So that's just one example that we're finding that we're not making the best decisions today, and this will allow us to hold the manufacturing teams to be entirely accountable. 
You've given a price, hit the defects, hit the cost structures associated with it and the business units, you have a wafer cost and go build the best product against that and ramp it like crazy in the industry. And obviously, presenting those with clarity will help you as the Street understand the progress we're making to accomplish that.",204

It makes perfect sense to me around the discipline and cost that you're looking to achieve here. But if I'm a business unit head, and you've been pretty clear that you're playing catch up 5 node migrations over the next 4 years. If I'm a business unit head over the next 2 years, why would I not outsource completely? So I guess what are the guardrails to ensure that you're keeping capacity internally until you achieve the goals that you set out for 2025?",93

Maybe 3 different perspectives on that C.J. Obviously, most of the design decisions that are being made by my product teams now are '25, '26, '27 decisions when we're back to process leadership, right? And they're seeing that progress day to day. And just as I said, ""Hey, if you want to design the best product, have the best transistor."" So they're with the capability to look now at the Intel leadership process technologies as they make those decisions. 
Also, secondly, as I described, this is a tight binding and we're going to maintain that tight binding of optimization and co-optimization for relationships that are decades old between our teams, by bringing in a new discipline to the boundary between them. 
And the third answer is we already use external foundries. This is a process that's already pretty well established, and we're using a range of external foundries. Our design teams over the last 5 years or so have learned how to use external foundries. And the fact is they're interacting now with my internal foundry, many of those learnings on expectations of PDKs, design tools, IP libraries are driving the expectations for what is required to be a good internal foundry, which will make my internal foundry a better external foundry as well. So I see this as a very regenerative cycle as we unleash these energies. And ultimately, I'm the CEO across both, and we'll be making good decisions to hold both of them accountable even as we clarify the interfaces and the efficiencies between them.",259

I guess, Dave, as you think about the strategy, how does it change capital intensity for the business, not into '23, but perhaps say, over the next 5 years? Is it still that 35% type of number? Or how should we be thinking about it?",47

Good question, C.J. So obviously, in this investment phase where we're catching up on node transitions, what we do, we will have a higher CapEx intensity, this 35%. But we do expect, as we get out of this phase, to be back down to a more normalized level of about 25% CapEx intensity. So there definitely will be an evolution and adjustment. And that's one of the key components of allowing us to kick up our free cash flow to this 20% of revenue level that is ultimately the model.",91

And also just piling on to that, we also look -- we always look at that through the lens of our smart capital strategy, where clearly, we're viewing both the gross CapEx, but more importantly, the net CapEx from your perspective and how we access other pools of capital to be able to build that out in a very financially prudent way and those other approaches, EU, U.S. CHIPS Act, ITC skip give us a lot of flexibility, combined with the Shell First Strategy to be able to make sure we're spending the capital, the more expensive equipment capital, more timed with the market demand clarity.",107

So given the high levels, you can make the argument that the industry actually needs even more consolidation than it has already seen at the level of the -- some of the biggest players in the industry. 
Can you share your thoughts on how you think about the potential for this large scale -- this kind of large-scale M&A or maybe joint ventures amongst the class of the leading-edge players? Or are they just -- are there issues like FTC-related or national security-related that just means that thinking about that kind of consolidation or joint ventures across borders is something that just takes it off the table and maybe it's a different analysis for consolidation versus joint ventures?",167

And I would just say, I mean, I generally said that, hey, we see this industry being a consolidating industry over time, particularly on the manufacturing side because of the extreme capital intensity, but also the incredible R&D costs, right? If you think -- if you want to have a world-class technology development team, all you have to do is spend $5 billion a year in R&D and do that for 30 years, right? Now you're okay. Now you're world class, right? And these are just extraordinary long-term investments that you have to build up and operate this way. And against that, I've consistently said I expect that there will be further consolidations in the industry going forward. 
Now what shape those will take, what the timing of those will be, what will be the trigger points that would position such moves, and as you said, there's many factors associated with that in terms of regulatory, legal, financial steps associated with it. But fundamentally, economics 101, right, would say, you will see further consolidations into the future, and we believe that will be the case. And we would expect to be a consolidator in that process over time.",206

We've got some, I think, relief from some of the commentary for cloud CapEx during this earnings season in the last 3 days and particularly from Meta last night, but the rest of the big guys as well. But on the flip side, there's some rumblings that maybe there's a couple of more months before Sapphire Rapids might ramp in big volumes. 
So I'm just -- maybe if you could help and level set us on the timing of big cloud volume of Sapphire Rapids and how that now dovetails in with the timing. It seems like you're keeping for Emerald Rapids in late '23.",117

And as I indicated, Sapphire Rapids is now PRQed and the ramp is underway. We are ramping the product as we speak, strong customer demand. We expect this will be our fastest-ever Xeon to 1 million units, and we're going to push that quite aggressively, and the factories are ramping up, as we speak. Obviously, this is good news for that business competitively, a big ASP uptick as well on the product. So lots of good things come. 
Also, we had a particularly good quarter on the execution front, not just Sapphire Rapids PRQ but great health on Granite Rapids, Emerald Rapids looking very good, Sierra Forest. So the next 3 generation products are all making very good milestones, and I really feel like the worst of our execution is behind us. And we're really starting to see some enthusiasm, momentum, excitement building in those teams as they turn the corner on these products. 
We do think, as I said in the formal, that the market is softer, right, on the enterprise side and somewhat on the cloud side as you reinforced by some of the other comments from others. That said, as we ramp these products, it's all about having the best product to gain share, to gain ASP, to improve the margins of the business. And we now feel like our portfolio is taking share or taking shape to accomplish exactly that. 
And we're going to be aggressive. We're going to fight for every socket. This is a game where we have to reestablish ourselves in the marketplace. And now we're starting to have the product line to do that. And that's exactly what you'll see. In addition to that, we're also building out our software assets to have an increased value proposition. And one of those is, for instance, with Sierra. Sapphire Rapids is the market improvements in AI, but even more importantly, in security. And with our security services and capabilities, very differentiated areas like confidential computing are gaining quite a lot of interest in the industry for not just enterprise, but cloud customers as well. 
So a lot of things going on there. But overall, we feel like our momentum is being reestablished in this critical, critical area of our business and one that we know has a lot of attention from you all in the community.",395

One thing that piqued my interest, Pat, in your prepared script was -- I mean there's a lot of discussion of the 5 nodes in 4 years and halfway through that transition is 20A with RibbonFET or gate all around. So you guys are going to need to go through that jump. Your competition as well. 
And you mentioned, I think, some tape-outs of your own stuff but also some tape-outs of potential external foundry customers on 20A that seemed, I don't know, from the language used, kind of meaningful. So if you could give us a status report there on sort of the gate all-around RibbonFET progress you see versus competition? And is this external customer really significant?",121
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2022",2022-10-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3745.0,2666610.0,100318698.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,52,"Yes. Thank you. And on 20A and 18A, they go to RibbonFET, as you say. And Intel has driven every major transistor, right, in the volume production for the last 35 years. So the idea that we're the ones who are going to drive this major new transistor structure into production is something that we're pretty committed to be a driver for 20A, as you said, on track, on schedule. We expect 20A will primarily be an internal node, not one that we have a lot of external foundry customers for the external foundry chipset or tape-outs are largely associated with 18A. 
And a very typical process for a foundry customer will be ""give me a test chip of my circuits on your process."" And that's exactly what we taped out. The first one this quarter. We'll have several more in the pipeline. So now we're taking out not only our test chips for 18A, but our foundry customer test chips for 18A, and that's a pretty critical milestone when they see the results of the silicon for them making a volume decision for a foundry customer. 
So we're exactly on the time line that I described earlier for those tape-outs and those decisions. So as they start to see the silicon results, which we think are going to be very promising, we think that will be a key step to them making major foundry decisions. And overall, this just affirms our 5 nodes in 4 years. We're making the investments. We're seeing good progress to get back to process technology leadership, which for Intel is a tide that raises all boats in the company. It makes our products better. It establishes our new business areas, positions us in a very profound way for foundry to [Technical Difficulty] economic environment. Macro, very challenged, but we're happy with the execution progress we made even though we're not happy with the reported results. And we know we have a lot more work to do there. 
It was also thrilling to participate with the Mobileye IPO in a tough market with very good results. We're prepared for the economic headwinds. We're making the necessary adjustments structurally as well as through our cost model to go through them. And we remain fully committed to being a value generator for our shareholders for the long term as we execute our 2.0. And we believe that, that will be a great result for our owners for the long term.
