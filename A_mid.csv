My calculation is I'm not suing anyone for less than 4 figures, and $350 falls below my threshold to take the Dealership to small claims court.My calculation is that Kia Finance nor their collectors will sue me for less than 4 figures either, and $350 will fall below their threshold. We will just all agree to hate each other, and there will be no suing. If there is suing, I'll sue. Let the games begin, but I'll let them throw the first punch."
February 2020,"It makes sense and is easy enough to do. I did it on a Passat a while back. And a friend of my wife's wanted a Kona last year - the incentives were significant but specific to a lease, so I helped her get the lease done and then she bought it out within a month or two. Lease incentives on my V90 XC were similar to the Stinger deal, to the point I got nearly $20k off MSRP. As with the Kia, the money factor equates to an interest rate around 5%, so I've considered buying out the lease to reduce the interest expense. I may still do it, but with average rates around 3.5%, it doesn't actually save a lot of money, and I lose the risk reduction with being under a lease."

February 2020,"I did the math on this example:https://www.kiaofcherryhill.com/search/new-kia-stinger-cherry-hill-nj/?s:pr=0&cy=08002&md=7494&mk=30&tp=new54K MSRP. I'm thinking you get this below invoice (50,726) so let's say selling price is $49500.The payment here in NJ with tax and only first payment OOP is $670. Acq fee is $595, 450 doc, 400 RegI like the Stinger a lot, but for nearly $700 I'd be forced to look at other options if I was set on leasing."
February 2020,"Evidence #1: It happened to me, and I don't feel particularly lucky or unlucky, I generally assume what happens to me is what happens in general. I'm usually right. Evidence #2: The whole Finance lease return rules, regulations, and contract (as written by Kia Finance) is fatally flawed, incompetently flawed, and rigged to benefit them, with no recourse for the customer to challenge inaccuracies short of a CSI tracking system. Evidence #3: Dealership said they didn't lose a Key FOB in 7 years. Makes it odd they'd burn a customer over $350 if it only happens once every 7 years, seems like a small price to pay that wouldn't dent their bottom line. What's more likely? That it happens weekly, and $350/week would put a dent in their bottom line, and therefore that's why they don't want to pay it. Evidence #4: Kia Finance's whole system of billing and collecting on faulty charges reeks odor. They've done this before. They seem confident they are correct.Bottom line is I find their ""evidence"" no more credible than mine, and I knows whos is right and correct."
February 2020,That's what I'm considering doing with the 2019 GTS I found It's just crazy.
February 2020,"I like that. Didn't think of it, but it sounds like an interesting plan. You'll still suffer lousy depreciation, but at least it's mitigated by the huge upfront discount and the buyout can save you some finance charges, if you use cash. If you don't have cash, then it may be better to let the lease run its course unless you can get a really low interest loan, like 2%. What are top tier open market rates for 36-48 month loans now?"
February 2020,"I think the big Stinger incentives are for 2019 models, but for the Acura TLX it's for the 2020s. And so on the other hand you might consider a 2020 TLX V-6 with super-handling AWD for c. $400 a month with $2500 down, although for that you need to currently have either an Acura or another luxury brand on their list.https://www.acura.com/tools/current-luxury-car-suv-offers-leasingFEATURED STANDARD LEASEExpires 03/02/202020 TLX 9 Speed Automatic SH-AWD Featured Special Loyalty/Conquest Lease. For well-qualified lessees who currently own a 2010 or newer Acura, Audi, BMW, Buick, Cadillac, Genesis, Honda, Infiniti, Lexus, Lincoln, Mercedes Benz or Volvo vehicle.$389 Per month for 36 months.$2,499 Total due at signing"
February 2020,But in month 2 you buy it out for residual plus principal and much different equation.
February 2020,"So, if my rough math is right, say $50K MSRP, 10K incentive, additional $2K off the sticker, we get $25K residual, i.e. $542 capital payment +$120 financial payment +whatever fees and taxes = $640+fees/taxes/month with zero down, say $700-720 per month on a short term 24-month lease. Similarly priced (MSRP) BMW 3-series (essentially entry level 330) even at higher residual (say 61%,, and lower MF, say 0.00142), if gotten with say $4K off the sticker would probably be slightly more. However, load that bimmer up to get similar equipment and performance and you're adding at least couple of hundred bucks."
February 2020,Any evidence it's a widespread problem?
February 2020,"I'm pretty sure that's the case with any captive bank.Not a reason to not lease from the same brand, again."
February 2020,That's a jaw-dropping lease incentive. Amazing deal.Maybe not... what's the MF and residual? Edit... just saw that was answered. Like I thought that MF hurts.
February 2020,"Did you hear about the Key FOB scam the dealership and Kia Finance are in cahoots on? Basically, the way it works is they ""doctor"" paperwork behind closed doors to show 1 Key FOB returned, even if you returned two. Then they say the reason you weren't given a return receipt in writing on the drop off date is that the lease manager wasnt' there to do it."
February 2020,"Add $350 to any lease on a Kia if you are not buying it out due to the Key FOB scam. Also, by the way, the $400 disposition fee isn't waived if you buy another Kia (or lease). It is ONLY waived if you buy or lease through Kia Finance, and Kia Finance only."
February 2020,"And, that's on top of any discount you negotiate off the MSRP.However, the 24/10 residual on the aforementioned GT2 AWD is only 51%, and the MF is .00191, or 4.58%.The GT2 stickers for north of $50K, IIRC."
February 2020,wow
February 2020,That's a jaw-dropping lease incentive. Amazing deal.
February 2020,"$12,200 lease cash for 24 months on GT2 AWD.6 trim levels have lease cash at or above $10K for 24 month terms.Many, many people are ""leasing"", then immediately buying out the lease."
February 2020,"BTW, I looked into incentives on Stinger. Up to 9.5 grand, but only if you take the specific lease through a captive program (24 month for the highest rebate) plus 1.5K conquest and whatever else may come, which can still be a great deal, considering the residual will likely be inflated vs. real value. That's insane. I think they overproduced big time, especially those ""GT+"" models."
February 2020,I also like the 86- I just wish it had abou 100 more hp.
February 2020,"What can I say? It all goes back to-as I call it- my ""misspent street racing youth."""
February 2020,but the only Toyota/Lexus car I would seriously consider is the SupraWell that makes sense as it's mostly a BMW anyway
February 2020,"I generally like Toyota trucks and SUVs, but the only Toyota/Lexus car I would seriously consider is the Supra."
February 2020,"I like long standard equipment and short comprehensive packaging approach in Acura (Lexus and Infiniti are much more elaborate). My only beef is that their model lineup is short (no hatchbacks, wagons, or any other ""special"" type of vehicle) and their color combinations are very limited in comparison with Germans. They are all about playing it safe, whereas Germans are willing to take chances, make some special models for individuals with ""off-beat"" tastes, and pare it back when necessary. I haven't seen Acura taking any real chances in their model lineup, Lexus made some efforts in high end performance range, but generally they are all a bit too oriented for the average buyer in that segment. Basically cookie cutter. Very well made, very well appointed, but cookie cutter nevertheless."
February 2020,"That’s a plus (or minus, depending on your perspective) of the traditional Asian packaging model. Like Acura. Just a few trim levels (option packages), so a a spec at one dealer is exactly like one at he next dealer. Just about everything is standard. And in this case, with base/tech/advanced, you can get a lease special strippo, a well equipped model, or almost silly level of gizmos. Plus a sport trim."
February 2020,"My local dealers have several of $39.5K-40.5K A4s in their stock (within 50 miles), so it is possible to get one if you really want it (I wouldn't). In upscale German brands equipment levels is mostly a decision of a local dealer's inventory manager (within model allotments) and their view of the market. I've been following BMW's inventory at my local dealers once every so often and they can't be any different from each other. For example, one dealer may have majority of strippers ready for low-end leases, another may have mostly fully loaded stuff for 20 grand more. They may say they order ""what sells"", but nobody will convince me that markets 20 miles apart are so different from each other than you'll sell only white cars here and black cars there. It's all what these guys think sells and what they personally think looks nice and fits. It's all their taste and ""feel"". Then they sell it and as long as they hit their target, their confirmation bias will tell them they made correct decisions. If they don't, they'll blame slowdown, four seasons, drought, snow, rain, wrong Moon phase and current president of the United States. I don't think there is any science there at all. Kia's MSRPs are pure fantasies drawn by accountants in the beginning of the model, later brought to reality, just like domestic manufacturer's."
February 2020,Cause faster is something everybody desperately needs. Without it we will all be lost...
February 2020,"Alex on Autos likes the 44 mpg Lexus 300h, which gets the highest mpg for any luxury car that isn't a plug-in. Probably won't happen, but I'd like to see Acura come up with faster competitor for this model with the next generation TLX.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhLG6r5bp0k&amp;t=1272s"
February 2020,"When it comes to entry-level luxury vehicles, the list prices can often be deceptive. For instance the Audi A4 has a starting msrp of c.$38k, but as far as I can tell no such models are ever built or sold. The least expensive A4 at my local Audi dealer has an msrp of c. $45k. And then we have the example of the KIA Stinger, which seems like a very impressive car, the equal to something from BMW or Mercedes if they offered something like that, but at an msrp of thousands less. And because of the huge lease incentives the msrp of the Singer is deceptive on the other side. You might think that with an msrp of $45k or more that a loaded Stinger is out of reach, but since it's actually c. $10k less it becomes quite good deal."
February 2020,The Stinger I'm looking at is $48k- I'm shooting for $36k-$37k.
February 2020,"So with the 10k lease incentive and a dealer discount is it possible to get a c. $45,000 Stinger for close to 30k?https://www.kia.com/us/en/stingerAnd since the base Stinger starts at c. 35k, would it be possible to get that model for as low as c. 25k?"
February 2020,"Yes, it shares the same platform with the G70. The Stinger is a bit bigger than the G70 but I think it looks much more interesting. And the current lease incentive is $10k- at least on 2019 models. On one Stinger forum there is a thread devoted to the process of leasing the car and then buying out the lease."
February 2020,"Yeah, and I’ve got a house full of LED lightbulbs that are supposed to last 10 yrs, yet I have to change them every 2, if I’m lucky."
February 2020,Am I remembering correctly that the KIA Stinger is build on the same basic platform as the Genesis G70? And did I also hear that the Stinger has lease incentives of up to $10k? Sounds like an amazing deal on an impressive car....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38nDEvihRUk
February 2020,"I'm still giving a hard look to the Stinger GTS. Normally you would have to beat me with a stick to consider an AWD car, but the GTS D-AWD system allows the driver to select the default F/R torque split all the way up to sending 100% of the power to the rear axle, which is also fitted with a mechanical LSD- a feature rarely found in AWD cars. My only real gripe is that the GTS isn't any faster than my 2er. I was hoping to get something legitimately quicker- running the quarter in the mid to low twelves."
February 2020,the software updates (or lack of same) are what could easily render the car useless.
February 2020,"Agreed, Tesla must not have realized how much $$$$ there is in replacement parts due to bad drivers out there.Probably little after-market supporting them so far too."

February 2020,It’s the horror stories that I’ve read of owners with cars out of warranty or needing collision parts but can’t get them or have a long wait could be a big negative compared to owning a Camry or main stream vehicle.
February 2020,"Tesla has apparently used up all of their tax credits, and so those are no longer available:https://insideevs.com/news/390520/today-federal-tax-credit-tesla-gone/Tesla claims, however, that the battery on the Model 3 is designed to last at least 300,000 miles in regular use, and in few years that might be well over 500,000:https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1117099861273219073https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-may-soon-have-a-battery-that-can-last-a-million-miles/The Tesla Model 3 at this point gets ""free"" software updates over the web:https://www.tesla.com/support/software-updatesThe current model 3 motor is designed to last perhaps as long as 1 million miles:https://electrek.co/2018/10/15/tesla-drive-after-million-miles-test/https://twitter.com/tesla/status/1051911793373638661"
February 2020,"wonder if that took into account the tax credits? another wildcard.one other thing with the 10 year comparison. The Tesla is basically a PC. in 10 years, the batteries may or may not work, and the car could be out of date and not upgrade-able. At least you know the Camry will be perfectly fine to just keep driving!"
February 2020,"ALG apparently puts the RV of the model 3 after 5 years at 31%. 31% is almost certainly too low, but 66% seems too high. In any case, after 10 years the RV on a model 3 is maybe going to be at most 30%, which means that the calculation is off by another $4000 or so in saying that a Tesla model 3 is as cheap to own in the long run as a Camry.Also missing from the calculation is the cost of the Tesla home charger, which costs $500, with maybe an additional $500 to install. So that's another $1k where this calculation is off. The bottom line is that the model 3, rather than being around $2k less expansive than a Camry over 10 years, is probably closer to being $6k more expensive. But, if you compared a Tesla with a Mercedes A220 or BMW 3-series, it seems like the Tesla might come out on top in terms of 10 year costs."

As far as I know, 4-wheel steering isn't available on any car costing less than maybe $70,000 or so, although I'm not sure what cars are available with 4WS even at that price.

February 2020,66% RV after 5 years on the model 3? And 40% at 10 yrs? HAHAHAHAHA
February 2020,"The person in this video calculates that over 10 years a mid-level Camry with an msrp of c. $28k will have ownership costs of about $54k, while the lowest cost Tesla Model 3 over 10 years will cost about $52k. The basic argument is that it makes sense in the long run financially to get a Tesla. Maybe. But one thing that isn't taken into account is that a good discount off of msrp can be achieved with the Camry, while in contrast a Tesla I think always sells for full msrp. And so that right there more than erases the difference. And if you're really looking at lowest ownership costs over ten years, my guess is that a Camry hybrid, Accord hybrid, or Sonata hybrid will beat the Model 3 by a significant margin over ten years. Hmmm. The Tesla 3 is still an awesome and appealing vehicle, but it has a highway range of 250 miles, while my Acura TLX has a highway range of over 550 miles using the EPA rating, and since I often get c. 3-4 mpg over the epa rating in the real world, my actual highway range is about 600. But it is true that a Tesla goes from 0-60 a lot faster. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sOjXCQVSKA"
February 2020,"I did add the spare when I got the car. The tire and kit is a dealer installed accessory. Probably a waste of money, but what can I say, I worry about stuff like this!Pretty sure I could take it out at the end of the lease and they wouldn’t notice but I didn’t keep all the foam filler parts so I’m not likely to bother."
February 2020,It's a Lazarus moment. The board is coming back to life after six months. Perhaps others will as well.Perhaps not.

August 2019,I should go see what they will offer on a lease!
August 2019,Lots of 2019's left right now though.
August 2019,"well, the Hyundai BtoB is transferable and that is 5/60. So only one year different. And in 2020 VW ditched the 6/72 anyway."
August 2019,We still have the Kia.... 4 cars is way too much though. Need to schedule the return. We are under-miles and she promised to drive it at least twice this week to work (tomorrow and thurs.). Probably should return it this weekend. Due date is Sept. 3rd.
August 2019,"nd 
It is nice! Digital HD cluster gauges in SEL trim. Once you get that, you never go back. Pano roof. A very nice leatherette, especially in interior gray color. We got the Stone Blue (sort of a grayish bluish hint of green) with the gray interior, a nice combo. Her first choice was ice silver which is like a super light almost white nardo gray, but that seems to have been discontinued as a color. One salesman suggested Audi wanted the color. 8 speed auto, 2.0T motor tuned for 87 octane. Lots of room vertically and length-wise. Good looking well-designed SUV!The 6-year 72K mile bumper to bumper warranty is almost guaranteed to be used and come in handy, even if it were a Honda, which it isn't! It's also a TRANSFERABLE warranty so it's not a gimmick like Hyundai/Kia where the warranty is only good for the first owner. I will say the Alltrack was problem free for 31K miles. Wife says she got the 4-motion because it felt and drove better than the 2-wd model which she tested back to back. Says the AWD felt lighter/peppier, probably due to better acceleration, even in the dry. Something about the feel of AWD, which she said reminded her of the Alltrack drive, which is a good thing."
August 2019,"nice. So the Kia finally went back? I have the Tiguan on my ""to look at"" list. Has to be really nice to get my wife to consider a VW though!"
August 2019,"I don't really see any cost cutting. However, it does seem the S is now a rental fodder model trim line, the SE used to be loaded, but is now sort of the base model replacing what the S used to be, and the SEL is now the loaded up tarted model, but still not every bell and whistle, which is either the SEL R-Line or SEL Premium line. My wife just got a Tiguan SEL 4-Motion, and it's pretty darn good and loaded. I'd say it's overpriced, but not with a giant discount we were able to negotiate. It was based on the ""Costco"" deal, which is super aggressive, and I was happy having it matched. Some dealerships wouldn't ""match it"" and claimed there were probably ""catches"" to it. Other than having to listen to (waste time) the finance guy sales spiel trying to sell warranty on a 6 year 72K bumper to bumper warranted car, not really any ""catches"" at all."
August 2019,Looks like lease is the best bet on WV/Audi. Cost cutting to support past sins might delay quality improvements.
August 2019,"So it's all about dealers and their profit margins, just like those disappearing maintenance programs. I guess people need to get paid, who knew  ."
August 2019,"4 yr/50k, same as Audi. From what I read dealers said selling an extended warranty became difficult with so long of coverage, hitting their profit potential."
August 2019,"You mean 2019 is the last year? That’s a bummer. Wonder what will come after. Standard 3/36? So far no word on the website, probably because there are no 2020 models there yet."
August 2019,The 6/72 warranty is over with the 2019 model year.
August 2019,"It just made my next car list. Looks very much like A5 Sportsback. Wonder if the 4motion AWD is exactly the same tech as Audi’s quattro, or is it different. That’s often really hard to find out, unless you browse all those Audi/VW geek sites and even there you need to be careful who to believe. Even if the package isn’t quite Audi, it looks like it will be 10 grand less, give or take for like configurations, especially in upper trim (mid 40s vs mid 50s), which seems a fair tradeoff if it delivers on essentials. VW has now 6-year btb warranty, probably to win trust back after the scandals, this definitely helps, as long as they make good on it."

Doesn't seem like it, unless I'm missing something. Although the TLX will cost c. $1500 more each year in gas and maintenance compared to a Model 3, even over ten years that doesn't come close to erasing the nearly $22k difference.If, however, by July of 2021 Acura has an electric car that has an msrp of maybe $38k it might make sense. First, my guess is that unlike a Tesla that goes for full msrp you might get a discount on an electric Acura. And then you'd get the federal tax credit of $7500 that has already almost expired for Tesla. Between the two of those things it might make sense for me to go electric—if it's Acura or Honda.But if I end up keeping the TLX that would be fine with me, because so far I love driving it."

August 2019,"There is no shortage of music from any era. The problem is that stations both OTA and satellite maintain limited playlists based on criteria they believe will keep the majority of their listeners happy. I have several thousand tunes from my preferred era to choose from and keep hundreds of them on USB for use in the car. Mix them up every so often, dropping ones I get tired of and adding others, and create new playlists when I do. Don't ever listen to radio now. I have no desire to seek out new music because most of it leaves me cold. An affliction of my age."
August 2019,"That’s the problem with any oldies genre station. They aren’t making any new songs and the catalogue of old ones isn’t that big.So branch out, and listen to new music!"
August 2019,"Ha Ha...All the stations get a little repetitive, I bounce around a lot to try and avoid that."
August 2019,"She obviously must have many other good qualities because that one tendency might be grounds for divorce!! When I had XM, 80s on 8 was my main choice, though the repetition got tiresome after a while."
August 2019,"I just did the opposite. After nearly 10 years of commuting together wife and I are now separate. It feels weird, but now I can rock out to 80s on 8 or Hair Nation while she listens to her Pitbull radio lol"
August 2019,"As some of you know I was forced to find another job as the firm I worked for 2.5 years closed its location Charlotte and moved those positions to the home office in MA. My new job requires me to work downtown, about 6 blocks from my wife. As she is already paying $$$ to park we have been commuting in together. So far so good but certainly a change from me driving separately and listening to my radio stations, etc. At this rate I don’t see replacing the Accord anytime soon as it is only driven on weekends and the occasional day when I need to drive in separately."
August 2019,Preview of the next-generation Acura TLX Type S by Kelley Blue Book. Guesses are that the next-gen TLX will arrive as a 2021 model sometime next summer. I think it looks good.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAfjIt33ilI
August 2019,"I think I agree with all of your points for now. But if Elon's predictions pan out, in 2 more years (when my lease is up) I might be able to get a Model 3 that has a 400 mile range, charges in half the time of current models (in other words, takes about 20 minutes to go from 20% charge to 80%), and lasts the rest of my life—even if I drive all over the country multiple times—with minimal maintenance and no gas. But since I'm already 54, I think my Acura TLX could well last till I'm 70—if I make it to that age."
August 2019,"well, I am not buying that logic! driving around local means gassing up once a week or 2. and there are stations everywhere, so if you are getting low you just swing into one, and 5 minutes later gassed up and on your way.but in the same usage, an EV would not concern me. It really is travelling that does it. and we don't normally stop much. gas if going 400+ miles (well, in my car, 300 in the RDX!), otherwise just a quick pit stop for bathroom and stretch, and if eating it will be a quick food place. and driving in rural areas at weird times, which we do, is really not going to be comfortable in an EV.Kind of a moot point anyway for us, because we can't afford the EV equivalent of the car we would like to have as our one nice set of wheels!"
August 2019,"With discounts the two of us got our TLXs for c. $30k, and these cars have a c.450 mile range per tank in mixed driving. The ""long-range"" Tesla Model 3 has a range of c.300 miles, and it costs about $48k and has no discounts. If we keep them, our TLXs should be able to last with good maintenance and a bit of luck well over 200,000 miles. The interior luxury of a TLX looks to me like it's beyond a Model 3. The long-range $48k Tesla seems out of my price range. But over 10 years and 150,000 miles it might be less per mile driven than even a TLX 2.4. But over the three years of our lease I think we are way ahead. And my guess is that over 5 years we will be ahead too. In terms of range anxiety, there's a video that makes some sense that says that gas engines produce just as much range anxiety as a Tesla. His argument is basically that because you each day charge your Tesla at home and/or at work up to maybe 250 miles or so of charge, and never have to stop even at a Supercharge station, you never have range anxiety in normal driving of commuting and shopping around town. With a gas engine, however, you do have to think about filling up so that you don't run out of gas. On a trip with a Tesla there is some range anxiety, but that's minimized by the Tesla Supercharger network. The included Tesla trip software calculates out your trip and guides you exactly to each recommended Supercharger based on your car's range. A long trip in a Tesla is slower because of the c. 45 minute or so charging times, but since often we need to stop for a meal and a little sight-seeing every 250 miles or so anyway, it's not as much of a slowdown as we might expect....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zvb7gV0GRNE&amp;t=544sI still love my Acura. But I'm beginning to hope that by the time I get my next car that Acura will just buy some of Tesla's tech and also buy access to the Supercharger network. Elon Musk apparently said quite a while ago that he'd be ok with selling to another car maker access to the Supercharger network, but that so far no one has taken him up on it."
August 2019,"there are still limits to a full electric that would prevent me from getting one. Unless it was really cheap (as opposed to really expensive, which they are), and I truly just needed a 2nd car for pure local duty.the problem is, they are expensive, and we can only afford one car in that high price range, and it will be the one we take on trips. So, the train ain't meeting on this one! No way I am taking one on say Christmas eve trip at 10 PM across the boondocks of NYS, in usually crappy weather, and have to be trying to find a charging station in an area I would really prefer not to stop in! Or get out to charge then sit there for 2 hours while it does. even worse if you can't afford more than say a leaf or Bolt. Not a suitable family truckster travel car anyway."
August 2019,"According to Elon Musk....""Model 3 drive unit & body is designed like a commercial truck for a million mile life. Current battery modules should last 300k to 500k miles (1500 cycles). Replacing modules (not pack) will only cost $5k to $7k.""https://electrek.co/2019/04/13/tesla-model-3-longevity-claims-elon-musk/"
August 2019,"https://loupventures.com/tesla-model-3-cost-of-ownership-slightly-cheaper-than-a-camry/""Average all-in cost per mile for a Model 3 is $0.46, compared to the Camry LE at $0.49, and Audi A5 at $0.80.""This study claims to show that a Tesla Model 3 costs less over 5 years than a Toyota Camry, which is shocking.But I don't agree with some of the numbers that were used. For instance, it says that maintenance and repairs for a Camry over 5 years will be about $4000, but my guess is that it would be about half of that (10 oil changes x $50 each =$500 + 4 tires for c.$1000 + 500 additional would be my estimate). The Tesla model was c. $39k on which no discounts are possible, but with a Camry for c.$25k you might get $4000 off of msrp, which they didn't indicate. So I feel like the study is about $6000 off in favor of the Tesla. Finally, although the Tesla battery has a 8 years/100,000 mile warranty, I'm wondering if you own the Tesla for 10 years and 150,000 or more miles if a new $8000 or so battery is likely to be needed.Still, the bottom line is that the economics may possibly be shifting toward electrics, and specifically Tesla. There's no doubt that a Tesla is cheaper over 5 years than their other comparison, which was an Audi A5. And now Elon Musk says that starting next year the design life of the battery for the Model 3 will more than double:https://electrek.co/2019/04/23/tesla-battery-million-miles-elon-musk/If this pans out, this means that in a year or two the batteries of a Teslas Model 3 will be able to last maybe as much as 500,000 miles. The electric motors for a Tesla are already likely to last at least 500,000 miles, because well-designed electric motors are inherently longer lasting than most internal combustion engines. Plus there are no oil changes etc. For high-mileage drivers the Tesla might become a top choice, because the cost per mile driven would almost certainly be quite low.I've gone from being a Tesla skeptic to someone who thinks there might be something to this."
August 2019,Tesla seemingly is on the edge financially. My guess is that they are going to pull through and be a major player in the growing electric car market for years to come. But we'll see....
August 2019,"I don't think so. It's much more likely US sales will revert closer to Q1 numbers than maintain Q2 numbers. Anybody, who read what Tesla actually had to do to get to those Q2 numbers would know there was a lot of one-time moves, just like Q4 of last year. I think a much more likely number is missing 200k target by a small margin. Much more interesting to me is how many new EV buyers are left in the current market. Those who wanted one, got it (most of them anyway) and they can pray to it, if that's their fancy. Now it's about people like myself - I have the money, I COULD buy it even at current prices, if I wanted to. There are aspects about those vehicles that I like and respect, but I'm not even considering it at this point. One reason is I'm not completely convinced Tesla will be around in five years, or to be more precise, I think the probability of complete failure of the company is significantly higher than zero (in mathematical terms ""non-trivial""). I can't ignore this in my calculus. That's on top of the lack of energy portability that's offered in gasoline engine. It could do well as a second vehicle in the house, but simply I have no space for two vehicles."
August 2019,"The battery warranty for the Tesla seems pretty good....""Model 3 - 8 years or 100,000 miles, whichever comes first, with minimum 70% retention of Battery capacity over the warranty period.""https://www.tesla.com/support/vehicle-warrantyAnd....""Model 3 with Long-Range Battery - 8 years or 120,000 miles, whichever comes first, with minimum 70% retention of Battery capacity over the warranty period.""But that still seems like it means that at somewhere around ten years Tesla expects the batteries to wear out. At that point the car is out of warranty and loses most of its resale value. A ten year old Acura in good shape, on the other hand, might still have ten more years of life without major repairs."
August 2019,I still have 2 years left on the lease for my Acura TLX. But maybe after that? Probably not. I'm more likely to buy the TLX for 18.5k at that point. But the Tesla Model 3 does seem like it's a really good car. After watching all these videos my doubts about it are slowly falling away. The big thing I wonder about is what happens with the batteries after ten years....
August 2019,"@benjaminh, sounds like your next car?"

August 2019,"As I posted in another discussion...The Club Sport is at the dealer for its annual service, and my service advisor gave me an M340i xDrive for a loaner.First impressions:It’s maybe a tick faster than my 2 Series, but the xDrive filters the fun too much for my tastes. I scared a friend quite a bit accelerating through a corner flat out when he thought I was going to lift and brake. I like the interior a lot- including the glass cockpit. I like the latest generation of iDrive, but it’s considerably different from what I’m used to.The voice recognition works quickly and accurately. The base sound system is surprisingly good. I’d still want to audition the H-K upgrade, but the standard system is no slouch. It’s still too big for my tastes, but the car masks its bulk to an impressive degree.An M240i with the M340i cockpit, 382 hp motor, and M Sport diff would be just about perfect for me."

August 2019,"The extended range Model 3 can go c.300 miles, which is sort-of ok. But once it's empty even at a Supercharger it takes over an hour to get close to a full recharge—compared to a fill-up of an ICE car at a gas station that takes at most ten minutes. For most road trips I just don't think that I want to stop that long at a Supercharger station in a strip mall or whatever. But I actually really like the styling of all Tesla vehicles."
August 2019,"I just can’t get past range anxiety. That and the practicality factor for my purposes make it not work for me. IMHO, the styling is meh."
August 2019,"This review of 26,000 miles of ownership in a Tesla Model 3 says that compared to a similar gas car he's saved about $2000 by using electricity instead of gasoline. But the Telsa Model 3 with a few options is, as he says, a $50,000 car on which you can't get any discounts. Because of big discounts and lease incentives I paid close to $30,000 for my more luxurious TLX. With that $20,000 difference there's no way even at 2k in fuel savings a year that you'll come out ahead. And I don't drive 26k miles a year, but more like 14k. And so the fuel savings would maybe be more like $1200. Plus my guess is that by the time he gets to 100,000 miles, if he keeps the Model 3 that long, he might need to replace the batteries, which might be a c. $10,000 repair, while with maintenance and good luck the engine and transmission on a TLX might go past 200k without major repairs. The TLX has environmental costs, but so does getting rid of or trying to recycle a huge number of Tesla batteries. The bottom line is that the costs for long-term ownership still favors the TLX big a big margin as far as I can see. I see the appeal, but the math just doesn't seem to add up unless you are so well off that costs aren't really a significant factor....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6r5SRM2H3APS Finally, the expensive extended range version of the Model 3 will go about 300 miles before it needs a recharge, while the TLX 2.4 can go twice that on the highway."

An entry-level 3-series on the BMW website without any options and in white or black starts at $42k or so, but in the real world I don't think you'd ever find any like that. They no longer make the de-powered 320i, which I feel mixed about, and so even an entry level 330i is now about the same in performance as V-6 TLX. But since I don't need that much power...."
August 2019,"I am in the same boat. I almost bought a 5 series in 2001 but backed out due to cost ($38K purchase price even back then). though a 3 series now is about as big, better equipped, and if you get a loaner, about the same price!maybe someday, but the ship probably sailed.

August 2019,"On the other thread there's the quote for the Infiniti Q50 for $487 a month, and my guess is that for significantly less you could get a loaded V-6 TLX. With the incentives like they are now you can lease a TLX 2.4 for less than an Accord EXL.That 487 is first pencil with zero negotiation ... I am sure that can be 410-425 with some haggling. In all reality for a not too savvy shopper it comes pretty close to the 1% rule and I'd bet many people would sign the deal. I don't think you can go wrong with either the TLX or the Q50. The TLX is certainly roomier inside, but also FWD biased versus the Infiniti's RWD.The Infiniti drove wonderfully and I feel I could get into some serious trouble with it. The 400HP version must be a total beast."

The system combines VTC (Variable Timing Control), which continuously adjusts the intake camshaft phase, with Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control (VTEC), which changes valve lift, timing and duration of the intake valves.At low rpm, the VTEC intake valve timing and lift are optimized for high torque and low fuel consumption. As engine rpm builds past 4,900 rpm, the VTEC system transitions to a high-lift, long-duration intake cam profile for superior high-rpm engine power.The ""intelligent"" portion of the system is its ability to continuously vary the timing of the intake cam relative to that of the exhaust camshaft. This helps boost power and also provides a smoother idle (allowing idle speed to be reduced). The intake cam timing is varied based on input from sensors that monitor rpm, timing, throttle opening, cam position and exhaust air-fuel ratio. The result is increased fuel efficiency and lower NOx emissions."

June 2019,Good to hear from you benjaminh
June 2019,"That limited edition hand-built TLX seems like a strange duck. My guess is that slow sales of the NSX mean that their elite team of people building those supercars have some time on their hands? And so why not make a rare TLX for the heck of it? But TLX sales, along with most other sedans, are on the weak side at the moment. Could be one of these special vehicles might be had at a big discount at some point. With only 360 being made that's less than 1 vehicles per Acura dealer, isn't it?"

April 2019,"Well, I think the ""satisfaction"" rating for A3 owners was VERY high. Also, there's a lot of high-mile A3's running around, so they must have done something right. I would say reviews were ""mixed"" on the DSG, but a well-trained and calibrated DSG worked wonders in my opinion. Yes, the transmissions were trainable,and had a ""learning"" computer ""brain."" It's important to note they work like a manual, not like an automatic. I personally like the mechanical feel, whereas some people call it a ""lurch"" upon stopping."
April 2019,"Anecdotal evidence is just that, anecdotal. And even if none of them blew up, that still wouldn't mean they had ""mastered the dual clutch"". If the driving experience was not what most of the owners wanted or expected, then you couldn't really say ""mastered""."

April 2019,Putting the TLX into Sport+ mode requires you to use the paddles. I personally have only used them a handful of times. For most of the driving I do around town I don't see the point.
April 2019,"On cars that I've had, when you are in Sport, it will hold the gear, and not revert to drive. Although different vehicles have different methods to handle ""out of range"" issues. Older cars would bounce off the rev limiter, holding the gear, while others would automatically upshift at red-line.Almost all of them will act like a regular automatic, if you go too slow for the gear."
April 2019,There’s some sort of drive mode selector. I don’t bother with it.
April 2019,"No ""Sport"" mode? If you have that, it usually makes the paddles behave differently."
April 2019,Nope. Unless they hid it!
April 2019,"Just like I should dig up the manual for the Outback and figure out how to set up the memory seats, since the wife and I will be sharing it soon."
April 2019,"Your shifter doesn't have a gate to the side, so you can manually do the paddle thing, but with the shift lever?"
April 2019,I don’t think the TLX even has that. I should dig out the manual and look it up.
April 2019,"The Outback does have a manual slot for the gear lever, so you have complete control over the transmission."
April 2019,So far that’s all I have done with it. So maybe that’s all it does!
April 2019,"In the Outback you don't have to touch the gear lever. Just paddle to downshift, then after a while, the computer figures out to return the car to D"
April 2019,that is what I do. Just try them once or twice. Still need to figure out the TLX. Not sure how to switch that to manual mode.
April 2019,"Paddles. Get a new car with paddles.. play around with them for the first week. Then, never touch them again. (my experience)"
April 2019,"I will mention one thing I like -- Ford, in their pickups (don't know about the cars?) has a ""gear indicator"" on the dash. With 6 and 10 speed automatic transmissions, it's interesting to see what gear the computer has picked for you under what circumstances, and how far it drops when you lower the hammer.It really doesn't matter, all that matters is how well the vehicle responds, but I still find it interesting."
April 2019,Buuuuttt... the same can be said of a manual transmission. The only difference is that you are FORCED to be a bit silly with the manual.
April 2019,"They are, but they are a fun diversion sometimes. I've played with them on the ATS and it makes no sense to use them in normal driving. I suppose if you tracked it, that would be a different story."
April 2019,"Our Outback has paddles for the CVT. I've probably used them just a handful of times, mainly just to play around with them. But, here in CO, it's nice to use them to downshift on slippery roads when you're going downhill and want to avoid the brakes."
April 2019,"I think for most people doing what most people do all day in a car, paddle shifters are just a bit silly."
April 2019,"Paddles are no longer slower. Well, not all. The ZF trannies are instantaneous, as are the PDK. And, yes, this is all about getting around faster. If I just want the feel of a car, then I’ll get an old 110hp miata with manual steering and manual brakes."
April 2019,"My friend's Boxster has them. Even when driving on the twisties, this is NOT the same as shifting with a clutch pedal. It reminds me of driving a push-button Plymouth Valiant. Sure, paddle shifting makes sense on a track, since that's where the whole idea originated!"
April 2019,"paddles in my experience are slower though. Usually a delay. Not that I use them much. If you want to shift, but a stick. if you get an automatic, let it do what it was designed to do."
April 2019,That's what the flappy paddles are for.
April 2019,"might be relevant if you are driving flat out on a track. In normal driving, even the rare spirited back road type, I bet most people (including me) don't push the envelope to that extreme, so the fraction of a second difference is meaningless. But the tactile experience and sense of control isn't. ATs are IMO much more likely to spend time trying to hold a much too high gear, or hunting around for the right one, than they are to be snapping off powershifts at the redline. They are more relaxing in stop and go traffic though. Not that lightning quick gear changes matter much in that use!"
April 2019,Paddles!
April 2019,They are faster than a human can operate a clutch---no argument from me there! The point is--are you driving or are you steering?
April 2019,Some of the new autos are so so so so fast in shifting Mr. Shiftright....
April 2019,"This place is so crowded they'll never get out of first gear. Besides, you break me, you buy me."
April 2019,"Speaking of colors (we are now) I left my car on the driveway his AM because it was covered with bugs and road grime, so was bathing it after walking the dog. Coming back up the block I could see quite a few houses, with many cars outside (I still am amazed that even with 2 car garages, so many people park outside).Anyway, my car was mid-block, sticking out in all its red glory. Every other car I could see was black, white, silver or gray, with the lone exception a tan beetle that lives across the street (and practically disappears in front of a tan brick house!)People need to get more color in their lives."
April 2019,I won’t valet my AT cars. No chance in hades I was ever giving them the keys to one of my stickshift ones. And they weren’t even all that exotic.
April 2019,"And if you wrote a note in cursive script telling them how to drive it, they couldn't read it! I brought the C30 to valet parking at an upscale restaurant last week and had the same issue. They looked at that 3rd pedal and when right to the handheld radios--like they were calling a casualty into headquarters. They did find someone though. A keeper of the flame. Young kid. He started the car up and turned to me and said ""Oh, a hot rod, hah?""(there's a sport muffler on it)."
April 2019,This. It's always amusing to take the C30 to the car wash and watch them scramble to find someone who can drive it through.
April 2019,"With just one clutch pedal, I can cripple an entire generation of drivers."
April 2019,"Almost all of the supercars and exotics are doing it, so..."
April 2019,"Speaking of sales, have sales tanked two three floors below? What's with the explosion in calls I'm getting from dealers I may have contacted even a year ago?"
April 2019,I recently got into the Giulia world (leased of course).  about cheating my own love for 6's.
April 2019,Automatic? Really? Whoa---22 lb of boost!
April 2019,I’m very partial to a screaming 4 cyl.
April 2019,"I appreciate a big burbly V8 just as much as the next macho guy, but no way in hell anyone could ever convince me this does NOT sound good!https://youtu.be/-5K_Nvquft8?t=1476"
April 2019,"You get almost the torque of the 6, but alas, you don't get a very nice exhaust note on a 5 cylinder---it's....weird at best."
April 2019,Haha. That's an option.
April 2019,"Or you could compromise like I did, and get a 5 cylinder!"
April 2019,"So much to learn here. But at the end of the day, nope. You may all be right, but you are all so wrong. The sweetness coming from decades of iteratively upgrading a good 6 cylinder cannot be replaced or displaced. At the end of the day, the very sound of a 4 banger with or without a turbo is awful, and if for no other reason, even that alone is one reason I don't want or like a 4 banger. But I'm running out of options to market forces. Also part of the reason I've started to lease and let the 99% shoulder the cost of my leases through tax writeoffs instead of buying these depreciating assets."
April 2019,Those are just donuts - these are DONUTS.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PVcSCJZM8tU
April 2019,"Do they really have much low end torque? I wouldn't think so, but I don't know the specs."
April 2019,"With this amount of torque, RWD and rear mounted engine, absolutely."
April 2019,Well that's one way to warm up the tires!
April 2019,YES! https://youtu.be/Tbnxs5QH5J4FFW to 0:38 to speed along.
April 2019,Can you even do donuts on an F1 car?
April 2019,Some members on Edmunds have reason to worry even when under warranty @jmonroe with the Korean automakers. He's not the only one with a muddy history on really cashing in on that 10-year only on paper warranty.
April 2019,Not sure about that! Shouldn't you be able to do some donuts if you win the race?
April 2019,"When Audi did a travelling ""Experience"" drive with their own cars long ago (1st generation manual R8's and S5's), they told people to put in in 3rd gear, and keep it there, bouncing off the limiter, I think that limited speeds to the double digits maximum. This was lead-follow, but at pretty fast speeds for a beginner."
April 2019,"The Glen was the first track I ever drove; over the course of the day the weather went from cool and sunny to cold and raining. It was a bit intimidating at first, but it was fun. Your son needs to attend an HPDE there- not just a lead/follow cruise."
April 2019,With older cars you never know what you’ll uncover. Certainly frustrating.
April 2019,"Oh, very very slow, thanks for asking. Everything from the top end, including heads, is strewn about the garage floor. Most recently, I pulled the steering column and disassembled to replace the bearings. I found it has been pulled apart somewhere along the way and improper hardware used in reassembly. They actually taped nuts in place. So many fun times."
April 2019,How is the Coronet coming? Ready to drive soon. Pics?
April 2019,my 74 duster had all kinds of gauges. No tach though.
April 2019,"It was a different time, as they say. One I prefer, actually."
April 2019,Yup. My Coronet has that. Absolutely mind blowing to me that anyone ever thought routing the vehicles full electrical output through one wire through one gauge was a good idea.
April 2019,At least into the '70s most Chrysler products had an ammeter in their instrument cluster. Unusual even for the times. They are now a source of fires and other problems in original cars where connections have corroded due to heat buildup resulting from increased resistance. It is surprising to me that it took so long for them to switch to voltmeters. At least they still provided a gauge of some sort..
April 2019,"Thank you -- I rest my case. My baseline is my MG's Smith instruments that displayed oil pressure, coolant temperature and (head for the fainting couch) an ammeter, which involved heavy wiring in and out of the instrument panel, plus the obligatory fuel level. Anyway, they all read real stuff, and were quite helpful in monitoring the health (or lack thereof) of my little '65 MGB as I drove it through 44 states and six provinces in the late '60s and early'70s. I even added an oil temperature gauge, which was connected via a hollow tube to a bulb that inserted into a fitting that I had brazed into the oil pan during one of the several times I had the engine down. This is how I learned that it takes most of an hour or two for the oil to reach a stable temperature when the ambient temperature is below zero, for those of you who wonder why your fuel mileage sucks in the winter.Good times.0.05% of the people who drive BMWs (the ostensible ""driver's car) understand a word of what I just said, let alone the rest of the driving public, who drive cheaper appliances. Yes, I'm a pi$$ed-off old man, but my TSX has well over 150K miles on it and is still fun to drive, even though it only displays fuel level, RPM and speed (along with about 17 lighted symbols that come on during startup, and hopefully go back off). At least I still have to drive (and shift) it."
April 2019,"I remember a few years back, in the Ford diesel truck forums, there was a debate about the oil pressure gauge. Most everyone had noticed that those gauges never showed anything but 5/8 of full pressure. An engineer (you know how engineers are) performed some tests and reported back that there were only two possible readings from that gauge. -- ""0"" (no reading) or ""5/8 scale"". As you varied the resistance to ground, the needle would jump from 0 to 5/8. No other readings were possible."
April 2019,"Marketing: ""The focus group has confirmed that consumers would like to have a boost gauge. 5% because they actually care, and 60% because they want to feel 'racier.'""Finance: ""Only if you can add it to the car at no additional cost.""Engineering: ""Done! It consists of 4 LEDs that mark 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, and full boost. It estimates based on how quick the RPMs build and not any actual data or new sensors because cost and, let's face it, consumers are stupid and only need idiot lights. And the lawyers said we couldn't let everyone feel that 'racy' so we buried it in the 5th level of the nav menu."""
April 2019,"On what planet will this happen? Certainly not Earth. Cars today don't have water temperature or oil pressure gauges, or if they do they're often displaying artificial stuff.Dream on."
April 2019,"I'd bet on a ""highly-stressed"" turbo built in recent years to be far far more reliable than my 1967 big block NA. Its all relative."
April 2019,"A race engine has a whole different role (and life span) than a luxury car, of course. If a race engine gets you 1 foot over the finish line and then blows up, it's done its job."
April 2019,Let's not even talk about what nitrous systems do to race engines.
April 2019,"Hopefully the turbo motor has been adequately strengthened, with mods for cooling and oiling. Turbos got a bad reputation in the early days because not much was done to the stock motors.The ""problem"" with any turbo or SC option is that the forced induction will exploit any weakness that develops in the engine. I have an aftermarket boost gauge on my car and I would hope all new turbo cars have them, too. Tells you what's going on in there."
April 2019,"My point is that with a naturally aspirated engine you need to do lots of mechanical work to make more power - heads, pistons, intake, fuel system, etc. As it comes from the factory there is usually lots of margin or capacity left. A modern D.I. turbo engine removes much of that margin to get more power from a smaller engine. It is much more highly stressed, not only structurally on things like pistons and rings and bearings but also much more sensitive to oil life, adequate cooling, etc. Adding a tune exacerbates that."
April 2019,"A tune is a tune--it's going to put more wear on your car even if well-engineered. Warranties are great, but they don't keep cars from breaking. If you buy hi-performance, there's always a trade off and you have to up your maintenance game, too."
April 2019,WG is a tough track; nice turns... he will enjoy
April 2019,My son is going to get to take his genesis 3.3 out on the track at Watkins glen. 3 laps following the pace car. He’s looking forward to it. No clue how fast they will let him go though.
April 2019,10 year warranty on a twin turbo 365hp/376lb/ft. in 3.3 ltr package from Korea. No worries
April 2019,"And some car-makers might be on the razor's edge at stock power ratings, while others are barely breaking a sweat at Stage 2 tuneups."
April 2019,I wouldn't let worry about turbo durability affect my decision to buy the type of car we're talking about here.
April 2019,The engine in my MS3 was relatively high-strung and at 138k miles the turbo was not showing any signs of wear or other issues.
April 2019,"There is a difference between factory turbo and some stage 10 kit you got of an website. However, it is to be seen how those turbos will perform at 100K+ miles. I read Ford vehicles suffer from reliability issues with their ""Ecoboost"" turbo engines, but I'm not sure what kind of reliability problems these are. Sometimes it may be electrical/computer trouble that has nothing to do with engine stress, more with crappy software or even crappier electrical components. Those can kill engines (or at least owner's enthusiasm) way before the combustion pressure can."
April 2019,"I do believe you are overgeneralizing. Engines like the ecoboost in Ford pickups are not ""highly stressed"" and are not ""dancing on the razor's edge"". And they outperform V8 engines with twice the displacement."
April 2019,"It's always a series of tradeoffs -- durability vs. performance, ease of assembly vs. maintainability (installing the engine from the bottom is quicker, but. . .) Durability and maintainability aren't valued much by the driving public these days, so you get what you get."
April 2019,"Well, now, everybody is smarter than the factory engineers, aren't they?"
April 2019,"Until it blows up. Those highly stressed turbo engines are dancing on the razor's edge. I see it all the time on the ATS groups, the kids buy a tune and some aftermarket go-fast parts, then ka-boom. Then they complain that the dealer won't fix their engine under warranty."
April 2019,"Except for one good ol' boy....duly noted! Used to be you needed displacement for torque, while the small, highly tweaked, multi-valve, SC or Turbo engines of modest displacement give you HP (like many race cars). So torque for quick acceleration and HP for high speed. (plus aero, of course). It used to be ""take your pick"".But that's not the case anymore. Now we see V-6 of around 200 CID putting out way over 400 ft. lbs (in some cases, over 500 ft lbs). Incredible."
April 2019,NOOOOPEEEEE
March 2019,"They do provide good value and I think that is basically Kia's mission. It's not a car you are going to keep for 10 years. It's not a Honda or Toyota in that regard, but it's pretty good for the money, you have to say."
March 2019,"Products like the '16 Optima LX Turbo are not going to win them any customers from people that have driven truly far superior (and more expensive, to be fair) cars. They are good econo-boxes at a decent value, that's about it."
March 2019,"Yes, it seems that in spite of the new and often highly competitive products, Kia dealers are still....well.....Kia dealers"
March 2019,"Funny, the dealer experience nixed it for me with the Stinger! Reminds me of the same feeling trying to deal with the local Pontiac dealer for the G8 GT!So, I went with a CX-5 Sig!!"
March 2019,"Yes. It's kind of hidden from the view, but you need to get it through ""Build - Wagons"". It's 2019, but it's the old platform. New platform will not feature wagon for the US. Bummer. No wagon, no GT. The only thing with five doors left will be 4-series GC and presumably 6-GT (at least for time being). Not in the market for now, so it doesn't matter, but when time comes I'll most likely be looking at A5/S5 SB, 430/440 GC, Stinger (if I can only stomach the ""dealer experience"") and new V60 (it looks really good). Unless I throw the towel and go compact SUV."

March 2019,"There is some value to luxury cars with quality chassis and suspension components though. Interior quality too. A lower base price isn't a bad thing for those that can do without the latest techno-gadget. I continue to think my A3 in '06 was the bargain of a lifetime, even if the GTI was similar for less."
March 2019,"Like the Range Rover? Parking assist, adaptive cruise, heads up display--either options that are part of $$$ packages or not available at all. Geez, you could get HID on wheezy old Corvettes from years ago! I hope the entry level LUX cars don't do this by chintzing out on basic level stuff."
March 2019,"I believe this is the “greater fool” theory. If someone can be fooled into believing the marketing hype and pay $80K for a (an?) SUV, they certainly can be fooled into paying some more money for options that are standard on a lot of mainstream brands."
March 2019,"I think some luxury brands offer more value than others. It's rather shocking to contemplate, for instance, that you can spend $80K on a luxury SUV and then have to pay extra for parking assist, for instance. Even at the high end of the luxury market, quite a few automakers still nibble at you, even after you've paid all that money."
March 2019,"Agree with all the previous posts on ""luxury."" There are a lot of subtle (sometimes not so subtle) enhancements that you generally get out of a luxury make - nicer materials for one, often in places like the headliner, storage compartments, etc. Switches and button are also an area that seem to receive greater attention. Then there are things that often come along with luxury makes like a smoother drivetrain. A better dealership experience is generally part of it too. My thought is the luxury makes do offer something additional for the extra cost of the vehicle, and it's up to the buyer to determine whether those things are of particular value to them."
March 2019,"I think it is rather subjective, and heavily dependent on what you just stepped out of, too. Speaking for myself, my sense of luxury is sort of a ""you know it by what you DON'T see""---does that make sense?You know, cheap hard plastics, for instance---things you touch or look at every day."
March 2019,It's all relative!
March 2019,"Fair question. Much like appearance, tech can be cheap. I’d say luxo is more “you’ll know it when you FEEL and EXPERIENCE it.”"

February 2019,"Ah, I assumed you'd want the multimedia, advanced, premium, and cold weather packs. That's over $8k in options."
February 2019,Doesn’t even need options really. About all the important stuff is standard I think. I configured one with some extras and ended up right about 40 on the nose.
February 2019,You'd have to be because you like your fancy options and would wind up with an MSRP same as mine even in T5 FWD trim. ;b
February 2019,S60 is very nice. I’m good with cheaper and less complicated T5 FWD.
February 2019,"speaking of actual ELLPS, the new S60 is getting strong reviews thus far. I like the idea of the T6 AWD with MSRP in the mid 40s. 0-60 in the low-mid 5s. Of course, the T8 is about a full second faster (or more) but also heavier and far more complex. I seriously doubt it will be worth the $10k price premium."
February 2019,"No, no it is not. No discussion needed."
February 2019,Is the new VW GLI an ELLPS?Discuss.
February 2019,"Yep. Contrary to what the good ol' boys used to say, there IS a ""replacement for displacement""!"

January 2019,ELLPS - 2013 s4 (8.5) 49k miles. All good with rig (Knock on wood). 19 3 series looks legit but bang for buck the G70 looks like it might be the king here. Price and warrantee real nice - performs like a nice gt car and the looks are spectacular. Long live the sedan.
December 2018,"That wasn't the manufacturer (Infiniti), that was the closest Infiniti dealer, on their web site. They had some decent deals on buying a new car or SUV, but terrible deals on leasing. Possibly because no one (or almost no one?) leases a car in Texas?I work with a lot of people who make good money (in some cases, great money), and some of them drive very nice cars. Probably half of them drive older or less expensive cars, and spend all of their money on other things, houses, college tuition, you know the drill. But among the ""car"" group, I only know of one who is leasing, a very nice Lexus SUV. And at the time she got that SUV, she was dating someone who worked at the dealership."
December 2018,Why are you taking what the manufacture post as the final deal? BMW does this all the time and you can ALWAYS get a better deal at the dealership than what the web page shows.
December 2018,"I’m definitely not seeing that. I just checked the web page for the closest Infiniti dealer. They have a lease special up for a 2019 Infiniti Q50 3.0t Luxe -- $299 a month for 39 months (no mention of miles), with $5,099 due at signing. $5,099 divided by 39, that’s another $131 a month, so for a sign-and-drive you’re looking at $430 per month against a retail price of $39,295. And that does not include tax, title, and license."
December 2018,There is excellent lease cash on 2018 Q50's. I see a ton of them on the roads in the NYC area. 5k to over 7k in lease cash . A nice lease buy.
December 2018,"So after some ""talks"" with my insurance company they have decided to total my 330i, total repair cost is $17K at first they weren't going to total but gave me an early XMAS present. I think I have narrow my choice to a MB E63. Have driven 2 of them, gob's of power/torque the seats are uber comfortable too, the V8 rumble is addictive!"

December 2018,"Most people would, but the G20 has taken the 3 series to a new level, the M340i will be nipping at the read end of the M3, but the downside is the G20 will not get a manuel. But right now BMW is offering 3K lease money but the MF is high. My 330i was 47K which is about average for what is on the lots right now, Getting roughly 10% off MSRP you will be looking at mid to high $400/m before tax"
December 2018,I’d rather take a blow out lease on a 2018. But I’m cheap!

December 2018,They are on the lots now.
December 2018,"and holy moley, they 3 series has really hit the skids. that used to sell a ton more."
December 2018,I assume the S60 will take a big uptick in a couple months when the new design hits the lots. There are next to no new 2018s left now.

December 2018,N20; it's my wife's new DD.
December 2018,which E84? turbo 6?
November 2018,No; but it was an amicable parting- in fact just last week the same dealer gave me a screaming deal on a CPO E84 X1 M Sport.I can still get info if you need it.
November 2018,"I heard about that company also, I have to give a shout out to the local BMW group they have been a wealth of info on the V10, also there is a service manager for one of the larger indie BMW shops has given me ideas and prices. BTW you still working at the BMW dealer?"
November 2018,"I think when you go and purchase a used M car or AMG car you need to do your homework, that I have done. Other then the items I have mentioned there are no real issue with the car, yes, keeping up on maintenance is important, but commute has been cut to 12 miles RT. I don't find myself needlessly driving around like I did when I was younger, so miles aren't going to rack up on me. But to own a sports sedan with a V10 is hard to pass up."
November 2018,"A recent issue of the British magazine BMW CAR had a story on a company that is rebuilding SMG pumps. The rebuilt units offer a significant savings.You've done you homework, so if you find an M5 or M6 that floats your boat I'd say go for it. I bought a four year old M6 back in 1992 and my only regret is that I sold it. I feel sorry for the risk-averse drones who sentence themselves to driving anodyne appliances."
November 2018,"I would imagine that you would really enjoy driving and being seen in that car. But I'm not so sure that actually owning it would be the same kind of pleasure. 10 years old, immensely complicated German machinery, ...Hard to say, but sounds like a really big gamble to me. On the other hand, it is beautiful, and very unusual, and probably a LOT of fun to drive ..."
November 2018,"There is no doubt this is the problem, but having spoken to a couple of owners of these cars and pricing out fixes those issues can be taken care, the bearing issue is a 3K job, the vanoas seals another $2500, yes, the SMG pump is a problem, but it's not the same as if the bearings going out.The price of the car, plus those two items would still come in under my 25K budget. And I'll have a car that will run with most cars."
November 2018,I think the anticipated repairs/maintenance would eclipse the price of the car in 3 - 5 years.
November 2018,it's amazing the prices for these cars.
November 2018,I saw this M6 around here for reference.https://jerseyshore.craigslist.org/ctd/d/2008-bmw-m6-40-service/6749199781.html
November 2018,"I've been looking into the E55/63 cars as well as the E39 E60 M5's. Most cars have had the major issues taken care of and each car listed has a few, the engine and transmission of the MB have been pretty much bullet proof prices are all over the place on them. I'm aware of the engine issues of the E60 M5, to fix the issue before the bearings go bad is about 3K, and the Vanoas seals would need to be replaced, that is the two issues with the V10. The E60 M5's with the fixes would run me about 25K (that includes the car.) I have at least a month before I need to purchase a car."
November 2018,"quite a change there, but whatever makes you happy. Probably won't be around long anyway.bummer about your car, but in this case, for the best. I have had a few over the years where if they spontaneously burst into flames (while not parked in my garage of course) it would have not broken my heart. Tough budget for something like an E63 though. Sure you want something that old or high miles?"
November 2018,"So I hope everyone had a wonderful thanksgiving. Have you ever wondered why things happen when they do? How many time have you gone to the store, got what you needed, return to your car and drove home! Well for me, thousands of time, but this time, some wacko took a baseball bat to my car, of course, I didn't have my cell phone with me, but lucky the store had camera's that caught it all, and there were police arresting someone for shoplifting. The derange man also got 2 other cars, I'm sure my car will be totaled. Both A Pillars, roof, both fender, hood, windshield, lights (LED), drivers and rear passenger doors, and all glass. Lucky for the video, and yes, the police tazzed the guy and handcuffed him. I'm driving the X2, but that doesn't belong to us any longer, my niece came into town for the holidays and LOVED the X2 and we did a lease swap on it, but she comes back on Friday to drive the it home. I guess things happen for a reason, I have been fighting with BMW to fix me car, when the car sits over night and when you go start it, it's lurches/jumps like its not in neutral all the way. BMW says my car is fine and is normal, in BMW speak, no codes are being thrown so we aren't worrying about it. I'm sure if I told them I lost confidence in the car things would be different, so this 330 is my last NEW BMW. So what to get, it will be used, looked at two MB E63's both one owner cars have to say, they are FAST, and the V8 rumble is addicting. So the fun starts.So criteria for the new car, used, max price $25K. More newsRick traded in his 328GT for a 2018 Honda CR-V EX-L, have no idea why he went with the Honda, the new Acura RDX is increditable we are now BMWless until my niece picks up the X2."
November 2018,I'd be happy with a Scat Pack and $30k change.
November 2018,"A 5.4 seconds 0-60 time is merely average these days; my 2007 Mazdaspeed 3 posted an identical time. And I know it is comparing apples and oranges, but if I'm buying something that big and heavy it's going to be an M5 or a Charger Hellcat."
November 2018,"I could probably manage to get by with 400 hp and 400 lb-ft of torque. It would be a struggle, but sometimes you have to compromise, and settle for less than what you really want..."
November 2018,I hope that it lives up to Munich's promises; I'm still leaning towards an M2 Competition if I were to replace my M235i.

November 2018,"Automobile magazine likes the Lincoln Continental....""And, of course, everything is trimmed in chrome, from the instrument binnacle to the knurled buttons on the steering wheel. Why? Because America, pinhead. What are you, a friggin’ socialist?But the Conti’s ace in the hole is that it is quick. Like, seriously quick—at least when equipped with the top-of-the-line engine, a twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6 that produces an even 400 hp and 400 lb-ft of torque. No, “produces” is the wrong word—it belts out its power the way Tom Jones sings “What’s New Pussycat.” Our colleagues down the hall at Motor Trend timed a similar all-wheel-drive Continental to 60 mph in 5.4 seconds—not bad considering the aging transmission has only six speeds. And while such fleetness-of-foot isn’t exactly novel in a luxury car, it’s the icing on the cake in the Continental: Just when you get totally absorbed in its old-school absurdity, you punch the accelerator and disappear....""https://www.automobilemag.com/news/2018-lincoln-continental-reserve-awd-quick-take/"
November 2018,"Just because the manufacture posts that doesn't mean that is a cement deal, I just think you want to post BS stuff. I mean, Toyota has $200/m lease dealers on Camry's but you need 3K down for that deal, and that is a horrible deal."
November 2018,"I'm not too sure why anyone would lease a 320i for $400+/M and put down (out of pocket) $2750.Our X2 MSRP was $49K, sale price was 47K (not much of a discount) there was 3K BMW credits ($1500 Loyalty and 1500 lease cash) with $525 out of pocket payments are with tax $525/m ($484+ $41) Those leader leases are that leader, and no one with their right mind would do for one of them. My 330 lease was zero out of pocket and payments of $450/m MSRP 47K but it was a service loaner. I just don't hope we aren't going to beat a dead horse on lease prices. The old day of cheap BMW leases are gone, MF is higher and the residual isnt as high as it once was."
November 2018,"My uncle had a 2002 DeVille that burned at least a quart of oil every 1,000 miles. Cadillac also told him that was normal. It was his first and last Cadillac."
November 2018,"I like that Vega. All it needed was a mild small block Chevy dropped in, with appropriate chassis beefing up, and good to go!"
November 2018,"My '71 Vega GT burned a quart every 150 miles. The joke was check the gas and fill up with oil. It always started and never left me stranded. Had to clean the #3 plug every 800 miles or so. That was in '78 and it had around 50k. The '06 Passat 2.0t that I bought in '07 burned a quart (synthetic, mind you) every 800 miles. VW said that was normal. Nonsense, and my last VW."
November 2018,I've owned a couple of cars that would be down 1 quart after 2 or 3 thousand miles. I always just changed the oil when it got down 1 quart. That was before everyone started going to the extended oil change intervals.
November 2018,"An engine could burn oil for 300K miles, as long as you keep an eye on it. I suppose if it got really excessive it might affect the catalytic, but it would have to be a real mosquito fogger to do that. I can tolerate 1 quart between changes, not a concern for me either."
November 2018,"It depends on the car; my Club Sport has averaged 2,500 miles/qt since new and it just passed 146,000 miles. It's never worried me in the slightest."
November 2018,"being at the 3/4 mark after 5,000 miles maybe. But blowing through a quart in 1-2K miles, that is wrong."
November 2018,"Yes but he just made up a new word ""Normalicy"". My two cents is that a car burning a teensy bit of oil between changes is actually a good thing---upper cylinder lube and all that."
November 2018,It says right on the disclosure that the dealer discount is $791. That's never going to translate into a good lease deal.

November 2018,"I'm not saying these are good deals. Just posting what the official offers are right now for entry-level luxury cars for comparison. I agree that 5k down makes this a strange lease.

November 2018,"I would still use it on my 1995 3er if I didn't get such a good discount on the BMW/Shell oil. I can't get a straight answer on how/why Mobil 1 0W-40 lost LL-01 approval. Some people say that the LL-01 test criteria was changed, but if that was the case I would think they would change the name of the certification to reflect that."
November 2018,"If you pay $6 or $7 thousand for a nice clean used truck, you really don't want to spend $1,500 on seat covers. Seems somehow ... disproportional. Not that you're going to find many clean used trucks in that price range any more. That used to be fairly easy to do, but not any more.My comments about the Ford truck leather seats is based on my personal experiences. I have looked at quite a few used trucks, 10 or 12 years old, reasonable miles, Ford and Chevy and GMC. Higher end Chevy and GMC trucks, the leather seats were almost always in good shape. On Fords, 9 out of 10 were shot, torn to h___. All of which is not a scientific survey, and someone else might have had exactly the opposite experience.I will add that the King Ranch Ford trucks use an entirely different leather, and I have never seen a King Ranch with the seats torn up."
November 2018,Or a cheap roll of duct tape and some pep boys seat covers to save a bundle. That’s SOP for old pickups.
November 2018,"If you found a car that was a good deal and in good shape outside of the leather seats, you can certainly get new leather put in for no more than $1,500. And it's generally nicer quality than most anything that comes standard from the factory. Now, generally, abused seats like that are simply a reflection of overall care, so it's unlikely that's the only need."
November 2018,"When I was getting my oil change at the Acura dealer my tech said, not surprisingly, that my air filter for the engine was still in good shape. How often do these typically need to be changed with ""normal"" use under ""normal"" conditions? Got curious about the history of these, and so here's Scotty K. explaining the history of engine filters—from water, to oil, to round, to square, oem, and why cheap filters are a bad idea....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WV-vNGzzP_M"
November 2018,"I think it does. Pickups typically see tougher duties and still largely carry the burden of being cosmetically uncared for. ""It's for work"" mentality."
November 2018,"I respect the BMW mandate, but for all the cars I've owned since the '90s, M-1 has been effective at keeping engine issues nonexistent. The '04 330xi I leased was serviced at BMW @ 15K mile intervals so assume they used the LL-01 oil."
October 2018,"I decided Mobil synthetic was worthy a few decades ago when our turbine engines (where I used to work) were always serviced with Mobil in accordance with MIL-L-23699. A gas turbine exercises oil to a level well in excess of what automobile engines see -- much higher temperatures, combined with the need to allow the engine to start at temperatures down to -40. So what is this LL-01 thing that Mobil can't meet?For what it's worth, when we had to demonstrate starts at -65 deg F we used an Esso oil that met MIL-L-7808. It coked up more at high temperatures but performed better at low temperatures.The way most, if not all, of the cars used by the people on these boards are used, the oil you use is going to be fine. Pretending that you use the engine to the extent that the oil choice matters is, I guess, what makes the internet what it is.That said, additives make all the difference as we grind along in the traffic jams."
October 2018,"They sell a lot of fancy products these days. Leather cleaners, leather conditioners, etc, etc. I still like saddle soap.But I don't think a lack of maintenance accounts for all of the Ford pickups out there with totally shot leather seats."
October 2018,"Not paying $4,300 for a car with seats like that and 192,000 miles on it.has to be the maintenance. I sold my 2000 TL with 175,000 miles on it 3 years ago, and other than a few patina lines, seats were in great shape."
October 2018,Exactly; the leather interior of my 146k mile 1995 Club Sport still looks brand new.
October 2018,Maintenance of leather is also a good idea. Every couple of years it should be treated iirc.
October 2018,"Some car manufacturers use a better quality leather than others. No idea about Acura. I do know that Ford uses a really poor quality leather in their Lariat pickups. Very poor. And I can attest that older Caddys used some very good leather.I still like the fake leather that VW uses, it seems to hold up really well."

When I did this research a while back, the BMW-USA website had a list of approved synthetic oils for the US market that was dated January 2008. It listed several brands, classifying all of them as oils with a “BMW long-life rating of LL-01.” The BMW LL-01 spec oil options listed were:Castrol Syntec European Formula SAE 0w-30 (rumor has it that this is the oil BMW relabels to sell as BMW Genuine Oil SAE 5w-30 Synthetic Oil)Mobil 1 SAE 0w-40Penzoil Platinum European Formula Ultra SAE 5w-30Valvoline SynPower SAE 5w-30What happened between 2008 and 2013 to make BMW stop listing several oil manufacturer options?

October 2018,"I do believe pretty much everyone agrees by now that synthetic motor oil is superior to conventional. And the price delta for a DIY oil change is $10 or less. That is comparing a 5 quart jug of Mobil-1 to a premium conventional oil. I don't know that synthetic is necessary, but for any turbocharged engine I would say yes, necessary, and in most cases, required by the manufacturer to maintain your new car warranty.Ford uses and recommends their own brand of semi-synthetic (or ""blended"") motor oil."

October 2018,Iirc they only gave me 4 oil changes and 2 tire rotations as part of the free service. And so I just did the oil change. I'm surprised they used the more expensive oil since it was on their dime. Hmmm....
October 2018,"Did you get tire rotation too?my dealer has 2 prices, with and without tires, and I think the price delta is about $20."
October 2018,"Since I was the only one in the waiting area this morning, I just turned the volume on the TV all the way down with the remote that was right there. No chance of doing that in the huge and crowded Honda dealer waiting area. They don't give you the option of adjusting the blaring TVs that I recall.The available snacks at the Acura dealer are a small thing, but they are nice—premium coffee, premium tea, bottled water, a variety of snack bars, chips, etc. I got a small bottle of water to put in my car's cup holder and a nutrigrain bar for under the armrest. Was probably a fluke that I was the only one there, but it was peaceful and I got a bit of work done. I also feel like they were more focused on me and my car. When I took my wife's CR-V a week ago for an oil change the Honda dealer didn't remember to reset the oil monitor. That's only a small thing, and I reset it at home, but it seemed like maybe a lack of attention to detail?I just checked their price list, and a regular oil change service at Huffman Acura at Oxmoor is $45—which is only five bucks more than the Honda dealer iirc. As I said, my service was ""free"", but I haven't yet figured out why the list price before they did the NC was $65. Doesn't add up if synthetic oil is only $10 more, but probably I missed some fine print somewhere. I imagine the regular oil change would be fine once my free ones are done, but I do like the idea of a little extra insurance with the extra good oil. Probably in a few years I'll be dazzled by a new model of car, but right now I'm hoping I'll enjoy driving this TLX for several years to come. Right now I feel like I'll probably try to drive a car that has paws from here on out, but we'll see...."
October 2018,"I've been to all 3 (soon 4) BMW dealers here in PHX, they are all the same, nice, comfortable, they have a self serve bar area with water, soda, in the morning they have pastries and the TV usually hsa some BMW propaganda playing."
October 2018,"The dealer I got my last few cars from has a waiting area that is similar with coffee and water but no snacks. I wish they didn't have the TV - it is always on some news channel and it drives me nuts, especially the repetition if you are there for more than 15 minutes. It is also immediately next to and open to the showroom so if they are busy it can get noisy and crowded. My dealer desperately needs a new building."
October 2018,"My BMW dealer has a decent waiting area; free wi-fi, snacks, soft drinks, coffee, and a 55"" TV. An Oil Service on the ti runs about $80, but I usually do it myself. An Oil Service on the 2er runs about $90, and I usually just grab a loaner."
October 2018,"The closest Ford dealer has a waiting area that looks very similar to what you show for Acura. With the good coffee, comfortable chairs, TV, today's newspaper, but no snacks. And the Quick Lane will get me out in under an hour, with a tire rotation thrown in, MotorCraft semi-synthetic oil, and under $50.The nearest Mopar dealer, decent chairs, TV, no newspaper, no coffee, no snacks. Vending machines with lousy coffee. Usually takes 1.5 to 2 hours for an oil change, and costs about $60 (semi-synthetic oil). No tire rotation. Which is why I let the Ford dealer do the truck, and do the Mopar minivan myself."
October 2018,"Looks like my Acura dealer. I never have an appointment but never takes too long. And they always have coupon specials. Honda dealer was busier. And for a while, I took my Acura TL there since it was closer and I had 2 Honda’s also, so they knew me!"
October 2018,The interior in that TLX A-spec is gorgeous; it makes me wish Acura offered a RWD version.
October 2018,"I don't know how busy the sole Acura service department is here, however, the Honda service departments do a booming business. I don't dare go without an appointment and I try to get one of the earliest morning appointments available otherwise a simple oil change can take hours. Pricing is competitive. It is often cheaper to go to the dealer than go to an independent shop and my experience with Honda service has been positive. The fact that the techs are Honda trained and use Honda parts is a big plus."
October 2018,"Just noticed that the bigger tires on the TLX A-spec cut the highway mpg by 1, which might well be worth it."
October 2018,"Interesting the RLX doesn't have ventilated/cooled seats. I like the red interior though I think I'd tire of it somewhat. If it was more burgundy in color it'd give a richer look, though I know the intent is sport."

October 2018,"Glanced at a few cars on the empty showroom floor too, including an RLX marked down 10k, and a TLX A-spec 4-cylinder with the red leather. The red leather looks nice but seems more appropriate for the V-6. I mean, if you're going to have racing car red having a 2.4 liter engine, no matter how nice (and it is nice) seems out of place. But I like the A-spec wheels, and I'm sure the even bigger and better tires than I've got help a little with handling, although I have no complaints there. The TLX handles like a dream even in base form. I know I'm like a broken record on this, but the precision all-wheel steering is really fun."
October 2018,I think my dealer charges the same but they are always sending out coupons that knock the cost down anywhere from $10-$20. They also wash and vacuum the car.
October 2018,"A couple of days ago the oil life monitor on my leased Acura went from 30% to 20%, and so with about 6400 miles I went into my Acura dealer this morning at 7 am sharp without an appointment. To my amazement, after the crowds at the Honda dealer service bays starting well before opening, I was the first and only one in line. When my dealer leased the car they gave 2 years of maintenance on the house, and so I got an oil change and car wash for no charge today—and they even used ""Duramax"" synthetic oil. The details of the Acura oil life monitor don't really come through in this picture, but it's an old fashioned oil can like for the tin man in the Wizard of Oz. It's actually a full color cutaway (as I say not visible in the photo) which shows golden colored oil. The normal price of $65 seems a bit steep for an oil change, check of the car, washer fluid, car wash, vacuum, etc. but for long engine life changing the oil regularly with synthetic seems like a good idea. For ten dollars less they'll do regular oil. Nicer waiting area and snacks than the Honda dealer, and I was out in less than an hour.https://duramaxoil.com/products/motor-oils/"
October 2018,"One would assume this, however, every dealer orders their cars. I have a good friend who is a saleman for the Penskie Audi dealer here in PHX and have some interesting conversations with him. Just like BMW of North Scottsdale (penskie dealership and it's right next to the Audi dealer) the Audi dealership orders A4's and keeps the prices within a price point. Which means most are equipped about the same. Like BMW they have lower priced and higher priced A4s. OF course they are equipped for the mass population not the car enthuses this i why you want see a 340i w/ M sport package with 6 spd and MPPK or a A4 Premium Plus with just the sports package. The people speak with the wallets and they want more options. But you can still order a car how you want it..."
October 2018,"There's a c. 2000 Audi A4 quattro in the animated classic Spirited Away. Saw it last night. Audi is pretty accurately portrayed, including the Audi logo. You can see it for just a couple of seconds at the start of this trailer....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByXuk9QqQkk"
October 2018,"You can order an Audi to specifications though, just have to wait 3 months for it. I'm convinced someone in Germany decides what all Audi dealers will get allocated unless an order is made. Too much similarity between dealerships."
October 2018,"Looks are subjective, but price is not. Each dealership has a ""set price range"" of certain models on the lot. Take BMW here in PHX, the average price of a 330i sedans is 47K, 340i's are about 7K more. That doesn't mean there aren't more or less expensive ones on the lot, but the average price sitting on the lots. I would assume Audi and MB are pretty close to those prices of the A4 and C300/400. Some people are in love with the new Acura's I'm not, but I do like the new RDX. I just wish Acrura would stop playing games and build a true sport model of their cars, Honda as the Technology just build it.However, as I'm entering into later side of my 50's I'm looking for more comfort then sport. But we love our X2, it's everything the X1 is not sporty. I think this SAV has prompted me to go a smoother riding transportation."
October 2018,"The problem is that interior could be a Camry's, and no one might know the difference."
October 2018,"The 2nd car I ever owned was a 59 Chevy 6 cylinder, cost me all of $75. And it had stuck piston rings, got about 50 to 75 miles per quart of oil. Anything since then has been an improvement, so I'm just not that picky about a little oil consumption. If it'll make 3k before it's down a quart, I have no complaints. Now gasoline getting into the crankcase and diluting the oil, that is a problem."

October 2018,"Here's a 2003 Accord with the 2.4 that seemingly has gone 300,000 with just regular maintenance. That's obviously not happening very often, but I think most people would say the Honda/Acura 2.4 is a good engine. Of course the Acura version today is more complicated. Imho this 2003 Accord is way over priced at $3000, because that engine is probably almost worn out.https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/751459567/overview/"

October 2018,"Yeah, the 2019 ILX is OK overall, but I think that's about it. The car has a good engine, a good transmission, good standard equipment, and good quality/reliability. And in a few months there will probably be nice discounts from the base $25,900 starting price. I think this is a way for a person who might be considering a new Corolla or Civic, etc. to move up for not that much more. Or maybe someone who is hoping for an affordable Audi A3 gets sticker shock at the c. $40k msrp and heads over to Acura instead? If you don't need something as large as a Camry or Accord, the 2019 ILX introductory lease is already about what you'd pay for the base models of those....""2019 ILX 8 Speed Dual-Clutch Featured Lease$239 Per month for 36 months.$2,999 Total due at signing""For someone wanting to avoid getting a turbo for whatever reason, this is one of the last ELL cars with a NA engine. Honda has probably come close to perfecting this 2.4 engine over about 20 years, and it's likely to last a long time. I think there are a fair number of Hondas and Acuras with earlier versions of this engine that have gone well over 250,000 miles.But the bottom line is that there's a reason the TLX has recently outsold the ILX by something like 3 to 1. The TLX imho is a special car and a real luxury sports sedan. The ILX to be blunt is more like the fanciest, fastest, and highest tech 2015 Civic ever made."
October 2018,It's an underwhelming car to say the least. The chassis and drivetrain are badly in need of an overhaul.
October 2018,Edmunds was at that same ILX reveal event and posted a less than enthusiastic review. You have to scroll down a bit to the October 28 entry and expand it to read it all. https://www.edmunds.com/acura/ilx/2019/
October 2018,"Every manufacturer of sedans (including Tesla) is going to have to fight for a shrinking market. Not a great situation for them. One way to compete is to pack more value into the car, which is apparently what the new ILX has done---but of course that increases costs and shaves off some profit."
October 2018,"Review of the ILX by TTAC. Comments are typical, ranging from ""it'll sell like crazy"" to ""nobody will buy this"". https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2018/10/2019-acura-ilx-first-drive-review-third-time-lucky/"
October 2018,"If you ignore price I actually like the looks of the A3 slightly better than the new ILX, inside and out. But although the A3 theoretically begins at about $34k, the reality for my local dealer is that they don't have any A3 cars for less than an msrp of c.$41k. But Acura actually stocks the base models of its cars, and so soon you will actually be able to find a base ILX with its msrp of $25,900 at Acura dealers across the country. And you can also get the base TLX, which has lots of stuff and even 4-wheel steering, for 33k. Speaking of the 4-wheel steering, I found a 3-minute video that briefly tries to explains how 4-wheel steering works on some Audis, Cadillacs, Porsches and Acuras:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jXnHeH9GNgHere's the Porsche explanation of it.....https://www.porsche.com/international/models/911/911-targa-4-models/911-targa-4s/chassis/rear-axle-steering/""Rear-axle steeringUpon request, available for all S models: rear-axle steering. This enhances performance as well as suitability for the every day. For an especially light-footed handling with significantly improved drive stability.Advantage in daily use: at low speeds, the system moves the back wheels against the front wheels in position. This results in a virtual shortening of the wheel position. The turning curve is reduced, the steering response in curves is significantly more dynamic and parking is easier – you will feel it.Advantage when driving in a sporty style: at greater speeds the system steers the back wheels in the same direction as the front wheels, that are in position. Driving stability increases with the virtual increase in wheel position, the agility through the simultaneous steering of front and back wheels. In summary, it affects the maximum driving performance. We would say, rather positive!"""
October 2018,I bought my first BMW in 1983- one year after I graduated from law school. I was 26 and the car was a 1973 Bavaria 3.0. I restored it over the next five years and sold it in 1990. I've kept track of it over the years and in 2015 it made it on to the cover of Vintage BMW:
October 2018,"I learned my lesson the hard way with my first Audi about how NOT to go about buying a higher risk car . I was in my early 20's, my prior car was totaled, and I wanted something higher end. Enter a B4 A4 with the V6 and 5 speed. It was fine at first but then the ABS control module went, rear wheel bearings started whining, it needed the timing belt service, various suspension bits, it goes on. Coming out of my Maxima the costs were sobering to say the least."
October 2018,"I always research the risky car's weaknesses, and then figure out what it takes to cope with them beforehand.e.g., say certain year BMWs---okay, cooling system, rear control arm bushings, vanos; or Mazda RX-8--ignition coils, engine flooding; or Boxster--IMS bearing, main seal, air/oil separator; or Infiniti G37--rear engine galley gaskets.Of course, sometimes ""the list"" is so formidable that it becomes TOO MUCH of a risky car---e.g. VW Phaeton W8."
October 2018,"My lease is up May 2020, I have time, but I figured I would start looking now to get an idea and to educate myself on the pro's and con's of ownership of these cars. You Tube has been a excellent place to research this,"
October 2018,"The 7 series has never done anything for me, also why would I go for a 740i, why not a 760iL? I still want a performance car, and the E55/63, M5 and Boxster fit the bill."
October 2018,"ILX looks like a baby tlx now. Same power train too, likely lighter so slightly quicker. Biggest drawback might be a much smaller (like 4 gallons) gas tank and same MPG!Doesn’t quite have same ride and handling though."
October 2018,"How To Buy a Risky Car:1. Always get a PPI from a specialist in that particular marque. So for a BMW 740, you go to a BMW specialist, not a ""German Car"" repair shop.2. Don't believe anything the seller tells you unless it's on paper.3. Never buy a risky car that looks like crap. 4. Line up a repair shop, and parts suppliers, before you buy the car, so you know what resources you can call on if you need them.5. Be fastidious in your maintenance."
October 2018,For $32k totally loaded it seems like pretty good bang for the buck. A FWD A3 loaded up would be about $40k—and for $40k you can get a V-6 TLX with Tech package. The ILX Premium with an msrp with destination of $29k is probably the best value in the lineup.
October 2018,"Alex on Autos on the 2019 ILX. He says 0-60 at 6.2 seconds, which is slightly faster than a 2018 Civic Si. Torque converter with 8-speed DCT means it's smoother at low speeds than the DCT found in a Mercedes CLA.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdOg_xntiaY"

October 2018,"Your 928 was a risky purchase, I have always liked them, was seriously looking at a 928GTS, but after a lot of investigating into the 928 and the high and I mean high cost of repairs (even at Indie shops) I moved away from it. I've looking to into the BMW 550i (twin turbo V8) and know that the N63 engine (early years) had some serious problems, the later years with the N63TU engine, not so much.Also looking at the MB E55 and E63, they have some issues, but not as serious as the 550i. Prices for the these are cars are reasonable, from 10K to as high as 35K. ALso looking at BMW M5s, the E39 M5, not looking at the E60 M5 (even though having a V10 would be nice) I don't want to have spend 25K on an engine rebuild. Porsche boxster is on my list, yes, IMS bearing is a problem, but the cost to take care of it after purchase is doable about $2500. OR one could get a Lexus and not worry about these cost."
October 2018,Another car I'm looking at are the MB E55 and E63's. I would love to find a a wagon version of either.Here is a link to E63.
October 2018,"In my post the work LINK is the link, just click on it."
October 2018,"High miles luxury cars should be treated as a gamble--if you can afford to gamble, then no problem. But if some unexpected repair devastates you, or forces a total loss after a short amount of time--then that decision was dumb. I've always driven risky cars and I've done just fine with them, even on the rare occasion when I had to pull the rip cord before the crash 'n burn---(like on the Porsche 928). Factoring in the miles driven and enjoyment, I really didn't ""lose"" anything on that car.The only time I bought ""practical"" was in trucks. Of course, if I were a young man with kids, I might be thinking differently--I get that."
October 2018,"Me, I shudder to think about being forced to drive a soul-killing appliance as opposed to what is currently in my garage. As I've said before, if the thought of owning a BMW out of warranty makes you want to go buy a box of Depends, then that's not the car for you.

October 2018,"No warranty on a 12 year old car of any kind is likely to make any sense, or even be possible. Iirc I think Shifty has said a few times over the years here, more or less, that if you buy an old high end car (after a mechanic takes a look at it, of course) you still probably need to figure on giving up on it if something truly major happens with the engine or transmission. But in the meantime you might get some great driving out of it—perhaps even for several years and many miles. Maybe that BMW wagon might even make it to 200k with maintenance and some minor work here and there. As you folks know, I was just posting it out of interest and for fun, not really as a serious idea. Mainly it interested me because a manual BMW wagon is such a rarity."
October 2018,"I note that you didn't actually answer my question, to wit -- would you like to sell qbrozen a 100k extended warranty on that car? I'm sure you could find someone who would sell you such a warranty, but I shudder to think of what it would cost."
October 2018,"I never changed the diff oil on the X3, but I did change the ATF every 60k."
October 2018,"That wagon has had 2 owners and now over 100k miles. It may be a nice car, but we can't guess how it has been cared for thus far. I would bet the diff and gearbox oils are original. Just something that people always seem to forget or trust the manufacturer who claims ""lifetime fluid."" Ugh."
October 2018,"First off what has happened to Edmounds, trying log in had been a joke, and other account is locked, how do I get it unlocked??All this talk about used lux cars, my next car will not be a new car, so I have been looking at used the market.

October 2018,"How do you know it's an outlier? In my opinion it was simply maintained properly. E60s aren't my cup of tea, but if I was in the market for one I wouldn't hesitate to snap that one up if it passed a PPI. Set aside a couple of thousand in reserve for maintenance/repairs and you'd likely be fine; you get a very nice car for a ridiculously inexpensive price of entry."

October 2018,"Agreed, and in that case the TLX wins hands down."
October 2018,"I am more interested in whether I would enjoy driving it for many years, than what looks like on paper to be ""more car""."
October 2018,"A few months ago @breld and @michaell and I stopped at the local Acura dealer to look at the new RDX and for @michaell to drive a TLX. When we returned from the test drive there was a certified RLX parked a couple of spots down. I can't recall the exact numbers but it was only a couple thousand more than the TLX with lower miles but it was a year or two older. IIRC it was a 2015 with less than 25k miles for something like $24,900. The TLX was probably still a better buy though."
October 2018,There's no accounting for taste.
October 2018,"They look cheap, don't they?"
October 2018,"My BIL bought a CPO RLX with 30k. He drives about 4k a month in the region he manages. About a year ago he gave it to his sons to drive at college. 310k basically trouble free miles. Original engine, trans, a/c. About 3 months ago the check engine light came on and he decided the car had done its service. Traded it for a used Sonata Sport for his sons. BIL bought a used '13 Accord V6 with 80k which now has around 130k."
October 2018,"The Acura RLX sells in very small numbers—less than 1000 a year. Acura must have lost a lot of money of that car. It probably took at least a billion dollars to develop, and they they just updated it and so it's not dead yet. But I wonder if they will just kill the RLX in another few years if the trend toward SUVs continues. I guess it's a halo vehicle to allow them to compete with Mercedes, BMW, and Audi. For just slightly more than a certified TLX V-6 you get a certified RLX."
October 2018,"you like bigger cars. will probably like this one. It is big, roomy and comfy. Basically a 5/4 scale 2005 Accord V6 with AWD."
October 2018,I don't recall ever noticing an RLX. One of these days I might have to try one on for size.

But they look nice. I also like the little extra pocket on the passenger side. Not sure how useful that would really be, but it's a nice touch. But yes, a new Civic is going to have a much lower cost to own over the years than a used luxury car. Higher gas costs, higher insurance costs, more expensive maintenance, more frequent and more expensive repairs, etc. But if you can afford it, for some people it's nicer to drive a luxury car than a Civic."

October 2018,"I take CR's ratings with a grain of salt because some of the ratings are skewed by issues that don't affect reliability at all such as those who denigrate CUE, iDrive, MyFordTouch because of their complexity, speed, UI, etc."
October 2018,"I think these ratings take in the entire model range, so an automaker could have 5 very reliable models and one turkey, and that will knock them down in the overall rating. Honda has obviously suffered a few glitches. Same thing for Tesla, which rates very low--but it's the S and X that are to blame, not the 3."
October 2018,"I had one, in blue, bought new. Not a single problem, actually very nice."
October 2018,"No, no, no. My boss's wife had one of those. Troublesome car. A Ford in a Jag suit of clothes."
October 2018,I'd probably rather have the Camry
October 2018,"For used entry-level luxury on a very small budget, what about this 2004 Jaguar X-Type 3.0 with real wood trim. Looks to be in nice shape and only has 79k miles. They are asking $5640. Probably less than the price of a 2004 Camry with these miles in this condition.https://www.bachmanvolkswagen.com/inventory/used-2004-jaguar-x-type-awd-4dr-car-sajea51c24wd83357"
October 2018,I was talking their developmental challenges. If they have problems with getting the things I mentioned right on a ICE model I would have to wonder how well they will make out with their first all-electric vehicle.
October 2018,"I believe I-Pace won't have engine or transmission noise by nature of electric motor. There may still be tires and suspension issues, but the car will be much quieter. Everybody in Europe is raving about E-Pace so far. They essentially think it's the first in line to trounce Tesla X."
October 2018,"That Auto News article seems strange when it comes to the XT4. His conclusions regarding the engine and ride are diametrically opposed to all other reports I have read. And to claim the I-Pace as a winner when the E-Pace is suffering from significant engine noise, transmission, and ride issues makes me question his judgement. Would you really be willing to jump into Jag's first all-electric vehicle given their developmental track record?"
October 2018,"Yeah, Volvo's reliability has not been best for ages now. I wonder if their new product line (after Chinese owner's much needed multibilllion dollar R&D investments) will do better. It is definitely much more attractive visually and feature wise. They are promoting this goofy (in my opinion) subscription thing, which I don't think will go anywhere, but I see it being pushed not just here."
October 2018,"http://www.autonews.com/article/20181023/BLOG06/181029897/nactoy-ford-gm-hyundai-jaguar""Richard Truett: Why these three vehicles will get my NACTOY votesOctober 23, 2018 @ 12:00 pm....One vehicle I looked forward to driving was the Cadillac XT4 crossover. Now, to my eyes, that vehicle is nicely designed inside and out. I particularly like the instrument panel and its lower row of switches, shaped a bit like the famous Cadillac V used in some classic versions the brand's crest and wreath logo.I didn't get far before I came to the conclusion that the XT4 doesn't deserve to wear a Cadillac badge.The snarling 2.0-liter engine has the demeanor of an angry chainsaw running at full throttle. The suspension system was as subtle as a child's birthday party bounce house. Bottom line: Not class competitive, not even close. With the XT4, I wonder if GM ran out of funds to properly render a vehicle befitting the Cadillac badge?....Now for some good surprises: There is no doubt in my mind that Hyundai has arrived as one of the world's elite automakers. The Genesis G70 sport sedan is a bona fide threat to BMW, Audi and Mercedes. The 3.3-liter twin-turbo V-6 is a rocket booster of an engine. The chassis is firm. The steering and brakes are dialed in perfectly.Despite the copycat German influenced interior, the G70 was the best car I have tested this year....Acura's RDX, despite having a schnoz inspired by the late comedian Jimmy Durante, is a terrific crossover — quiet, smooth, loaded with safety technology and equipped with a great sounding 2.0-liter turbo engine that is mated to a 10-speed automatic.But the Jaguar I-Pace gets my vote as the utility of the year. It may have four doors and a higher ride height than a coupe, but it drives like a pure sports car. The torque from the twin electric motors is powerful and instant. The interior is typical Jaguar -- high quality and very stylish. True, the infotainment system can be fussy, but you forget that when you are driving. The I-Pace will get my vote for Utility of the Year....""(Much more at the link.)"
October 2018,"Yeah, this is just on past models. Maybe the new ones will be better.It's just that goofy (imho) survey that CR has its members fill out based on their own cars.

That does seem to be based on something.""Volvo, which came in dead last, was far behind the rest of the pack.

October 2018,that was just their overall marque reliability ratings.
October 2018,"Are these ratings for 2018 or 2019 models? I don’t think 2019 are available yet, let alone rated by CR, which buys cars retail."
October 2018,"From the pix and reviews, I like the new Volvo S60 and V60 a lot, but it was worrying to see them dead last in the reliability survey by Consumer Reports. I take those ratings with a few grains of salt, but seems like you might need a few more than that to get a Volvo."
October 2018,"I always loved the seat in my Mazda 626. very comfy!last week I was looking at BMWs (X1 and X2). X2 had the fancier sport seats (memory linked adjustable upper bolsters too). The X1 had base seats. Salesguy referred to them as ""mini"" seats. I thought he meant smaller, until he clarified, as out of a Mini!"
October 2018,"BMW’s non sports seats are awful. Too short thigh support. Volvo’s are good. My 2003 WRX I used to own had unbelievable seats, if I were just a bit slimmer But best seat I heve ever sat was 25 years ago Peugeot 405. Great bolstering, soft around the edges, but firm and supportive in main section. Phenomenal."
October 2018,"I only like BMW sport seats, and they are a bit firm. Caddy is also firm. Volvo is still #1 in my book. My Alfa seat is quite good, but lacks enough adjustability for me. If it wasn't for that, it may be #2."
October 2018,"Volvo is right up there. The whizbang fancy multi adjustable ones in the XC90 are killer. But all the ones you listed are very comfy, and I think it tends to be individual preference which fit best. Lexus has really good seats too."
October 2018,"My very subjective ranking of the best seats that I've tried in luxury cars....1. BMW2. Mercedes Benz3. Acura, Audi, Lexus etc.I haven't been in a Volvo in more than 20 years, and back then their seats seemed good but maybe 4th. The other luxury cars I can't recall right now trying. Probably Cadillac is now somewhere up there in the top 3, but I haven't been in a Cadillac since the 1990s."
October 2018,"You want either the sport seats or the comfort seats. I prefer the sport seats, but the comfort seats have more adjustments."
October 2018,"It's more luxury than sport, but a lot of both for someone like me who has been driving Accords for the last 16 years. I had a friend in the 1990s who always got BMWs, and the seats on the 5-series he had were amazing. Iirc those seats were even slightly more comfortable and supportive than those in my 2018 Acura TLX with Milano leather. Anyway, I'm hoping that a BMW 5-series from 2015 has seats just as good as a BMW from the 1990s? And probably the handling of it would be fine for my tastes.I do like how my TLX with 4-wheel steering handles. It's really great around corners."
October 2018,"That’s a pretty blue one. Big, but I like it. CR, well, I specifically issue (like the 9 speed AT programming when it came out, or telematics issues) can drop a brand. But even mid pack is practically no issues."
October 2018,"Interesting that Honda wasn't in the top 10? I thought they usually were? Hard to believe Mini, Audi, BMW and Hyundai were in the top 10 and they were not.

Lexus has the most reliable turbo powertrain, followed by Honda and Porsche, while Hyundai and Mini have the most problematic ones, Consumer Reports said.
Hmmm. This seemingly ignores the Honda 1.5 turbo engine's woes that have been discussed at some length recently. Also not sure how Hyundai and Mini can have a troublesome turbo engine yet be ranked in the top 10 in overall reliability. Confusing."
October 2018,"That generation of 5 Series is not all that entertaining(M5 excepted); woolly steering and handling that was less than inspiring. To each his own, but light-years away from my cup of tea."

Volvo is in last place....http://www.autonews.com/article/20181024/RETAIL/181029858/consumer-reports-reliability-survey-detroit""....Meanwhile, Lexus and Toyota topped the predicted new-vehicle reliability ranking for the sixth year in a row. Mazda jumped nine spots to finish third -- making it the most improved brand this year -- while Subaru, Kia, Infiniti, Audi, BMW, Mini and Hyundai rounded out the top 10.Overall, Consumer Reports noted that when an automaker decides to make a vehicle more complicated, reliability often can dip as there are more things that can go wrong with a vehicle. Tesla, for example, made air suspension and all-wheel drive standard on the 2017 Model S, and it affected the car's reliability.The nonprofit also highlighted the trend of automakers turbocharging smaller engines to give vehicles both pep and fuel economy -- with mixed results. Lexus has the most reliable turbo powertrain, followed by Honda and Porsche, while Hyundai and Mini have the most problematic ones, Consumer Reports said.While automakers are adding more turbos, they're also increasingly pairing them with complicated transmissions that have upward of eight, nine and 10 gears, said Jake Fisher, Consumer Reports' director of auto testing.""With this added complexity, it's not surprising to see some brands struggling to get them right, particularly the ones that don't have a long history of producing turbos,"" Fisher said in a release."

I like driving the TLX a lot, whether to work or to a state park out of town for a bike ride, which is how I've gone much more than the 1000 miles a month I get with my lease. Darn. On that trip to the state park I stopped briefly at a rural cemetery and snapped a few shots, including this one of ""Tattoo Charlie""...."
October 2018,"That's good information to have. I, too, felt cramped in a C-class. Since it's usually just me in the car, rear seat space or elbow room isn't much of an issue."
October 2018,"I actually found the ATS roomier up front than the M-B C-series when I was looking. The ATS cabin seems to have more width up front and to me feels a bit airier. Rear seat is perhaps a different story, but a driver and passenger are quite comfortable up front and are not rubbing elbows. The main issue is that the ATS is fairly low, which my knees are finding a bit challenging these days for getting in and especially out. As the lyrics to ""Hot Rod Lincoln"" say, though, ""But man, what a ride!"""
October 2018,"I fit fairly well in an SRX, which has been replaced with the XT5. No idea about the XT4. I will probably try one on for size eventually. Just not right now, I'm not in the market to spend that much. Now in 2 or 3 years, an off-lease model for half-price just might be interesting."
October 2018,The XT4 does have much more rear seat room than a Q3. I think the XT4 is closer to the BMW X3 in size.
October 2018,"With 2 up front, the issue is often elbow space. Fighting over the center armrest, never ends well."
October 2018,"I don't actually mind a small car (or SUV), as long as it has enough ""driver space"". Sometimes smaller cars are much better than larger ones at providing driver space. I feel less cramped in a CR-V than in a Tahoe."
October 2018,So this XT4 is set to compete with....say...the Audi Q3 family? Hmmm....that's not going to be so easy.
October 2018,"Same. Plus, my wife would probably find it too cramped (the ATS). No roomier than my current car."

Perfect size now too, at 187” long. About what the 2018 inscription (LWB) version was I think.

October 2018,"Motor Trend's take....https://www.motortrend.com/cars/volvo/s60/2019/2019-volvo-s60-v60-first-test-review/""....Design is as much a part of Volvo's brand identity these days as safety, and the S60 and V60 have serious presence. Credit for that largely goes to the new platform those cars now ride on, providing more premium proportions and an enormous 4.9-inch increase in length. The stretched-out 2019 S60 is longer than all eight cars in our most recent Big Test comparo and boasts a back seat that feels far more livable than what you'll find in most competitors....If all-wheel drive isn't a must-have feature, take another look at the front-drive, 250-hp S60 T5 and V60 T5. Although the V60 T5's 6.9-second 0-60 time can't keep pace with many others in this class, it doesn't feel much slower than T6 models, which reach 60 about a second quicker. Sticking with the T5 also bumps fuel economy from 21/31-32 mpg city/highway to 24/36 mpg........Although we wish that tech (called BLIS in Volvos) were standard across the line and not just on the R-Design and Inscription models, it's worth noting that a $36,795 S60 Momentum base model starts thousands below the Lexus IS, Alfa Romeo Giulia, and Mercedes-Benz C-Class. And even at that price, the S60 gets a panoramic moonroof, a 9.0-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto support, LED headlights with slick daytime running lights that don't announce your car as a base model, 18-inch wheels, and safety tech...."""

And although it hasn’t completely cracked the code on full-blown prestige quite yet, it has produced some fun and interesting vehicles over the years. Take the TLX, which is available with torque-vectoring all-wheel drive (dubbed Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive, or SH-AWD), while front-drive models boast a rear-wheel-steering system (Precision All-Wheel Steer, or P-AWS). It’s also assembled from a whole lot of North American pieces, the highest domestic content by far of any sports or luxury-brand sedan.""https://www.caranddriver.com/flipbook/most-american-cars-and-trucks-you-can-buy#7"
October 2018,"I'm sure the TLX sounds better, with a good engine note as it shifts through the gears than does the Accord with its CVT. The Accord is quick enough in most situations (who doesn't like more power?) but I don't find myself enthused to drive it hard very often and find myself accelerating in our Pilot a little more aggressively than I might to experience the engine sound as the transmission shifts gears. The V6 in the Pilot is typical Honda with a nice growl when you jump on it."
October 2018,"Here's are some 2-cent thoughts about putting premium gas in the TLX 2.4. Unlike stickguy's RDX—which has huge amounts of power and a great power to weight ratio—the 2.4 in the TLX is honestly just enough. If an RDX uses regular gas and loses maybe 5-10% of its power there's still plenty left over. But the TLX base weighs 3505 pounds, compared to I think about 3200 pounds for a 2013 Accord EX. In other words, if you lose maybe 5-10% of your horsepower by going to regular it's a definite hit.The last generation Accord's 2.4 and the current TLX 2.4 are similar engines, but they aren't identical. First, with the TLX 2.4....""To maximize power output, the 2.4-liter engine has a dual-stage intake manifold has two different intake runner lengths that are selected based on the operating conditions. An actuator and a set of four butterfly valves control the intake runner switching process. At low engine speeds, the long runners are used to improve low-end torque. At higher engine speeds the system switches to the short intake runners for greater high rpm power. The result is intake tuning that is optimized for the engine's entire operating range.""http://acuranews.com/acura-automobiles/channels/tlx-press-kit/releases/2018-acura-tlx-press-kit-powertrainSecond, the TLX 2.4 has a higher compression ratio compared to the last generation Accord 2.4. The TLX has a compression ratio of 11.6, compared to something like 10 for the Accord. I think there are some other differences with the Acura 2.4 as well. It definitely sounds better and more refined than the 2.4 in the last generation of Accord.You almost certainly won't damage your Acura engine using regular (although personally I don't want to chance it with mine), but I don't think you are going to squeeze those extra 21 horses that the souped up TLX 2.4 has over the last generation of Accord 2.4. And imho you need every one of extra horses in some situations when you are accelerating a car that weighs 3500 pounds. Just my 2 cents. I like to drive a little fast and do somewhat sporty maneuvers sometimes, and the TLX works for that. The TLX is about a third of second faster to 60 than a base 320i, but that's not saying a lot. The TLX 2.4 needs all the power it has—and part of that is that the engine is optimized for premium gas. My guess is that the next generation TLX will have a 2-liter c. 290 hp turbo as standard—and so the current lower-powered, lower-priced (and higher mpg) TLX will be a thing of the past probably starting in 2020."

October 2018,"if there is a difference on RUG, you are only going to see it at high revs. I doubt for normal use you will ever notice. I go back and forth with it in our RDX, and I have never been able to tell. and some of my best MPG tanks have been on RUG.there actually is an option for a spare. Almost positive it was an actual accessory listed at one point on the TLX, though possible they changes something for 2018.

October 2018,"Yeah. I slowly warmed up somewhat to the unusual looks of the Accord, but it still seems a bit strange from every angle—front, side, and back. The Acura TLX, in contrast, is just a nice looking vehicle all around. There's also a lot of variety with the TLX. My lunar silver 4-cylinder is an almost modest looking luxury car, with hidden dual exhaust and somewhat understated details. But for people who own a TLX with the V-6 there are big exhaust finishers and other details that make the car pop. For me the more restrained look works just fine, perhaps because I'm in my 50s and a college prof?"
October 2018,plus it is better looking.
October 2018,"Yes, I did test the new Accord. Tougher call there. The new Accord is pretty impressive, but....Material quality in the TLX is a lot better than even in this generation of Accord. Here's one example that stood out for me. The dial on the steering wheel of the new Accord is clearly copied from the Acura, but it's cheap feeling, and the movement isn't particularly refined. On the Acura this control is really great in term of feel and ease of use. They look almost the same, but big difference in feel and operation. You can find differences like that in a dozen or more things just on the inside.There's more room in the back seat and in the trunk of the Accord, but in most other ways the TLX is better and nicer. Finally, with the lease incentives on the TLX, you can probably lease the Acura for less than a comparable Honda Accord."

October 2018,"The TLX has more back seat room than an ATS, but less than an Accord.As you'll recall, I traded in a 2016 Accord EX for my 2018 TLX. On the off chance it might useful here are a lot of things that are better about the TLX compared with an Accord EX, as well as a couple of things that aren't as good.1. The TLX has an amazing sound system compared to an Accord EX2. The TLX has a much quieter ride over rough pavement3. Better handling and suspension—both more sporty and more comfortable 4. Great 4-wheel steering system, which is exclusive in this class5. AcuraWatch safety systems + adaptive cruise control6. Better and more comfortable seats7. Nicer interior materials, switches, and controls8. Lights in places like under the center console, in the glovebox, etc.9. Fully finished trunk with special storage areas10. CarPlay/Android Auto11. 8-speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter and paddle shifters. Really nice transmission.12. More refined and more powerful engine13. Integrated dynamic drive mode selector—econ, normal, sport, sport+14. Stronger brakes, bigger brake pads, etc.15. full led headlights provide better and more even illumination, save power, and have longer life16. All sorts of other details not found on an Accord EX of your year, including capless fuel filler, acoustic glass, reverse tilt down side mirrors, built in compass, longer warranty, etc., etc.A couple of things that aren't as good include a somewhat smaller back seat area (although still good enough for all but adults over 6' imho), and the fact that the TLX needs premium fuel to make the extra 20 horsepower it has compared to an Accord of the last generation."
October 2018,"Can confirm, it is a wonderful car to drive. The rear seat is for kids mostly unless front seat passengers are short and adjust their thrones forward. Headroom is OK though."
October 2018,"ATS is a great car. The back seat area is tight, which would make it difficult for my elderly mom to get in and out, so kind of rules it out, unless I find one that is just too hard to let go."
October 2018,They will be supposedly announcing a new sedan soon.
October 2018,"It would be a great coup if a multibrand dealer housed them adjacent to their German or Japanese lux brand, rather than Hyundai’s. But insisting on (and financing) separating buildings of H and G is a bare minimum they have to do."
October 2018,"It might work if they were presented in different showrooms on the same property, and if sales personnel were trained differently in approaching the higher end customer."
October 2018,"Not even sure it will be a new model, but it will be a different name, following their new letters/numbers thing. So possibly CT4"
October 2018,"I just looked up Cadillac’s concept vehicles on the website. I remember in the past how quickly nice concepts went into underwhelming humdrum execution once they reached production stage, it was just pathetic. One can hope they can do better this time, as those conceots look really opulent and would give Bentley or RR run for the money. It’s almost like Cadillac needs another brand to fit those into their lineup, do they have rights for Duesenberg?"
October 2018,"As stickguy mentioned the 2019 Lexus ES is also all-new. It starts at about 41k. The ES has a lot of luxury, power, refinement, and reliability for the price. Like an Acura, it's one of those luxury cars that you can imagine owning for ten years or more. In fact, a friend of mine has one that's about a dozen years old and it still looks good and runs really well. More luxury than sport, but very nice.https://www.lexus.com/models/ES"
October 2018,"So is ATS sedan completely gone, or is it a production transition to a new model?"
October 2018,"If discount is big enough and you keep it long enough, the depreciation becomes a non-issue four-five years down the road, as your starting point is the lower transaction price, not the sticker. If it’s a good lease, then the manufacturer takes the bath, not the driver.Another good advantage of buying an outgoing model is usually they work out most of the obvious flaws and kinks by then, so reliability should be at least OK. Also, the support from independent shops should be alright, as the model is well known to the technicians. New models, on the other hand, have always risk of “teething” issues, sometimes can be quite annoying and even manufacturers can fall behind on part availability, if particular failures turn to be more widespread than anticipated."
October 2018,"Oh, that is interesting. Did they really sell enough ATS coupes to justify keeping that as the only 2019 choice? Huh"
October 2018,"They are only making the coupe version for 2019.I got confused when reading your list, forgetting that the TLX wasn't a SUV/CUV. Nomenclature always confuses me."
October 2018,"If you're not too worried about resale there's an advantage to getting an outgoing model in its last year or so. The ATS is an impressive luxury car that looks really good, and my local Cadillac dealer seemed to be almost giving away their last one. The last of the 2018 Volvo S60s and V60s also are potentially very good deals."
October 2018,"XT4 isn't a sedan, but it does look good. Looks like the ATS may have been cut already, because I can't seem to find it on the Cadillac site. But here's the XT4 that starts at 35k or so....https://www.cadillac.com/crossovers-suvs/xt4-crossover"
October 2018,"You left out the new Cadillac XT4. I saw pics of one in the wild, it looks very appealing."
October 2018,"Or, for less money than any of those new ones you could get this 2012 BMW 750Li V8 with x-drive and seemingly every option available for that year. Original msrp might have been maybe 80k or so? Not sure. But now you can have this huge and powerful luxury car for just $23k....https://www.englewoodcliffscadillac.com/VehicleDetails/used-2012-BMW-750Li_xDrive-Sedan-Englewood_Cliffs-NJ/3281914043"
October 2018,I think the Lexus ES is new now also.
October 2018,"2019 seems like a significant year for entry level luxury cars. There's an all-new Mercedes A-Class that's getting rave reviews that will probably start at about $34k, an all-new BMW 3-series due in a few months that'll start at about 41k, an all-new Volvo S60 that starts at 37k, and Acura has an improved and restyled ILX that got a big price cut and now starts at 27k.Carryover ELL cars include the Audi A3 starting at about 34k, the A4 that starts at about 40k, the Acura TLX that starts at 34, the Cadillac ATS in its last year that starts at about the same price, the best-selling Lexus IS a and ES that go for 40 something, plus entries from Lincoln, Infiniti, etc."
October 2018,"Yes, more ES than IS and GS. And RX more than double ES sales. Interestingly, in comparison, 3/4-series outsells the X3 and X1 combined."
October 2018,"Lexus ES, or IS? I think the former is outselling the latter."
October 2018,High powered FWD cars need AWD more than high powered RWD cars do.
October 2018,"I have owned WRX and STI. Those were AWD made right. One big difference is full time, with 50/50 splits, unlike many others that start with FWD and push drive only when sensors say so."
October 2018,"Pretty confident the only mainstream Audis winning comparisons and getting praise are AWD.Besides, I did say leaders. In all of 2017, BMW and Lexus each sold about 33% more cars than Audi; Benz was 50% more. Audi did beat out Acura, the other FWD-based premium car, by 50%."
October 2018,Once you get much over 500 hp I can see where AWD would be beneficial; aside from that I only want AWD in an SUV.
October 2018,"Since I'm thinking about the possibility of keeping my 2018 TLX for a while, I came across this video of a guy crazy enough to keep his 2005 TSX that he bought new for more than 500k miles. Sometime after that though he had to get major work done on his transmission....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWkbJp6MK7Q&amp;t=824s"
October 2018,"I think FWD does not preclude luxury, but is a detriment to sport. ES, or MKZ are entry lux cars, but not remorely sporty (which is OK for people who buy them). AWD is a bit of a tossup for sports, depends on the actual system. Audi and Acura seem to have it done well and those are sportier versions of their models, than their base, but others not necessarily. Many systems are about helping you in snow, not making your car go fast through corners."
October 2018,I'd pick a Giulia Ti Sport over an A4 or F30 3er.
October 2018,In this Motor Week comparison they liked the Audi A4 even better than the BMW....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEBlwNYWw8U
October 2018,Audi would like to have a word.
October 2018,"RWD does not equate to luxury. But the leaders in the luxury class do employ RWD. Yes, maybe premium is a better term, but we know what we mean."
October 2018,"after watching the video previews, no they are not. But, if I was leasing something, would be fine with a 2018 for 3 years. or, will just wait a year or so and start hunting the service loaners and leftover deals."
October 2018,2018 V60/S60 is nowhere near as nice as 2019.
October 2018,"I read the disclaimer. Looks like the only thing to consider is the owners loyalty being included, so for non-Volvo owners, make that $1,000 down. Plus tax, DMV, and dealer doc fees. So in NJ, another $1,700 or so, making that about $2,700 DAS. Or, about $475 doing a true sign and drive.I like that one too. the colors work, and fully equipped. Nice."
October 2018,"My local Volvo dealer has what seems to be an amazing deal on one of their last 2018 model V60 wagons....""2018 VOLVOV60Cross Country T5 AWDLease For$399/MO.$0 Down""https://www.volvooflouisville.com/specials/new.htmThis wagon has an msrp of $47,545https://www.volvooflouisville.com/new/Volvo/2018-Volvo-V60+Cross+Country-86ab76660a0e0a6b27ec24f774fd0fef.htm$399 a month with 0 down is difficult to imagine to me for a vehicle with that msrp."
October 2018,"now this is something I really like. Would replace both cars with something like this. Get the utility needed, plus the luxury desired."
October 2018,Alex on Autos likes the new Volvo V60 luxury wagon. A good value imho starting at $38k. Although in a non-luxury wagon the VW Sportwagen is a great value starting at c.24k.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-zfVn7an2M
October 2018,"IMHO, they are moreso than Acura since at least Genesis has RWD cars. I wouldn't say RWD equates to luxury. See: Charger, Mustang, Camaro.I think the word luxury is being misused anyway. Perhaps ""premium"" would be more appropriate."
October 2018,"IMHO, they are moreso than Acura since at least Genesis has RWD cars."
October 2018,You can get that from any dealer.. doesn't matter if it's luxury or not.
October 2018,"Here's another video review of the Stinger, out of the UK. I don't know who the reviewer is, but I like his style.https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/videos/kia-stinger-gts-takes-the-fight-to-bmw-audi/?ftag=CAD-04-10aba4f&bhid=25416315718523622077081880631938"
October 2018,"I could see myself picking up a RWD V6 Infiniti or a RWD Giulia, but those are the only sport sedans I could see luring me away from BMW."
October 2018,"And you'll get that same old ""What can I do to put ya in a car today, buddy?"" song and dance..."
October 2018,"3.5 months into driving my first luxury car part of me wonders why I waited so long. I've driven well over 5000 miles in the TLX and so far I'm really enjoying every mile even more than I expected to. Because sales of sedans are weak some of the greatest values in leasing right now are with entry-level luxury sedans. Right now you can lease a lot of luxury cars at nice rates, including the Cadillac ATS, the Acura TLX, the Volvo S60, and for a bit more even an Alfa Romeo Giulia:https://www.alfaromeousa.com/car-shopping/current-offers#2018-giulia Here's hoping @stickguy and some others join us on the ELL road lol!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOGdmIecvgw"
October 2018,they can be loaded up to that range too.
October 2018,"Here's a base Stinger for $27k, which is almost 7k off of msrp.https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/726916969/overview/"
October 2018,Loaded Stingers go for $50K+ MSRP. I thought the G70 was priced a lot lower than that?
October 2018,"Agree about Genesis not really fitting well with being sold through Hyundai.The Stinger is actually a hatchback. Although the underpinnings and engine are shared with the G70, I think the sheetmetal and interiors are different. But yes, in a sense the Stinger is the ""bargain"" G70. Looking at cars.com I saw that you can buy a brand new Stinger for c. $29k, which seems like a good deal. But then that Savage Geese reviewer complained about multiple squeaks and rattles and so it seems like they are having some quality issues. One thing I've been enjoying about my leased TLX is that it seems so far flawless in terms of quality. Honda is good, but the Acura does seem almost like a different world."
October 2018,"Yeah, Hyundai has bollocked up the Genesis brand. Initially sold at Hyundai dealers, corporate then decided that there would be separate showrooms, but only in major markets (I think a couple hundred dealers, max).Then - WAIT! - corporate then reversed course and said that it would be OK to continue selling the Genesis brand through existing Hyundai stores. The store where I picked up my Elantra GT a few years back sells Genesis. But, the store itself is a bit dated; not someplace where I would want to purchase or lease my $50,000 (or up) luxury vehicle. I'd expect a more Acura / Infiniti / Lexus like environment and experience."
October 2018,"When they start building dealerships that aren't attached, or on the same property as the Hyundai dealership, they might be able to make it work. (like Acura, Lexus, Infiniti, etc).Until then, they'll just be seen as ""nicer"" Hyundais. Whether that's deserved, or not.Is the G70 an actual Stinger with just a nameplate and minor trim/body changes? I was under the impression it would be smaller?"
October 2018,"https://jalopnik.com/the-2019-genesis-g70-starts-at-34-900-is-a-better-dea-1829180983""Genesis announced today that the G70 will start at $35,895, including the $995 destination fee, which prices it exactly the same as a base 320i. Both are rear-wheel drive sport sedans, both have premium features, both have turbo four-cylinder engines.But remember the 320i is the cheapo 3 Series, the one with a less powerful version of BMW’s ubiquitous 2.0-liter turbo four. It puts out 180 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. You can get more power from a GTI these days.For the same price, the G70 has it soundly beat: 252 HP with the eight-speed automatic or 255 HP with the six-speed manual and 260 lb-ft of torque. Go Korean over German and you’re getting a lot more power right out of the gate. You have to get the more expensive 330i at $40,000 to match the Genesis, and even the latter has slightly more power."""
October 2018,"Hyundai is planning to have a stand-alone Genesis dealer network set up over the next few years. But for now about half of Hyundai dealers are qualified to sell Genesis cars...https://carbuzz.com/news/over-half-of-hyundai-s-us-dealerships-will-stop-selling-genesis-cars""Genesis wants dealers that stick with the brand to set up dedicated showrooms, but not all dealerships are expected to make the investment. The first standalone Genesis showrooms are expected to open within a couple of years. In the next few years, Genesis will double its model line-up. Within the next three years, two SUVs, including a flagship model based on the GV80 concept and an entry-level GV70 crossover, and a sports coupe will join the G90, G80, and G70 sedans."""
October 2018,Genesis is a luxury badge now? Hmmmm.

October 2018,Does yours also involve removing the center console to get to the crank that lowers the tire from underneath? I'm thankful I have only had to change a flat once so far between our 2 T&Cs.
October 2018,"I had a flat on the Town & Country, about 2 months ago. I did put on the spare myself, although it took me longer to find everything than it did to actually change out the tire. They do hide things on that minivan, rather have to, what with no trunk. But at least it did have a spare. A can of fix-a-flat would have done me no good, as the sidewall was torn up by the time I got off the freeway.That was on a Saturday, and I went to Discount Tire on Monday and purchased 4 new tires. The old ones still had good tread (maybe 30% of original), but a set of Arizonians (Discount Tire house brand with good reviews) only cost about $500. Cheap peace of mind."
October 2018,"BMWs with conventional tires have been equipped like that for over a decade. my M235i has one, as did my i3. I'll note that Munich has started offering a jack and a spare tire on some cars for a nominal cost."
October 2018,Perfect size for me too. Could be my new aspirational car!
October 2018,I'll be hoping for good lease deals on the S60 come August 2020.

October 2018,"The 2019 S60 is up on their website now. That price of 40k is for the new one. It does look like a great car. If you can stay away from most options it seems like a really good price for that level of car. A little bit difficult for me to get that any color aside from black costs $650 more, but I guess BMW has been doing that for many years—although iirc BMW at least offers white for free as well.Given how weak sedan sales are across the board, my guess is that in just 6 months or so there will be big discounts on the new S60."
October 2018,"that is what the current ones list for. But the new one seems way nicer!that flat tire piece though, really went deep into the ""helpless female"" stereotype."
October 2018,"Although the 2019 S60 is pretty loaded to start, it turns out it is missing a few things, plus colors cost extra. And so once you add a color beyond black, heated seats, smart entry, blis, etc, it becomes a $40,000 + car. https://www.volvocars.com/us"
October 2018,"Perhaps. But having gotten dirty and sweaty changing tires in the 70s, 80s and 90s I don't want to get my clothes dirty now doing that either. I'm done with that. If the fix a flat machine doesn't do it, I'll just get towed and get a new tire. But maybe I won't get a flat. We'll see. My wife and I haven't had a flat in any of our various cars in our 2-car family for more than 10 years iirc. I don't know if that's just luck or if it's also that tires are better now?Anyway, maybe a Volvo is in your future @stickguy, although with destination it's going to be almost $37,000 for the base model, and I don't think that has BLIS—although rear visibility looks excellent for the new S60."
October 2018,nice review on the Volvo. that I will be taking a look at when it arrives.

Especially since Qualcomm isn't a real track, and is just a parking lot conversion, and a parking lot in disrepair at that. Grip is a problem for the 2WD vehicles. Anyway, the most interesting race was me vs. either a Hellcat or Demon, hard to tell them apart. I actually had an end time advantage by .001 seconds, but my reaction time was about .l5 slower so I lost. I was way ahead, and at the finish line they past me like I was standing still.

October 2018,"The 2020 Cadillac CT5 (or whatever it ends up being called) looks good to me—although I also like the looks of the current ATS. Even though I like Acuras, the ILX seems below the competition in terms of prestige and often performance (except for the 320i). But since for just a little more than a Civic you can lease a base ILX it's arguably a good deal for bargain-minded customers who want a reliable and nice performing car with some luxury that's almost $10k less than the competition (when similarly optioned).I'm in Seattle right now, and the local Audi dealer has an advertised lease on a base FWD A3 for $350 a month (plus taxes etc.) with $3250 due at signing. The A3 is a better car in some ways than an Acura ILX, but the base ILX can be leased for $200 a month (plus taxes etc.) with $2500 das. If you can pay an extra $150 a month and an extra $750 down the A3 is a better looking car imho with better performance. But if you need to save that money for something else the ILX seems like a good deal—and in the long run an Acura is likely to be more reliable than an Audi."
October 2018,Wow. Good for them. That is impressive. The ATS will be named something like CT4 in the near future. https://www.caranddriver.com/features/2020-cadillac-ct5-and-2021-ct3ct4-the-ats-and-cts-renamed-and-repositioned
October 2018,"? What fate would that be? I believe the ATS is scheduled to soldier on, although the name is going to change, I believe.I thought the ATS was being phased out over the next few years. But maybe I'm mistaken about that? My local Cadillac dealer has a grand total of 1 2018 ATS in stock."
October 2018,"? What fate would that be? I believe the ATS is scheduled to soldier on, although the name is going to change, I believe."
October 2018,"From 2013 to 2015 the ILX did have a lot of road noise, but with the 2016 refresh they added about 100 pounds of insulating material and now it's fairly quiet. Check out this KBB review of the 2017 ILX at c. 2:30 where he says the ILX now has a quiet ride....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovEp5na3Inw&amp;t=150s"
October 2018,"I like the ILX, especially the current and newly updated '19. It isn't too small, and with the Tech model, has most of the features I'd want including the ELS. My main concern from the majority of the reviews I've read is that it has a harsh ride and is noisy, primarily road noise. Not having driven one it maybe fine as a lot of the reviews are overly critical and the reviewers bang the same drum!"
October 2018,"@stickguy imho the ILX you might consider is the step above the Premium, which is the Tech. The most important addition at that level is the ELS sound system. It lists for c. $29.5k. But wait for several months, or even the end of the model year, and there are likely to be big discounts and incentives.Of course, you could also consider waiting for the new, smaller than RDX SUV. My guess is that it'll be introduced for model year 2020, perhaps with a starting msrp of about $31k for the 2-wheel drive version. Of course if you need BLIS and other goodies it'll probably be more like 34K. Still, it's probably going to be a good value for the money—and it will almost certainly have much better resale value than the ILX. The related flip side of that, of course, is that huge discounts on the ILX are sometimes possible, but no such thing is likely for this new SUV."
October 2018,Yes. I think this is almost certain to happen. There have been rumors for a couple of years about it.
October 2018,"I think the 320 is still available for the next 6 months or so, which makes it still a fair comparison for right now. In any case, the A3 is faster than the ILX, although a lot more expensive."
October 2018,"Perhaps. In any case, it seems like the ILX might eventually suffer the same fate as the Cadillac ATS."
October 2018,"don't know about the rear seat vents, but it does now come standard with power lumbar."
October 2018,"I thought I had read that the 2018 ILX would be the last, so pleasantly surprised to see it will be around a bit longer and also like the updates. I wonder if they finally added adjustable lumbar support for the driver's seat, and a/c vents for the back seat. A friend's son recently purchased a black '16 ILX base with the 2.4 and loves it. He says it really scoots."
October 2018,"Ab, that’s why I think it morphs into a CUV, to compete for the younger, entry level luxury buyers. And old people that want something smaller. Think X1, Volvo XC40, mini Infiniti, etc."
October 2018,Up until now the ILX has been a car without a market. I think it would require a sea change in buyer perceptions and attitudes to make the new one any different in that respect.
October 2018,"Well, the new design 3 series coming out did away with the 320. So the strippo model is going to be in the mid-40s. Not even comparable.Probably need to compare an ILX to a base FWD A3. Or a MB CLA FWD."
October 2018,"It might help ILX sales if Acura got together a group of real people for an online ad to compare a totally loaded ILX A-spec with the Technology Package, including red leather seats, the ELS sound system, etc., which lists for $31,550 and compare it with a base BMW 320i that lists for $34,900. The ILX is almost exactly the same size as a 320i, but gets from 0-60 in c.6.6 seconds compared to 7.1 for the 320i. Get real people to beat a 320i in a drag race to 60 with an ILX. Then compare the red leather in the ILX vs. vinyl in the 320i, as well as all the things the 320i lacks without options—no moonroof, no adaptive cruise control, no CarPlay/AA, $550 extra for any color beyond white, etc. In fact if you skip the A-spec, which is mostly an appearance package, the ILX Tech now lists for $29,550—$5k less than a stripper 320i."
October 2018,"I saw yesterday there is supposed to be an all new (I assume accord, or RDX platform, based) 2020 TLX. Would not surprise me if they consolidated the current T and I into one sedan model, with trim levels, but added a compact CUV to replace the entry level ILX"
October 2018,"With sales of the ILX last month down to 930 cars, I'd say the writing is probably on the wall. Acura saved at least a billion dollars by keeping the 2019 ILX on the 2012 Civic platform rather than making an all-new car with the 2016 Civic platform—and they've passed that savings on to the customer. But unless sales somehow explode my guess is that we're only a few years away from the end of the ILX. We'll see.One weird little factoid is that when the ILX was first introduced for model year 2013 the list price for the base model was $25,900. And now six years later the base price of the ILX is again exactly the same—$25,900. But the 2013 ILX had the comparatively underpowered 2.0 engine as well as a lackluster 5-speed automatic transmission. The 2019 ILX has the TLX's 2.4 plus the TLX's 8-speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter. Plus the 2019 ILX has a better interior than the 2013, a quieter ride, AcuraWatch, etc. When you account for inflation 25,900 in today's dollars would be about 29k. In other words, the 2019 ILX is a much better car with a huge price cut from 2013. But it's still difficult to get around the fact that it's a massively updated and improved 6-year old car—even if the price is now pretty compelling. Perhaps another upside is that it should be completely debugged. That seems to be the case with my 2018 TLX too."
October 2018,"Acura has room for both. I am surprised they have not come out yet with a CUV below the RDX in size. Could be a serious hit. that market is hot right now, and should work well with the Acura customer base (and younger people outgrowing (financially) the Honda brand, but wanting something smaller."
October 2018,"No chance. Wagons are dead. Maybe sedans will be dead next? I wonder if in another couple of years even the ILX will be gone, replaced by an entry-level SUV about the size of the HRV."
October 2018,I like wagons. I liked the Acura TSX wagon they used to make. Any chance they'll make a TLX wagon?
October 2018,"I just had a former Ford service advisor come to work for me in another industry. The subject of warranties came up, and he mentioned how Ford Focus RS owner's would come to him after obviously ""abusing"" their launch control button. IT was funny because his attitude wasn't like mine, which is ""why put a button or feature if the car can't handle it?"" His attitude was more like, the launch control is just for marketing, and you really shouldn't be using it if you wanted warranty covered.I simply mentioned how Audi didn't really care, at least at the dealers I'd been too, and he admitted he's heard Ford is more ""stuck up"" than others, and heard/noticed that Honda will cover just about anything. He's a young guy so I'm sure he was just taking orders and instruction/training from more Senior Ford officials. This confirms the stories you've heard about Ford voiding any reasonable honor of warranty."
October 2018,"By the end of December I bet they will already be dealing on the 2019 ILXs. The ILX premium with the restyle and the $3.5k price cut is a good msrp. If you can get a good lease incentive of c.3k or so on top of that it should be a nice price/payment overall. The trick is the resale on your Elantra Sport. As you know, once I said I couldn't afford the TLX and it was clear I was willing to walk away, the trade-in offer on my 2016 Accord suddenly increased by quite a bit. I think you might get more from an Acura dealer for the Elantra Sport than from Carvana, esp. if you go in at the end of the sales period (end of Dec.?). They mentioned to me a few times that mine was one of the sales that put them over the top for their sales goal which helped them get a bit of a bonus from corporate."
October 2018,"I would have to drive them back to back. I do find the ILX to be a better size for normal driving, though the extra room is nice when travelling, and the wife prefers a bigger car. So a TLX would be OK. no bigger than the Sonata I had was. but I am not giving up goodies to get the bigger model. so would be comparing an ILX premium vs. a TLX tech."
October 2018,"Currently there seems to be a $5000+ lease incentive on the last of the 2018 ILXs. But if you wait just a few months you can probably get almost as good a deal on one of the 2019s. Sedans just aren't selling, as you know, and so it's a buyer's market. I bet your local Acura dealer would give you top dollar for your Elantra Sport if you're willing to walk away. But imho the TLX is really the better car. I'd take a base TLX with the 4-wheel steering, slightly more room, etc., etc. over a loaded ILX. If you are considering the ILX, the new style will almost certainly have better resale value."
October 2018,"probably going to be some good deals on the handful of leftover 2018s soon. Though at least near me, not all that many to pick from and mostly base models."
October 2018,"My guess is that they are hoping to cut the lease incentive. But that means the monthly payments will probably be about the same as with the 2018s—c. $200 a month+ taxes and so on with c.$2500 das. In other words, only c.$30 a month and c.$500 more das than a lease on a Civic LX. But that's the best case scenario for the base model. The ILX Premium would obviously be a bit more...."
October 2018,that is a pretty steep price cut. Wonder if they will eventually have big lease incentives on them!
October 2018,"AcuraWatch is now standard on the base 2019 ILX, instead of being a $1300 option. On top of that they've cut the base price by $2300. And so really it's a price cut of about $3500, which shows how much Acura hopes to get some sales. The ILX is now seemingly a good deal for the money, esp compared to say an Audi A3, which comparably equipped costs almost $10k more. The base msrp of the ILX is now $25,900. Unfortunately Acura didn't put CarPlay/AndroidAuto into the base model. But for $27,650 you can get the ILX Premium which adds CarPlay/AA, leather seats, upgraded stereo, power passenger seat, BLIS, built-in garage door opener, etc.http://hondanews.com/acura-automobiles/releases/2019-acura-ilx-arrives-with-dynamic-new-styling-major-technology-upgrades-and-new-a-spec-treatmentSince the ILX weighs almost 500 pounds less than the TLX, but has almost the same engine and transmission, it is faster. I guess it's kind of a luxury Civic Si with an 8-speed dual clutch transmission....Nothing that I see in the press release says anything about enhanced driving dynamics, so that's probably very close to the way it was before."
October 2018,Like that new ILX. Some may critcize it as overstyled but I tend to like a little over styled.
October 2018,"was not actually expecting one, but looks like Acura spent some money on updating the ILX. will be interested in seeing it in person. already had the TLX drivetrain, now seems to have the interior. Hopefully they did some updates to the driving dynamics too.https://www.acura.com/future-vehicles/acura-ilx/?SP_RID=MjEyOTg4Mzk2NTM4S0&SP_MID=22319340&PROGRAMID=RHYNWSLT&CAMPAIGNCODE=AT9366&OFFERCODE=AT9366&CELLCODE=G1&PID=100286379&LINKNAME=www_acura_com_future_vehicles_acura_2&spMailingID=22319340&spUserID=MjEyOTg4Mzk2NTM4S0&spJobID=1323231396&spReportId=MTMyMzIzMTM5NgS2"
October 2018,"Most of the time, when I have checked, the Acura lease offers were not particularly good. I think you were right place, right time!I could see the redesign base model being priced like the current tech car, but with some of those features standard."
October 2018,"Yeah, given falling sales for almost all entry-level cars, Acura might not have much room to raise prices. Here's my guess....the msrp for the base model 2020 TLX might only go up by c.$2k or so, but at the same time (as with the Accord) they will really cut back on lease incentives. In other words, my guess is that the ""real"" price increase might be more like $5k—almost the same price increase as for the BMW 330i—although like today a TLX will still undercut a comparable 330i by thousands of collars. My lease deal was almost too good, in that I could lease a TLX 2.4 Tech for less than an Accord EXL 2.4. I think that will almost certainly not be possible for the 2020 TLX."
October 2018,"But, will be nice if they keep the pricing like the 4, but it has performance of the V6 which I assume is going away."
October 2018,"But falling sales for ELL cars probably helps to make for the possibility of good deals....Perhaps I'm the only one to regret it, but it looks like starting next year that lower-powered ELLs won't really be available. Currently the 320i has a 0-60 time, according to BMW, of 7.1 seconds. The Acura TLX 2.4 I have has been timed at 6.9 seconds, which is fast enough for me (and about half a second faster than my 2016 Accord CVT). But for the new generation of 3-series coming up it looks like they've not only eliminated the manual transmission but also taken out the less powerful version. So the lowest level of 2019 330i will have a 0-60 time of less than 6 seconds—but it will also cost c.$6k more than the current bottom-of-the-line 320i. Rumors are that the all-new 2020 Acura TLX will also have an standard 2-liter turbo engine with similar power and acceleration.That's probably what almost all ELL buyers want in terms of power and acceleration, but once the least expensive 3-series starts at c.$42k msrp before options it might be out of reach for some who might otherwise buy it. And I'm enjoying that on highway drives without ac I can get as much as 40 mpg with my 2018 TLX with the naturally aspirated 2.4 with the 8-speed transmission. I don't think a 2020 TLX with the 2.0 turbo will be able to get more than maybe 35 on the same drive, but obviously I don't know for sure. I assume that as with the 330i there will be a big price jump for the 2020 TLX. I could afford the current TLX, but the next one might be too rich for my blood....Finally, if you really are trying to keep a car past 10 years and 100k miles, then perhaps a naturally aspirated engine might be more reliable in the long run?"

This is making me think that if I take care of it, drive carefully, and have some luck, that keeping my 2018 TLX past 100k might be possible. I already have over 5000 miles on it, even though I've only leased it for a little over 3 months. (My wife's 2018 CR-V already has about 6k miles on it.) Anyway, here's the video about his ILX. His 25 year old Legend has made it past 500k with its original engine and transmission.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67pKJVUWCpI&amp;t=3s"
September 2018,"Yeah, the Tech package for the TLX is expensive (c.$3700 iirc), but it does add some nice stuff—blind spot monitors, cross traffic alert, ELS sound system, Milano leather seats (which even smell nice imho), rain-sensing wipers, built-in navi (which I have used a few times), and AcuraLink concierge (which I've not yet used at all). Plus, as you say, the 2018s and later get CarPlay/AndroidAuto as well as Acurawatch. But for about the price of a new base Elantra, I'd say that I'd take the TLX for 15.9k any day. Still has that nice engine and transmission combo, 4-wheel steering, etc., etc."
September 2018,nice color combo on the TLX. But I really don't like these without the tech package. At least the 2018s base have a lot more stuff on them.

September 2018,"I like the 2 screen set up, for just the reason you said. More real estate, and dedicated map when needed."
September 2018,"The KBB reviewer makes some good points about the infotainment system on the TLX. As he says, it's not intuitive at first, but over time it becomes pretty good. And I'm now used to it and can use it pretty easily. My wife's new CR-V has just the touchscreen, and in some ways I prefer that, but believe it or not in other ways I prefer the TLX's 2-screen system. Let me try to briefly explain. So with the one touchscreen like with the CR-V—and many new vehicles these days—you are either in one display mode or another for the screen. In other words, if you've called up the stereo controls on the screen, then the map you might be using from AndroidAuto or CarPlay goes away. Same with the climate controls on the CR-V. With the system on the TLX, however, you can have two things going on at the same time. And so your navi screen at the top (which is a good place for it, right below the line of sight outward) can be doing its thing directing you to where you need to go, while the lower screen on the TLX is displaying your stereo and climate controls. Plus the touch screens, to state the obvious, are magnets for dust and fingerprints, and since you don't touch the upper screen on the TLX it stays pristine. Finally, the TLX's touch screen is more responsive than the one on the CR-V. Sometimes you need to press an electronic ""button"" on the CR-V's screen twice to activate it, while one gentle touch on the TLX's screen almost always works the first time.In terms of handling, even my wife has said she really likes the way the TLX drives. She likes the 4-wheel steering (although it took her a couple of months to actually feel it), the handling, and the smooth power."
September 2018,"Yeah, I was and am a bit concerned with getting two new cars at once. But so far we haven't regretted it. The CR-V is also an awesome vehicle. We love it for what it can do in terms of large cargo space while still carrying passengers. We use that a lot, actually. And the CR-V is also fun to drive. Anyway, we put an extra 4k down on our the 15k loan we have for the CR-V, and so now the amount owed on it is down to 11k. If we can make another 4k extra in Dec., which might be possible, and then yet another 4k extra early next summer, that along with our monthly payments might get us free and clear on the CR-V by July or so. Then we'll just have the reasonable $229 a month lease on the TLX."
September 2018,"They usually go up as the year goes along. Christmas ind Presidents’ Day are good options.I try and stagger the cars, so always at least one newer. Also helps to only have one loan at a time, max."
September 2018,"I'm not sure if I'd have the patience and discipline to really keep a car for ten years—maybe eight?—but if I did this TLX would be the car for that. So far I really like the TLX on all levels—driving dynamics, comfort, awesome sound system, looks. It's by far the best car I've ever had. And given that it's an Acura I can see potentially driving it past the standard 70,000 mile engine and transmission warranty.Not surprisingly it seems like the incentives on the 2019s are less than what was available over the summer for the 2018s. Maybe even by Thanksgiving the lease incentives might be higher again?"
September 2018,Thanks. I'll give it a try at some point to merge my accounts.
September 2018,"If I do manage to upgrade to a TLX it would have to be with a 10 year horizon.That was the deal the wife made to get the RDX. that just had its 6th anniversary last week, and sitting at about 48,000 miles. Though getting used more now. Wife just started a new job Monday, with a 27 mile RT commute. Going to wear the poor thing out. Another reason for me to upgrade. Get something she can share for commuting duty."
September 2018,"A new and mostly positive review by Kelly Blue Book of the TLX.

September 2018,I sent you a message
September 2018,Still on the list. Just have not been looking actively right now.
September 2018,"I am the poster formerly known as benjaminh and now as benjaminhf. Just wanted to say I'm still alive, but my 17 year history with Edmunds has seemingly been erased. Also I've been very busy with work. But I wanted to briefly say that I'm still really enjoying the driving experience with my leased 2018 Acura TLX 2.4 Tech. Great car for the money imho. All best wishes out there to the chronic car buyers, etc. @stickguy: are you still considering a TLX?"
September 2018,"Yeah, I went once to an AutoNation Lexus store. It had nice decor and everything, but the experience wasn’t the same as my local BMW dealer. It was polite, but you could still feel primary focus on sale and closing, not the product exposition and its potential fit into your life, which I felt at BMW, Audi, or even Volvo stores, every time I visited those. Something you expect at a good Toyota dealership. The difference is subtle, but perceptable. It’s mostly in the types of conversations you have with the salesman, or the manager, if he/she introduces themselves. After the visit I even received generic template follow up emails from two different managers, even though I made it clear to the sales guy the product was not interesting to me (I was looking at CT200h and it was a total dog, real disappointment). To their credit, when I responded to them saying don’t call/write and explained why, they left me alone."
September 2018,"Thanks, but I am more than aware of the distinction. The dealer group that owns the future Genesis store(and the current Hyundai store) has less than a stellar reputation. I suspect that their Genesis sales ""experience"" would still require me to take a long hot shower afterwards. Not worth my time."
September 2018,"Are you talking about Genesis Dealers or Hyundia dealers? If you go out to the Genesis web site, I think you will see a completely different type of experience. Just like Infiniti, Lexus and Acura changed the way people looked at Asian cars, Genesis dealers aren't Hyundia dealers. Granted there are no Genesis only dealerships yet, but when Rich and I went and looked at a Genesis G80, the treatment was miles a head of what you get at the Kia or Hyundia salespeople. No pressure they weren't looking to be your best friend. Just have to wait for the G70 to show up at the dealers."
September 2018,"Again, the local dealer are hopeless at best(What can I do to put ya in a car today, pal?)- and with the well know Hyundai proclivity to void warranties at the drop of a hat I could see problems with using it as my instructor car."
September 2018,Why not a Genesis G70 with a manual?
September 2018,"Yes, the completely noncomparable M2 would beat the Stinger on track, as would a corvette or sportbike, BTW."
September 2018,"The lease rate is the factor that stops me cold from taking the leap. Since I don't track my cars, it would do fine for my needs but I would assume an M2 would surpass the Stinger on the track compared to the Giulia."
September 2018,"If they keep it around in next four-five years, I think I will make myself to put on a hazmat suit and visit our friendly Kia dealer (oh, boy are they horrible here, or what) to check it out. It's got a lot of good stuff, but seems like they are still behind on a few things, such as relationship between power and gas mileage (e.g. BMW 340/440 has similar performance, but much better gas mileage as a daily driver), but with appropriate price difference, those objections and shortcomings are not insurmountable. Biggest thing will be the ""first contact"" with a sales person. Hope it won't start from ""are you buying it today?"", ""what can I do to make you take it home?"", or ""let me wash your BMW - oh, I can't find the keys"", ""How about I show you the deal - square one, two, three, four""."
September 2018,"The Stinger is too big for my tastes, and the transmission overheat issue would also nix it if I wanted to use it as a dual purpose car. For strictly street use I still prefer the Giulia Ti Sport, even though it's a bit on the slow side.I still think my next car will be either an M2 or an M2C."

August 2018,"So what is up with Edmunds these days? logging is a pain..On a side note, took a little trip to San Diego, my 330i averaged 35 MPG with an average speed of 85. At 85 my car is at 2000RPMs I'm still amazed on how the MPG of this car."
August 2018,@benjaminh Alltrack pictures:
August 2018,"Plus it’s not a lightweight, and us pushing an AWD system."
August 2018,Yeah. I think the CVT combined with a little bit of turbo lag results in a so-so performance for acceleration when you first start out.
August 2018,"Bingo, there's the problem, and I haven't even test driven the 1.5T yet."
August 2018,"CRV is now a CVT, yes."
August 2018,"Floor it in a Audi with DSG on sport mode, and see if you still think turbo lag is a problem. My guess is that the delay is more due to programming and transmission ineptitude than on the turbo lag. Does the CVT make an appearance in the CRV?"
August 2018,"Yes, the AndroidAuto navigation is linked to that little top display. There's actually a dial on the right of the steering wheel that lets you scroll through your various choices for that display, including tire pressure, oil life, compass/navi, performance mode, etc. When on compass/navi and you've asked it to go somewhere it also displays an arrow to show the direction of your next turn along with a mileage marker for how long that will be. All of that is also displayed in much bigger form on the center screen with the map, but it's a nice little addition to keep you on track to your destination.PS Now that I've driven both the TLX and my wife's CR-V a lot, I've decided I like non-turbo engines slightly better. The 1.5T on the CR-V does have maybe a third of a second delay in acceleration when you floor it—but in certain situations that can seem like a substantial delay. And so turbo lag has been reduced with these new engines, but not completely eliminated.PPS My guess is that the next generation TLX, due in maybe a year or so, will go turbo and take out the 4-wheel steering. I'd rather have a naturally aspirated engine and the 4WS. Right now I am hoping to finance the residual on the TLX when the lease is up, if we can afford it at that time. It's a really nice car that I'd like to keep long-term."
August 2018,"I like the location and look of the compass and assume that the nav is linked to that display as the street name is shown. Does it show speed limit, too? The large, clear easy to read gauges are a big plus."
August 2018,Was watching the Mecum auction at Harrisburg the other night and they had a DeSoto Firedom go through the line with that same record player. Outstanding looking vehicle!!The Sandman
August 2018,Another little feature I like on the TLX is the built-in compass....
August 2018,"I believe my XF has a 10gb hard drive, it allows me to upload 10 CDs. So 10 on the HD, one in the player = the Spinal Tap nirvana of 11."

August 2018,Funny...I just had this image of feeding vinyl records into the dashboard.
August 2018,"May I suggest you check out a copy of the book ""The Revenge of Analog"" from your local library?Goes into detail about the revival of things like vinyl, books, board games, notebooks and the like. Great read."
August 2018,The hard drives in late model BMWs have a 20GB storage capacity- it is convenient.
August 2018,"Back in the late 80's or early 90's (don't remember what year) I donated two high end turntables and slightly over 400 vinyl record albums, and never looked back. I spent years protecting and cleaning and fussing over records like each one was the hope diamond. No more, never again, thank you very much. And then when I got divorced in 1999, I donated some uncounted number of CDs. All ripped and stored on the computer, no need for optical disks anymore. In those days, if I was going on a trip, I would burn custom CDs, a ""road mix"" if you will, just for that trip. These days, it's all on flash drives with a playlist. Some things do get better.And I will extend that to cars. Yes, cars really are a lot better. Faster, cleaner, MUCH longer lasting. If I don't enjoy them as much (although I still do enjoy, just not as much), then I attribute that to being a grouchy old man. You kids get off my lawn!"
August 2018,"That's cool as I still play CDs in the Accord and Pilot from time to time. I still listen to vinyl about once a month at home. Some cassettes, rarely, thou no 8 tracks."
August 2018,"Good questions. Tried to look it up at the Acura web site but the info doesn't seem to be there. Perhaps its in the owner's manual....In any case the ELS sound system is better than my home stereo. I'm hearing details on albums I haven't heard before. I've been thinning out my CD collection over the last ten years, but thank goodness I still saved c. 150 favorites! I'm planning to start downloading them to the car each week as I drive."
August 2018,"What's the storage capacity in GB? If uncompressed WAV files, about 700 MB per album."
August 2018,"One of the features I like on my TLX's stereo is that it has built-in memory/storage for CDs. The new Accord and many other cars have taken out the CD player entirely, but the TLX with ELS sound has a player that downloads every CD into its memory in about 5 minutes and then stores it in an album folder. In the first pic you'll see that it's at 29% for downloading the 1958 classic album from Nat King Cole called St. Louis Blues...."
August 2018,A pic from today....
August 2018,"I have always enjoyed history and am sure I would enjoy your class. When I went to The Univ of TN, Knoxville, I took several French culture classes that were a mix of history and reading books written by French authors. One class was taught by a professor who had participated in the French resistance during WWII. The stories and insight that she shared, wow. I am delighted you enjoy what you do, too many don't.To stay on topic: I see more and more TLXs on the road. For first generation it is hard to tell the 2.4 from the V6, with the rim style/tire size being the real give away. Goodyear tires on the 2.4, Bridgestone tires on the V6."
August 2018,"I teach art history—and I really enjoy it! I think the standard audio in the TLX is similar to the top-of-the-line system in the Accord EXL/Touring. So it's a very good system that's quite a bit better than what you and I hear/heard in our EXs. The ELS takes it to the next level, but the starting system is already equal to the best that Honda offers—and maybe it's even a little bit better? In terms of the leatherette, I would have been happy with that too. In fact, imho it's less worry because leatherette will last longer than probably almost anything else on the car, while leather after 8 years or so might be reaching the danger zone even if cared for.The seating position in the TLX is just slightly lower than in my 2016 Accord.But like you I did find the seating position of the 2018 Accord maybe a little too low.I do enjoy the Tech features, but if they had had a TLX base on the lot I might have gotten that one if it saved me money over the Tech. It happened that it was the very last TLX 2.4 they had."
August 2018,"What classes do you teach? I wonder if the standard audio in the TLX is better than the current Accord EXL+ models. I do wish the standard TLX came with leather instead of faux leather. The higher seating position in the TLX, similar to my Accord is a plus. I don't like the lower seating stance of the new Accord."
August 2018,"With destination the starting price for an Acura TLX is $33,995. That's a lot of money, but for that price the TLX comes with a moonroof, power heated seats, AcuraWatch, etc., etc. An Audi A4, BMW 320i, or Lexus ES350 with about the same level of equipment all have msrps of about $41k, making the 34k for the TLX seem pretty good. But some people put the A4, 320i, and ES350 in a higher category than the TLX.For the entry-level model TLX probably some are cross-shopping the Accord EXL 1.5, which has an msrp with destination of about $31k. So one way to look at it would be what does the TLX base have that makes it worth $3000 more than an Accord EXL. Here's my very subjective valuation of what the added features and qualities of the TLX are worth to me personally over an Accord EXL....The exclusive 4-wheel steering of the TLX would be worth to me as an option at least $1200. The 4WS really helps make the steering better, from parallel parking, to medium speed cornering, to higher speed lane changes. Great system imho.The 8-speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter is worth at least $800 to me compared to the Accord's CVT.The better suspension of the TLX compared to the Accord is worth at least $500 to me. The quieter ride of the TLX is also worth about $500 to me. The TLX's better and bigger brakes with their ""Premium Bosch 6-piston brake modulator"" another 500. Plus the ten spoke wheels look better to me on the TLX than the strange designs found on the Accord.The longer Acura warranty—4 year bumper to bumper, and 6 year/70,000 mile engine and transmission is also worth maybe 500 to me. And the fact that they threw in 2 years of maintenance in a much nicer waiting area reinforces that.The nicer interior parts all throughout the inside the TLX, and the more interesting and better-looking to me sheetmetal outside is worth at least another 1000, and maybe twice that. Very subjectively to me then the TLX does seem to be ""worth"" c. 5000+ more than a comparable Accord, making the added cost of 3k seem like a good deal. And with the lease incentives Acura offers it doesn't seem like you even pay that....?"
August 2018,"""Danger Will Robinson!"" What happens when you like driving your new car too much? In just five weeks of ownership I've put c.3300 miles on it on my newly leased TLX Tech. I love the handling, the stereo, the engine, the transmission, the seats, etc. And so I've been going on lots of fun trips to see old friends, driven to sites in town I haven't seen, and I've also been driving to cities I've never before visited. Since I'm a prof. (which perhaps explains a few things) once the school year starts in a couple of weeks I won't be driving so much since I'll be working all the time. So that should slow down the miles, and then I'll also probably start driving my wife's new CR-V sometimes when going back and forth to Lexington. But yikes...."
August 2018,Jaguar XE sales are down considerably from 2017
August 2018,"Probably a Jaguar is in a different category higher than ""entry-level luxury."" I just copied and pasted that list that someone compiled. I notice it's also missing the Cadillac ATS, I guess because the ATS is a little smaller?"
August 2018,Jag XE didn't even make the list; that can't be good...
August 2018,"Declining sales last month for most ELL cars means bargains can be found....ES 4,551 -31.5% Cclass 3,841 -21.6%A4 3,433 +17% 3series 3,185 -22% Q50 2,397 -7.7%IS 2,068 -15.3%TLX 2,046 -18% MKZ 1,580 -34.1%Giulia 858 -22% S60 799 -11.6%"
August 2018,"The entry-level TLX with an msrp of $33k might also be something to consider. For 3k more than an Accord EXL it offers some significant things above an Accord in terms of the steering, transmission, brakes, interior design and quality, etc. Although I've gotten somewhat used to the style of the new 2018 Accord, I still think the TLX looks better from every angle. The A4 is also a very nice design, and the Audi is maybe the best-looking entry-level luxury car right now imho. The TLX is close, but I do think that the Acura calipers on the front grill are maybe a bit too large, like it's trying a little too hard? I'm getting used to it, but I think the styling details on the Audi are very nice. I guess the real bargain for leasing when it comes to entry-level luxury cars is the ILX, which is basically the fanciest and most powerful 2015 Civic ever. Still, with a lease price of c. $200 a month it's a good deal for the money. It's close to the same price as leasing a Civic.Your 2013 Accord EX might be worth c. $11-12k at trade-in, which obviously means that you have a big downpayment. Would you lean toward leasing or buying? For entry-level luxury cars the lease deals seem better than the purchase deals."
August 2018,"Well, it sounds like the author had consumed quite a bit of the Honda Kool-Aid, so I would take the article with a grain of salt. It certainly looks better than the Accord or Camry, and I suspect the handling and braking criticisms may be due to the selection of hard low rolling-resistance tires by VW. One thing I fail to undertand is how VW can take a 2L engine, turbocharge it, and end up with 174HP when other makes routinely get around 80-100HP more by doing that."
August 2018,"The 2018 Passat got a mixed review from Motor Trend recently. They didn't much like the engine, the braking, the handling, etc. The Passat has a roomy back seat, and can be had at a bargain price, but....https://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/passat/2018/2018-volkswagen-passat-first-test-review/"
August 2018,"I have an old friend that just testified to the following:He took his '86 Accord to 337,000 miles, at which point it ran well, but got rear-ended and totaled. He currently has a '04 Accord at 184K miles, His plan is to save up for the following 5 years, and then buy his race/sports car.This came up because he lives very close to where my old S4 is for sale right now."
August 2018,"I haven't ruled out the Passat. I find it attractive and from what I understand they drive well but not as crisply as the '06 Passat 2.0T that I used to own. As much as I like VWs, have owned many, none have been as trouble free as the Hondas we've owned."
August 2018,"If you need a big back seat in a sedan, you really need to look at the Passat."
July 2018,"Your daughter getting an Acura TL from a relative seems like it might be a good thing when it comes to getting a future car for you—because instead of giving your 2013 Accord EX to your daughter you can use your substantial trade-in value to get a new car for yourself. Mr.Shiftright has suggested on another thread that Audis after 80k miles tend not to be reliable, which might make an Acura or Honda better for long-term ownership. If you need a bigger back seat the Accord is going to be a better choice than the TLX, but in most other ways I think the TLX is better than an Accord. At some point you might consider test driving both."
July 2018,"I will buy another sedan at some point. Thinking a current version of the Accord EXL/Touring, TLX tech, Audi A4, used CPO. I am interested to know how the 1.5 engine performs. A friend just bought an '18 CR-V EXL AWD and says it doesn't feel as peppy as their '15 CR-V AWD which they still have. She also says the '18 feels bigger than the '15. My SIL is going to replace her '06 TL soon and says she will give it to us for my daughter to drive. It is still in excellent condition and she is the original owner. As nice as that might be, that puts a kink in my plan to give the Accord to my daughter and for me to get something 'new' for me. My wife is doing a happy dance, no new purchases! ugh"
July 2018,That says a lot that you've driven it that much. The V6 may be a bit faster but I prefer the 4 cyl.
July 2018,"I already have over 2500 miles on it—and I've only owned it a month. For initial purchase price and mpg I think the 2.4 is a winner. And kept in Sport mode it's fast enough for me, but no doubt the V-6 is much faster."
July 2018,How many miles do you have on the TLX now? After going on a couple of test rides with @michaell I'm a fan of the 4 cylinder TLX.
July 2018,"The CR-V is a very nice vehicle—but not really my cup of tea. It really is my wife's car. But you're right that I'm going to need to start driving it to reduce the added miles on the TLX. The CR-V feels rather big and tall compared to the TLX, or really almost anything else I've ever driven except my 1969 VW Bus from so long ago. Are you thinking of a CR-V? A CR-V really has good bang for the buck, with impressive passenger and cargo room."
July 2018,"Great mpg, and wonderful that you like the TLX so much. Enjoy the pics, too. Need to drive the CR-V some, give observations about it, and keep your mileage down on the TLX. But your wife might thump you on the head for taking her ride, lol."
July 2018,"Highway mpg continues to surprise on the upside with the TLX 2.4. Some manual calculations seem to indicate that it usually inflates the mpg by about .3 mpg or so. And so 39.5 would really probably be closer to 39.2. Both of these trips were c.90% highway with speeds ranging from c. 55-75 with the ac on. Somewhat hilly ride at times. Was making a tour of the historic downtown of Corydon, Indiana, where there is a little shop that specializes in old signs."
July 2018,"I've always been a high-risk buyer, not in terms of buying cars that are broken, but in terms of buying cars with a dubious reputation---often those are the most fun (for me). I think the Saab would actually be newer. The Mini is a 2003 and most of it is original, except for all the parts that literally fell off it. Actually what the Mini really needs is sticky tires and RWD."
July 2018,"On those winding roads I was driving to a park that's popular with cyclists, and by chance I ended up parking my Acura TLX near a c. 2010 TL. This park is a private-public partnership and the infrastructure is excellent. Different grade levels and separate bridges for bikes and cars, rest areas for hikers and bikers, etc. One of the true treasures of the Louisville area. The bike ride up the big hill was tiring but good for this 53 year old. The bike ride down was grin-inspiring.https://www.theparklands.org/the-vision.html"
July 2018,"Yes, the super-handling awd is only available with the V-6. MSRP is significantly higher on those models, and the lease incentives weren't quite as high."
July 2018,"So I think you answered my question, the SH-AWD is only available with the V6. The incentives were not as good on the V6's I take it?"
July 2018,"A 4-cylinder is really enough power for me. I didn't test drive the V-6 because I knew that wasn't in the cards—and not really suited for my budget and driving style. This particular 2018 TLX Tech 2.4 4WS had more than $6k of lease incentives. I did have a trade-in, but my monthly lease payment including taxes and everything else is $229 for a car that has an msrp of $37,600. That's the right level for our budget, esp. since my wife's payment on her 3-year car loan is $450—and we have a daughter starting college in a year.But the 4-wheel steering on the TLX is enjoyable. I worry now that I won't want a car without this feature in the future. But given that Acuras with good maintenance and some luck tend to last a long time, this is a car that may—knock on wood—be with me for a while."
July 2018,So your c. 10 year old Mini is worn out—and you're thinking of trading it in for a c. 20 year old Saab? You seem to be searching for exquisite automotive pain on multiple levels. Maybe a new base Mini with a manual might be something to consider? A car with new suspension parts and a warranty? Just a thought. I'm just a tad concerned that you're not able to enjoy driving as much as you should. But I realize it's none of my beeswax. Apologies....
July 2018,"i think you'd enjoy four-wheel DRIVING even more than steering. Did you consider or test drive the TLX with SH-AWD? I know you probably wouldn't like the fuel economy penalty, but a test drive wouldn't hurt to give consideration for the fun factor. Although, I'd imagine the 4-banger might be overtapped with AWD."

July 2018,Even nicer in a RWD performance car where you can use the throttle on/off to help yourself around the corners.
July 2018,"I live 4 miles from Downtown Cincinnati, and I can be on a road like that within 10 minutes."
July 2018,I used to live out in the country and drive roads like that all the time. Now I live in the inner city and drive highly congested pothole infested ...
July 2018,I'm hoping to take a couple of test drives over the weekend - 2015 TLX V6 w/ Tech. One FWD and the other AWD. Both priced around $25K.I've driven a 4-cyl base model already (also a 2015) and enjoyed it quite a bit.
July 2018,Love that! I was just up in the mountains on a similar road with the Mini--and I realized how old the suspension has gotten after many miles. This car is really tired--it just couldn't hold the line when pushed. It was like driving a skateboard.
July 2018,Here are the kind of roads I get to enjoy driving on with my new TLX. Eat your hearts out city slickers. During the five minutes I was out of my car the road was completely empty in both directions.The four-wheel steering is nice on roads like this.
July 2018,"I don't really understand the question, but I'm the last one to place some kind strict categories with a checklist. People buy whatever they want and if they want to cross shop Escalade with Mazda Miata, it's weird, but it's their privilege. All I just meant to say my dad's A4 TDI is loud (it's still in the family, my nephey has it) at highway speeds and you definitely know it's a downsized tractor engine with slightly better vibration dampening and noise insulation good enough for you hear the radio at somewhat loud setting. Europeans liked those TDIs and Benz's old (slow, noisy and clunky) diesels long years before they bought into the ""diesel will save the planet and we just have it in our showroom"" lie, luxury or not."
July 2018,"There's a good aftermarket tune for those old TDI's. I experienced one in a loaner bug at my preferred shop. Of course, it might be spewing 80X the current standard emissions now. So do entry level vintage luxury performance cars from the pre-smog era get excluded too?"
July 2018,"Yes, buy why?When they released the new 2015 models, they were snapped up in minutes, once the fix was done.But, now that I think about it, that was the ""newer"" 2.0 engine.. Maybe, they don't have a fix for the older models?"
July 2018,"I may not be, but it's nice. I just drove a rental TDI in Scotland for a week and I didn't feel much deprived vs. my 430 GC. The vehicle was a relative base (cloth seats, no Nav), but the overall level of equipment, fit and finish was quite good. Despite being FWD, it was nicely responsive, but I have to admit, the ""spritited"" handling was last thing on my mind there, as I was more focused on not hitting anything and constantly fighting my cross-wired senses (left is right, right is left). Nevertheless, it would have been quite good substitute if you didn't want to shell out as much money. Of course I didn't like that diesel's characteristics as much as my gas engine, but it wasn't a tractor, as say my late dad's 2005 A4 TDI."
July 2018,"In addition to the pollution, the Passat's not an entry-level luxury car."

July 2018,"I get 30 mpg on my commute quite consistenly, as long as I keep light on the pedal and the traffic is average. My best highway was nearly 40, going downhill from Atlanta to Tampa, but it drops quickly on any disturbance, or uphill. It’s more like 35 on a typical trip. My M235i averages 26-27 mpg in suburban driving and a tick over 31 mpg on the highway if I keep it under 80. Considering the performance I'm more than happy with the fuel economy."
July 2018,My 320i would average 38 on the highway... The 4 cyl and ZF is a great match for Performance and MPG BTW my MPG was in Comfort mode
July 2018,"That's better than I can do in the relatively light weight 7-speed Optima with the 1.6T engine. 28.4 would be an improvement. I'm gonna peg my lifetime average at 27 mpg.

July 2018,"In the last 7 months my 330i has averaged 28.4, lets not forget that the last 3 months I've had the AC running all the time, the best highway was on a trip to Austin TX, 37 MPG, I really don't think this is bad for a car that can run mid-to low 5 0-60."
July 2018,"I would say for sure a DCT is more efficient than a lowly CVT, but a DCT with a torque converter sounds less efficient, but it seems Acura found a good middle ground. There's a reason many people won't consider a car with a CVT, even if Honda does it better than just about anyone."

July 2018,"My new gas station mpg calculation for the 2018 TLX 2.4 was as follows: 345 miles/10.18 gallons=33.9 mpg. My car's trip computer says 34.1 mpg for those same miles, which is obviously very close. This was for about 70% highway miles. This is is beginning to seem like slightly higher mpg than for my 2016 Accord with the CVT—a car that weighs c.200 lbs less. Puzzled by this. Could it be the 8-speed dual clutch transmission? Is a DCT sometimes more efficient than a CVT?My 2016 Accord CVT was rated 36 on the highway—and that's about what I got. Sometimes I got a 1-2 mpg more, sometimes 1-2 mpg less, and sometimes right on.The 2018 Acura TLX 8-DCT is rated 33 on the highway—and yet I seem to be getting 36-39 mpg on the highway. I regularly seem to be getting 3-5 mpg higher than the EPA rating, which has never happened for me before in decades of checking my mpg on my cars. And this is in the hot summer with the AC on. During the Fall months, when I won't be using the AC much, seems like I'll probably do even better?Overall, I like my new TLX a lot. Really a lot. In almost every way it's better than my 2016 Accord—which itself was the best car I'd ever owned up until I got the TLX. Cars, unlike some things in life, really can get better than in the old days.The suspension is one of the things that impresses me about the TLX. It's controlled and yet comfortable, seemingly getting a nearly perfect mix of sporty and luxurious, but with a slight emphasis on the former. And the ELS stereo is excellent. I'm ashamed to say that I think of reasons just to drive my car so that I can listen to the stereo and enjoy the ride...."
July 2018,"A 12.9 quarter mile is currently acceptable for me- until I finally install the M Performance locking differential- at that point I will probably bump the power up a bit, for more fun at HPDEs, the local drag strip, and the occasional stop light grand prix... I'm still leaning towards an M2 Competition or CPO M4 for my next car."
July 2018,Figure roughly $30/mo for every $1000 of trade equity.
July 2018,"It's complicated because of my trade-in, but if somehow that could be taken out I'd be at less than 1% of msrp for my monthly payment."
July 2018,"My problem with the T&C is traction. One front tire powered by a 3.6 pulling 4800 lbs behind it results in nothing but wheelspin if you try to get going too quick.As for fast cars, I agree it is mostly pointless. If I, however, can get back to track days, that would be a different story. I am doubtful that would ever happen again though."
July 2018,"I am forced to agree. A 12 second quarter mile is an impressive thing, but I doubt I will ever again do that. Or at least it would be a very rare occurrence. But I do like acceleration. When I'm coming up the freeway on ramp, spot a hole in the traffic, punch it, and the car lunges forward, I mean really jumps -- yeah, I like that. Yes, I will pay extra for that.But the difference in 1/4 mile times between the Kia and the Alfa -- not going to matter in my world. Both of them will jump just fine, more than enough for me.A few years back, when I was seriously considering a used Genesis, I did several test drives. Both 6 cylinder models and V8's. The guy who wrote the review for Edmunds said you didn't need the V8, it would only be for bragging rights. A conclusion which I vehemently disagreed with. I alternate two daily drivers, a Town and Country and an F150 with an Ecoboost. The Town and County is fast enough, it will get out of it's own way. But you have to punch it, wait for the downshift, wait for the engine to spool up, and THEN it will move pretty good. The Ecoboost, lightly touch the throttle and you are moving!"
July 2018,YUP...
July 2018,"given the road quality and congestion around here, and the level of police interest, it quickly becomes all about bragging rights. Not anything you can actually use (or in any realistic way need)."
July 2018,"You know the 1/4 miles times and trap speed means nothing today. Most cars are going to be fast, fast enough to get you in trouble. My 330i will run the 1/4 in 13 sec's and about 100. 0-60 times in the high 5's (stock) drop a stage 1 onto (like I did) 0-60 in the mid 5 to low 5, and 1/4 times and speed goes up. We have a neighbor who has his new M5 w/comp package on order and all he talks about is how fast it goes. Some of us are betting that an accident will happen shortly after he gets it."
July 2018,"Ben in the BMW world, it was not unheard of getting a new BMW lease for 1% of MSRP, that was a good indicator that you got a good deal. When I was looking to replace my 320i, I was offered V6 TLXs for under 1%, reason, they weren't selling... Would you share your deal you got on your TLX?"
July 2018,"also 1.1 secs, not a tenth.I still say the Kia could be a good value. I don't seem to see a great deal of agreement on that, though."
July 2018,I haven't read anyone issues like it mine with the ZF either on Bimmerfest or Bimmerpost. The ZF is a pretty build proof unit. The X2 will replace Ricks 328GT. He really liked the one I had as a loaner. As a replacement for the 330i the new Genesis G70 has caught my eye... https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2019-genesis-g70-first-drive-review?src=nl&mag=cdb&list=nl_dvr_news&date=071618
July 2018,"After the car sits for 12 hours And on start up the car lurches forward like it's not completely in natural. It doesn't make any noises like gears grinding, it has gotten worse in the 15 months I've had the car. Part of me says, screw it, I have less than 2 yrs left on the lease, the other half says, BMW knows there is a problem but they don't want to fix it. My 330i was a service loaner, and yes, I got it less than 1% of MSRP."
July 2018,"Alfa: 11.8 seconds at 122 mph through the quarter-mileKia: a ludicrous 12.9-second quarter-mile at 111 mphOK, it was 11 MPH not 1. Oops. But, on a cost per eyeball peel basis, Kia is still a hell of a value!and look at that for a minute, and think about the automotive world we live in. A freaking Kia, that most people could afford (I think a $41K sticker for that model), can pull off a quarter mile in the 12s at over 110 MPH! the difference, at least to me, is probably meaningless since there is no way I would ever come close to using all the acceleration the Kia has."
July 2018,"Not sure what 1/4 mile times you are looking at, but they are far from close. Of course, the Alfa costs a helluva lot more."
July 2018,Somehow I hadn't heard of this before—but I'm glad I seemingly got it on the TLX.
July 2018,"So what happens at startup?If you do have any interest in another BMW, lease a service loaner. Typically below the 1% threshold."
July 2018,"sorry to hear about your tranny issue. Seems though that is a really rare occurence on a BMW, with the ZF? I thought those were pretty bulletproof. But, can always get a lemon anything. The X2, will that replace the 330, or your other car (a 4 series?)interesting readying on those tests. The Kia (RWD) is withing a 10th and 1 MPH of the Alfa in the quarter. Impressive. Less impressive is both cars having serious failure issues so early, and not surviving the test regimen. I wonder if they just went too far hopping up these sedans? Or some sheep in wolves clothing going on (fine for around town, and normal spirited driving, but just not really able to cope with wringing out all the performance)."
July 2018,"I have enjoyed listening to people takes on the Accord v TLX.. Interesting reading. The itch to purchase another car has hit us, and we scratched. We wanted to do another Euro Delivery but the dealer was hot to make a deal, we got a new 2018 BMW X2 FWD, M sport, all Bells, and toys. My 330i had been in the shop for 2 weeks (transmission problems) and was given an X2 as a loaner. The days of 1% of MSRP as your lease price is long gone at BMW, but we are happy with what we got. I do have to say the X2 is a lot of fun to drive. My 330i still has transmission issues, BMW has done all the diagnostic testing and all data had been sent to Germany as well as ZF, and the word is, nothing is wrong, however, there is. I've been waiting for the field service rep to make an appearance at the dealer so we can talk. The dealer has 1 more week and then I get a lawyer involved. I've been having problems going on 6 months. The car is driveable, the issue is only startup. I have the SA as well as the Service Manager on tape saying there is something wrong with my car. I think it's the torque converter. Car and Driver have started 2 new long test/reviews this month.A Stinger GT https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2018-kia-stinger-long-term-road-test-introduction-review?src=nl&mag=cdb&list=nl_dvr_news&date=071818A Alfa Giulia Quadrifoglio https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2018-alfa-romeo-giulia-quadrifoglio-long-term-road-test-introduction-review?src=nl&mag=cdb&list=nl_dvr_news&date=071818"
July 2018,"I think I forgot to mention, why the hell is Acura putting GREEN X tires on a SH-AWD model (referring to KBB's review of a test model with those tires!?)? That's an inappropriate tire for an A-spec model.Changing out the tire to something like a Michelin Pilot Super Sport 4S would probably make the car twice as fun in the canyons, literally. I'm not exaggerating. I'm sure the tires were the source of criticism in that review. You never get a 2nd chance to make a first impression."
July 2018,"@benjaminh Yes, you get a full 36K for your own use."
July 2018,"My TLX already had almost 300 miles when I bought it. It had actually been traded with a dealer in TN at some point (I could tell from the window sticker). 300 miles is obviously small potatoes when compared with 36,000, but with a lease do they give you that credit so your actually mileage limit is 36,300 at the end of three years?Anyway, while I get ready for yet another c. 160 mile round trip from Louisville to Lexington with the new TLX, here are a few more random pix. The first is the light that my son discovered that's under the center armrest. Somewhat useful when digging around in there. One of the other pix is of the new for 2018 LED turn signal lights on the TLX."
July 2018,or buy it out at the end!
July 2018,"Alex on Autos, on the other hand, thinks the TLX A-Spec awd is close in performance to an uplevel BMW or MB—and for a lot less.The version I got, the TLX 2.4, is close to being competitive with a base model 320i or A4.In any case, my latest hand calculated mpg numbers for my TLX 2.4 are: 401 miles/11.8 gallons= 33.98 mpg. This time my gas station calculation was almost the same as the car's trip computer, which said I'd gotten 34.1 mpg over the same 401 miles. This was for about 80% highway.I've already put c.1300 miles on the car. At the rate I'm going I might need to need to start driving my wife's CR-V to stay within my lease mileage."
July 2018,"I think that KBB review is ""fair."" The TLX just isn't a real sports sedan. If you bought one thinking you'll go canyon carving with your BMW and Audi friends, you may be disappointed. If you got one thinking you got the better Accord, chances are you'll be happy. The funny thing is there are a lot of cars that can keep up on the Angeles Crest Highway (ACH). You don't have to spend $200K on a Porsche to keep up. A lot of people in LA do put a few mods on their cars though. Canyon carving, like any task, requires having the right tool for the job. That being said, most of the cars carving canyons on the weekend are not getting anywhere near the fuel economy of the TLX @benjaminh is getting."
July 2018,"I have a good friend who owns a late model Cadillac SRX, I disremember the year (2016? 2017? Whatever.)The seats in that thing feel to me like they forgot to put in any padding. Vaguely reminiscent of a wooden church pew."
July 2018,"It is an absolute gas to drive. Much faster than any car I've ever owned so I need to watch myself. The handling is something else too, as it has far more capability in that department than I am used to using. The seats are OK. The lumbar support is adjustable (via an inflatable bladder) and the side bolsters also can move in and out. Truthfully I don't notice much difference regardless. There is also an adjustable thigh support (the front part of the cushion is separate and can move in and out) but again I notice little difference. Maybe a smaller person would appreciate these things more than I do. I am probably not the best judge of seats. To me the most comfortable seats of any car I ever had were in my '09 Lacrosse, which were the standard 8-way power adjustable leather thrones. They were cushy and soft with very pliable leather so you sunk into them and with the adjustment set correctly they were just about perfect. I remember being disappointed when I traded it on the 2011 Regal and had lived with it for a while at how hard those seats were and how stiff the leather seemed in comparison."
July 2018,Alex on Autos likes the performance of the A-Spec TLX....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZfhE1BA7tQ
July 2018,"@ab348 : I think your ATS is a really sharp looking car. Are those seats as comfortable as they look? I assume it's a lot of fun to drive, esp. with that super powerful engine?"
July 2018,"Before I had it, I thought ""rain sensing wipers"" fell in the realms of unneeded and even silly features. But yesterday driving my son c. 80 miles in traffic with variable rain conditions the darn thing worked pretty well. Not worrying about how fast to put the windshield wipers on made it slightly easier to carry on a conversation and worry about the other aspects of driving. Obviously not an essential feature, but it can actually be useful imho."
July 2018,"They've improved the sensors quite a bit on the Fxx and Gxx cars. I'd prefer to have a dipstick as a backup, but on the newer cars I'm comfortable with the sensor."
July 2018,"Oh, you can manually check. You manually push some sequence of buttons and a level appears in the cluster that ""estimates"" how much oil you have. At least, that was the case in my 2008, so I'm assuming that is still the case."
July 2018,That’s correct.
July 2018,Wait—you mean you can't manually check your oil level with new BMWs??
July 2018,"Haven't you heard? Almost no one looks under the hood in the daylight these days, let alone at night. That's part of how BMW got away with eliminating the dipstick lo these many years ago."
July 2018,"To take my mind off other events, I got some pics of the ATS engine and trunk compartment today.Mostly what you see under the hood is the engine cover, not much else.The trunk is nicely finished although not huge. The battery is in the compartment on the left side."
July 2018,The TLX is certainly dressed up under hood.  You got my curiosity about the radiator fans.  The Accord has two as well. They look very similar overall.
July 2018,"TLX pix—engine compartment edition. @sda : You might be interested to compare your Accord's engine compartment to the TLX. Right away I noticed the battery looked to be almost twice the size of the one in my Accord. Two fans, no prop rod for hood, etc. But it misses a feature that my 1988 Oldsmobile 98 had—an under hood light lol!"
July 2018,"Brought the folding bike in my TLX to another nice park today. The twisty rural roads are fun even when following the speed limit (which I pretty much did). The auto-dimming mirror in this car has a rather thin frame. The Acura Link button lets you call a concierge for restaurant recommendations and reservations, theater/concert tix, etc, and I'm subscribed to it for free for a certain number of months—I forget how many. I think I need to take a trip and use it. The other button is similar to an Onstar emergency button, I guess. My Honda Accord didn't have either of these buttons. Below a few pix of the strangely idyllic bike paths around Louisville. Being from California, I still marvel at the lack of crowds in some places here even after 20 years...."
July 2018,"On some BMWs you can get into a service menu that lets you adjust the OBC mpg calculation. Funny thing, every BMW I've owned with an OBC has tended to be 5% optimistic. Ditto for the Mini. However, the 2 Series OBC is usually 8% pessimistic. Go figure..."
July 2018,"I can tell you that my TSX mpg computer averages about 5% high over 142K miles, quite consistently. Every other readout that I can check (speed, miles, temp, etc.) are dead on. It never reads low, just varying degrees of high. The marketing guys won this one -- a tiny percentage of people hand-calculate MPG."
July 2018,"With still more than half a tank of gas in my new TLX curiosity got the better of me on the mpg front, and I decided to fill it up so that I could do a manual calculation to check against the car's trip calculator. I drove 225 miles with 6.4 gallons, which gives an average of 35.15 mpg for c. 85% highway driving—which is quite good. The only problem is that my trip computer said that I got 36.2 mpg for those 225 miles. Hmmm. I thought the trip computer's mpg numbers, which were seemingly slightly better than my Accord's, were maybe a little too good to be true. But the real number is still better than I expected, esp. given that the EPA highway rating on the TLX 2.4 is 33. My son the engineer/computer coder said that my method of manually checking the mpg could have a margin of error as well. Who is to say that the shut of works exactly the same each time, or that you have the filler in the same amount? I guess he has a point? In any case, I'll try to remember to test it again manually on the next tank and see what I get.Bottom line is that I'm still happy with the mpg of the TLX 2.4. On the highway seems just as good as an Accord 2.4."
July 2018,"@ab348 : Your seats in your ATS look really comfortable. ++ And if you get the chance, I would be interested to see what your engine compartment looks like."
July 2018,"My mpg on my big commute to get my son—Louisville to Lexington and back—was one of my excuses for getting the new TLX. I thought I'd take a significant mpg hit for moving from an Accord to an Acura, but if the mpg meter on the new TLX is accurate the mpg is very similar. I got c.36 mpg on the way over and c.38 mpg on the way back. This is a c.80 mile drive with AC on going c.70-75 mph. I know I'm getting premium gas instead of regular, but I'm still impressed that mpg is the same as a CVT car that weighs c.200 lbs less...."
July 2018,"Mine is a RWD ""Premium Performance"" with the 3.6. The 0-60 time is supposedly mid-5s. All I know is that it is really quick, especially in the midrange. Haven't bothered with gas mileage calculations yet. I haven't done a lot of highway driving with it so the computer numbers it displays would likely be pretty dismal (I haven't looked at it recently). It is just a super-fun car to drive. I wish the interior had a little less black and a little more Kona Brown, but I'm glad it isn't all black."
July 2018,I love the red...it goes so good with the interior colors.
July 2018,"If its the 3.6, it should be way better than 6.5. I think it may be the 2.0T, unless I'm getting my ATS owners mixed up.EDIT: just looked it up and both versions are mid 5s, with the v6 just a couple of tenths quicker"
July 2018,"Hope some other ""entry level luxury-sport"" owners will share their pix too.++"
July 2018,"@ab348 : Nice car! Hate to admit it, but your interior seems slightly fancier than my new TLX Tech. Thanks for sharing. What kind of mpg are you getting? You have the performance 3.6? No doubt you would totally smoke me 0-60. I think my 0-60 with my 4-cylinder TLX is c. 7.5, while yours is maybe c.6.5?"
July 2018,I love the interior... looks like you are missing a pedal.
July 2018,Sure thing. Most of these were taken shortly after delivery.I just realized I don't have engine compartment or trunk pics. I'll have to get on that.
July 2018,"Today I went with my TLX and my folding bike to a park on the outskirts of town called—believe it or not—Pope Lick Park. About a 20 minute drive each way, 60-70 mph on the highway, and then some two lane roads. Got about 35 mpg on the little trip with ac on the whole way, which seemed pretty good. We have good parks here in Louisville, and some have very nice bike paths. In fact, I think the ""Louisville Loop"" in its various places is one of the better urban/rural bike paths in the country. Anyway, here's one of my uses of my entry-level luxury sedan for today—and in the last pic you can see my ugly mug to see the face of the guy who has been bothering you off and on for almost 20 years here. By the way, the volume dial on the steering wheel of the TLX has been copied for the 2018 Accord. But having driven both, I can say that although they look almost the same the Accord's is a cheap feeling piece of hard plastic, while the TLX's is a rubberized dial that feels and works better."
July 2018,@ab348 : Any chance you'd post some pics of your ATS? I like the looks of those but I've never been in one....
July 2018,"He certainly seems To be quite picky. And if you want a 200k Porsche, buy one!"
July 2018,Interesting link from KBB that popped up in my online reading this AM. Long-term evaluation notes about their TLX:https://www.kbb.com/car-news/all-the-latest/2018-acura-tlx-a-spec-long-term-review/2100005090/?psid=cstw1&utm_source=t.co&utm_medium=referral
July 2018,"I'll just live on the wild side when it comes to spare tires (or lack) and see what happens. No doubt I'll let you know and cry uncle if somehow disaster strikes. But my guess is that the odds of a flat are low on the roads I drive. My second guess is that if I get one the fix-a-flat might work to get me to the gas station. My third guess is that even if a AAA tow truck has to take me to the gas station I'll be ok with it, since I've done that before a few times and it's not a big deal imho. Other things being equal I'd take a spare, but given how much I like almost everything else about the TLX I doubt I'll miss it much. Again, we'll see. I might end up eating my words...."
July 2018,I would prefer not to either. The AAA guy can do that. Just have to have the tire on hand to put on!
July 2018,"Yeah, stuff like this is why I'm never going to bother with changing a tire ever again."
July 2018,"My worst tire changing experience was on my 2000 F250 diesel, the one I used to pull the 5th wheel travel trailer. I was cruising down Interstate 10 and the right rear tire just let go. This was well out in the country, on the approach to the Brazos River bridge, actually. The break down lane was small, and the dropoff was pretty steep. That F250 was very big, and very heavy, and it came with a tiny bottle jack. I wasn’t really sure it was going to lift the truck, but it did. Precarious is a word that comes to mind for that huge truck perched in the air on that tiny bottle jack.I got the lug nuts off, but the aluminum wheel had welded itself to the hub. I looked around, found a big chunk of concrete, and used that to try and break the wheel loose. I’m laying under the truck, whacking the back side of the wheel with the concrete chunk, and an 18 wheel tractor trailer comes whizzing by at 80 mph. Sliding by my parked, jacked up truck by about 18 inches, maybe less. So naturally the truck sways back and forth on that tiny bottle jack and I’m thinking, “What a way to die. Crushed under a damned truck trying to fix a flat tire.”There was another occasion. Not dangerous, but embarrassing. I was pulling the 5th wheel and had a blow out. If you’ve ever owned a travel trailer, then you will already know that they tend to eat tires. I looked around for a good place to get off the road, and spotted some kind of business with a big empty parking lot and pulled in. I’m jacking up the travel trailer (I always carried a really good jack with that thing), and my wife comes around and says, “You realize this is a funeral home, right?”I look around, and she’s right, it’s a funeral home. I tell her it doesn’t matter, no one is there. Except … They obviously had a service of some kind scheduled, and the parking lot starts filling up. I swear it didn’t take me more than 10 minutes to swap out that tire, but in that 10 minutes the parking lot went from empty to full. And every single person who came in was looking at me like I was transgressing against their dead relative.Some days …"
July 2018,"oh, we would not be buying one now. Just deciding if we want to put it on the wish list and plan around it. I would be quite happy with a much more affordable TLX too.Either car would have to be a tech package. That part is non-negotiable. But I don't need the advance package."
July 2018,No spare in the i3 or 2er; the ti has a spare that has never been used in the 23 years I've owned the car.
July 2018,"That new 2019 RDX really is a knock out. But you'll pay a lot at this point for one, unless you're getting the base model. One big advantage of the TLX, as I know I've already said in some detail, is that you can potentially lease one for significantly less than a comparable Accord."
July 2018,"I am planning to stop at the Acura dealer Saturday afternoon, for their ""summer event"". Free lunch and a test drive, what's not to love? Will give the wife a chance to scope and (and hopefully drive) an RDX, and will also spend some time in a TLX too (won't need to drive that one)."
July 2018,"Yes, the TLX is quieter than our 2013 and 2016 Accords. This is esp. noticeable over slightly rougher pavement where we got a fair amount of tire/road noise in the Accords. This is muted with the TLX. Starting in 2018 Honda has started using some of the noise reduction engineering adapted from the TLX for the Accord. My guess is that there will probably still be a difference with the TLX even compared to the new generation of Accord, but not as much. And tonight, I'll confess, I took another pleasure cruise in the TLX—although first I had to go to the gas station to get my first fill-up of premium. And yes, they told me at the Acura dealer that using regular won't hurt your engine, but honestly why would you sacrifice c. 20 horsepower with a car that's designed to use every horse it has. My feeling is that if you aren't going to put premium in a premium car when it's recommended that maybe you should get something else? Anyway, the lower mpg of 22 was my c. 3 miles of stop and go traffic to the Costco gas station for my premium fill up.And don't get excited about that upper mpg of 40. I think it's valid (although I need to check with this tank how accurate the mpg meter is), but this was a highway run of about 20 miles with light traffic going an almost steady c. 60-62 mph, although with the AC on fairly high and the car in Sport mode. This was on a series of 55 mph freeways around Louisville. So it's seemingly good mpg, but the reality is I'm usually going more like c.72 mph on 70 mph freeways back and forth between Louisville and Lexington. But if it's accurate, 40 mpg is about as high as I would have gotten in my Accord for this run.@sda : You might check out a TLX, esp. if you can find one of the last of the 2018s. For a last generation Accord owner imho the TLX Tech a big upgrade, really a wow. I'm still getting lots of smiles from the four wheel steering. And the ELS stereo is really great for listening to SiriusXM and CDs."
July 2018,"My wife's car doesn't have a spare.. or, the one before this one.. Since 2013, no issues.I don't worry about it... not my car."
July 2018,"with tires, it is not just a matter of not wanting to change your own. You can still call AAA. The difference is, if you have a spare, they put it on and you are on your way. No spare, and you are riding in the front seat of a tow truck, or standing on the side of the road waiting for an Uber, while you hope that the tow truck drops your car someplace that can find a tire right away. Just hope you don't get a flat when they are closed!"
July 2018,"Premium is recommended in my RDX too, but runs fine on regular. The engine is identical best as I can tell to the Pilot, Accord, etc. I think it even has the same code designation. Same compression ratio, even same power output. The TLX, not sure how much different it is than the Accord motor. Odds are it is fine on regular but might cut performance slightly but only at higher revs. The new RDX is pretty much a 2.0T Accord motor too."
July 2018,"Keep the comparison review of the Accord/TLX/CR-V coming! Speaking of which, do you find the TLX to be significantly quieter than the Accord and how so? I do believe you can run regular gas without damage in the TLX without too much performance degradation...if Premium gas is recommended and not required."
July 2018,"Almost everything about the TLX seems to be significantly higher in quality than an Accord, and often that higher quality comes with some added weight. I assume some designers several years ago said, more or less: here's a way we can save c.40 pounds all at once. And how many people really change their own tires at this point?Anyway, a few more pix of the new TLX, and a few little observations....The rear windows go completely into rear doors, and that didn't even quite happen with my Accord. Seems to be c. 5 LEDs in the side mirror turn signals compared to I think one with an Accord, trunk hinges are covered and protected, etc. The interior plastic wood or plood actually seems to be something like fake marble, which my son instantly named ""plarble"" lol! I had the owner's manual out because I was trying to figure out how to program the built-in garage door opener. Ultimately my son had to help me, because it involved him hitting a button actually on the garage door opener itself while I simultaneously pressed and held the Hondalink button."
July 2018,the plastic insert should pop out. I know for sure in the ILX it did.
July 2018,"I noticed the lack of a spare tire on my test drive of the CPO 2015 TLX last weekend. I'm very much on the fence about this issue.If it's an option, I wonder if / where / how much it would cost to obtain."
July 2018,"@henryn : Good points! I might at some point regret this design. We'll see. AAA response time in my area is usually about 15 minutes, although no doubt that varies. I changed maybe 4 tires between 1980 and 1995, and each time found it a challenging and annoying job. I don't really want to do it again. Because of good luck, good maintenance, and good tires, somehow I don't recall that we've had a flat in the last 7 or 8 years in either my wife's car or my car. My wife's new CR-V has a full-size spare, which is something I haven't seen in a long time. Interesting that our two new cars in their own ways go to extremes on this. @stickguy it's not clear to me if a spare would even fit in the TLX. Maybe those plastic trays can be removed? Not sure. Honestly it doesn't look like it. They seem well built and built-in.Anyway, you get a pressure sensor on each tire on the TLX. And here's a pic of some of the controls and buttons that are better than on my wife's CR-V."
July 2018,"Henry, I am with you. No spare tire is a hot button issue. Last blow out I had was at night, on a holiday, in the middle of nowhere. At least with the donut on I could get to a hotel, then next day find a tire store. The tire was shredded so yeah, no can of fix a flat was helping. I believe the TLX (at least prior to 2018 redesign) had a spare as an option. The ILX definitely did. Heck, if you pulled out the tray insert, the bracket with the screw hole to attach the tire bold was already there. And at one point they listed it as an accessory option on the build it page. the new RDX at least still has a spare. I would have to check a TLX to see if the tire well is still there."
July 2018,"It has been several years since I last used a spare tire. And then, bang, last Saturday, blow out on my minivan. I hit something out on the freeway, never saw what it was. My wife (now ex) used AAA and other ""road service"" (USAA insurance) several times, and the average wait was 1 to 2 hours.It took me about 15 minutes to get back on the road Saturday, and I thought that was rather long actually. Unfamiliarity with the mid-mounted spare, I actually had to dig out the owner's manual. IT guys really hate to RTFM.Fix a flat doesn't cut it, in my opinion. This incident Saturday, there was a hole in the sidewall. I don't think any amount of ""goop"" would have done the trick.I see now where some new cars offer a spare tire as an ""optional, extra cost item"". Is that your situation, @benjaminh ? If so, I would cough up the bucks.YMMV"
July 2018,"After a week apart I got to drive my new TLX for more than an hour today, all in Sport mode, which is the way to go for the 2.4. One highway run of c.70 mph with AC had a car calculated 36.5 mpg. If that's not a fluke, and if the car's mpg calculator is accurate (the one on my Accord was) then the highway mpg is very close to what I got in the 2016 Accord. Still finding all sorts of little quality touches, such as the nice feeling carpet, and the hidden storage area in the trunk (no spare tire, just fix a flat). I'd rather have a tire, I think, but the honest truth is that I haven't changed a tire since about 1995. Since then I've always let AAA do it, or tow it, and I haven't had any regrets."
July 2018,"I do not find it attractive at all. The previous version was far better looking IMO, and inside, this one is not good at all. As a GM fan this car is a huge disappointment. Top that off with performance that is mid-pack at best and I suspect the model may not make it to the end of its 4-year production contract with PSA at the former GM plant in Russelsheim, at least for North American markets."
July 2018,sounds like something I might like. Sucker for hatches of this style. I can take my chances with a 14 second quarter. Super comfy seats are a big plus.
July 2018,"No excuse for this, really. It has enough HP to be entertaining."
July 2018,"It is attractive; Too bad the overall performance isn't there, a fourteen second quarter isn't very impressive and every report on handling has been underwhelming- and all for ""just"" $40,000..."

July 2018,"Once in a while we've actually had that question in Forums: ""How can I tell if my car is FWD or RWD?"""
July 2018,"I'm fairly confident that the majority of people driving cars today couldn't tell the difference if only one wheel were driven, never mind on which axle.So long as it looks swoopy enough and has tons of electronics and a non-black interior, they'll sell (or, more likely lease) them from hell to breakfast."

July 2018,Can you get a V6 Stinger for $36K though? Maybe with discounts? Would you really want a 2.0T Stinger?
July 2018,"Just read a comparison of Accord 2.0T sport. $36k?! Sign me up for a Stinger instead, please!Or maybe a base Giulia."
July 2018,"I think you hit the nail on the head. The gadgets and whiz bang bells and whistles keep increasing, but the underlying quality seems to be going the other way; especially in the better ""lower-end"" makes. Lots of things are being compromised to hit price points while adding the latest nanny features."
July 2018,"The resale values/residuals for most luxury performance sedans are weak compared to something like a Honda Accord. As you all know, that sometimes makes getting a used one a good deal. Sometimes it seems like for just a thousand or two more than an Accord with the same years and mileage you can pick up a 320i, an A4, or a TLX. Even new it seems like the lease incentives on some luxury sedans are so high they they are almost giving you for free the added quality, features, and performance of the luxury car. I've mentioned before that maybe the most interesting book on the auto industry I ever read is called ""Car: A Drama of the American Workplace"" by Mary Walton, published in 1999. This book was not about a luxury car, but instead about the second generation Taurus, which Ford was trying to push higher in the marketplace. Anyway, one of the memorable things about it for me was that—not surprisingly—every single part on a car goes through a tough process of figuring out what the cost and therefore quality of the part can be. Ford was trying to make the 1996 Taurus a car that people would buy without big rebates, and as it was first designed and for its first year they allowed a higher budget for the cost of various parts so they would feel nicer, and sometimes function better. When the 2nd gen Taurus flopped in the marketplace the project manager had to huddle with his designers and engineers and try to figure out in an almost brutal way how to take something like $1500 in costs out of the car, which involved getting cheaper parts here, there, and everywhere.Since I read that I've been even more aware than I was before of the quality of big and small things in a car. Sitting in a rental Hyundai Sonata, for instance, I could almost immediately tell that most parts did not get quite as good a budget/engineering detail as the Honda Accords I used to own. And now with my new TLX, I can tell that the amount spent on most parts is not surprisingly higher than for a Honda. For instance, the steering wheel buttons and controls have a quality and size on the TLX that a Honda just doesn't have. This is partially about aesthetics, but it also impacts function. The adaptive cruise controls etc. are easier and more intuitive to use in the Acura when compared with my wife's new CR-V with its small and comparatively cheap butttons.Again, given the discounts and incentives that most luxury performance sedans need to move, it's almost like the customer is getting this added quality for very little cost—and in some cases almost for ""free."""
July 2018,"I think the Stinger is too big and it's also too expensive for me. The 2019 Kia Forte is soon ta be out and Kia fans are saying it looks sorta like a baby Kia Stinger. The 2019 Kia Forte 6-speed stick would work out good for the Mrs. and I some day.I've got a buddy over here in Alamogordo that swears by RWD cars. He says they're safer in the ice and snow than FWD cars and, basically, does not shut up about the issue. We just laugh at him and kid him about it - he also criticizes our driving (the other guy's driving, because I pretty much agree with him about this) as far as lane change procedures, putting on our turn signals correctly, etc. He's a stickler for driving accuracy, and, in those matters, I agree with him. I hate it when I'm turning right, for instance, and somebody behind me turns right, but goes around me right into the left lane without turning first into the right lane. I agree with him, that's not how the driver's guide teaches a person when they're first learning how to drive. And how they first teach you goes for lifetime driving.But he's got an old Cadillac Catera RWD that he fixes or has repaired often. Loves it so much. And he's as feisty as Geronimo was dealing with the US Cavalry regarding how much better a RWD car is over a FWD."
July 2018,"The Stinger is still too big for my tastes- and all the idiot dealers in my area only stock GT2 cars with AWD, pandering to the nitwits that think RWD is tantamount to a death sentence on anything other than straight and level dry pavement. I did see a Stinger in the wild today; I think it looks worse in person...Same in Centrsl NJ. All AWD. I test drove one . It's a true GT that is very quick. Bottom line, great cruiser but over priced at this time, even with the incentives. The lease rate comes to over 5%!I told the sales person I preferred RWD and crickets...."
July 2018,"Did you see the fuel economy on that model though? I can vouch that Audi knows how to do FWD as well as anyone, including Honda."
July 2018,"Everybody keeps saying that, so much so that I am beginning to have doubts. If everyone wants a clean used 2 year old Stinger, then supply and demand will kick in, and the price will go up. Way up.Time will tell. In the meantime, I think I may go looking for a 3 year old Genesis R-Spec V8. I know those are cheap."
July 2018,"Ah, a FWD. always seems odd to see one of these at an Audi dealer. And Audi prices. Forget the extra HP. that one is detuned. But, at least I think they did away with the CVT. I would get a much cheaper TLX instead."
July 2018,Audi A4 Ultra Prestige FWD.
July 2018,you do gain some HP in the deal though. and AWD (assuming you are looking at a Quattro).
July 2018,"Tried to figure out how much it would be to get an Audi A4 with about the same level of equipment as my TLX Tech. The number I came up with was c.46k for the Audi A4 with leather, navi, upgraded sound system, etc.—about 9k more than the TLX."

July 2018,"Yeah, I noticed that was conspicuously omitted from the article. These are going to make some great buys, used. I don't think they'll get modded, unlike the STi or Type R."
July 2018,interesting. Even more so in a couple years when they are CPO at half the price
July 2018,Food for thought on the Stinger
July 2018,"All but two of my 11 BMWs were purchased used, and only four were CPO cars. I always pay them off within 2-3 years and keep them for 8-10 years at a minimum. So far I have no regrets on any of my purchases- although the E90 328i was not exactly exciting and was offloaded to my son. As a point of comparison my Mazdaspeed 3 needed several repairs under warranty and I eventually needed to replace most of the suspension components, but like my BMWs, the pleasure the car gave me outweighed those issues. Could I have saved some money sticking with mainstream sedans or SUVs? Probably. But frankly, I could not care less; the cars I drive have to make me smile, and I can't imagine driving anything that doesn't..."
July 2018,"I'm not about to argue against what you're saying, basically I agree with you. But... what exactly does that say about anyone who buys a used Mercedes or BMW or Audi or ...I'm not going to spend that amount of money on a new car, and I'm not going to own a used one, so I am out of that market, sorry."
July 2018,no issues. I don't think it has been back to the dealer for other than routine service. And a couple of busted tires!
July 2018,"That's not what they are built for--the expensive cars are generally leased or traded in after a few years, and certainly during warranty. They are made for people who want the latest in luxury and gadgetry, and a few years, want the NEW latest in luxury and gadgetry."
July 2018,"The S4 8 years ago achieved 4.9. So there's that. Then add the tendency for Koreans to exaggerate their abilities and metrics/statistics, and the German's propensity to understate it, and yeah!"
July 2018,How reliable has your son's Audi been?
July 2018,But I assume that means Honda/Acura and Toyota/Lexus....?
July 2018,"The top makes for reliability are perennially, Honda and Toyota.I don't think expensive cars have ever been known for reliability, or low maintenance costs."
July 2018,"It seems counter intuitive, but it seems that some of the premium/luxury brands are still more problematic than mainstream, cheaper ones. To me, if I am paying top dollar, one of the things I expect is a well designed and built car, that should need nothing but routine maintenance. Just like my Hyundais have been! I would rather not even care how the service department experience is, since I only go once a year and it takes an hour or less."
July 2018,"It was Quartto, no sport package, it handled very poorly."
July 2018,"Or folks who have had one or more of those brands, isn't a badge snob, and is looking for better reliability. And before folks jump up and down on me, I'm not saying it will prove more reliable, just talking perceptions and biases here.If one follows CR one knows Kia has been rocking it pretty well in the reliability department in recent time. My Kia experience mirrors CR's ratings, yet again. CR always hits it out of the park for me."
July 2018,"Just curious, do you remember if the A5 was FWD or quattro? The other thing that wouldn't surprise me is if they put low octane fuel in a high octane competitor."
July 2018,"If you want rare, get an RLX! I saw one out in the wild today, probably the first of 2018!"
July 2018,"I liked the one that I saw at the car show. One of these days I will find an excuse to be out running errands near the Volvo dealer, and just stop in to browse."
July 2018,There is a lot of room in them
July 2018,I'm liking the XC40 more and more as I see the commercials and them in the wild. Saw one today that was in a kind if orangey-red. Really sharp.
July 2018,"I've seen 2 2019 S60 and 2 V60 with manufacture plates on them here in Phoenix, each time with 3 XC90's in tow, they are stunning in person."
July 2018,"I have never been in an Acura dealership. I've never driven one, and offhand I can't recall ever riding in one. I know a couple of people who own one of their SUVs, but I've never happened to ride with them. Infiniti, Lexus, Mercedes, BMW, of course, many times. Riding in, driving, whatever. Just for some reason, no Acura. Maybe they don't sell well here in Texas?"
July 2018,Sounds like a nice upgrade to a Accord. Next time I'm at Acura dealer I will test drive one. Acura's sound system is one of the best systems. Lots of luck with your new ride!
July 2018,"Huge difference. Wish I'd done it before. Although it might be that the great deal I got was only available at this time for the significantly improved 2018 TLX. The 2017 TLX iirc lacked AcuraWatch and lacked AndroidAuto, both essential features imho.On the TLX 2.4 the 0-60 acceleration, to be blunt, seems about the same as an Accord to me—although how you get there is different. At first acceleration seems faster in the TLX in 1st and 2nd, but then as it quickly goes toward 4th, 5th and beyond, it just loses punch. This is all in ""Normal"" mode. I think I might try Sport for a while and see what that's like. The TLX's 2.4 engine, of course, is a slightly souped up version of the Accord's engine that's made to take advantage of premium gas.But aside from the engine almost everything else is a big upgrade over an Accord. For the most part, you can't even tell that there's any relation between the two cars. The steering with PAWS is sharper and better, the transmission with the 8-speed dual clutch is also a very different experience from a CVT, the leather seats feel as comfortable and supportive as those of the new BMW I was just in yesterday, the suspension has that planted feeling almost like you are riding on rails (but it's still really comfortable), etc. And the the sound system is beyond anything Honda offers, and maybe even better than what's offered in a comparable BMW or Lexus."
July 2018,I liked what I saw and read about on it. Hope it is as nice in person.
July 2018,The S60 and 3 Series are new for 2019. and I think Volvo has a hit on its hand with the new S60/V60.
July 2018,benjaminh Any thoughts yet................ Pro's / Cons going from the Accord to a TLX.
July 2018,If I was about 25 pounds lighter and 3 inches shorter I'd buy the Audi A/S4. I really like them. I don't see any TLX's here in SC or NYC area . What I have noticed was a lot of Q50's ( good leases ) and MDX's in NY the last year or so.
July 2018,"The entire category is slumping. Only Audi is up. At least the S60 is being replaced this year, giving that tiny number some justification.I was noticing yesterday my neighborhood has quite a Acura’s. Every 2nd or 3rd house has at least 1, some 2. My block has a couple TLX, a TSX, 3 (that I noticed) RDX and 4-5 MDX."
July 2018,"Moving from an Accord to a TLX prevents one tiny problem (which is pretty meaningless)—""meeting"" your exact car at an intersection or on the road. My wife and I made a joke of it, but several times we'd see a white Accord that looked just like mine, or a red Accord that looked just lke hers. Once I was at a four-way stop sign and there were four Accords of different colors and generations there all at once. Now that I'm an Acura owner I do notice Acuras more, but usually they're RDXs, MDXs, and earlier Acura sedans. There are definitely TLXs on the road, but seeing one is pretty rare."

You drive the ""other"" car first around a road course, then you pick a GT to drive, there are three laps, the last lap was driven by one of the ""Professional"" drivers. I got the Audi A5 and it was a dog, Rick got the 640 and loved it.

June 2018,"This article is describing exactly what I think will be largest problems for Stingers and any other model over 40 grand. It's not even about the technology, as luxury dealers are sometimes behind on that, too (they were last ones to have their inventory posted online), but the attitude of ""you must buy it today"" that simply doesn't work for people who know they can afford a car twice as expensive, if they wanted to. All I need is to see the commercials of Kia dealers from my area and I know I don't want to go there. If they keep the Stinger around I still may need to bite the bullet and go to check it out for my next car. I get cold sweat even thinking about it."

June 2018,"The Kia is fast and relatively large.. If you value size in a vehicle, that's great. But, I'd take the Alfa over it, in that price range."
June 2018,I'd consider a RWD GT2 once depreciation has knocked the price down to a reasonable level. For what one would cost new I'd rather have a CPO F80 M3 or F82 M4- or a Mustang Bullitt for that matter.
June 2018,I think I saw one out on the road so far. Maybe.
June 2018,This thread has been dead for a while. Did anyone ever actually buy a Stinger? Inquiring minds want to know.
February 2018,"A lot more Stinger lease info can be found, here:https://forums.edmunds.com/discussion/49547/kia/stinger/2018-kia-stinger-lease-deals-and-prices#latest"
February 2018,Depending on trim and drive
February 2018,So why is it 4800 to 7200?
February 2018,I'm not aware that Alfa has had major quality issues with its cars lately.
February 2018,"For the Stinger, the numbers are national."
February 2018,"Or folks who have had one or more of those brands, isn't a badge snob, and is looking for better reliability. And before folks jump up and down on me, I'm not saying it will prove more reliable, just talking perceptions and biases here."
February 2018,I think the Alfa situation is also a bit different; it's a classic European brand that I think can do well if they iron out the QC issues and reliability is decent.
February 2018,Is lease cash depended on location?
February 2018,"Kia has changed up the calculus of their lease programs - high MF, low residual but high lease cash.For 36 months and 12,000 miles per year, MF ranges between .00195 and .00200, residuals between 50-54%, and lease cast between $4800-7200"
February 2018,"I know the Residual is like 50% and the MF isn't that good, but doesn't Kia have 6700 lease cash? Alfa had the same issue with the Gulita when it first came out, but they lease programs have gotten better."
February 2018,"Yes, I think newbies are the focus. And current hyunkia owners that want to get fancier. And of course people that can’t afford the name brands. Not seeing a lot of diehards or brand snobs making the switch."
February 2018,"The lease penetration is pretty high at those price points. And, the Stinger lease program sucks.So, I'll guess it will sell about as well as the Cadenza."
February 2018,"Soooo .... here's a thought.From what I've read, it doesn't look like Kia will be able to convert the BMW/Audi/MB/Infiniti clientele to give the Stinger a second look, much less a first one.But, for folks who haven't driven those brands on a regular basis (like me), would we be impressed enough with the drive / feel / interior materials enough to consider it?Not that I'm in the market for a $30-50K vehicle like this, but just wondering ...."
February 2018,"based on my brief drive of the Stinger GT2, Kia will have to up its game to play with the Audi /BMW / MB crowd; and having a $3500 regional markup is a non-starterbut the V6 is pretty nice"
February 2018,"I like the dash, it's different, and I'm sure that is what will be coming in the future. Rick and I stopped and looked a Stinger, it was a GT-1 V6 RWD, MSRP 46K, with all the features and options on this car a BMW 4 series 440i GC would be in the low 60's. It was very roomy in the rear seat, but getting in and out was a PIA. We didn't drive it, but for a 14K difference, I'm not too sure if paying the difference is worth it. The fit and finish was first rate, the salesman needed more training or he got his Audi models confused, he kept saying the Stinger competed against the A8. Stopped by the Volvo dealer, and was shocked a V90 (wagon) on the lot, according to the salesman, someone ordered it and decided to take a V60 instead. Not too sure why the interior of that V90 was stunning. 55K fully loaded. What a deal, an MB E400 wagon starts at 59K. Volvo has a hit, not too sure why the V90 wagon (not to get confused by the Cross Country) is special order only car."
February 2018,Looks like one of those Dyson vacuum cleaners. That's not a luxury look--that's GEE-GAW.
February 2018,Like the idea. Nice styling. Dash looks hideous.
February 2018,"Oh, my do we have a new entry into the ELLPS?https://blog.caranddriver.com/2019-mercedes-benz-a-class-debuts-will-spawn-at-least-three-models-for-u-s/?src=nl&mag=cdb&list=nl_dvr_news&date=020518"
February 2018,"My 2er weighs about the same as my 1988 M6, which was about 1.5 feet longer. The M6 had a Dinan chip and no cat so it was fairly quick for its day, but certainly not as fast as the 2 Series. That said, the M6 had timeless style and a incredibly cool exhaust note."
February 2018,"Tires and brake pads will complain about weight by making you run out of them sooner and faster. The tires on my lighter TTS are holding up well, though I am planning to get new PS4's soon."
February 2018,"so doing the math, your saying about 1% make it a decision issue? While probably accurate, I'd argue the percentage where it does matter is higher. Weight (less of it) assists in better handling, ride, acceleration, fuel economy, and braking. Lighter cars simply feel more toss-able. Those seeking sporty handling will notice it, even if they don't look at spec sheets."
February 2018,BMW certainly keeps porking up. only so much you can do to overcome physics.
February 2018,"With current engines, weight is much less an issue than it was 20 or even 10 years ago."
February 2018,"Yes, but I think many sports sedan buyers ""feel"" the weight.Granted, some manufacturers do wonders. My 3950lb CTS felt lighter than my 3700lb Mustang and 3750lb G35x."
February 2018,I think less than 5 percent of buyers look at curb weight and less tham fifth of those would make it a decision issue.
February 2018,"On the other hand, it could be judged heavier and less dynamic than the 3'er yet hold its own or be better than the 5'er in those areas. Also, of course, WAY cheaper than a comparable 5."
February 2018,"That may be true where you live, not so much here. So all you need is to get on a plane, or order."
February 2018,"The idea of going against 3 rather than 5 is to advertise „it’s bigger, has more power, more stuff and it’s cheaper”. Going against bigger 5 series that has many more available features (even if optional) would make it rather unsubstantiated in eyes of people who are silling to spend north if 60 grand, even uf couple metrics match. Just like the CTS might have been 5er size, it was crossed shopped by 3-series buyers, no matter what Cadillac’s marketng department tried to sell."
February 2018,"This because the dealer won't order them, but you can get RWD cars you just have to order them."
February 2018,"Here is what I posted on the previous page. In terms of interior room, especially rear seat space, the 5 and the Stinger are a virtual tie. In all measurements, it is clear that it is closer to the 5 than the 3.Having a bit of trouble with passenger volumes of the BMWs, but here is what I was able to dig up. Interestingly, the 3'er has more front leg room than the 5'er. Stinger trumps both. Rear leg room is within a tenth of an inch between the 5'er and Stinger.Stinger:Length 190.2Width 73.6Height 55.1Wheelbase 114.4Passenger capacity 93.8 cu ftLeg room front/rear 42.6/36.45’er:Length 194.6Width 73.5Height 58.2Wheelbase 117.1Passenger capacity ?Leg room front/rear 41.4/36.53’er:Length 182.5Width 71.3Height 56.3Wheelbase 110.6Passenger capacity ?Leg room front/rear 42.0/35.1"
February 2018,"well, in the north east, the 3 series effectively only comes as Xdrive. You will never find a RWD on the lot. I am guessing that Kia will likely be the same."
February 2018,"They still make the 3GT, the issue really is, the 3GT only comes in xDrive while the Stinger can be had in RWD and AWD. Which I don't think is a proper comparison."
February 2018,"the comparison tests have all been versus the 3, A5, etc. even if the WB is a little longer, it doesn't really compete against the cars in the E/5 series class. Seems like it has always been that way though. I was thinking it should compare to the 3GT. I assume they still make that one? The car mags (C&D) used the hatches (4 series and A5 sportback)"
February 2018,"Not sure where we made the comparison before, but yes, because of its size. Comparing on price does not make sense to me. You can get an Escalade and 911 for the same price, so does that mean they are comparable?"
February 2018,Why do you think it needs to go against a 5 series? Size? I think Kia wants the 3 series because of the price.
February 2018,"I also, as I have stated before, think the Stinger is closer to the 5-series. No idea why Kia says anything about the 3'er, unless it is only because that is the standard all the mags use."
February 2018,"Nope I built a 330i sedan. I looked at what the article compared, I think that is the only fair way to go about it, some people on Bimmerfest think the Stinger should be compared to the 5 series because it's close in wheelbase. But if Kia talks about the 3 series then compare it to the 3 series."
February 2018,"I just priced out a Ford F-150 Platinum, heavy on options, and I'm already up to $72,900. Sure does have everything, though."
February 2018,should be the GT version though to get the hatch. Or was that what you meant?
February 2018,"So I went and built a Stinger 2.0 RWD and a BMW 330i, I believe they are as close as you can get, and there is a 7K difference. Now if you pick 4 series then it's close to 9K difference. When Genesis brings the G70 you will be able to get it with a 6 spd manual and the difference wont be that great but I'm sure the BMW will be more."
February 2018,"After buying the S4, I didn't feel so bad about spending so much money once I saw how much people were spending on average trucks and SUV's."
February 2018,"Yes, but in order to really save 14K you'd have to have a car with similar specs and performance, now, you could argue your getting somewhere around 9/10th's for 8/10th's cost. As with everything, there is a law of diminishing returns."
February 2018,"LOL, and people complain that a base 320i doesn't have power seats."
February 2018,Mine had a sticker dangerously close to $50k and I don't even have leather!
February 2018,was that how much you spent on your truck?
February 2018,"Maybe Kia could cash in on the ""reverse status"" thing----""EVERYONE has a BMW and Audi, but I have no need for such ostentatious displays"". Tricky to pull that off, but it has been done."
February 2018,"In a world of $60k pick-em-up trucks, I don't see how folks can be so snobbish about a $50k car, frankly."
February 2018,"I had wondered the same thing when Nissan started selling the GT-R here. Here is a dealership whose average sales price is about $25K, now sell a 90K car. If you don't want a KIA, then get a Genesis G70 with a manual. But I don't have a problem walking into Kia dealership to get my car serviced, and if it does have to get service I'm not too worried. I highly doubt they will screw things up, yeah, I won't get the free loaner have a nice lounge to sit in, but I saved 14K..."
February 2018,"That's my worry as well, not to mention potential warranty hassles if I took a Stinger to an HPDE. At least you can get it in RWD. Having said all that, my usual strategy of buying a 2-3 year old CPO works great for me, the only downside being the ability to tailor a car to my exact specs- for example if I had ordered my F22 it would have had a red interior, PDC, and no hole in the roof- but the $15,000 savings compensates for the ""imperfections."""
February 2018,"Now it's about the dealer - if I have to put up with some sleazball salesman who is used to selling stuff to people with 550 FICO and won't change his tune, I may be deterred by him. Unfortunately my recent experiences at establishments selling ""mainstream"" cars have not been overly positive. To be blunt, every time I went to a place like that, I felt like needing a long hot shower. Hopefully I'll get lucky next time."
February 2018,"kia stinger gt AWD-- this it top of line v6just test drove today; nice engine note; very responsive in ""normal"" driver setting i.e not sportnice steering wheel-- flat bottomedtech is good; not sure HUD is needed as very washed out on a sunny day but apparently that is adjustabalereally nice seats with nice side bolstersvery audi-like/lightdealer had +$3500 market adjustment---lolkia does not have any 'concierge' services-- so as mentioned above, not sure how they will do in the >$45-$50k market"
February 2018,"MB been doing that now for 15 yrs with the CLS, it's an E class with a sleek body and they charge more for it."
February 2018,"I'm with you, my 330 suspension is base, but it has the right amount of firmness without being harsh. I like Stinger, I don't care if it doesn't have the best suspension I have no plans on tracking my cars again. But a 14K difference is a huge difference."
February 2018,"Not sure if 430ix standard suspension is same as my one in my RWD 430i (I have a std., not M-sport, not adaptive M-sport). Anyway, I don't care what C&D says about 430 ix GC steering and suspension. It's good enough for me. Perhaps I'm getting older. On my next round of vehicles I may be out of ELLPS altogether and into stupid SUVs. Ugh. Or maybe one more - if so, both A5 SB and Stinger will be on the list."
February 2018,"@flightnurse On Chronic Car Buyers I posted Car & Driver's sportback/coupe S5 comparison review which is also interesting, since these 4-door coupes are really just sleeker sedans."
February 2018,"Based on Car & Driver's review and my bias, I'd say so. Also, you don't get a free loaner car at a Kia dealership"
February 2018,"I posted this over on Bimmerfest and of course, many people are bitching that the 430i xDrive didn't have the ""right"" suspension. Of course, not too sure what they mean by that since you can't get xDrive with the 704 suspensions. But the price is a whopping 14K difference, is Audi worth it?"
February 2018,"They really did like the A5 Sportback. What amazes me, is the A4 is significantly lighter than the A5 Sportback, and is essentially the same car. The sportback might be tuned a bit more aggressively suspension-wise though than the ""family"" sedan."
February 2018,"I read that article in the magazine. Seems like BMW took the hit there. Audi romped.would be interesting to see the same test, using the big motor models instead."
February 2018,"Ha! I was just going to post that. Kia takes on the big boys. The Stinger isn't perfect but look at the price differential!One wonders how it will all pan out, though, when we look at the 3 year resale for each of these?"

January 2018,"Dino the N20/26 engine had a timing chain issue that BMW has FINALLY recognized and have increased the factory warranty, other than that the N series engine seems to be pretty built proof. The new B series engines are too new but would think they are just as built proof. The mileage for the F3X series cars have exceeded the EPA #, on a trip to Santa Fe, I averaged 37, Rick got 36 going to Austin in his GT."
January 2018,"The N/A straight six had a great sound. Beautiful, I loved it. But in terms of performance and fuel economy, it was a slightly improved product of 1990s. My only concern with my current four turbo is its long term durability. Its first iteration was introduced in 2012 models, so the jury is still out on true long-term numbers. Mid-term seems OK, as there are no massive failures at 100k+ threshold being reported so far. We had a very long track record with the N/A straight six. Those four cylinders are still building the record. One positive, it seems the owners, dealers and garages got the memo regarding proper oil grades this time, unlike in 80s, when turbos were used first time the stakeholders had no idea how to properly maintain those engines. Cheap mineral oil was the king back then, it would sometimes kill the scroller bearings in 60k miles from coking, even if changed at 3k miles, as the oil particles were just too large for fast scrollers."
January 2018,"Ditto.. Of course, the last n/a 6 cylinder helped push me that way. It was uninspiring."
January 2018,"The BMW is a car, not a church (although some might contest that)  There is certainly a trend to turbo-4s all across the board in the auto biz right now."
January 2018,"I was one, yet I have a four-cylinder now and think it's quite alright."
January 2018,"I've heard too many happy BMW owners over too many years and too many car models praise the in-line 6 engines, that to get a BMW without one would be sacrilegious to me."
January 2018,"They are all a bit too big and heavy for my tastes, although I did enjoy a 440i GC M Sport we had in our loaner fleet. RWD and the M Performance Power and Sound kit made it a lot of fun despite being a bit porky..."

January 2018,Sounds like the 2 liter might be the better bang for the buck.
January 2018,These are full lengths. More important would be wheel base and cabin space/legroom. Does anybody have those handy?
January 2018,"So the Stinger looks like a legitimate effort from Kia. Let’s hope people will buy it, so it stays in the market. If it is 5-series size, then $50k+ sticker for fully loaded fast supercharged V6 may be ok, considering Kia always throws in decent cash incentives. Low end 2 liter starts 35k, so that’s much more pallatable and separated in price from lux and comparable to four cyl turbos from other brands, too. One knock against is the mpg on GT, when you compare it with, say BMW’s 3.0 six turbo. It souns a bit like the previous gen without much fuel asavinlg tech. It may be a positive for some."
January 2018,"I looked at a white StingerGT2 2 weeks ago. I sat it in and it had far more room than my Q50S. I mentioned that it looked like a 5'er interior to the sales person. The exterior is far more upscale that is more up to date than a 3'er, IMHO."
January 2018,"Current 3-series sedan is 182"". 5-series is 194. Kia is 190. So definitely closer to the 5 than the 3."
January 2018,3 series in no longer compact. It grew in both size and weight. It is a legitimate midsize today.
January 2018,"The car is great so far. I picked it up in Munich in June, drove south to Switzerland, then southern France (Provance), swept along Cote d’Azur to Milan and back to Munich. Then picked it up in Spartanburg in late Septempebr and drove home to Tampa. Now it’s almost 9 thosand miles and perfect. Have to admit, although I miss the sound of my previous straight six, the four cylinder turbo is both quicker less thirsty by 20 percent. Even the automatic doesn’t bother me, it’s probably one of the best in the market. The electric steering, which used to be a major issue with early F3x generation, is finally fixed. It’s precise, albeit lighter than my previous 328. No longer Buick like. I think they tweaked standard 4-series, including GC to be slightly more sporty than standard 3. The standard suspension is also quite alright. I got luxury package without adaptive suspension and don’t feel like missing anything.In other words, the car is just fine with my growing up and getting stiffer in the joints, but maintains most important aspects of the handling. And there is that rear hatch"
January 2018,"Depending where you look, you might find different numbers. I found 4.2 0-60 and 12.8 quarter miles reported for my '16 TTS. Of course, my car cheats by only having 2 doors and being a coupe, so it's not a sedan, nor entry level."
January 2018,"As does (did) every other automaker. BMW practically invented ""sport sedan"", even before they got that posh image."
January 2018,"RR mentioned the Giulia TI, which won Car of the Year. I loved the one I drove, but Alfa needed to rethink their leases, for a 45K car they wanted 3K down, and payments of $550/m But today you can get that same car for min down and 420/m which is in line with BMW."
January 2018,That is because Kia used the 3 series and its benchmark.
January 2018,"Have to remember, as far as I know, the Stinger's class is midsized. Yet magazines always seem fixated on comparing everything to the compact 3-series instead."
January 2018,"To each his own; my personal standard is a sub-thirteen second quarter mile- and my 2er just barely qualifies.. Note that I didn't say the GT was slow, only that it could be a bit quicker. The Stinger GT's performance is solidly average for its class- which isn't bad."
January 2018,"I just read the latest road and track last night, and they had a stinger review. They list it at 4.6 0-60, and 13 seconds 1/4 at 109 MPH. Top speed of 167. If that is not enough performance for street use, you need to take up NHRA."
January 2018,"Before I bought my M235i I also considered a Camaro SS 1LE, a Challenger SRT8, a 2013 Boss 302, a 2016 Mustang GT Premium w/Performance Package, a Lotus Elise, a 370Z NISMO, a Cayman S, and a WRX STI, so I didn't confine myself to the ELLPS market segment. If I was buying a new car today it would almost certainly be an M2 with three pedals; If I wanted another automatic I'd likely go with a fully optioned M240i with sunroof delete.Leasing? Maybe a Giulia TI, even though it isn't that quick."
January 2018,"My non-negotiables are RWD, ample(some would say ""too much"") hp, and top-shelf handling and braking- so yes, I'd at least consider a Stinger GT. It could be a bit quicker, but aside from that I would just need to drive it. As dino001 mentioned, for me the primary drawback would be the buying process and probably service as well. At least with BMW I know that I won't have a warranty claim denied because I take my car to HPDEs."
January 2018,"Dino do tell about your 430 GC!! When it comes to Hyundai/Kia I think we need to be watching them. The first Gen Stinger is a looker and performs well, but isn't perfect. Give the mid life cycle and next Gen I think the Germans will have problems. For the price of my 330i, I could have bought the top of line Stinger GT and have money leftover and the V6 Stinger is quicker than a 340/440i. On the other hand, I have fallen in love with the Volvo V90, the design is stunning, and the price is perfect and you don't see many Wagons on the road."
January 2018,"the stinger really does seem like the acid test here. Car looks to have everything required to be a playa' if (and around here too, a big if!) they can overcome the dealer experience.Hyundai, I have multiple dealers nearby that are perfectly fine. Just as good as any Honda dealer. So the upcoming small Genesis, IMO, should not have the same stigma to overcome, if they car is as good as it seems it might be."
January 2018,"I have to honestly say, I don't care how something is called, whether it's the ""right brand"", or it ""belongs"" to some category. To me important issues are if the vehicle drives right, has right amounts of features, sufficient reliability record of the model or brand and dealerships that don't treat you like an illiterate. It just so happens that those tastes and financial abilities coincide with number of models that are called ELLPS by many. However, if Kia, Chevrolet, or Toyota came with a vehicle that has the features, handling and styling, I would consider it, regardless if somebody else calls it ELLPS, or not. It just so happens that up to this point their current lineup is aimed at different buyer demographics, but they could change. For example, Kia came up with Stinger, which looks quite ""tasty"" in the first glance. Even with their legendary obnoxious dealerships (at least here in Tampa Bay) with even more annoying commercials, if I were on the market, I would probably hold my nose and at least take a look and ask for a drive. If it checked all the right boxes, I'd take it. Lower price would be just a bonus. And I don't care if Edmunds' panel of discussion board experts considers that vehicle ELLPS, or not."
January 2018,"yup. Sometimes you get the car without the badge. and sometimes you get the badge, without the car! Up to each buyer to decide what is more important to them. The drive or the prestige (posing)"
January 2018,"Then there is the 'near ellps' 2018 Kia Stinger. Nice car but no brand image as far as luxury goes. It does look refreshing compared to some current ELLPS sedans, however."
January 2018,"Mr_Shiftright said: flightnurse said: Mr_Shiftright said:It's a marketing term, it's not something quantifiable. 
I fully get it so why can't other brands be brought into conversations?
Well it's a consensus kind of thing. One has to set a limit somewhere--or as the old saying goes:""If everyone is beautiful, then no one is beautiful"". 
Yeah, then we could cover the entire automotive spectrum with just one thread here at Edmunds.""Talk about your transportation device - sedan, coupe, wagon, SUV, CUV, truck - whatever""(and, I'm sure I missed a few categories as well)I get it, however - one person's definitive list means that another person's choice would be excluded.""Near ELLPS""?""Pseudo ELLPS""?A year or so back, I created a thread to discuss the new compact SUV's (Trax, HR-V, etc.). Crickets.Shifty's got one on electric vehicles - besides the two of us, I think there has been maybe one or two other unique posters who have contributed."
January 2018,"Well it's a consensus kind of thing. One has to set a limit somewhere--or as the old saying goes:""If everyone is beautiful, then no one is beautiful""."
January 2018,"Luxury.. We decided it meant a luxury brand.Kia: Not a luxury brandGenesis: Not until you show me separate Genesis dealerships, that aren't adjacent to Hyundai dealerships. Until then, just a Hyundai.Feel free to discuss the actual vehicles."
January 2018,"Spartan can mean different things to different people. Especially if you've had a feature in a car for more than a Decade, going back to something that doesn't have it will seem ""outdated."" Of course, I'd imagine even the most stripped model today would seem ""loaded"" compared to anything from 20 years ago, for those that only buy a new car every 20 years"
January 2018,I fully get it so why can't other brands be brought into conversations?
January 2018,Volvo? Aren't they kind of like Buick? (snicker snicker). How about the Genesis and Cadenza or K900 or whatever other name the Koreans come up with?
January 2018,"It's a marketing term, it's not something quantifiable."
January 2018,"But the question is, what is Entry Level? As I wrote, my 330i MSRP was 47K, and does not have leather? What list of options or standard equipment makes it an Entry Level? If you added leather to my car the MSRP would have been close to 49K. Just because it has BMW badge makes it ELLPS?"
January 2018,I would add the upcoming new smaller genesis (3 series competitor).
January 2018,"I'm pretty sure that @Kirstie_H laid out the list.It starts with a luxury make. So, Acura, Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Infiniti, Jaguar, Lexus, Lincoln, Mercedes, and Volvo.So, that's the minimum to qualify.A 3-series sedan is an ELLPS, for the purposes of this discussion."
January 2018,I think it's a combination of badge + price more than the individual options list---although we do expect an ELLP not to be spartan in any way.
January 2018,"As prices continue to climb what is really an ELLP? If you are talking about the base model, mid-level model? My 330 MSRP was 47K, far from the base, and far from being fully loaded. What equipment makes it a ELLP? My 330 does not have leather. Now is my 330 a sports sedan, I would say YES to that. The base suspension is firmed up from previous year F30's, I have 18"" rims with Performance tires, the standard seats are now the Sports seats. The steering feel is a little better than in the past, overall I have enjoyed this car. I just wish BMW would allow you to really custom build a car, I would love the M Sports Suspension without the body kit, this to included the M Steering wheel. I feel this is the only thing I'm missing from my car.So you think manufacturers are getting away from Sport Sedans perse and more into the ELLP?"
January 2018,"For a while years back Audi let Stasis get in bed with them.For people that were afraid of losing their warranty, they were perfect.Of course, all Stasis really did was this:GIAC tuning, which you could get from GIACI'm sure they sourced someone for a forged 20"" wheel.Alcon brake systems, rotors, calipers, and slapped the Stasis name on it.AWE exhaust, and slapped the Stasis engraving on the tips.I'm sure the coil-overs and sway bars were outsourced too. I wonder if they did anything themselves. Of course, I do remember noticing that KW used Koni Dampers."
January 2018,"I did raise an objection to the tunes for the S4 (and TTS) for that matter costing more than the A3 tune. The S4's is the most expensive. I asked if ""the cost was based on the MSRP and assumed bank account of said owners?""The answer was that there were more 2.0T engines to spread the costs around than 3.0T (supercharged) engines. In fact, the 2.0T is used in VW's like the GTI. The 3.0 was limited to S4, Q5, A6, & A7."
January 2018,BNW does not offer one for the 4 cyl in the US only the 6.
January 2018,Doesn't the dealer offer a tune? Or did they stop that?
January 2018,"This is true, however, I'm not worried as I don't abuse the engine enough be concerned."
January 2018,Not at the dealer many aftermarket companies
January 2018,"They shouldn't, but they usually do. As I recall, when dealers first started offering DInan tunes on the N55, it bumped them like 30hp and cost 50% more than the aftermarket units that offered double the power increase. I could be misremembering some details, but I believe that was the gist."
January 2018,"If the dealer offers it, they back it up"
January 2018,The Dinantronic tunes are piggybacks.
January 2018,"oh sure, just like Microsoft, etc. like the old joke about the mechanic (or plumber, but hey, this is a car forum) that got called in, took one look, turned a screw 1 turn, and was done. Then handed owner a bill for $100. Owner then complained about such a high charge for 1 minute job, so mechanic took bill back and noted on it: ""screw turning charge, $1.00. Knowing which screw to turn, $99.00"""
January 2018,"Tuners claim the cost is to reimburse them for R&D, since it is just software."
January 2018,"considering it is just a software update, it really should not be all that expensive. Well, it could be if the value is there, but not like there is much labor or parts involved. as to ELLPs, I like them. Can't really afford a new one at this point, but I did really like the TLX. would however prefer it was a size smaller. A modern version of the ILX would be just right. Though more likely they kill that off.but, right now, I am following the trend in the country of being more interested in a CUV alternative (the upcoming RDX). All the goodies, most of the performance, and a big square cargo area for convenience. Actually, for us, anything in this class would have to be the primary family car, and that is likely to always be something practical, like the RDX."
January 2018,They can; a lot depends on the dealer and the amount of the warranty claim.
January 2018,"These mods. sound nice, but do they they invalidate the warranty?"
January 2018,The Dinatronics Sport for my car is only $300.
January 2018,Only $200? At the dealer? That's a bargain.
January 2018,"I know what will revive this discussion. Let's argue about what constitutes the right amount of luxury and performance to be a vehicle that fits ""Entry Level Luxury Performance Sedan."""
January 2018,"Boy, this forum has died. So I've had my 330i now for 8 months, and I like it. Just had the car coded and applied the Dinan Sport tune. It gives a modest HP gain (25hp) but a healthy torque (50lbs) increase. It took 2 complete sleep cycles to feel the additional 50 lbs of torque. Not bad for $200 tune. This car just amazes on how the milesage I am getting with it, combined I'm getting a very solid 28.5, took a trip to Santa Fe, averages 34 on that trip, Ricks GT averaged 34 a few weeks later. Hope all is doing well."
December 2017,Thanks! Appreciate the shout out.
December 2017,I've looked at a few different chats(blogs) here at edmunds and have been very impressed by the responses (certainly in the lease/deal sections) from the moderators. Nice work.
December 2017,"If you are the one affected, then the casualty rate is 100%"
December 2017,"The second recall involves the heated PCV valve. I talked with several techs at work and a couple of them said that they had seen blower motors with connectors that had gotten hot, but none of them looked like they were anywhere close to catching fire. No one had seen the PCV issue."

December 2017,"The the comment above - I hope the BMW wins. BMW has been leasing ""el cheapo"" cars for years and calling them the ultimate driving machines. (Talking 320 for those new here) Would be great to see if they can beat a Ultima (Nissan). For 299 a month I think the BMW should win - at msrp I would think it could be tougher-"
December 2017,"I've been a fan of Peter Egan for years, because of writing also motor Motorcyclist.

That is why I think those articles are boring, What I think would be interesting is these magazines would take a BMW 320 and put against say a Kia Optima and see if the added cost for the BMW is worth it.

December 2017,"""Guess who's back, back again, shadys back, tell a friend""2013 s4 now has 40k miles - which I bot used in February 14 with 14k miles so for 26k miles thru New England weather and potholes I have yet to have any issues. Tire swaps for the seasons and regular recommended service. My guess at 45k would prob need to do brakes- which will be expensive. Of current Ellps I don't really see any thing that screams by me for the cash - Audi s5 fastback very cool looking BUT 60k is tough. Kia stinger another that's very interesting - BMW for anything with a 6 is way to expensive for that interior.Many have commented about getting more in average brand cars and I totally agree- badge envy for me is gone- look at the technology and standard safety features you get with a 18 accord. Speaking of accord - sharp looking in sport form and you can still get a Manual (talking to you Audi)"
October 2017,How is it that my 12 yo Acura TL looked good and was highly reliable. And yet the new TLX IMHO doesn't look as good and Acura's reliablity is in the dumper according to CR. Not a lot of progress in 12 years.
October 2017,"I'd find badge engineering comparos interesting. Pit an X1 against the Mini equivalent, a GTI against the A3, the Smart Car against the...... well, never mind. A V6 Accord vs. a TLX. Or soon to be 2.0T Accord vs. V6 TLX."

October 2017,"I've been reading comparison tests since 1967; I find the magazines that most closely mirror my preferences are Automobile, CAR, Car and Driver, EVO, and Top Gear. Road & Track has an extremely deserve staff , and I usually find myself agreeing with Peter Egan, Jack Baruth, and my friend Sam Smith."
October 2017,"When was younger I would live, breath and sleep these comparison test, I could quote stats all day long. But as I got older and owned some of these cars I realized that numbers really don't mean much, since testing is never done at the same time of year, or track or weather condition. So for the average Joe any one of these cars would be OK with and no see any of the ""issues"" the writers saw. I wouldn't mind having any of those cars and I know I would happy owning it. Now, I wish BMW would build a M4 GC..."
October 2017,"depends a lot on priorities, as with every comparison test."
October 2017,I have seen that comparison a number of times now and the verdict is almost never the same. Although I do believe the RS5 always finishes last.
October 2017,"I picked up the latest issue of EVO tonight; it contains a comparison test of the RS4, M4 Competition Package, and C63 S. The M4 won; it was they said, ""Way out in front..."" It makes me wish even harder that my center would sell the M3 manual with the Comp Package; it's getting way too tempting having to walk past it every day..."
October 2017,Hard to see the point given that you seem prone to simply dismiss any such reports that do not fit your narrative.Meee-ow!!
October 2017,"Oh it counted, and is the reason Audi didn't ever surpass Lexus. However, I will say the problems he experienced with one Audi pale in comparison to 3 Cadillac's in a row he had. But you never mentioned him I'm sure it was an oversight. My issues with Audi is they are FWD cars. If they moved to an FWD platform an S5 Sportback would be in my driveway."
October 2017,"Good point!Nothing really wrong with the Infiniti. I think they softened it too much. The twin turbo 6 was good. Transmission was a bit lazy, but nothing really wrong with it.I think I was hoping for more of what the previous generation offered with the 3.7, which was much sportier. Infiniti went in the opposite direction."
October 2017,"""Show us where the bad Neon touched you, Andres. That's the only way we can help you get past this incident that still affects you so deeply even though it happened 20 years ago.""
Still, batting .666 or so with cars isn't good. Anyone else around here own a good Caddy recently?
Hard to see the point given that you seem prone to simply dismiss any such reports that do not fit your narrative."
October 2017,"Does mean it drives better or sportier than a 330i, but to each their own"
October 2017,"You didn't own the Infiniti long enough, but it seems the Asian brands are your anti/counter-magnet to getting bad cars as @dino001 put it."
October 2017,"They count, but you've only had the 2nd one for how long? @qbrozen had a good experience with one too, but he owned it for about as long as a Neon is reliable too. Still, batting .666 or so with cars isn't good. Anyone else around here own a good Caddy recently?"
October 2017,"Well, they did tend to have AC issues, intake module issues, fuel pump and cam follower issues, and maybe a couple other things (like open sky double moon-roof issues, window regulator issues, and center console latch issue). For a lot of those things they issued super long courtesy 7 year 120 K warranties though as goodwill, and the failure rate was far from 100%. I had a window regulator and AC go bad, and I needed the intake module replaced on my A3 by 106,000 miles (didn't opt for the Open sky so you can't break what you don't have). Getting a big check to reimburse me for the intake module after the fact went a long way towards making me forget some of those minor issues. Still, considering I drove it like I stole it, was a reliable 06 model. It was no Lexus, but it wasn't a Neon either. For example, the A3 never needed to be towed."
October 2017,"Oh it counted, and is the reason Audi didn't ever surpass Lexus. However, I will say the problems he experienced with one Audi pale in comparison to 3 Cadillac's in a row he had."
October 2017,"I wouldn't give Audi that much slack, to say that they were reliable in the mid 2000s. I think it took a few years longer than that for them to get quality control UNDER control."
October 2017,"quite likely. there is also some time lag to those surveys, so what you buy today may be different than what got dinged.besides, at this point, with very few exceptions (ALfa?) the bar is set so high, that even the ""worst"" brand is pretty darned good. especially considered where most were not all that long ago."
October 2017,"dino....seems that way, doesn't it.Stick....I think that ZF transmission was an issue for Acura. While I never owned the '15 TLX, from what I understand the trans was tuned ALL WRONG in that drivetrain.The one in my '19 behaves quite well and reminds me a whole lot of the ZF trans I had in my 335i several years ago.So, perhaps Honda/Acura got all of that sorted out with ZF."
October 2017,"Well, in a survey, any individual response really doesn't mean much."
October 2017,Nor with BMW or Toyota. I guess my 2 flawless Cadillacs don't count either.
October 2017,Acura is probably entirely related to the 9 speed AT
October 2017,"Well, I didn't have much experience with Audi, except my late dad's 2004 A4 TDI (in Poland) that's still with the family, but enough people complained about it even on Edmund's forums, like GG's infamous S4 problems and inept response from the service departments (this was before his even more disastrous CTS when the service guy blamed ""wrong gas"" for for problems with the entertainment system). BTW, I have to say from years of posting, GG looks like a magnet for bad cars. I'm sure Audi improved, I just found very surprising that they are now at top 3. BTW, I was happy to see BMW also climbing to near top. I wonder if Audi will offer similar warranty to VW (6/72 btb!), or perhaps they're doing well enough and VW is just putting a last ditch effort to salvage the market."
October 2017,I guess there isn't enough data for Alfa Romeo yet?
October 2017,"I am also wondering about Fiat. They were WAY down at the tail end before, so I'm pretty sure there is still one worse than Caddy."
October 2017,So his experience with Audi didn't count?
October 2017,Kind of amazing how Honda has slipped. And Acura much more so.
October 2017,"Audi's been providing the icing with the cake since the mid 2000's. Where have you been? Pretty darn consistent at the top right behind Lexus for luxury makes the last 5 years or so. Still, not at Lexus reliability levels yet (or ever). I think we all saw Cadillac tumbling coming based on @graphicguy experiences. Unlike some that write-off personal experiences reported here as anecdotal, I take it to likely be ""par"" for the course as that is statistically most likely to happen. BMW's improvement is both significant and recent. They weren't that hot in prior years. Kia has been inching toward the top for awhile now too. One of the reasons I got one, as they surpassed Honda and Acura for a few years now. Audi's QC is most definitely superior to VW's. Has been for a long time, and most Audi's are still made in Europe while VW's in Mexico. As to Chrysler's improvement, they had no where to go but up."
October 2017,"I find Audi, BMW and Kia at top almost shocking. Especially Audi. Interestingly enough, VW is way to the bottom, so it seems even though they share some parts, the overall QC must be much better there. Also, Porsche being closer to VW than to Audi is interesting. I will believe Chrysler's improvement (it jumped over other domestics) if it remains there for a few years. And where is Fiat? Off the scale?"
October 2017,"For reliability, according to Consumer Reports, Lexus is at the top and Cadillac is at the bottom....""Toyota led the way with a predicted new-car reliability score of 80 on a 100-point scale, with Toyota's luxury brand Lexus right behind at 77. In last year's ranking, Lexus was No. 1 and Toyota was No. 2.“All the way down at the bottom is Cadillac, which is just really very disappointing because these cars are great,” Fisher said at the luncheon. “Anyone who's driven a Cadillac lately realizes that this is a very competitive, luxury car [brand] but unfortunately, there’s a lot of reliability issues.""http://www.autonews.com/article/20171019/RETAIL/171019640/toyota-consumerreports-reliability-survey-fca"
October 2017,"That's true in most markets, not just cars.If you want the best you pay $$$$If you are happy at 70-80% you can pay perhaps 50% of the high end.Examples:
 Smart phones TVs Computers Watches (more than a 2:1 ratio here!) I'm sure many more"
October 2017,"LOL ah, the good old day when ELLPS were cheap... The price of your 1998 A4 is the same cost of a middle-level Nissan Altma.. Have fun with one of those."
October 2017,"Interesting, now I came from a base suspension 320, to a base suspension 330i and the two are worlds difference. The 330 feels more planted, doesn't want to push as much in the corner and I know I can take my fave on and off ramps faster. I feel that the base suspension on the 2016 and newer 3 series is better than before. Now Rick's GT has the Adaptive suspension and I like it, I wish mine had it.. But overall I can't see how a Mazda 6 would come close to a base 3 series on a road course or figure 8"
October 2017,A car with that MSRP came with a battery tender? LOL!
October 2017,"Wow.....this old thread is back. Got really contentious in here for a while so I ignored it. Good to see it in friendlier confines.Just saw a review of both the new Camry and Accord. Camry has NEVER been my cup 'o tea. But, seeing it, what it offers, and comparing it to something like a Lexus ES300 or IS, and the lines begin to blur. Same or similar drivetrains, all loaded up, and more than just a nod to similar styling, ELLSS become harder to differentiate from their parent company.While not Entry Level new....how about now?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f83A2CW-Lt0&amp;t=17s"
October 2017,"Well that's the whole marketing scheme isn't it? To dangle a few extra baubles in front of the consumer so that he upgrades? I mean, isn't advertising about making you dissatisfied with what you already own? Certainly, that seems to drive the leasing of ELLPS, at any rate."
October 2017,"yes, pretty much. The incremental improvement costs a whole lotta money."
October 2017,I think the point is you can get 80% (or more) of the performance and features for 50% of the price.
October 2017,"But is it really comparable?220 HP vs. 201 hp for the HyundaiTorque disparity is larger I believe if I'm not mistaken. 24/33 MPG vs. 26/33 for the Hyundai; now that's close, but the Audi engine is 20% bigger. Car and Driver is posting 5.4 0-60 time for A3 Quattro, with 129 MPH Top Speed Wasn't able to find figures on the Elantra Sport (too many trims)."
October 2017,If you want a RWD sport sedan the mainstream brands really don't offer any competition- although the Genesis G80/G90 and the KIA Stinger are notable exceptions. If you don't care which wheels are driven and simply want a wide assortment of gadgets then a bread and butter sedan may well be the way to go.
October 2017,"Interesting - forgot about the A3 in your family. A longer term comparison will be interesting. Gotta have your son drive the Hyundai and offer his opinion. Better yet, let him take it to NY and drive it for a month (when the weather is nicer)."
October 2017,"well, my pending Elantra sport is an interesting example, compared to my son's A3. Not as many gizmos (his is loaded). But similar size, comparable performance (short of Quattro), many same features. similar ride and handling. Less prestigious badge. But for most people, not a huge difference. Other than price, which was a full $20,000 cheaper.put another way, you can get so much car for 20-25K now, that justifying 40-50k is hard (assuming you even have the budget to pull it off!)"
October 2017,"That's the fun of shopping, looking, smelling, tasting, trying on, driving... Funny, seats, while comfortable, have kinda short bottom cushion for my taste. Gotten used to/adjusted, so no worries. Maybe the one you looked at had the upgraded seats? I have standard black interior, not my first choice, but when you're buying from inventory on New Year's Eve, variety is not your spice of life! I like the overall interior, a bit too much aluminum staring me in the face for my taste, but enough wood to keep me warm.The rotating vents are a cool feature....the first couple of times you see 'em. You can easily program them to stay open, which I will do as soon as the warranty expires!Drove into Boston for dinner/show Saturday night. Parking garage, didn't realize until I was all the way in that it was valet only. The attendant told me no worries, they always take special care of Jags! Uh, huh."
October 2017,"Also prices have continued to skyrocket in ELLPS. I know what I bought my Audi A4 for in 1998, and I'm not gonna spend my money on their current prices. So ELLPS is more or less out of what I want to pay.However there are some decently compelling ""mundane"" cars that can be loaded up to levels that approach (and sometimes exceed) ELLPS. If you want the badge then you go ELLPS. If you want much of the actual benefit and to save some cash, then dropping down a market notch is not a bad idea."
October 2017,"Not any longer! Though my looking supported a theory of mine. This class is hurting, because the competition from below is fierce. Mainstream cars, for much less money, that are so good already that the extra money is hard to justify for many people. Especially in the smaller models."
October 2017,Yet I get the feeling we've strayed a bit off topic this last day or two.Anybody in the market for an ELLPS?
October 2017,"Bingo, shifty!"
October 2017,In the right hands......
October 2017,I had a Mazdaspeed 3 and I really liked it. My wife may well end up getting a CX-3 in a year or two. Mazda is my favorite of all the Asian brands; I actually put off replacing my Mazdaspeed3 for a year in hopes that the rumored 300hp AWD Mazdaspeed3 was coming to market. No such luck...
October 2017,Agree .. my neighbor's kid has the mazda6 which has 19's. I'm not a mazda6 fan but the handling on this Mazda is excellent
October 2017,Getting the upgraded  15 wheels on a fire red Rio may help in the agility tests.  Buick Regal GS vs Mazda6 might be a better square off. The New 2018 Regal is updated and refreshed this year. Lets see if GM builds on some previous model positives . Regal's 2.0- turbo accelerated 0 to 60 mph in 7.2 sec. The Rio just may give it a run for its money down a straightaway
October 2017,That does it- the 2er and 3er are going on Craigslist and I'm headed to the Kia Store!!!
October 2017,"Probably closer than you think if the 330i has the base suspension. If the 3er has the M Sport or the Adaptive M Suspension all bets are off. Neither car is a rocket sled, but the with a 0-60 in the mid-fives and a fourteen second quarter mile 330i is about 0.5 seconds quicker than the Mazda. The 330i will likely return better fuel economy, especially if equipped wit the superb ZF 8HP automatic.I don't like FWD in anything larger than a Mini Cooper, so I'd go with the 330i- in RWD of course."
October 2017,"Why not wonder if a Kia Rio handles just as good as a 330i.Check out this review - it might.http://www.thedetroitbureau.com/2017/10/first-drive-2018-kia-rio/Best of all, there’s a lot more driving fun than you’d expect in an entry-level scooter, especially considering its front struts, rear torsion beam setup. Its progressive and predictable in its behavior, so much so, you might wonder when the hot hatch variant will arrive, something you would never say of a Kia Rio in past form.It lacks the expected Korean floatiness and excessive brake dive, even at extremes. Take a corner too fast, brake hard and crank the wheel and the Rio will scrub off speed while maintaining way more grip than you’d come to expect. Credit the car’s rigid structure; the suspension pieces themselves are nothing special.When it comes to tech, Kia has you covered with Bluetooth, a six-speaker stereo with satellite radio and a rear-view camera system, seven-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Standard safety features include six airbags, side-impact door beams, electronic stability control, anti-lock brakes, hill-start assist and vehicle stability management.There's a brand new 2018 Kia Rio5 over at George Gee Kia in Spokane Valley, WA, selling for $14,795. 6-speed stick model."
October 2017,Why not wonder if a Kia Rio handles just as good as a 330i.
October 2017,I'd imagine if the Mazda 6 was given an upgraded wheel/tire size it would hang as long as horsepower was previously agreed to not be used.
October 2017,Mazda6 handling vs BMW 330 . Does Mazda6 have a leg to stand on?? Love to see the 6 in a manual? I thought the 17 Mazda's handling was superb
October 2017,"They are okay onde you are on the move, but they are a bit laggy at low speeds and when shifting from forward to reverse."
October 2017,"I don't have any experience with BMW's DCT's. I heard the early ones a long time ago were lackluster to put it nicely, but I thought they had made vast improvements? What would be your ""complaint"" list on the current crop of the latest and greatest DCT's from BMW?"
October 2017,"we looked at a used Jag XF (2013) Wednesday. Wife was not impressed by the interior (I found the seats fantastic, her less so, but mostly because is was that odd orange color). But the part she found oddest was when I finally figured out how to put the AC on, and the vents rotated open and close. Just seems like a solution to a problem that did not exist, and one more thing to break (expensively)."
October 2017,That is something that sadly has gone away here in recent years. There was one GM dealer in particular that always had free food on offer. It changed ownership and that is now gone.
October 2017,"Michaell, since shopping is free and fun, and you never know which dealer will have free food!, why not visit your local Jag dealer too, and check out the XE? Good driving from what I've read, interior may not be up to snuff (more performance than lux). But, only you can decide what floats your boat.Re: BMW, its Motor Works, not Style Works (roughly translated)."
October 2017,"That's my feeling. If you don't need to work the stick, then don't buy the stick."
October 2017,"I've come to the point where I prefer manuals in cars that really need one- those with engines that need to be wound out to make significant power, like my Club Sport. With engines that make peak torque from 1300-4500 rpm-such as the N55 and B58-I prefer theZF 8HP; it shifts quickly, rev matches, and has a true manual mode.That said, I'm not all that enamored by the DCTs in the M cars; if I was going to replace my M235i; I'd go with an M240i if I wanted two pedals and an M2 if I wanted three..."
October 2017,"Aside from a 3 year stint with the Fusion I've had a manual for the better part of the last 15 years, granted not as long as some here but long enough that was very accustomed to the enjoyment of rowing my own gears. I lucked out in 2014 when it came to the A4 however this time my dealer had no manual A4's in stock and no immediate plans to order any, my salesman said they sell on average less than 4-5 per year and most times they sit waiting for a buyers like folks on this board, who are becoming rarer by the day. Like @dino001 I resigned myself to the fact the next car was going to be an auto, which opened up many more options because finding a manual entry level luxury car is like finding hen's teeth. It did also open up another vehicle for my wife to drive, who was confined to her Altima the last 3 years."
October 2017,"I went with auto, cause there wasn't anything else available with GC. When I was preparing to change from my wagon, I made peace with AT as my next transmissions already some time ago. I decided that the form factor (body type) with equipment and color were more important than the transmission. The transmission is alright - very responsive, efficient, seamless. It isn't manual, but it will do. I thought I wanted 435, then 440 GC all that time until I spent some good time with the 430/330, got to play with the sport/sport+ modes and became convinced to keep the money, both in the purchase and at the pump. For me it's good enough. I think I'm already past the ""got to have the horses"" stage. There is minimum I want/need, of course, probably higher than the market average, but 430 is quite enough."
October 2017,"Congrats on the 430, so you went with the 8 Spd auto, how you like it? I'm still leaning towards a 440 GC next."
October 2017,"When it comes to looks, you can tell BMW is playing it safe, the look is evolution and bold and in your face like what Acura had done to the TL, I think the BMW is a handsome sedan. I'm not 100% sold on the new C class but like the looks of the A4."
October 2017,"I just bought 2018 430i Gran Coupe. Keen eye would see subtle difference with the 330 sedan, but from a distance they both look similar. BMW has made a decent progress in addressing my largest complaint, i.e. steering wheel and suspension feel. It's not quite as heavy as my previous 2018 328, but it got to the area where it's no longer Buick. The interior is improved, the stitched plastic dashboard cover is a nice touch. One thing that feels really old and tired, are the speedometer and odometer. Almost the same as they were 10 years ago, which were almost the same as those 10 years prior that. I even joke that those BMW designers obsess about their engine, transmission and everything else, then three weeks before launch they suddenly realize that they need a new dashboard, so they stick the old one, again."
October 2017,"@flightnurse, no doubt that the 3-Series BMW’s are being improved. With regard to my expressed opinion, I’m talking about looks. I know you’re BMW guy; no offense intended."
October 2017,"Your statement is completely wrong, The 3 series has changed where it was needed, with the new B46 engine I feel it is a lot more fun to drive as the torque is lower in the rev band. The small changes to the interior and iDrive software has been an improvement."
October 2017,"You pretty much can’t go wrong with all of the above. The only thing I have against a 3-Series is that they haven’t changed much, and the interior has remained essentially the same through the years. Still wouldn’t throw it out of bed for eating crackers. It’s all personal choice."
October 2017,"Yeah, I've been admiring them lately."
October 2017,C class is really really nice.
October 2017,"Drive them all and buy what YOU like. I want a RWD, car, so that biases my choices"
October 2017,Q50S60
October 2017,"In the interest of reviving this thread, I pose a hypothetical.In 2-3 years I could be in the market for a CPO ELLPS - what do you recommend?Audi A4BMW 3-seriesMB C-classSomething else?Figure I'd be looking at 2017 or 2018 MY."
October 2017,Along with the sedan...
October 2017,Boy did this forum die....
July 2017,"There is always a change but my 320 and Ricks 328 hasn't had an issue, I don't plan on pushing more than the tune."
June 2017,"Mine was good about it and helped me get things fixed but he did say if the engine blows, for example, there isn't much they can do because corporate will inspect the computer and find out."
June 2017,The trick is finding a dealership and service advisers that ignore a TD1 flagging.
June 2017,"Question is if it will void your warranty. And the answer is yes. At least as far as damage that may be related to it, such as the entire drivetrain.The BS about it being ""undetectable"" is just that. That was proven to me firsthand by my service advisor."
June 2017,"I rolled some negative cash from the 320 into this new car, the value of the 320 was falling, and wasn't going to get better."
June 2017,"I had the BMS stage 1 on my 320 and never had an issue, I'm not worrying about the JB4."
June 2017,sounds like the car I would look at later in the year (the service loaner lease part). What did the before tax payment end up being on that?
June 2017,"Warning: the BMS will void your warranty. Unless the dealers have started offering it, which would shock me."
June 2017,"Out with the old and in with the new. It was time to get a new car, my first choice was the Alfa loved how it drove, and for the price hard to beat, but when it came to lease payments, yicks... Basically told the dealer when they were serious about selling the car to call me.Volvo S60, nice car, but the MF and RV is horrible, so I moved on.Acura the dealer wanted to move a car, but wasn't all that thrilled on how it drive, either the 4-6 cylLexus IS, drove well, even though the dealer wanted to move a unit, the RV and MF were high as well as lease payments.MB I don't like the C sedan, even the C43 again they wanted to move a unit but the payments were high. I went with a 2017 330i that was a service loaner, 2500 miles, Drivers assistance package, Premium Package, Nav, heated seats, Apple Car Play, 18: rims. 41K out the door, 2100 out of pocket, for fees, first month, and a small Cap reduction. Have to say BMW has firmed up the standard suspension, to almost perfect, I have the same rims and Rick's GT, however, I have 225-45-18's, Ricks are 225-50-18. This car is light on its feet, the new B48 engine is a Gem, much much quieter than my 320i at idle, it drives like how a BMW should. I'm getting the car coded for added features and installing a BMS JB4 for added power."
June 2017,I'm thinking Acura will be dropping a turbo 4 into the TLX within the next 2 yrs. Honda will have a Turbo 4 in the Accord next year.Infiniti had to dump the VQ V6 it was a thirsty engine but don't understand why they had to go to MB for their engine...
June 2017,"I agree Acura seems to be lost; they gave up on their 3.7 engine, which is strange for Honda/Acura to give up on an engine so quickly. Infinity, while the Q40/50/60S are all heavy cars, they do have a 400 HP Red-Line and 3.0 L turbocharged power-trains. They seem to be making an effort. I thought the 2.0T was an Infinity engine that Mercedes was using. If it is a Mercedes engine that Infinity is using, it does seem like a strange partnership. Acura needs an ILX-S or ILX-R. TLX-S?"
May 2017,Infiniti and Acura are lost for sure... Lexus has at least made the effort with the (ugly?) IS.... They also have the volume es and rx to help the rest of the fleet. Infiniti has 2 highly discounted sedan and suv (pathfinder q) that I guess is the reason Nissan gives them a lifeline. Acura has one real product the MDX. Yes they have a super car which is cool but unfortunately in its current stable you can't look down the line and say it has a real bloodline. The old nsx had the integra r and gsr (had one) to point to.
May 2017,"The big discounts is really because every car magazine panned and they aren't selling. The V6 does not feel like it has 290hp, in Sport+ the transmission does not shift and crisp and sharp as the 4 cyl. Now I will give the seats major props here very comfortable. The car drove with typical Japanese blandness very isolated feeling. Now, there is nothing wrong with that if that is your thing. The dealer I went really wanted me to take a 6cyl w/Tech but didn't see the real value in it. The only difference between a 4 and 6cyl Tech package is the engine and transmission there is not additional equipment in the 6 cyl since more manufacturers add features Honda/Acura does not."
May 2017,"I have not driven a 4 cyl yet, but really liked the 6 cyl I tried. But that is why they make so many different cars. something for (almost) everyone!the big discounts now are thanks to clearing out for the new model. Just curious, but what was so disappointing?"
May 2017,"Went and drove a 4 cyl with Tech and 6 cyl W/ tech and was disappointed. I think Acura is the new Infiniti in which they lost their Mojo. It's sad to see this, it's even sadder that Infiniti has to use German Engines and Transmissions to get the powertrain right... It's even sadder that they are discounting the TLX do much to move them off the lots."
May 2017,TL TLX amazed how Acura got it wrong... Here is the new TLX http://blog.caranddriver.com/fresh-faced-value-2018-acura-tlx-pricing-announced/
May 2017,I really like the TLX. Just fits me well.
May 2017,Local Acura dealers are discounting the TLX 4 cyl with tech 7K. Not too sure if a TLX is a good idea unless you are shopping strictly on price.
May 2017,"When I bought my 2005 Acura TL in late 2004, Acura was on a roll with the best looking car (IMHO, still love that styling) and Infiniti had the G35 which was also a looker and doing well. Fast forward 12 years and Acura has lost it, and so seems has Infiniti, at least in the sporty sedan arena. Audi is resurgent and BMW is treading water/surviving on it's long standing reputation. And I think cars in general are less of an interest than then, with Tesla/electrics, hybrids, Uber, Lyft all competing for transportation, along with gadgets and the internet for people's cash."
May 2017,At my dealer we take in a lot of the off-lease BMWs and sell them as CPO or CPO Elite cars.
May 2017,If you are talking Mazda 3 I agree. Infiniti doesn't want it's used cars back. (I would guess BMW is similar) http://www.startribune.com/flood-of-off-lease-used-cars-push-prices-down-upend-market/424537303/
May 2017,"Yeah, it doesn't compare. it has surpassed the 3."
May 2017,"While I agree Acura has become Buick - don't get me going on them- Infiniti has become even more irrelevant. While Acura has the MDX, Infiniti has zero products that are upper third (half) of any category in Luxury market. They used to have the g sedan and coupe (something Acura and Lexus forgot about) that actually sold and could compare to BMW 3."
May 2017,"I think even Honda fans will Admit that there's a reason Acura can't get much more than 90% of MSRP on their sedans the last decade or so though. Combination of overpriced and under-delivering in my opinion. Acura needs it mojo back. I think Infinity is the new Honda/Acura, and Honda/Acura has become Buick.Maybe the new Civic Si, Type R, and NSX will prove me wrong, but the NSX is a niche product."
May 2017,If I was in the market now the TLX with technology 4 or V6 would be high on my list. I have been very pleased with Honda products.
May 2017,Seems acura got out of the sedan/car biz for what seems 10 years ... Maybe more. They used to compete vs Lexus. Now it seems Buick.
May 2017,"I had my eye on the TLX all along. Though I did kinda forget about it there for a while, but now back on the list. At least the wife likes it a lot too, which of course will make my life more pleasant!"
May 2017,Already did......
May 2017,"Acura got out of the sporty/hot car deal a while ago. And they do have a Civic and CRV (ILX and RDX). They are both just ready to be replaced. For the last models, they followed about 6-12 months after the Honda doner car was redesigned."
May 2017,"Andres3 - yes no issues yet and I enjoy it a great deal. Was told I need new summer tires soon which will be expensive. The sales numbers quoted above are they m/m or y/y for a said month? TLX awd at somewhere near 35k is a scream - styling aside as someone said rock solid cars. Have to feel bad for Acura- it seems Honda is leaving all the good stuff (save for nsx) under the Honda umbrella. Cr-v, New civic - civic si - and type r - never hear anything about Acura. do they ever advertise there sedans ?"
May 2017,You'll be fine. The B8.5 S4 is one of the finest cars ever made. Find a good indy shop for the services. My TTS was quoted $450 (w/ DSG) for the 35K service. I imagine the S4 would be within 10% of that at most.I can't imagine (if you've had no issues the first 37K miles) that you'll have any issues the next 37K miles.
May 2017,Don't say it's so
May 2017,"Agreed. That said, dealers are going to try to hold to MSRP on the '18s for as long as they can. I might look at them this time next year. But, for right now, a $45K '17 TLX SH-AWD ADVANCE would probably be in the realm of $35-$36K. The 4 cyl would probably be close, or maybe even below $30K. Both would be a screaming deal on a fun, reliable car."
May 2017,"I drove a 2015, with about 30k on it. Trans seemed fine. The 2018s hit in June I think per salesguy. If I was buying now, would jump on a 4 cyl tech with all the incentives. Maybe the 18s are worth waiting for, but who knows what the deals will be like at year end."
May 2017,"Driven the TLX a couple of times (V6). If those incentives were going on when I was looking, my choice might have been different (ended up with a Q50 3.0T, which I like quite a bit). While only test drives, I never experienced the untoward behavior of the 9-speed transmission in the V6 TLX that others reported. That said, the ones I drove were all in the last 18 mos, and perhaps Acura addressed those issues.Be interested in the '18 TLX to see if they tweaked more than just the styling."
May 2017,$5500
May 2017,Wow. What are the incentives on the 4-cylinder TLX?
May 2017,Has Acura fixed the transmission issues on the TLX V-6 model?
May 2017,Should be able to do better than that.. $6250 of incentives on the V-6 model.
May 2017,"Entry-level luxury sales for April:C-Class 7,821 +38.5% TLX 5,258 +44.5% 3series 3,494 -25.4% ES 3,400 -20.5% A4 3,246 +8.8% MKZ 2,658 +24.8% Q50 2,559 -30.3% IS 2,154 -15.7% LaCrosse 1,983 +9.4% ATS 1,405 -19.1% Seems like Acura probably has major incentives on the previously slow-selling TLX. It sold more than the BMW 3-series!? A refreshed 2018 TLX is coming out in a few months iirc."
May 2017,The deals on the TLX are supposed to be very nice right now. I've heard it's possible to get as much as $7k off of list on the V-6 model.
May 2017,"I assume it counts, but last week I test drove a V6 TLX advance. It was very nice."
May 2017,"Two people drive this board, and you're one of them. Welcome back."
May 2017,Wow haven't been here since February - and well nothing has changed - update 2013 s4 warrantee just expired - so 4 year old Audi 37k miles (remember I bot it 10 months old with 14k). Do I trade it for a CPO? Buy a new one? Or keep it (love it) knowing the service bell will be ringing at some point around 40k? Help needed
February 2017,Dealership service rates have gone mad.
February 2017,I'm back..... Noticed this forum still going which is nice to see.. Update 2013 B8.5 s4 now has 35k miles. No problems thus far with just routine maintenance to report along with one quarter panel needed to be replaced after the neighbor backed into it last feb. Just recently had the 35k service done which also included a transmission flush and filter replacement. Funny thing about Audi service they don't advertise Audi care - which you can bundle 2 10k services for 800 bux. Not cheap but considering the 35k service alone I was quoted 900 - and that's just for One service. Car performs great in all weather - snow tires are a huge plus for this car up north and make it unstoppable while moving just don't try to get it thru a snow bank more the 8 inches
January 2017,"If you recently sold or traded in a BMW for a Mercedes, Jaguar, Volvo, Audi or Cadillac vehicle, a reporter would be interested in speaking with you about your experience. Please send a note to PR@Edmunds.com no later than 5 p.m. EST on Tuesday, Jan. 31, 2017. Thanks!"
January 2017,We sat in one at the car show. It was a nice impressive package. My wife loved it a lot.
January 2017,"I personally love Mercedes C-Class. Besides its prestigious status, this sedan is spacious and very easy to drive."
January 2017,They should handle it like software versions. You could be driving an E36.2.2!
January 2017,"Year ranges are fine, but can be tricky, when certain model variations carry longer than others. Example: 2012 328 sedan was F30, but all other bodies were still E9x, like my wagon. IIRC 3-series convertible carried all through 2013, before being replaced by 2014 F3x 4-series."
January 2017,"Audi Club guys like to refer to their A4's and S4's as B5 or B6, or B7, or B8, or now B9 A4's and S4's.Personally, I think it's easier to remember date ranges for a model, like '10-'16 A4's and S4's are either B8 or get this; B8.5"
January 2017,"That's SOP for Munich, every extensive redesign is followed by a more conservative replacement. See: E12, E28, E34, E39, E60, F10. The G30 is the low key model transformation."
January 2017,"Because now every permutation gets a new number. The E36 code covered every 3 Series body style as well as the M3 and Z3. Now, each body style and M car gets its own number. It's just silly."
January 2017,"While I'm sure the drive is much better, I hope the interior is more revolutionary than evolutionary in change than the exterior."
January 2017,"How can the E codes be good for BMW for 40 years, but it only took 10 years to blow through the F codes, and now it's G?"
January 2017,That is them.
January 2017,"Are those the ""new"" 5-series introduced at NAIAS earlier this month?"
January 2017,"That's a very nice good-looking blue on the BMW 5-Series. If Kia's blue on the Optima was more like that and less Purple/Violet, I'd have selected it!"
January 2017,Now those are some sticky tires!
January 2017,Why were you doing head/handstands when you took those pics?
January 2017,We just got our first two G30s- a 540i xDrive M Sport and a 530i xDrive Sport Line(shown below). I've driven the 530i and I like it MUCH better than any F10 I have driven. The car feels a lot faster than I expected. It's still a bit too big for my tastes but it's really an impressive drive.
December 2016,"Not much talk in the last 2 months..BMW has finally released the prices of the new 5 series, as I figured the base MSRP for the 530i went up 1 grand. It appears that is across the board, pricing guides and ordering guide will not be released until after the Detriot Auto show where the car will shown.http://www.bimmerfest.com/forums/showthread.php?t=957126"
October 2016,"I've heard of and looked at them briefly. I believe I looked closely at a S60R that seemed on paper like a pretty close competitor to the S4. Unfortunately, I think it is more like an A4 competitor. It just doesn't win on any specification. And then I believe I saw that they put some rather small skinny 225 or 235 rubber tires on it (not 100% sure which on as it was a while ago). Base S4 starts at 245, with the upgrade wheel using 255. My wife's Sportwagen has 225. That's not a deal breaker as I like after-market wheels anyway, but to me it is a sign of how the engineer's really feel about the performance of their vehicle. Now, I hope some auto exec doesn't read this and start a tire size war."
October 2016,"@stever....if you bring some Edmunds Shwag with you, I'll let you camp out on my porch, but only if you hand our candy tonight to all the little terrors.....er.....angelic little children!"
October 2016,"XC60 is still only one line. That's the thing - most dealers didn't even stock R-line trims, so one wouldn't know about their existence without more extensive research. The salesman told me it's getting a little better after acquisition of Polestar, but will surely take time to get any following. Plus, those are much more risky models to stock, more expensive low volumes. Regarding engines, everybody does strange stuff with engines today. Tripple scrollers, super/turbo charger mixes, batteries. It's just fact of life, especially on European brands."
October 2016,"We looked at Volvo the XC60, at the time the tickets were only coach, I'm not sold on the supercharge and turbo charged engine. I like the S90 but they need more then a 4 cyl."
October 2016,It broke already.
October 2016,"I just stumbled on a great ELLPS - Volvo S60/V60 R-Design trim. 305 horses, very nice cabin, all goodies included, around 50 grand sticker. Just drove one, nice steering feedback, better than first intallment on F3x 3-series (improved by now, but still), nice suspension. Drives as well as my 328, it is a bit faster, AWD. Looks good, too. Lots of value. I may be really tempted to save some money versus 440 Grand Coupe, or even 430. Volvo always has some good incentives, or I could also take Overseas Delivery, which doesn't have them, but you get two ticketsvticket on Premium Economy with SAS (4 grand value, I know for a fact), full concierge experience in Goetynburgh and hotel stay. That's more than BMW's ED. Nobody thinks of Volvo in terms of performance, cause their base trims are targeting different audience and focus on family and fuel economy. They've always had performance trims, but no marketing behind them, therefore nobody knows about those."
October 2016,"Ha, see if I mail you any more Edmunds pens."
October 2016,"I have accommodation in three of those, but I'm not sharing....but there's probably a couch for you in Santa Monica."
October 2016,"I'm looking for accommodations in Manhattan, Aspen, Malibu.... Oh, and San Fran."
October 2016,Contact @Edmunds they put @stever in charge of Mugs / shirts / buttons. If you agree to put him up for the weekend he'll drive it to you
October 2016,Well I'm just over 5K and I aint seen no stinkin' mug or tee shirt!
October 2016,That's up to BMW NA; I'd think that the information will be released in the very near future- but I'm just guessing.
October 2016,"We went and looked at the new C coupe and while at the dealership looked at the GLC impressed with both, a big upgrade over the GLK. 50K seems to be the price for a well equipped SUV."
October 2016,"When we were looking for Rick next car, we drive a 2015 RX350, and was very disappointed in it, there was no refinement in that thing. There was no sound deadening, the ride was horrible, and the interior screamed Toyota. The NX we drove was far better but was too small."
October 2016,But you can't build one on BMW website and the pricing guide has not been released.
October 2016,"The BMW you owned didn't have the N63 engine, this could be one reason for no issues."
October 2016,Actually I just looked at my spread sheet the 17 GLC I priced was invoiced at 51k.
October 2016,"GLC is high on my wifes new ride list. I priced a 2017 w leather, premium pck, Sport pck,, heads up display and upgrade surround sound. Pricey at 50k. The Selenite grey which we both like was a $720 color option.@Qbrozen Sat in the newer model GLK cant get comfortable at almost 6'2. Did find the 2016 Ford Edge to be comfortable with plenty of ft room/ hip room. Have never drove one thou. Plan on taking mrs brian125 for a few more pit stops before deciding on something for her. She liked so far X-3, MDX, GLC, Highlander"
October 2016,I found the GLC to be a nice upgrade over the GLK comfort and interior wise. I would be real happy with one of those. Not that it will be in my budget for a long time.
October 2016,"2013 GLK, and I think 2010? Rx350. I was really disappointed in the Lexus. Although the interior was nice, it drove/felt like a much cheaper vehicle. GLK drove great but I just could not get comfortable in it."
October 2016,Only if it comes with a fine bottle of Scotch
October 2016,"No, everyone (I think) got sent back to 2001 with the software switch. (and if you really want a mug, send me a PM with an address....)"
October 2016,And yes I lost 3yrs off my 2001 start date to. I might of had a different name thou?
October 2016,@steverI heard Isellhondas lost his Edmunds 19yr retirement badges and 80k posts . Think he would mine if I stole 4 more of his now 10 posts onto my column so I could get my Edmunds 5k comments mug and tee shirt.

October 2016,"Looks like they shuffled the line up inside but yes when you walk in you see these beautiful A/S8, RS7's, TT, Q7's , SQ5's scroll down on my pic of the dealership showroom floor. The line has changed or this is when they 1st opened. Last I was in there they has a red and silver TT side by side. Sharp and sharper.http://www.dealerrater.com/dealer/Ray-Catena-Audi-Freehold-review-105122/"
October 2016,"Let me guess, an A8, an S8, and an R8?"
October 2016,"Q what years did you test drive ? which did you like better  I was in the Audi dealership in Freehold last month . Its the largest Audi showroom in the country. Rows and rows of Audi's on display . 100k, 120 k, 130k plus on these vehicles window stickers."
October 2016,That's sad. There is a handsome looking black 750 iL that I saw last week pulling away from a stop light belching blue smoke out the exhaust. It reminded me of my Vega years ago.
October 2016,I am. He's got a couple of places in Freehold that I have been to. I test drove the RX350 and GLK350 at the Benz and Lexus dealers there within the past couple of weeks. Salesguy at the Lexus dealer was very very good.
October 2016,@roadburner are you familiar with the Ray Catena auto group out in NJ. Ray's got some auto business out here. I know him for over 30 years met him when he had a small dealership in NJ Cox Cheverlot . We've been good friends ever since. This guy is a sweetheart compared to the ruthless owners out there with his kind of $$$. I joke with him all the time about how much work and money is enough. He's got to be worth close to a BIL. His land Rover brand has a lot of problems with customer complaints and defects. .
October 2016,Will do!
October 2016,Tks @roadburner post thoughts after your 1st test drive. I have a golf buddy interested next year when he comes out of his lease
October 2016,"I rode in an uber early Thursday morning on my way to the airport. The car was a black Hyundai Genesis, an older model but I couldn't tell how old but what impressed me was it had 139k miles on it and was smooth and quiet as a new car. I was impressed with the ride given the amount of miles."
October 2016,The G30 5er can be ordered immediately. Our earliest build date is week 51.
October 2016,Wow you really dodged a bullet on the 7 Series....good for you!
October 2016,I will find out and post it.
October 2016,"I can honestly say I had a good run with limited problems with my 2 older bought new Bmw 750's ( 95, 2000 ) and now on my 3rd X-5 ( 08,12,16)"
October 2016,"YOU want info on the N63 engine issues Read thisand ThisLots of info on the problems, the issue with the N63 happens with the X5 50i, 650, 750's. It will be interesting to see what BMW has done with the G30 and the engine."
October 2016,I like the color combo on this X5 / mhttps://www.dubicars.com/2016-bmw-x5-m-x-drive-50i-56147.html
October 2016,"Tks............ My next oil change going to ask the service mgr. I know for years about any recent issue's. Sons looking to buy a 2017@roadburner.......... Agreed about The M sport X-5 x-drive 50i . I wanted to buy one but 1st problem was My wife's ML350 is fast approaching 50k looking to dump it soon .  2nd reason was If I had some balls in my senior years I'd a bought one.  Like the old saying goes a happy Wife is a happy life. I could just hear her saying every time she got in the M X5, 50i........................ Do you know what we could do with that extra $$$.. ?"
October 2016,When can people start to order the G30?
October 2016,The 550i with the n63TU engine has known issues stay away from them even though the N63Tu is the updated version of the N63 engine it still has problems. Its a great car but the engine has known issues.The S6 has gotten great reviews.
October 2016,I just confirmed the info with my NCM; our center isn't expected to see a G30 until late January.
October 2016,"I was under the impression that all Dealers were getting 2 G30's as demo now, I like the concept of the 550i but that engine just has too many issue for me to spend 80K and have it break down like they have. What I like about the G30 is now the 530i will get the M sport Suspension in the M Sport Package as standard equipment, that was a big mistake with the F10."
October 2016,"The 550i is nice enough, I just find the F10 too soft for my tastes. I think I'd rather have an M Sport X5 xDrive50i. I still think that the 340i is the sweet spot- for BMW sedans at any rate.We don't expect to see any G30 5ers at our center until late January at the earliest- and those will all be in either 530i or 540i trim. The M550i xDrive will be offered a bit later- it sounds intriguing."
October 2016,The G90 reviews on Edmunds (old Euuis ) are not as good as the G80. Any body have any behind the wheel time on below 16 / 2017 vehicles. Looking for any negatives before I test drive ? 1- E4002- S63-550i
October 2016,"We had a first Gen Genesee and liked it, and with the improvements of the new gen I can see sales being taken away from Lexus and MB."
October 2016,"I'd buy the G80 over the G90 (Old Equus model ) Its a better buy for the money.  Genesis is a great bang for your buck and will pamper you with many amenities in the 42 to 52k price range. What I liked about the new model is the warranty, Largest car in its class. , ultra quiet ride, radio, 3 mode suspension, command center and large screen, everything inside is laid out nice and easy to use. The new redesign / wheels look terrible. Its a perfect vehicle for folks who want a steady ride and could care less about brand or how uninspiring this vehicle seems when driven like the Audi , Bmw, or MB. Genesis 429 h/p and 9 spd trans works well in this vehicle. I call this new Genesis ( G80 ) the upper class large family sedan bargain . The Camry XSE V-6 will take some sales away from the Honda Accord. I had a 13 Accord V-6 for 1yr. Very nice vehicle. Next time I'm at the Mb dealership going to test drive the a 17 550i then hopefully at Audi there's a S6 to compare."
October 2016,Here are some interesting articles.2016 Cadillac CT6 3.6 AWD2017 Genesis G90 5.0 V-82017 Toyota Camry XSE V-62016 BMW i8
October 2016,"I highly doubt the 530i will start at 60K, that is almost 10K more than the 2016 528i, and over 5K more then a 2017 E350. Since pricing hasn't been released I'm thinking base price for a 530i will be close to 53-55K. The standard equipment list for the 530i is impressive.Here is an article about the new 5 series."
October 2016,"I like Harmon other wise known as HK. Don't think they should drop the Kardon part. My previous receiver which I still have is an HK. I'm keeping it because they don't make receivers like the two I own anymore. When the Denon konks out I'll switch back to the HK. Heck, I might switch out yearly just for the fun of it. Biggest advantage the newer Denon has is the ability to read FLAC files. Other then that, the HK is perfect and probably superior despite the fact it's made in China ."
October 2016,andres3 I'll tell you what my Lexicon 7.1 surround sound 17 speaker w/ amp in my Genesis is a top notch system. I believe Harmon bought the Lexicon brand a few years back.
October 2016,"Yeah, see, they don't trust us filthy Americans with their best stuff. Denon makes all of their home audio receivers in China. However, one exception, their flagship a few years back which is my current Denon Receiver is made in Japan. Denon AVR-4520CI home theater receiver.http://www.crutchfield.com/p_033AV4520C/Denon-AVR-4520CI.html?tp=179OK, bragging over."
October 2016,Its K..............assuming that means Korea???????
October 2016,"What's the first letter and/or number on the VIN for your Genesis; that'll tell us the answer, at least in 2013."
October 2016,I know Hyundai has a plant in Montgomery but I'm guessing the Genesis is being made in South Korea. Just a guess thou. I know there were talks to assembly here last year don't know much more .
October 2016,Curious if you know if the Genesis/Cadenza's are made in the USA like the Optima. Usually manufacturer's make their flagship where quality matters more than lowest bidder.
October 2016,"All good facts and info . Another thing I forgot to mention was Tesla sells on 2 Lux cars. BMW 7 series is once again a contender and not a pretender. The 2017 BMW 5 series is said to be the Jr. version of the new 7. It will have most of the 7's new tech including Remote parking , Gesture control, Apple CarPlay, 4G LTE with WiFi, upgraded motor and shed close to 130 pounds.The 530i will Start at 60k . The 540i , 3.0............. 335 h/p 8 spd Trans should be a fun ride. Cant wait to go test drive it. I'd love to get another 2017..... 7er.................. but not willing to drop 100k at this point in my life.I test drove the new G80 Genesis . Excellent all around vehicle without the fun factor of driving a S6, or BMW 550. The problem with this new G80 is.... looks to much like a Sonata from the back for 55k. If you could get over the looks of this G80 / G90 vehicle it will pamper you with its amenity's. The 429 h/p , 9spd Trans is superb. The 3 mode upgraded suspension proves to be what this model was needing a few years back.............................. What a bang for your buck Go test drive this model if you have the chance ...................... Hell of a job by Hyundai."
October 2016,"and this..Mercedes-Benz extended its lead in a race with BMW for the luxury-car sales crown, as a series of new models position it to overtake its rival for the first time in a decade.A jump in deliveries of SUVs and crossovers helped Mercedes increase sales almost twice as fast as BMW in the first nine months, expanding the Daimler AG unit's lead to 57,985 cars, according to data released by the manufacturers.Mercedes is poised to achieve its 2020 target of unseating BMW AG's namesake brand as the world's biggest seller of premium vehicles already this year, Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche said this week, which would put Mercedes back on top for the first time since 2005.Mercedes is winning over customers with a recently updated lineup of trendy models that appeal to younger buyers, including the GLC coupe and compact GLA sport utility vehicle.BMW is responding with a revamp of its 5-Series business sedan to rival Mercedes's popular E-Class, adding new self-driving features that control speed, help drivers stay in lane and keep distance to nearby cars.The 5-Series, set to hit showrooms in February, will range from a four-cylinder hybrid plug-in that can drive 45 kilometers on a single charge, to a more powerful eight-cylinder gasoline version, BMW said in a statement on Thursday.The car is critical for BMW after an overhaul of its top-of-the-line 7-Series sedan received a muted response.BMW has downplayed the impending loss of the No. 1 spot, shifting its view to maximizing profit and fund investments in new technologies.""Profitability remains our primary focus,"" BMW's head of sales Ian Robertson said in a statement on Thursday.New entrantsLuxury-car makers are racing to compete on self-driving innovations while also having to spend more on developing electric cars to meet increasingly tough emissions regulation.BMW, Mercedes and Volkswagen AG's Audi brand last month outlined a major push into electric cars, which will add to their research-and-development costs. After hiking investment in plants, equipment and new technology from a peak this year, Daimler plans to rein back spending in the years ahead, CEO Zetsche said this week.BMW's global deliveries rose 9.4 percent to 197,419 cars in September, boosting the nine-month total by 6 percent to 1.48 million vehicles, the company said in a statement.By comparison, Mercedes's sales jumped 12.1 percent to 211,286 vehicles in September, lifting the total by 11.7 percent to 1.54 million, according to a separate statement. Audi slipped further back in third place with year-to-date deliveries of 1.41 million cars, a 4.5 percent gain.Contact Automotive News"
October 2016,"Was checking out Tesla's last week. What a sharp Car... In the last quarter, Tesla sold 9,156 examples of the Model S. Mercedes sold 4,921 S-Classes, and the BMW 7 Series came in third with 3,634 units sold. That puts Tesla's share of the segment, which includes 12 different vehicles, at 32 percent. It's by and large the king of this segment, helped by a 59 percent year-over-year improvement. The Tesla S is a beautiful vehicle very classy and luxurious. Shame its range is useless in my world."
September 2016,"Funny thing; one of our most successful client advisors is an attorney who retired from a large well-respected Louisville law firm. As you might expect, his client base is heavily populated with attorneys. I delivered a 440i convertible to one of his clients who had bought himself the car for a retirement present; he had been a top notch criminal defense attorney and as we walked out to the car he asked, ""Are you as glad to be out of the legal field as much as I am?"""
September 2016,"Here is a deal someone posted on Bimmerfest.How's this deal?2016 340i - Black sapphire exterior with the coral red interior. M Sport package, tech package, cold weather package, Driver assistance package. MSRP: $59515Selling Price: $54230. Thats about 9% off MSRP. Sales rep said it was $1k below invoice MF 0.00088 with 3.5K in MSDs1.5k in taxes, $925 acq fee, misc dmv fees, luxury tax, and first payment = another 3.5kterm 10k/36: 0.66 Residual Monthly: $497So basically his payment is $497 so you round up to the nearest 50, so that would be $500x7 = 3500. This loweres your MF down.Hope this helps."
September 2016,"This page gives a pretty good overview. I just returned from the mandatory one week instructor led training; there's a strong emphasis on product knowledge as well as how to relate to the clients that we work with. I don't fit the typical genius profile due to the fact that I'm retired from my ""real"" job and thus I'm considerably older; In my class of twenty the next oldest person was about ten years younger than me and the rest were in their early to mid twenties. In addition; I have no interest in a promotion to client advisor or service advisor- although I did ""sell"" a CPO i3 yesterday in that I conducted the presentation and evaluation drive so that the client advisor was able to close the deal in just a few minutes."
September 2016,"On Bimmerfest I'm seeing people posting leases on a i3REX for $189/m That is with max MSD's and min down (tax, Doc, 1st pmt)"
September 2016,"If the lease payment is $350, then $2450 total."
September 2016,"I leased a 2011 Z4 service loaner for $335/mo, all in. Seven MSDs were $2450. Save $46/mo. on a 24 month lease. (insanely cheap lease... original MSRP of $55K)Leased a 2011 Infiniti G37 for $378/mo., all in. Nine MSDs were $4050. (Infiniti uses the pre-discounted MF payment to assess the security deposit amount). Saved $61/mo. on a 36 month lease."
September 2016,"So, couple thousand?"
September 2016,"It's the monthly payment rounded up to the next $50 increment times 7.So, if you already have a super-cheap employee lease deal, the amount won't be very high.And, refundable, of course, so the only thing you are giving up is opportunity cost on the money."
September 2016,What do the max MSDs total out as?
September 2016,"Some programs are anomalies and counter-intuitive.MSDs just happen to be one of those programs. It's a net win for the customer, every time. It's overly generous for the amount of capital you have to put up. (so, don't tell anyone.. lol)"
September 2016,"You must be a judge, or at least, a lawyer."
September 2016,So what qualifications does one need to be a genius at a BMW store?
September 2016,Yep; I could also get a 2016 M3 lease on the same terms for about $600/month.
September 2016,"Yeah, I figured you could score an amazing lease deal as an employee. That's a $50k car, right?"
September 2016,"If I max out the MSDs I can get a 24 month/10,000 miles per year lease on a 2016 i3 REX for less than $90 per month with no money down."
September 2016,It's kind of like collateral.  Less risk for lender equals a liitle lower rate in addition to use of funds.
September 2016,"Like in every transaction, both sides get a benefit, or they at least think they do, since it's voluntary. Here, the lesee exchanges cash for lower cost of borrowing (money factor, by extension lower payment). In some way, it's similar to points on mortgage, but temporary, not permanent.The lessor's benefit is cash today, which they can dispose as they see fit. Being a financial intitution, they are allowed to leverage that money to raise even more funds. Another benefit is more general, i.e. possible increase in product sales. Notice it's offered only by financial arms of some manufacturers."
September 2016,"Ah, so they get the ""float"". I suppose if their money rate is 2.5%, then they can beat that by investing your money elsewhere. MSDs weren't created for the benefit of mankind. I was just curious where the profit was."
September 2016,The leasing company gets the use of the MSD funds for the duration of the lease. Add it up and you can make a decent amount of money if you invest it right.
September 2016,"So who does it benefit, is what I'm asking? Why create a system that makes less profit?"
September 2016,"The benefit isn't to the leasing company, and those who understand leasing and can negotiate well, can get a better deal with the MSD, then without."
September 2016,And the benefits to the leasing company are what exactly?....that you get someone to lease who might not have? Or get them into a more expensive lease rather than the one they first chose prior to the MSD bait?
September 2016,"MSD's mean Multi Security Deposits, we are taught that when leasing one should never put any money down. However, with MSD, you are basically buying down the money factor (APR) of the lease, which means lowerimg your monthly payment. At the end of your lease you will get your MSD's back or if you want and lease another BMW you can roll the MSD's into your new lease. The added saving for a typical 3 yr lease is about $1900."
September 2016,Multiple security deposits
September 2016,"Might sound dumb, but what are MSD'S? Have no clue what these are since we've never leased. Please educate me on these.The Sandman"
September 2016,"So what has happened to everybody?Here is a review of the new MB E43, I like how MB is offering a AMG without the high strung V8..http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2017-mercedes-amg-e43-first-drive-review"

August 2016,"Hey, I resemble that remark!And, @brian125, I have a lease that is coming due, so I will almost certainly be in the market at that time. At the moment, just spitballing ideas over in CCBA."
August 2016,"Well, can, and would, are not the same thing.Ands what's wrong with a short attention span!"
August 2016,"I bet if you guys stop going threw cars like I do underwear you can buy a 60k vehicle.  Last time I checked the Chronic Car buyers Rehab forum @nyccarguy, @stickguy, @micheall, wanted and probably got talked out of buying about 5 different vehicles they like that day. Today was a whole different round of pleasures. Carry on"
August 2016,True enough.
August 2016,"my budget, your budget, & @stickguy's budget - still out"
August 2016,What does a well-used Phateon go for these days? Lol.
August 2016,My neighbor just bought a loaded 2016 V-6 Genesis . The new electronic 3 mode suspension is Eon's better than my 13 R-Spec Genesis. She is coming out of a 2012 E350. She loves the Genesis . I have 15k on mine and really enjoy this 429 h/p RWD model. Hyundai's 17 speaker 7.1 surround sound Lexicon system is special. Maybe a tab below the Levinson or Acura's ELS system. . I would consider buying a left over 2017 or CPO at the end of 2017. I would go for the V-6 that's plenty fast for me these days
August 2016,"well, I do like to think of myself as a trend setter. So maybe if I offer to put a decal on it, and talk it up here?"
August 2016,"I'm guessing they will depreciate heavily, so if you want one, just hang out a few years."
August 2016,I can't see why they would turn that deal down!
August 2016,"well yeah, unless they want to lease me one for $300/mo. S&D, just to get some on the road."
August 2016,"And, with a starting price north of $60K, probably out of your budget, too."
August 2016,quite a large boat. Definitely won't be on my shopping list.
August 2016,"So here is the first car from Hyundai new product line Genesis, impressive, but I think they have missed the mark on a few things, some of the switch gear looks like it came from an accent.. http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2017-genesis-g90-first-drive-review?mag=cdb&list=nl_dvr_news&src=nl&date=081716"

August 2016,"The issue is, a non-related entity could also offer authorized service, at least in theory. Service does not have to be tied to sales. In this case, a Buick dealer could offer Cadillac service in small town. Or even it could be an completely independent provider, as long as the certification process is transparent and demanding enough. Unless there are some franchise laws, preventing such decoupling. Looking what kind of BS Tesla faced in some states, you never know."
August 2016,"My BMW dealer is setting up a satellite location to sell and service CPO cars- although service for other BMWs will still be offered there, the focus will be on CPO cars."
August 2016,"I have always maintained Cadillac's dealer network is waaaay too big and does not fit a premium image they want to project. In small and midsize towns, local Chevy or Buick dealer also got a Caddy franchise, so they could sell them to small local business people and their families - model that worked in 70s, when German competition was small and super-exquisite (Benz only sold what today would have been loaded E-class or up, at price point equivalent to today's S-Class) and Japanese brands were literally non-existent. In today's world with all-out competition in premium at all levels, it simply doesn't cut it - the accessibility is a good thing, but in today's reality it collides too much with exclusivity they wish to project. They'd do better if they pulled sales franchises from those weak dealers, but supplied them with authorized service licenses. Essentially, you buy your Caddy in a big showroom, comparable to those of MB, BMW, or Lexus, in a nearby big city, but can service it at a local Buick dealer garage, provided it passes the necessary requirements. That model might actually work. In Europe they generally have denser authorized service network than sales. American model somehow is such that if you want to service a brand, you have to sell it, too. No real reason for that, other than ""tradition""."
August 2016,Auto dealers have a huge of influence at the state and Federal level. For better or worse it makes it difficult for automakers to bring their dealers to heel.
August 2016,Maybe that's Cadillac's intent....to cut away more marginal dealers who can't/won't offer a higher level of customer service.
August 2016,"http://www.autonews.com/article/20160808/RETAIL07/308089966/dealer-groups-open-fire-on-cadillac-retail-plan""Some state dealer groups are demanding that Cadillac scrap its controversial new dealer-incentive program, Project Pinnacle, claiming brand chief Johan de Nysschen's vision for transforming the retail network would violate franchise agreements and intentionally cull smaller stores.In a sharply worded letter to de Nysschen dated Aug. 3 and obtained by Automotive News, seven state dealer association heads say Project Pinnacle would create several tiers of ""effective pricing,"" as Cad-illac funnels a disproportionate amount of money to larger, urban stores that are better able to make pricey investments in services such as complimentary roadside assistance.Project Pinnacle ""picks winners and losers,"" the letter says. ""The winners can make the required investments and prosper. The other dealers face business failure.""(more at the link)"

July 2016,Probably just as bad today if not worse.
July 2016,"I remember that Forbes, some time ago, did a survey asking American families if they would go into crisis if one month's salary failed to arrive. The response was very unsettling."
July 2016,"Right is right, that's why I wrote ""too judgmental"". Anyway, one can do whatever they want, but I can also voice my opinion about the action. I just don't want to hear their complaints about Bush, Obama, bankers, Wall Street, or global warming next time their life and income prospects turn less then anticipated.BTW, last thing a 23 yo needs is 340i, but surely if they want to spend their ćurrent and future last dime, nobody other than their family or loving friends, should stop them. Surely not BMWFS, as long ad they meet the criteria. That much I agree."
July 2016,"According to Edmunds.com, the average monthly payment on a new vehicle is $479. IF one wanted to make money on about 4K, one would use MSD's and save $50/m which is about 1900 on a three year lease. I can tell you one could get a nice 528i for $480/m with the currently RV that BMWFS is giving..."
July 2016,What is the average monthly car payment nationwide? For both leases and buyers? I bet it wouldn't take a year of saving car payments to save up that $4K for most people.
July 2016,"This is true, however, there are people who don't have 4K sitting around in a bank."
July 2016,"MB has MSD, but they aren't offered in all states, just like Audi as well as BMW.Jag currently does not offer that since all preferred leases go through Chase. I'm sure once Jag sets up a bank here in the states, they will offer MSD's."
July 2016,"Dino it is being judgmental, but many people would agree with you, on BF some 23 yr old out of college wanting to lease a new 340i, his payments are $600/m cough.... Should he have gotten that car, no, but no one was going to stop him, and BMWFS sure wasn't.. The average saving is roughly $1900 on a course of a lease, however, to really save that money one needs to take that $50 you save a month and place it into a saving account so at the end of that 3 yr lease you have that money."
July 2016,You would be foolish to lease one of these brands and not take full advantage of the savings. Depending on the MB dealer most are supported who offer MSD.
July 2016,Infiniti: 9 MSDs at .00010 each (.00090 total)
July 2016,"Exactly. The problem is, not all manufacturers offer MSD for leases. A quick summary - and I'll let @kyfdx chime in if my information is incorrect.BMW - 7 MSDs at .00007 each - total MF reduction of .00049Audi - 10 MSDs at .00005 each - total MF reduction of .00050Lexus - 9 MSDs at .00008 each - total MF reduction of .00072MB - no hard evidence on this; have had folks report that MSDs are only allowed on unsupported MF (standard MF is .00200 - .00220), but others have said otherwiseNo MSD program for Infiniti or Acura. No information on Jaguar.No MSD programs for any of the domestic brands."
July 2016,"Well, not to sound too ""judgmental"", but I truly think somebody who can't come up with 4 grand, has no business shopping a 50 grand vehicle. This is to me something of category of complaining about premium gas on a luxury car. But that's probably just my weird math sense. Also, it's just plain good savings. Not artificially on payment, like cap cost reduction, but real savings on total amount of money paid out of your pocket. If you do math correctly, that 0.00049 MF on 50K car with 25K residual (not so great one) saves you 0.00049*(50K+25K) times 36 (typical 36 month lease with not-so-hot residual) is 1300, give or take, more if the residual is higher. Who would pay you 1300-1500 bucks on 4 grand over three years??? It's probably one of the best guaranteed rate of return in zero-interest environment (adjusted for risk, of course). It of course is not a real rate of return, just savings in interest charges (or their equivalents in lease). If you lease, MSD is the way to go, period. There are no excuses. The lower payment is just a side benefit."
July 2016,"That's correct on a BMW, just take one zero out of each number. .00007 and .00049Also correct on having someone assume your lease. They have to reimburse you for the MSDs."
July 2016,If I remember correctly. Buying 1 MSD point down up to Seven is .000007 going to 000049 on the MF. The only Cons I see is coming up with the extra cash. If your car is totaled or stolen that money is still secure. If you flip your vehicle before lease is up who ever assumes it has to pay you your MSD money. Where can you make 1500 to 2000 dollars profit on that initial upfront investment in 3 yrs?? Its a good deal
July 2016,"You get the MSD back at the end of your lease, PLUS save about $50/m on your lease, so that averages out about $1900 on a 3 yr lease. So it's a win/win for you and BMW gets to use the MSD for 3 yrs. You are buying down the money factor of your lease, this where is where you get the saving from."
July 2016,"Yes, this is a great way to lower payments, however, more people don't have an extra 4K sitting around."
July 2016,"Well, the '04+ TL was many great things:1) A Power leader at 270 HP V6 3.2 Standard - In later years that became a 3.5 and 3.7 with good numbers. 2) Was a very good looking sedan with a nice interior.3) Class-leading super modern audio DVD-audio playing music system (that's special and rare). 4) Handled really well.The TLX currently in my opinion is:1) Pretty bland; no visible exhaust either2) A bottom feeder for power with either engine (as compared to the competition). They don't even offer a 3.7 anymore!3) If the Audio systems still plays DVD-A discs I'd be surprised pleasantly, I don't know? I know the '14 TL did still play DVD Audio discs. 4) Handling is adequate but not particularly great."
July 2016,I like seeing old reviews by MotorWeek. Found this one last night. Seems as if Acura's current perceived value issues have deep roots.....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y9mOYz8Y28
July 2016,3 whole years with the same car? Perish the thought.
July 2016,"Not really. Since it's a deposit, you get the money back. Since it lowers the MF, it can be seen as earning interest on the money. So if you take 7xSD, lowering MF on the entire lease amount, you essentially leveraged say 3 grand to reduce interest on say 30-40 grand (average capital cost between purchase and disposition). Translate that money back and you won't get anywhere near interest in a bank, if you keep the money. MSD is nothing like putting money down (cap cost reduction). Not even close. Don't put money down on lease, but MSD - good deal, IMHO."
July 2016,"Sort of... but, you get the money back at lease end. It's too good of a deal to pass up, in most cases. (even if the purpose of a lease is to not tie up a wad of cash)."
July 2016,"Yeah, but doesn't MSD sort of contradict why you lease in the first place?"
July 2016,"Agreed. Plus, the Accord has now started knipping at the heals of the TLX. Acura's cars in their most recent iterations have been hit and miss. ILX, TLX, RLX (especially the RLX) have missed their respective marks, badly.I still like the TLX (and all of my previous TLs). But, given the transmission woes, and that just about every other lux manufacturer out there offers AWD and some sort of torque vectoring system, which was at one time unique to the TL (and some Audis), isn't so unique any more.I know holding the prices on the TLX trasnlates into higher resale value, but it's hurting their sales on the new end.Let's face it, Acura is becoming more an SUV company than a car company."
July 2016,"I think that's it. They thought they could cover both the TL and the TSX market with one car, two different engines, but it's not working."
July 2016,"I think there are multiple things going on when it comes to the weak sales of the TLX. Like you, I think it has good styling, but probably for some it still seems to be a bit bland. The base engine is a very nice 2.4 liter direct-injected model that's a more advanced version of what you get on the Accord. But most competitors have turbo base models that are faster. The 8-speed in-house dual-clutch transmission on the TLX with the 2.4 has gotten mostly good reviews, but the 9-speed that goes with the V-6 has gotten mixed to negative reviews.Acura doesn't seem to get much credit for its high quality, durability, and reliability. And the exotic 4-wheel steering that's standard on the car doesn't seem to help it stand out, but no doubt cost a pretty penny to engineer and put into the car. Finally, the Accord now has AndroidAuto/AppleCarPlay, but the TLX isn't scheduled to get that until the early introduction of the restyled and enhanced TLX that's coming next year as a 2018 model."
July 2016,"Re: the TLX, I had a 2005 TL that I sold recently at 156K miles. The TLX is the newer incarnation of that car, and with the somewhat improved appearance, I'm wondering why it seems the TLX doesn't sell anything like the '04-10-ish one did. I know it got ugly with the beak but it seems that it is at least decent looking now. Has the market changed? Are we just bored with cars now? Or is it the looks as IMHO the TLX is still not as good looking as that vintage TL. It seems those mid-year TLs were everywhere and it was a hot seller, but I don't think so any more. And the ILX seems like even more of a bomb. Poor Acura is not doing so well these days."
July 2016,"In a bit over two months I'll have 90 days in, so I'm hoping BMW FS still has some attractive leases on something I find interesting..."
July 2016,"And if you use MSD to buy down the MF, you can end up with a pretty amazing lease payment."
July 2016,"BMW currently has some insane residual value on leases of 2016 5 series. 67% on 10K/36 month lease, 66% on a 12K/36 and 65% on 15K/36 month,"
July 2016,I am considering it. In 15 months. Not sure it will last that long.
July 2016,"In the unlikely event anyone here would consider an Acura TLX as their entry-level luxury car, right now Edmunds is offering an exclusive $1500 incentive on that car. Once that's applied, I think someone could get a base 2016 TLX for close to the price of an Accord EXL, c. 26k. I considered this option, but ultimately decided the Accord EX was good enough for me, and it can be had for c. 3k less. Anyway, below, I think, is a link for the TLX incentive...http://www.edmunds.com/elp/acura/ilx/offer/?fromIframe=true"
June 2016,So it appears BMW will be bring over a 4 door 2 series for MY2018 I guess they think that segment will growhttp://www.bimmerfest.com/news/919577/want-a-four-door-2-series-check-out-the-next-gen-1-sedan/

June 2016,"Drove a previous generation MB GLK, 2015, today at work. Loved the way it drove though not a big fan of driving a box around. Great engine with shift points that were so unobtrusive, I had to look at the tach a few times to make sure the car was indeed changing gears...totally seemless and quiet, was a real pleasure to drive and would be very happy to have a CPO model as my daily driver. Sure the mpg's are in the toilet but one doesn't purchase any luxury vehicle like this to get econocar gas mileage. Just like the maintenance, one just knows going in that driving these type of vehicles will cost more but it definitely is worth it for anyone who loves the automobile!Just sorry that I didn't get anymore seat time in this puppy as 35 minutes was just not enough time to really get to enjoy it. Should be fun looking for my next vehicle...new or a CPO luxury brand. Since the next will probably be the last, really want something so out of character for me!!The Sandman"
June 2016,"@sweendogy It looks like you might have to wait a bit longer for the '17 S4 to be available, maybe not until '18 models role out. Have you looked into it? If it drops about 250 lbs as advertised, should be a hoot to drive."
June 2016,"I miss Palomar, I always liked the east side best, always had breakfast at Mothers at the top."
June 2016,"Drove up Palomar mountain hauling donkey butt today. At the top met a nice young couple in a '03 Honda S2000 with 95,000 miles that he said he got a couple thousand miles ago for 10 grand. Last of the 9K redline units he said. Bumble bee yellow with black interior, top down. He said it was only 2,500 pounds and was riding on 255/??R17 Enkei lightweight wheels on extreme summer tires. Also saw a Ferrari club arrive just after I did going up the other direction that I chose. Included a McClaren and Maserati in the group. TTS drove great, sort of kart like in the tight winding roads by this great Palomar Mountain. Oil temps never exceeded 232 degrees. What is a too high oil temp anyways? Everything is digital, but at least in the new Audi that has brought back gauges I didn't used to have. Oh, the S2000 owner has an '13 S4 daily driver and his former fun car was a '13 Golf R. He said my TTS was the first ""new"" one he had seen with the redesign this year."
June 2016,my son drove a C class coupe friday. I rode in the back (won't do that again). He was in lust with it. Impressive car if yuo want a 2 door.
June 2016,"So stopped by the MB dealer and looked at the GLC and the new C Class coupe, liked the GLC a big improvement over the GLK it replaced.. Now the car that really blew me away was the new C- coupe looks like a mini S coupe MB had a home run with this car, didn't drive it, just wanted to look at it."
June 2016,"There's something familiar about that styling>2017- Volvo S902016 BMW 650i GCIf you're going to steal, steal from the best."
June 2016,"I like the lines on this S90 looks sharp. love the blue color. I'm not a fan of any 4cyl / turbo in a car this heavy. I'd like to put this S90 up against the 17 Hyundai Genesis. I'd think in the looks dept. Volvo has the Genesis beat. Is there a Air suspension option on the S90 that would help ride quality. These are the things I would look at before buying the S90 Road noise, Interior size, Seat comfort , To firm ride, and depreciation value would be my main concern for this model if I was considering it. The 2016 XC90 ride is way to firm for me and the control / screen system is terrible."
June 2016,Their Series 5 BMW competitor really needed an upgrade like that. The older S80 had a horrendous depreciation rate. Losing 58% of your car's value in 3 years isn't an encouragement to buy.
June 2016,"So here is a short write up on the new Volvo S90, very promising.http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2017-volvo-s90-drive-review?mag=cdb&list=nl_dvr_news&src=nl&date=060816"
June 2016,"Forgot to answer this, I have 47K miles on El Cheapo and never had a mechanical issue with it, of that 39K or so is with the Stage 1."

June 2016,"Yes the N63 (engine code) has had problems and it appears BMW has a fix, the truly sad part really is, Audi and MB both have TT V8 and don't have problems with theirs. I had thought about a 550 in the past but after researching the N63 issues and the factory fix, I'm not totally convinced they have it fixed. Here are a could of threads on Bimmerfest regarding the N63 engine problems.http://www.bimmerfest.com/forums/showthread.php?t=828680http://www.bimmerfest.com/forums/showthread.php?t=817273"
June 2016,@flightnurse - how many miles are on your modified 320i?  Have you had any issues with it (regular or related to the chip)?  Are you still happy with it?
June 2016,"Lol!  I'd have to wait for you & Rick to buy a moderately priced 640i GC X-Drive (my wife prefers blue), and then buy it from you second hand for somewhere less than 50% of the car's original MSRP when you are done with it!I don't completely trust BMW's marvelous twin turbo V8.  I have a friend who had an X5 ///M & an ///M5 (modified with some Dinan goodies).  He had significant engine trouble with both vehicles that the dealer couldn't diagnose.  The cars would go into ""limp mode"" while he was in the middle of accelerating onto the highway."
June 2016,maybe I mixed that up in the alphabet soup. Might have been 4 GC and 3 GT. they don't make it easy to keep straight.
June 2016,"There you go, the stars are trying to tell you to get a 6 series..."
June 2016,"Interesting wasn't aware there was a 4GT, that would have stood out, but then again, 3 series is a sedan and a 4 series is a coupe, they all look alike I guess"
June 2016,@flightnurse - I saw a B6 Alpina Grand Coupe on the way in this AM & an ///M6 Grand Coupe on the way home tonight.
June 2016,"I walked a row at the BMW dealer today (some of their new cars). Had to read the backs to figure out what was what. So many looked not all that much different from each other. 2's at least were coupes. But the 3, 4 GT, GCs, all blurred together.oh, they were expensive too!"
June 2016,Yes they do
June 2016,I don't think it was the heat that caused more like it was on a Friday morning and some people might have to work..
June 2016,"@flightnurse - A few years ago, I drove a BMW 650i Sport Package Equipped Drop Top at a similar event. While the car was beautiful and quite powerful, I looked at the $90K+ Sticker price and said to myself; ""no way."" You are in 911 territory at this price point. Yes a 911 with not too many options, but a 911.I do LOVE the way the 4 series and 6 series Grand Coupes look (even though I think their nomenclature are stupid). They make an ///M6 Grand Coupe, right?"
June 2016,"Couldn't imagine why the masses didn't show up to drive cars in 115 degree heat. Oh wait, maybe I can."
June 2016,"So Friday my local BMW dealer had a driving event, Drive for the Cause, it was held on friday and of course no one was there for it at 11am, so Rick and I had all the cars to ourselves. They had 650i GC, 550i sedan, 4289GC, X1,X3, X5 40e (plug in) they also has a 340i sedan that was a rolling catalog for the M Sport performance parts. I drove only 4 of them, the 650, 550, X5 and X1. First time driving the 650iGC and I loved it, It handled well, was roomy and it didn't look like a typical sedan, it was fully load, M Sport, Executive package, B&O radio and a couple of other options (don't remember what they were) but the TT V8 is a monster, and I would get tickets in it, the 550 was equipped pretty much the same way and I wasn't that happy with it felt bigger and disconnected but then again the TTV8! The X5 40e was a complete surprise it was comfortable to drive, you have a very commanding view of the road, the power train was great never did I feel being between pure elec and gas engine, the 2L gas engine was peppy enough to move the big X5 without much problem, very refined.. The X1 was a big disappointment but after thinking about it for a couple of day, there was no way the X1 was going to impress me or Rick after driving the other 3 cars, the X1 feels like a much lower price car, lots of road noise and tire noise, the ride was bouncey and never felt planted. plus it was much smaller then I thought it was going to be.Rick drove the 428GC that was loaded with M Sport and couple of other packages and really liked how it drove, but he did like the 650GC too.Spoke to a CA and we took out a 640iGC and really liked how that one drove, yeah it's down on power, but the planted feel and comfortable but firm ride was still there. MSRP 83K was a little shocker, not too sure if I'm willing to spend that much on a car right now.. Only if BMW would build a M4GC!!"
June 2016,There's a white S3 parked outside our office building these days - I agree it's very sharp with the contrasting black panoramic sunroof.
June 2016,I saw a gorgeous WHITE S3 tonight!
June 2016,"I just spent a few minutes building my own Audis on the Audi Website. There hasn't been a vehicle out within reason in quite a few years that I actually cared enough to look, so hats off to Audi. They caught my discerning eye.2016 A3 2.0T Quattro Premium Plus - Metallic Paint, Sport Package, Sport Suspension, B&O Stereo. MSRP of $40,2752016 S3 Premium Plus - Metallic Paint 19"" Performance Package, B&O Stereo. MSRP $45,525.2016 S4 Premium Plus - DSG, Sport Differential, Adaptive Suspension. MSRP $54,125These cars continue to get good press as well as real world reviews from actual customers. All 3 of these cars are way out of my budget, but they do depreciate and eventually there will be a sweet spot to buy a nicely used CPO model."
June 2016,"Audi has dropped lease support on all 2015's, making them more expensive to lease than the 2016's."
June 2016,"RR even in the M3 and M4 the DSG are wonderful, just as you said you can go from Cruise mode to toy mode with a push of a button. It's like having two cars in one. Some years back Rick had a Mini convertible as a rental it was the non turbo model, and that car could not get out of it's own way, a MT was needed in that car."
June 2016,"Just poking around, I am noticing a few brand new 2015 leftover S4s still sitting on dealer lots.  What gives?  Is there no lease support, so the 2016s (which you can lease) are moving off the lots?"
June 2016,"I'm coming around to the opinion that a manual tends to be more entertaining when the car actually needs a manual gearbox. For example, my 318ti(with a Turner Motorsports Conforti chip) makes around 140 lb-ft of torque at 4500 rpm. You simply must keep the engine wound tight to make anything close to rapid progress- and it's a lot of fun to drive it in that fashion. In contrast, my M235i makes 330 lb-ft of twist from 1300 to 4500 rpm; with such a flat torque curve there is almost always a ton of thrust available regardless of rpm and/or the gear selected. It's also nice to have a car that can convert from cruise mode to track toy mode with the press of a button. If I was buying an M2 or M3 I would definitely go with a manual every time, but in the less intense models an automatic transmission does not detract from my enjoyment of the car- but then at 59 I'm fast approaching geezer status."
June 2016,"DSG might not have the smoothest of shifting characteristics, particularly at low or stopping speed, but when you can bang out consistent 4-1/2 second OR LESS 0-60 sprints in part due to the brilliant ""launch control"" features of the DSG, how can one honestly complain?"
June 2016,"A lot of people aren't happy that the MT is on it's way out, but the current crop of DSG and Auto transmissions really make it hard for people not to agree, I love the 8 spd in our BMW's"
June 2016,"I'm going out on a limb and saw that that isn't correct, every 2017 A4 that North Scottsdale Audi has, has a CVT transmission, the salesmen said that the Premium gets the CVT and the DSG on the other models."
June 2016,@flightnurse - great write up on the A4. I too was seriously impressed with the DSG transmission in PDK form while driving a 911GT3 around a track in NJ.
June 2016,"not according to their site. Looks like DSG on the premium too, FWD or AWD.https://www.audiusa.com/models/audi-a4/configurator"
June 2016,"When it comes to transmissions the Premium A4 get's the CVT, if you move up to the Premium Plus and Prestige they get the DSG. I just wish Audi would move to a RWD platform."
June 2016,"looks like you are correct. Must be confusing it with the old style, but looks like the A4 is DSG, though the site just mentions base FWD, I'm sure it is the same with Quattro."
June 2016,"I think the '17 A4 has simply gone standard dual clutch auto, at least in Quattro form, but I haven't seen one in person very closely yet, nor driven one."
June 2016,"I thought the A4 was using the normal AT, not the dual clutch box? Which is fine by me for one of these!"
June 2016,"Looks like Audi is on the right track.  Make a great car.  Slowly make improvements based on customer/media feedback as the model progresses.I hate to be ""that guy,"" but in a couple of years, a CPO S3 or S4 might make a good buy.  I keep seeing more and more Audis on the road.  They definitely ""look the part"" and distinguish themselves from the sea of 3 series and C-Class' out on the road.  I saw a run of the mill A3 2.0T sedan in grey with what looked like some nice, thick, 5 Spoke silver & black wheels, a lip spoiler that I liked.  There te seems to be a good amount of these current or 1 year old CPO A3 & A4 units for sale at a healthy discount off sticker.I agree, based on that review it looks like Audi TTS-ified the S3. No wonder I liked, but didn't love the '16 and older S3's. That being said the performance enthusiasts will be taking advantage of the new engine's stage 1 tunes coming in at about 350+ HP. No need for the 5-cylinder unless you just have to have the superior ""sound"" of it."
June 2016,"So the test drive went well, just a little FYI, it was 110 today here in Sunny PHX...So I test drove two A4's, but 2017, I drove a Premium Plus FWD with a CVT (only transmission that comes with FWD) and a Premium Plus Auto ( Quattro)I have always liked the looks of the Audi's and their interiors have always been very clean (almost like someone from Denmark designed them) and minimalist at the same time. The size of the A4 is bigger then last Gen, so in comparison it's slight bigger then my 320, but the 3GT has more rear legroom. I was surprised how well the CVT shifts, but there is still that rubber band feeling, the Auto in the Quattro was better, but not too sure if AWD is really needed here in the Desert. The 252 HP 2L has a lot of motivation, but our 3GT is quicker (it has the BMS stage 1) over all driving the car is drove well, both with CVT or Duel Clutch but I give the Dual Clutch the nod, pricing for the cars are very competitive, you can get a Premium Plus for about 46K fully loaded, very competitive with BMW and a 328i. Even in Quattro you can tell the car is based on FWD. Fit and Finish was first rate, and would give Audi a nod for the feel of the leather over both of our BWW's. The size of the A4 felt just right not too bed or too small, I'm not too sure if an A6 is needed, plenty of rear leg room and head room, even behind the drivers seat once I adjusted the drivers seat to my liking. I sat in a 2017 S3 and found small and I can see the appeal to it."

May 2016,Well you know the argument...the highest trim level of the lower price brand approximates the stripper model of the next higher level brand.
May 2016,"Some dumb entries in there, IMHO. First, how do you have 2 different ""entry-level"" BMWs. Entry level is 1 level only. If they were close on price, I suppose I could see the argument, but the 4 GC is $8k more for starters. My other problem is the inclusion of a VW. Audi takes their luxo sales slot."

One of the reasons I like, whenever possible, to rent a very similar vehicle for an ""extended test drive"". Live with the car for a week or so, try it out in everyday life."
May 2016,"One of my good friends has the TLX V6 Advanced Package, it's not AWD but it does have the 9 speed transmission. He loves the car except for the transmission, I've driven it on several occasions and the shifts from 1-2 and 2-3 are really harsh."
May 2016,""" I hope this is a good sign for Jaguar.""Actually, car-wise, there have been good signs for Jag since the '04 XJ's all aluminum architecture (and Ford cash flow). Unfortunately, nobody noticed as it continued the XJ style of the '60s. Handsome, but been there, done that. The current lineup are all winners as vehicles that offer performance, style and quality. From my personal (and, of course a sample set of 1) experience build, reliability and materials are all excellent.The XE and F-Pace early reviews are almost all big thumbs up. I'm torn, want Jag to survive and thrive, yet selfishly I hate to potentially lose the relative exclusivity of driving a Jag. My 17 y.o. son believes I'm being selfish, that there's no reason for someone of my advanced years to be driving an XF, when it would so much better serve his purposes. The '02 RX300 he currently is lucky enough to drive would be much better suited to me. Gotta like the attitude, if not the logic!"
May 2016,"Just hears a quote that pertains to everyone here....""I'm just one car away from true happiness....!"""
May 2016,"That is what I thought, but the salesperson explained the ""F"" in Pace. The F-pace is based off the XF there will be a E-Pace within the next year. Also something interesting, Look for Jaguar to set up a bank i.e Jaguar Financial Services soon, like like what BMW and MB has done. He explained that they currently use Chase Bank, so lease rates should come down as well as top tier rates for people who have a credit score above 675, this is the cut off for BMW top tier rate."
May 2016,"I thought they drove nice, and were pretty quick. Or so I have heard.I'll try one eventually, just, because why not?"
May 2016,@carnaught - there's nothing wrong with YOU owning an Accord Hybrid.  Your stable balances it out with your RC350 F Sport.  @stickguy & I are in here as well as CCBA to give each other a kick in the pants!
May 2016,"the F pace is that big? I thought it was based on the XE, so more along the size of an X3?"
May 2016,"So went to the Jaguar Dealer, I was much more impressed with the F-Pace then I was with the XE. The XE still has a tight rear legroom then my F30 or Ricks F34. But the F-Pace is nice, the one on the showroom did not have real leather, but their fake leather and was impressed with how it felt, very rich feel to it. The 340 hp V6 was nice, pulled strong. The F-Pace is the same size as BMW's X5 and it under cut the X5 by 7K. This was the first time I had a chance to really look at Jaguar up close and the salesman was not pushy at all. The F pace comes in Diesel and Gas, beginning of June they get their first diesel F Pace, I can't wait to drive it. Regarding the XE for a base model, at 34K you get more standard equipment then the 328, A4 and C300, the fit and finish was perfect on the two XE's that I looked it. I hope this is a good sign for Jaguar."
May 2016,"Boo!Hey, I resemble that.....Boo on you ."
May 2016,"Have you driven a 6-cylinder Accord lately? I wonder if that would be the way to go for what would probably be less than the 4-banger Acura. Always liked Honda/Acura's V6's.I haven't checked the equipment level on the Honda recently - it certainly may have changed with the recent facelift - but at one point the Acura had a better suite of safety and tech features, such as a true blind spot monitoring system. On the Honda, it seemed you had to get the ""Touring"" model to get that, which got quite expensive. And, for what it's worth, the TLX may be conservative in its own right, but I think it's still more distinctive than an Accord. Having said that, the Accord is a great car - but I'd take a used TLX over a new Accord. Best value? perhaps a used Accord."
May 2016,Boo!
May 2016,Better overall than a V6 model.
May 2016,Boo!
May 2016,I'm tempted to look at an accord hybrid.
May 2016,"I like those too - test drove one a while back and was impressed with the package overall.  In my area, the dealers have some low mileage 4 cyl tech models (loaners probably) for right at $30k or a bit under.  As I like to say, lot of car for the money. Have you driven a 6-cylinder Accord lately? I wonder if that would be the way to go for what would probably be less than the 4-banger Acura. Always liked Honda/Acura's V6's."
May 2016,a big discount on a 4 cyl tech would give me all I need.
May 2016,"Perhaps I'm the only one, but I like how Acura has gone back to its tagline from the 1990s: ""Precision Crafted Performance."""
May 2016,"I like those too - test drove one a while back and was impressed with the package overall.  In my area, the dealers have some low mileage 4 cyl tech models (loaners probably) for right at $30k or a bit under.  As I like to say, lot of car for the money."
May 2016,"I received a letter from my Jag dealer. They want to buy back my '13 XF for 20% over ""book value*."" They're desperate for used cars. And, they'd be glad to get me into a new set of wheels. For 20% over MSRP, of course! Tempting to review the offer, but I just bought a condo, so no new cars for me. Yet."
May 2016,"I received a phone call from Scottsdale Jaguar, they have the new XE in, will be stopping by today to look at them, they have 5, 4 base and 1 premium. I'll have to look at the F-Pace too."
May 2016,"After dad gave me his clean 95 Cutlass Ciera because he could no longer drive, I drove it for about 2 years and sold my 01 Aurora 4.0. When the Ciera needed expensive a/c repair, I cut bait, and it was a great excuse to get another car. I bought a very clean 03 Acura TL with 20k, silver, black interior. This was in 05. For some reason, the TL just hit me as being blah, nothing special, though the V6 felt and sounded great. I guess I should have bought the TL-S instead. Enter black 06 Passat 2.0t---a fun and nice driving car. Like stickguy, I have my eye on a TLX w/tech as a possible future purchase."
May 2016,"I am still fond of the TLX, and it is on the list for next year. But would get a 4 cyl DCT"
May 2016,"I know it the car was repainted & that's not a stock Acura color.  I just thought it stands out.I really like the styling of the TLX V6 SH AWD, but that 9 speed transmission scares me.  If you wants read some good owner reviews, check out edmunds."
May 2016,"That TL is a total respray. That's not a color Acura offers in the TL.Still two of my all time favorite cars....my TL-S and my TL SH AWD. I am in the minority, too. I loved the aggressive style of the more recent TLs.TLs don't stand out in any one category (except maybe for incorporating every tech feature you could imagine in their cars). But, they do everything well."
May 2016,"I saw a previous generation yesterday. (2004-2008?), TL-S model. Was thinking about how nice that body style holds up.. I have no problem with the rear-end of that next model. Wait, is that the rear or the front? lol"
May 2016,"A lot of noise was made on the boards here when Acura replaced everybody's beloved TL with ""the beak"" with the 2009 redesign.  It was too much and way to aggressive.  The 2012 facelift was subsequently criticized for being too conservative.  I happen to be in the minority.  I like the old TL Type S which is still a great looking car close to 10 years out of production.  I like the 2009 - 2011 SH AWD models because of their aggressive looking rear end with tail pipes sticking out the back & squared off 5 Spoke Wheels.  I also dig the look of the 2012 - 2014 SH AWD models.  Many people also don't like the sea of black, white, silver, & grey ELLPS out there.  Check out what I saw on the way home yesterday."
May 2016,Someone posted this on the Caddy board I frequent. It is a really good interview. He is an impressive individual with all the right answers.https://youtu.be/OKjEQS2DYrU
May 2016,"Oh goodie, Audi got added to the previously only High-end list."
May 2016,"Still looking:A reporter is looking to speak with someone who recently got a great deal on a new luxury brand vehicle (BMW, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Jaguar, etc.). If you're willing to share your story, please reach out to pr@edmunds.com by no later than Friday, May 20, 2016."
May 2016,"That's why I'm so disappointed. 3/36 maintenance plans have generally low value, as they cover basic oil change and sometimes air filter. 4/50 plan run into a need of first major service, even on computer based. My brakes are still in good shape, which saved them a bundle (I'm out of 50k already), but many people needed them apparently. There may also be some more fluids to be changed, if your computer senses more severe driving condition. Wipers are generally cheap, so not much value there, especially that there are some decent aftermarket wipers for $20 or so, but it seems like just pettiness from their part to cut that one. Whatever. I guess dealers can now charge those uninformed good money for their ""genuine"" wiper and even add ""installation fee"" for good 30 minutes of hard work of super-certified technician. BTW, this is not first time I see pettiness in their conduct. My navigation (it's older-generation, still hard disk based system) doesn't have a single automotive store (like AutoZone, etc.), or other brand dealerships in it. Just ridiculous, if you think about it. I'll live, but I'm quite disappointed overall. Just confirms to me - there is no reason for any kind of loyalty. It's all ""what you have done for me lately"". It's OK, I'll do the same."
May 2016,"Not covering wear items at all, from what I understand, so no wipers or brake jobs. I've received brake jobs on at least one axle, on every BMW we've had. If you lease 36/15, you are out of the maintenance plan for the last 7.5 months, if it drops to 3 yr, 36 K"
May 2016,"And, given that a majority of BMWs are leased for 36 months, I don't think they are offending that segment of their customers by dropping the 4th year."
May 2016,"Trying to remember what the maintenance items might be in that 4th year, but BMW saved themselves a ton of money. Probably cut out one brake replacement, an oil change, probably some AWD services, wipers, perhaps some other minor things. But, that 4th year would probably be the most expensive to cover than the previous 3 years combined."
May 2016,"I think it's the maintenance that's not transferable. Warranty is - essentially all brands have warranty transferable, except there are some exceptions in Kia/Hyundai ""extensions"" in warranties beyond 3/36, but I don't know the details on those exceptions.http://www.bmwusa.com/Standard/Content/bmwmaintenanceprogram.aspx?mobileoverride=true"
May 2016,"IT's not to take effect until MY17, Only the maintenance is being cut not the bumper to bumper warranty, however, I think the bumper to bumper warranty isn't transferable since My16."
May 2016,"I tried to corroborate and found a confirmation for the maintenance cut and couple of dealers listing new 2017 vehicles with 4/50 warranty and 3/36 maintenance. Looks, like I might have misunderstood. I thought Fligthnurse wrote about both warranty and maintenance being cut, but perhaps not."
May 2016,I hadn't heard that the warranty was being cut.... just the maintenance.
May 2016,"By cutting the warranty? I don't follow. Maintenance is one thing, but warranty is another."
May 2016,"If I didn't know a great Indy Audi Shop then I might feel differently about the value of free maintenance. Also, if the car is totaled early in its life, I don't believe you get a penny for ""free maintenance"" back. So it could end up being worthless. I think BMW found that a few too many non-badge buyers are driving the heck out of these cars, and M brakes are very expensive to service and replace (pads and rotors)."
May 2016,"Saw a beautiful 328i, blue over beige, not sure the year but gorgeous. Having never owned a BMW, will definitely be looking for a CPO unit in a few years once I go into retirement again. By then, my driving should go down substantially so it'll be mostly around town stuff. Just wish they still made the 128 as I love the smaller size, anything from 170"" down is my preferred size now as it's usually me in the vehicle or me and the wife as the kids usually meet us in their own rides or we take a couple to our destination.The Sandman"
May 2016,Maybe BMW has confidence that their cars are now more reliable than they used to be?
May 2016,"not happening as long as they are paying for it.but, nothing stopping you from changing the oil as often as you want to, on your dime!"
May 2016,"Maybe BMW will go back to maintenance schedules that help the car last hundreds of thousands of miles, as long as they don't have to pay for it. I'm not holding my breath, however."
May 2016,"As much as those that really look at the math (like you and me) value the maintenance program, BMW decided that the marketing value of the plan didn't justify their increased costs. They are probably correct. Unfortunately."
May 2016,"That would be sad as Olds was shut down. Doubt they would do that to Cadillac, but never say never."
May 2016,"They do, but shortening the coverage will make them even more dependent on leases. I'm sure a good extension and certified preowned programs coukd bridge the gap. I just hate ""sneak"" price hikes, like changing the packaging, or cutting 0.2 inches of width from paper towel or toilet tissue rolls. I like straight talk and treatment, not slight of hand moves."
May 2016,"BMW is selling cars do they don't have to do the free maintenance any longer, but Jag will have to do it for a while to get people to trust them, I'm hoping that Alfa does the same thing with their cars too. It's nice to know you wont have to pay for anything.."
May 2016,"I thought BMW already leased a very high percentage of cars? If so, makes sense to cut back. Most likely though it was just a way to shave costs without raising prices, and not something buyers will immediately feel."
May 2016,"Wow, what's happening? Why is BMW cutting maintenance and warranty? This is effectively a price increase. Looks like pushing the lease even harder than before. Also seems like a very weak statement about confidence in this new and improved product. Too many problems with turbo engines? Hoarding cash for a future dieselgate? What gives?I think that maintenance thing was actually a fairly strong selling point, at least to me, but it might have been too few covered services, leaving cars prone to long term issues and dealers unhappy, because they were unable to upsell during those four years."
May 2016,Wear items are no longer warranted by BMW from 2017 forward.
May 2016,"BMW includes wear items though, including brakes and wipers I'm told. However, they do exclude tires.One salesman kept harping on the free maintenance thing, and I just had to flat out tell him, free maintenance is nice, but it ""doesn't sell the car."""
May 2016,What's going on with Cadillac the past few years reminds me a little bit of Oldsmobile in the late 1990s.
May 2016,"BMW and Jag, however, BMW will stop the 4/50 after the MY16 cars. will be 3/36"
May 2016,"This is volvo's:Complimentary Factory Scheduled Maintenance covers the first three services (10,000 miles, 20,000 miles, and 30,000 miles) at no charge.*"
May 2016,Interesting Article:  What's Wrong With Cadillac?
May 2016,"I get a Caddy loaner whenever I went in for service. Tired to coax them out of a ATS-V they had sitting there as a loaner once, but they said they couldn't."
May 2016,Volvo has free service for that long at least I believe. or close to it. VW offers 1 year (used to be 3). Or maybe it is 2 now? They kept changing it.
May 2016,"They aren't all that far off. My caddy has quite generous coverage, actually. 4/50k B-2-B, 6/70k powertrain, and 4/50k included service.I don't know the answer to this: does anyone else offer 4/50k included maintenance? I didn't even know any of this when I went to buy the caddy. It was a nice bonus. I've looked at the possibility of extending the warranty, but it just isn't cost effective when what it comes with is as long as it is."
May 2016,A 10 year warranty with a guaranteed loaner/rental when needed would help speed that along.
May 2016,They need to do something unconventional to win back the trust.
May 2016,"I like the XF will give it a look, should have written that."
May 2016,"Congrats on the new car, is this one a 4 cyl or 6 cyl?"
May 2016,"The Jag F-Pace, like the XE, is getting very good early press. Automobile Mag (online, at least) has a ""first and second"" drive impression articles, they're still looking for faults. While the XE is a handsome, muscular looking beast, I really wish they had gone away from the Germans sedan styling theme of same sausage, different lengths. But, along with the F-Pace, as their likely bread and butter models, can't start too out there, I guess.My XF, still flawless at 29+ months and ~26k miles. Well, the windshield wipers are due to be replaced, so not perfect!"
May 2016,"Where in the interior do you find it lacking? Just doing a quick comparo online, the CTS has 4.4"" more front legroom than the E and 4.3"" more than the 5. It falls right in the middle with rear legroom at only 0.4"" less than the E but 0.1"" more than the 5."
May 2016,"If I get a jag, will definitely be a lease, so they only need to survive 4 years more from now!Volvo, I think they stay. New owners will want to keep the US market in place. New product us helping."
May 2016,"As most of you are tired of hearing me saying  , Cadillac remain relatively stagnant until everyone who bought one in the 1980s is dead. We have about another ten years, if Cadillac can chug along until then. Another problem, aside from the dubious reputation of the past tarnishing their quite good products of the present, is, as you have all mentioned, unrealistic pricing. This seems to keep their sales figures firmly rooted to the same numbers, year after year. And say, where's Jaguar? I'm actually quite worried about that company. Let's hope jumping into the SUV market will save them---if that flops, I think you can kiss them goodbye. They are only at 25% of their 2002 U,S, sales figures.Cadillac, on the other hand, has been pretty consistent, hovering in the 200,000 range per year since 2002. They seem to be on a 175,000 pace for 2016. So, same-o, same-o for Cadillac. Volvo is at about 70% of its 2002 numbers, and seem to be on an upswing of sorts."
May 2016,"@laurasdada....if I decide to go A6/5/E/CTS/GS range again this next go round. I've put the XF at the very top of that list. If Cadillac hadn't come through in replacing my lemon, that's what would be sitting in the GG estate right now.Beautiful car that drives surprisingly well.As you say, not as spacious as a 5, E or A6, but about the interior space of the CTS, which is really more than I need anyway."
May 2016,"""For my next car I'm leaning towards the new 5 series, but will look at the A6 and E class, but the CTS isn't on my list until it competitive in the interior space like the other cars. ""FN: Add the Jag XF to your lookieloo list. Probably not as spacious as the Germans, but, a really nice overall ride..."
May 2016,"FN...Cadillac took the '14 CTS back. I was still PO'd but they gave me a new '16 and some pocket money for my troubles. '16 is what the '14 should have been. CTS came out of the blocks about 18 months before it was fully baked, at least in my case.'16 has been perfect. These new Caddys are really nice cars. They're built well. They use very nice materials in them, they look great, and they perform and handle great. But, that's not what people want from Caddy. They want the Caddy that's in the Escalade.Not sure I'll buy another, but so far, I'm loving the '16 version.But, as others point out, it's not enough to build a really good car. Perception is what makes people pony up. Funny, people are willing to buy the most expensive Cadillac, but it's the poorest performer. Again, perception.....The best Cadillacs are the ATS and the CTS, but people are avoiding them. I know resale is terrible, but I bought my CTS for what a cheaper 3 series or C300 would cost. But, it's as good, and in many respects better, than the E Class or 5 Series.I saw an M235i convertible at the car show this past winter. If I had my check book with me, I would have bought it on the spot. Luckily, my rational angel replaced my demon by the time I left the car show."
May 2016,"CG what has happened with your CTS? Had Caddy made good on fixing it?Now I like the CTS, but I really think Caddy needs to stop with these half size cars. The ATS is a 3 series fighter, but it's smaller on the inside. The CTS is a 5 series fighter however, it's is smaller inside, and slight larger then a 3 series. I would assume if they want to compete with the 3 and 5 series they need to be competitive on all fronts. For my next car I'm leaning towards the new 5 series, but will look at the A6 and E class, but the CTS isn't on my list until it competitive in the interior space like the other cars."
May 2016,"Simple - there is always a hope for a sucker who will pay more. Moreover, there is also fear that lowering the price won't help - people will still ask for further discount. Not to mention 5k is probably more than their profit margin on first production year, perhaps even longer. Last - they still think ""It's a Cadillac"" means, the sticker has to be high, cause you know, it meant that 30 years ago."
May 2016,"couldn't agree more. No idea why they just don't lower their prices. I mean, rather than try to get 10k people to pay $2k under and 25k people to pay $10k under, just lower them $5k and kill the rebates and advertise the hell out of the fact that you trump the others in comparison tests AND undercut their prices. You lose $270k with the first scenario but have nothing to crow about vs $175k in scenario 2 with a great selling point."
May 2016,"Well said @jpp5862.  To me, part of the allure of a Cadillac (besides the Escalade) is that they are not status symbols.  You don't see one on every corner.  I'm a car enthusiast.  I'm ashamed to say that when @qbrozen announced that he bought his CTS V-Sport, I had to look it up to find out.  I took a look at the specs and my eyes widened.  I was impressed to say the least.  As @roadburner says all the time, people wear many of the BMWs, MBs, & Audis on the road today.  The ATS looks like a nice car.  I built a Luxury model online with AWD, Upgraded Wheels (the black ones).  The sticker price shoots close to $50K very quickly (as it does on many entry level luxury performance sedans).  If GM is constantly throwing $10K rebates at these cars at the end of the year, why not lower the cost of entry to begin with?"
May 2016,Lots of truth in your last paragraph!
May 2016,"I completely agree, but they spent 30+ years destroying the brand, it won't recover overnight. No one really wants a Cadillac, even if they do want a great driving car. Edit: Let me rephrase, people who want a great driving car will buy a Cadillac. People who want a status symbol badge won't give Cadillac a second thought and most buyers fit the latter category."
May 2016,"It may be true, but the reality is people don't buy them in numbers produced and those who buy expect pricing below what Cadillac thinks they should pay. So either the cars stay on lots, or they move at prices below expected levels. Something's got to give. Mere wishing is not going to solve it - yet, so far that's all we see from them - trying to charm reality with corporate chants, not real moves."
May 2016,"The sad thing is that Cadillac HAS good products.  Between @graphicguy, @qbrozen, & @ab348 they've got some fans.  Believe me, if there was a problem with any of our posters' cars we'd know about it.  Even the fact that @graphicguy didn't flip his 2016 CTS in its 1st week speaks volumes about the product."
May 2016,"Cadillac is a tragic case of a complete mismatch between aspirations and reality on many different levels. It all starts with pricing not matching the current perception (whether the perception is correct or not, doesn't really matter at this time), production capacity and sales network. They want to be ""prestigous"", but their production capacity and especially dealer network is a legacy of their heyday well before German and Japanese brands took over that market. I read that Detroit's problem has always been (across the board for all brands) inability to scale down production to match current demand, which in turn made them incentive addicts. They essentially make a car and then try to sell it. Others often have mindset that they won't make a car until they have some evidence it's actually needed somewhere. It can be a real order (customer's or dealer's - BMW operates that way), deep market studies, or simple case of matching cars that sold (Japanese reportedly do it that way). In other words - they want to (at least virtually) sell the car before making it. Detroit makes it first (because you know, union contracts, sales targets, etc.) and then find a customer for it. Any attempt of changing that mindset, while positive in general long term, requires willingness of taking short or even longer lasting intermediate pain of sales drops, production shutdowns and contract breaks with minor dealers. For comparison, Tampa Bay (not including Sarasota) has 3 BMW, MB, 2 Audi and 2 Acura, 1 Jaguar store, and only 4 Cadillac stores, which doesn't sound bad. But extend the radius to just 50 miles and the picture changes dramatically: it adds about one dealer for Sarasota for all Germans, one store in Lakeland for BMW and MB, but Cadillac's network grows to 13 stores. Considering sales numbers and it is clearly nuts. May be convenient, but there is no pricing power. I'm sure those dealers are hurting, too. This of course quickly rolls downhill into contentious relationships with customers, as dealer that doesn't have any money will not support their customer.Cadillac's management keeps wanting to have the cake and eat it. They want large sales, no incentives and high prestige - we all know that ain't gonna happen. You can pick two. They probably know it, too - but their stakeholders are too entrenched and simply unwilling to take the necessary real steps to fix it - they rather pretend doing something and then act surprised that things are not going as planned."
May 2016,Exactly; they need to get butts in seats before they set prices as high as their competitors.
May 2016,"Perhaps review their pricing model, study Lexus circa 1989..."
May 2016,I don't know what Cadillac is going to do; they have a world class product but perception is taking much too long to catch up with reality...
May 2016,Spotted an STS-V on Monday. That has to be pretty rare.
May 2016,"OH, I'm certain it is.I bet the XT5 bolsters Caddy sales. If they offer a V Sport, I may even consider taking a look."

Had less cash to spend and wanted the versatility of a hatch to haul stuff. So far, only one issue with a starter wire that took a few days to find malfunctioning. But after a couple of days, the problem finally showed itself and that was that. Also, the lumbar handle came off twice and now fixed perfectly.Hoping that the reliability on both will be good and so far, so good.The Sandman"
April 2016,The Quattro version comes with a more powerful engine...
April 2016,I wonder when rental companies will start installing dash cams into the cars to see just how abused rentals are during rental periods.
April 2016,"I couldn't toss it as I pretty much drove the freeways. Also my rental seemed to bottom out the front right shock as if there was no damping - it was a huge chunk on speedbumps, etc. So I had to baby it a bit - but the car had 18K miles on it so don't know how that had happened. I reported it to the rental company upon return."
April 2016,"Can't argue with you that it seems Audi finally took some cost cut measures when making the current generation A3's interior. I love the round air vents though, that's our only disagreement. The driving feel; did you toss it around?, feels like a very light and lively chassis to me. The 1.8T I'm not a fan of; the 2.0T should be standard, better power, and better fuel economy at the same time. Before someone argues, note the 2.0T adds quattro without losing MPG, that's better efficiency by a large margin. The 2.0T is a stellar engine."
April 2016,"I had a rented A3 sedan this past week. I have to say I was a bit underwhelmed. While I realize it was probably a base model, the interior, while nice, had quite a bit of hard door plastics, etc. IMHO the dash looks kind of cheap with the worst part being the round air vents. The driving feel was ok but not great. The engine (I assume it was a Turbo 4?) was somewhat harsh at idle but had good power upon acceleration. The leather seats were decent and the car looks attractive.Compared to my 1998 A4 that was about the same size, the older A4 was way nicer thank the A3 IMHO."
April 2016,"I was going to post something like this, I would suspect that it all depends on how much reconditioning your car needs, if you take care of your car and it's just normal wear and tear, then it's not an issue, but if you don't care how many stains there are inside or scraps and dents and road rash on the rims, then I get could see BMW holding back some money."
April 2016,"I haven't run into that. Twice was with MSDs, but I've turned in at least 8-10 leased cars, with never an issue.I've heard plenty of stories, though. I also know that plenty of people treat their vehicles like crap, and probably aren't good candidates for leasing.."
April 2016,"True enough but there are shades of gray as to what represents ""significant damage"". I've also heard of cases where one inspection seeeds rather perfunctory, and another very detailed. Go figure."
April 2016,"I agree with the thought process on this... It's the same reason I don't use a debit card. But, in reality, all cars get an inspection at your home/business, and a printout is given to you then (3-4 weeks before turn-in). You owe what you owe, regardless of deposit.I've done it twice, and no issues."
March 2016,Depends on what's in the contract--it should state (or not) whether the MSD can be used against damages at turn-in.
March 2016,"From what I have read on Bimmerfest, BMW has not done this since the MSD is not really a ""security"" deposit in the general term, but a way to lower the MF."
March 2016,"This can happen and does at any dealership, but this is why the savvy buyer would investigate what the current MF is and call the dealer on the increase."
March 2016,EGG-xactly my concern as well.
March 2016,"that was something I wondered about with the MSDs. On my lease, there is no security deposit, so if they want to ding me for damage, they have to ask for it and I can argue. But if they have $3,500 ""on account"", they can keep whatever they want, and I would have to fight them to get it back."
March 2016,"Yeah but the dealer can jack up the MF, and if they do that to the max as Michael points out, that's one whole 1% more interest; and those 7 payments are held hostage against any damage (read the fine print) --not a great position for negotiation at turn-in. But your point is well-taken nonetheless and should be considered along with everything else."
March 2016,"One thing people don't get with MSD's is over the life of the lease, you are saving on average about $1900 plus you get the MSD's back when you turn the car"
March 2016,"its seems difficult to decide, seriously."
March 2016,"This is one area where the dealer makes money, other then the lovely Doc Fee"
March 2016,You're also losing one month's lease payment in the investment interest you would lose on giving them $3850 of your money for 3 years.
March 2016,"@flightnurse - good point. They mention the 7 MSDs but not the starting MF from which they are deducted..00135 is the base MF this month, but the dealer can mark it up to .00175."
March 2016,"That isn't a very good deal, I'm sure you would walk into the dealership and get it for less. Also With that payment the MF isn't at the base rate. The GT's aren't selling that well."
March 2016,I stand corrected!
March 2016,"$925 is the new standard acquisition fee for BMWFS. No markups allowed, now."
March 2016,"Not to mention that this has got to be for 10K miles per year (so what do I drive for the other 6 months?).  So after 3 years you'll have paid out over $19,000 in lease payments (plus tax).  I think they are marking up the bank fee by $200."
March 2016,"It's OK .. over $5K due at signing, but you'll get the $3850 back at the end. Oh, plus DMV and dealer fee costs, whatever those happen to be.NJ calculates sales tax on the sum of the payments and the customer can either pay it up front or add it into the cap cost, which will increase the payment.You could probably negotiate a better price than that used in the ad to lower your payment."
March 2016,Here is a good lease on a 335i
March 2016,"Depending where you live there are some great deals on BMWs right now. my neighbor just leased a 2015 535d new, MSRP $77K, purchase price $59K, with the 3K lease money BMW has his money payments on this car is $525/m with ZERO out of pocket. He got the car from Pacific BMW in Glendale, Ca. They have a huge selection of cars from new with zero miles, to service loaners to Exec cars. But go out and look at cars kick the tires and test drive them."
March 2016,"Yes, the IS350 is light years better than the IS250. Still, if you want great power it's 335+, S3 or S4, or AMG versions of the above."
March 2016,"I think you answered your own question. scope them all out, see which ones interest you enough to get into a short term relationship with, then go where the money trail leads.Maybe add infiniti. Q50 is going to be really cheap compared to those others. I like the Volvo S60 too, might be worth a look.Funny though, of your list (I assume A3, 328, IS, CLA/C class) the only one I don't like is the one you drive now!"
March 2016,"So very open ended question -- but I would really appreciate opinions. I currently lease a 2014 Lexus IS250 AWD. Its fine -- has worked out well for me.I am looking at all the typical cars in that range and class: Audi, Mercedes, Lexus, BMW, etc etcAny thoughts or recommendations? I would look at a purchase of a CPO but I really like the thoughts of a different experience every 24-36 months.Lease specials will probably sway me to be honest"
March 2016,"Well Audi has always had a 4 cyl, Lexus until now never had a 4 cylYes, MB had one too, what the scary thing is that Nissan could not make their own, the 4 Cyl in the Q50 is from MB..."
March 2016,"BMW? Heck, almost every luxury brand offers a 4-cyl turbo in their entry level cars.MBLexusAudiI guess the question is, what took Infiniti so long?"
March 2016,"So for 2016 Infiniti has an entry level Q50 with a 4 cyl turbo, so is Infiniti doing the BWW thing with a El Cheapo model?http://blog.caranddriver.com/sans-six-infiniti-announces-pricing-for-some-2016-q50-models/?mag=cdb&list=nl_dvr_news&src=nl&date=031616"
March 2016,"Those of you who own a car fitted with a ZF automatic or double-clutch transmission might be interested in this ZF List of approved lubricants. Page 3 lists the approved oils for double-clutch boxes while page 4 lists the proper ATF for the automatics- in both cases the part numbers for the oils as sold by the vehicle manufacturer are also provided.Automatic owners should note on page 5 that ZF recommends an ATF change every 60,000-120,000 km(50,000-75,000 miles) or 8 years under the following conditions:- frequent highway driving in top speed range,- offensive, sporty driving style,- frequent trailer operation,I plan to change the ATF in the 2er every 50,000 miles, primarily because it will be my track toy for the next several years. Otherwise I would go with the 75,000 mile interval. I tend to be proactive with respect to vehicle maintenance and I believe it pays off; I've had the ATF changed in the GM A5S 390R(5L40E) in my '04 X3 2.5i every 60k miles. It now has 185k on the clock and the transmission performs like new."
March 2016,"I would pay extra for a policy that has ""new car replacement"" even if your car isn't totaled, but has more than a 20% of value damage claim. I'd also pay extra to have a collision deductible waiver that applies to both uninsured and under insured drivers hitting you. Unfortunately in CA at least, it's better to be hit by an uninsured than a under insured driver."
March 2016,@andres3 I really feel for the story- last month my neighbor backed into the front quarter of my car. Damage just to the one panel (I hope)- I have been waiting on getting the car fixed- may wait another 6 months or so as my hope is to have it fixed correctly and then quickly trade in for the next model s4 which I'm guessing will be available at that time. The tale of issues you have had with your car would have driven me to roll it off a cliff.
February 2016,"Yes, they were certified, and there's only 3 in all of San Diego County! However, they were so horrible, I imagine a typical decent body shop would probably out-perform them, though I haven't had luck with any body shops in San Diego County yet (tried 4 different ones now). I did tell Audi that they need to immediately de-certify them. They used to have a good reputation locally in Escondido (by San Diego), but they got bought out by Caliber Collision (the McDonald's of Body Shops) years ago. They kept the old name along with Caliber Collision to fool people, and they still are certified by Audi to this day despite my complaints.I agree with you, they get away with shoddy workmanship because most people won't take their car back 3 times until they get it right like I did."
February 2016,"I hate dealing with most body shops; if the car looks good from 20 feet away the average customer is ecstatic- and as a result, the work really suffers. Maybe I've just been lucky, but when I creased the side of my ti I took it to my local dealer's BMW Certified Collision Repair Center. The quality of the work was outstanding, and I had absolutely no complaints. Was the body shop that ""repaired"" your car an Audi certified shop?"
February 2016,"I had to take in my S4 for its first warranty replacement part at 42K+ miles yesterday. The right headlight low beam bulb ""burned out/broke."" Indicator light was very specific about problem with the right side headlight low beam bulb. Audi covered it, although there was a mention that sometimes they might like to wiggle out of paying for bulbs. I just said no owner would expect to have to replace bulbs in under 4 years or 50K miles. They didn't try and charge me; said it was a $300 bulb. This was the headlight that was replaced by a body shop; so not original. I""m going to go with not a coincidence, and blame it on the body shop/accident rather than Audi. That's how I'm chalking this one up, and appreciate Audi covering it without making me deal with the hassle of going back to a lousy shop. I do realize the shop used an Audi derived OEM replacement part, but I have my reasons. Isn't this 2 indicator errors in 2016 alone for me? First windshield washer fluid issue, now a burned/broken bulb. When is Audi going to learn how to make a car :P LOL.Maybe this is a sign I should join Chronic Car Buyer's Anonymous before a 3rd indicator error light comes on (besides low fuel)."
February 2016,"I will say I was impressed with how my AWD Q50 handled a 10"" snow (large for NC). We don't have the equipment to clear streets, so most were unplowed when I went out. Ground clearance was the only real issue, and that didn't keep it from getting through the snow, you just heard it underneath."
February 2016,I'd agree.
February 2016,"well, the 2014s are already right around $30k at auction, putting them around $33k retail. Sooo... what time is it now?"
February 2016,"Congratulations, Roadburner on your new M235i. An M235i convertible is at the top of my wish list and I think, like you, I'll like the size performance and features. The resemblance to the great E46 doesn't hurt either. Like you I've given some thought to various Mustangs but they're just to big for me. I wonder if they've improved the weight distribution. My '86 5 liter convertible was as front heavy as an unloaded pickup.How long do you suppose it'll be before used M235s are in the $30K bracket?"
February 2016,"Sorry! EDC= Electronic Damper Control AMS= Adaptive M SuspensionVery similar similar systems that use various sensors and switch settings to modify jounce and rebound settings on the shocks. The GM's magnetorheological suspensions are more sophisticated and versatile, but I haven't had much experience with them. I haven't driven that many cars with adjustable damping aside from BMWs, and the M235i system makes the most noticeable difference that I've experienced."
February 2016,"Okay, need a legend here. What does EDC and AMS stand for? Have you had enough seat time in other recent model sporty cars to judge other ""adaptive"" suspensions with the M235i? I didn't notice hardly any change in a Lexus IS350 for example, and it had 4 different settings! The S3 only has 2 truly different settings; definitely noticeable. I wouldn't go so far as to say it's a different car, but even in a short test drive, it was a good difference. If these adaptive suspensions don't add significant weight; I'd say they are definitely worth it as a Win Win."
February 2016,"You can order a M3/M4 that comes in under the 65K mark, the only option I would get on them is M Adapative Suspension, for 1K that is it. But the GT350 fully loaded in far less then that. When it comes to the ADM well just wait, that will go away too."
February 2016,The guy with the Shelby? I guess not. My friend with the Challenger got slaughtered though. To him it doesn't matter. They've got a tree in the back yard.
February 2016,"So he paid what? Maybe $60K?...and 9 years later it's worth 1/2 that---not too bad, really, even with the ADM."
February 2016,"I can't stand ADM stickers, but there are morons who pay them so who am I to judge?  I actually know 2 people who paid them. One guy bought a 2007 Shelby GT500 for $20K over sticker.  He put the $20K down, then paid off the rest of the car over 5 years.  He maybe put 5K miles on it.  Traded it in a year after it was paid off for a new Jaguar FType R coupe.Another guy I know paid $10K over sticker for an '09 Challenger SRT8.  He got rid of it maybe 4 years later with less than 10K miles."
February 2016,"A major selling point for the GT350 is the flat plane V8- it's significantly different from the Mustang GT engine. As for as price goes, the GT350 has the edge on paper; the trick is finding a dealer that actually has a car to sell- and isn't tacking on a $25k ADM sticker..."
February 2016,"@flightnurse - I'd also go with the GT350 at the price point.  I know that you & Rick have no issues custom ordering & waiting for your BMWs, but it is not too hard to get an ///M3 or ///M4 into the $75K us atmosphere."
February 2016,"Having just driven a M3, Mustang GT and GT350 back to back, I give it to the GT350, for me it hits all the right points. Plus the sound that V8 makes is erotic (to me.) When I'm ready for next car it's going to be tough to choose."
February 2016,"I liked the M2, but it wasn't within my current budget. That said, at the M2's price point the GT350 is a compelling alternative. I'd have to spend considerable seat time in both to make the call."
February 2016,"Congrates on the new M235, When the new M2 arrives in the next month or two, that will be worthy of the M badge.. Regarding the M Adaptive Suspension, I was really taken how it transforms the car when you toggle from C to S. It's like having two cars..."
February 2016,"Those of you who don't follow the Cars & Conversation or Chronic Car Buyers topics might be interested to know that I picked up a CPO 2014 M235i about two weeks ago. My wife insisted that I check it out; I originally intended to drive it first and then drive a couple of new Mustang GTs in the same general area. As it turned out I ended up making a deal then and there. I was honestly surprised at how good it was. The car is about the same size as an E36, which suits me perfectly(a main sticking point on the Mustang was its size). It has just about every option save the the Helen Keller Package(Blind Spot Monitoring, Lane Departure warning, etc.). It's also an automatic, but being the Sport derivation of the ZF HP8 I can live with it(in any event, I still have the Club Sport and Wrangler to keep my left foot in practice).What do I like? The transmission actually does what I want it to do in Sport+/Manual mode- every other BMW automatic I have driven has tried to second-guess me- including the B7 press loaner I tested a while back. Think: electronic full manual valve body, for any older drag racers out there. Durability should be decent as the M235i Racing gets essentially the same transmission, albeit with more aggressive software.The Adaptive M Suspension literally transforms the car when you toggle into Sport or Sport+. It's almost like two different cars. I've never driven a BMW where the EDC or AMS made such a huge difference.The standard M Performance Power Kit really eliminates the turbo lag; with 330 lb-ft of torque available from 1300 rpm it almost feels like some of the big block Chevys I drove in my misspent street racing youth. Fuel economy is hovering around 25 mpg, which is more than good enough for me.Michelin PSS in a staggered setup are standard. No run flats!The sports seats with adjustable bolsters are excellent as expected. It's no wonder that BMW NA is making them standard fitment in many US models; the base seats in newer BMW are only good for generating business for chiropractors.The H-K audio is good enough that I don't feel like I have to tweak it right away.Dislikes?The steering could use a bit more feel. That said, the effort and ratio(s)-Variable Sport Steering is standard-is very good.I agree with Bob Harper fromBMW CAR : the IP needs oil and water temperature gauges instead of the ""///M 235i"" graphic that illuminates as soon as you open the driver's door The brakes are great but the pedal feel is somewhat wooden. No LSD. I will definitely have to add one sooner than later; at half throttle it will light up the rear tires in Comfort mode with DSC fully enabled.Track time will have to wait a few months. The 2ers first outing will be at Putnam Park- which is my ""home"" track. I'm too old to attempt to learn a car and a track at the same time. It will also see at least one night at the local 1/8th mile strip- might as well test the Launch Control...A couple of people asked me to compare it to the E30 M3; the 2er is not as light on its feet and it lacks the ""hard-wired to the synapses"" experience of the original M3. However, it is very comparable to the E46 M3 in terms of handling and braking. Power in contrast, is more akin to that of the E9x M3 at least from a usability standpoint on public roads. In any event, I can easily see keeping this car for a decade or more. Who knows when/if Munich will build anything RWD in this size class again?So... Is it worthy of an ///M badge? I'd say it's closer to an ""is,"" but that said, most everyone has forgotten that the first M car based on a production model was the E12 M535i- which boasted the M30 3.5 motor from the E24 635i along with an upgraded suspension, an M body kit, and aggressively bolstered front seats. Sound familiar?"
February 2016,"Live in Phoenix, yes easy gig"
February 2016,"FN, you live in that area of AZ, right? So an easy gig for you? Certainly sounds like fun!"
February 2016,"for a LT relationship, a well-rounded performer with rock solid reliability is not a bad thing to have. Likely better than one that ""wows"" in one area but comes with a lot of other compromises that can wear on you after a while?Maybe the difference between dating a wildcat (leasing) and marrying to grow old with (buy and keep for 10 years)?"
February 2016,"Greetings from sunny Phoenix.. Well the Auction week's are over here and what a event. The Barrett Jackson event is mind blowing on what they have.

February 2016,"Still love the TLX. Really good cars, regardless of which measuring stick you use. It's just not tops in any single category....except maybe bang for the buck!"
February 2016,I think I read that they were doing a refresh on the 50 for 2016 (or 2017 now?)did sit in the TLX again today. a really nice car. Super comfy seats. Really need to drive one eventually.
February 2016,"stick said he has that as his ""next car"" still, with next car being the next one after the one he gets a year from now! say that 5x  Any change coming down next year on the Q50 or 70 ?"
February 2016,"at the car show, my son did sit in the S3 again (bright red). He still loves those, but knows it is out of scope still. he has that as his ""next car"" still, with next car being the next one after the one he gets a year from now!"
February 2016,$60 in 1975 is about $270 today ...but not $1100 as the OP mentioned. Also the kinds of services included in that price are probably less labor than the service from the 1970's.
February 2016,One of the main reasons that I have not strayed too far from BMW is the fact that my dealer has an excellent service department and doesn't try to push unnecessary work. I also get a 20% discount on both parts and labor.
February 2016,$60 in 1975 is about $270 today
February 2016,"That's one reason that even though I love driving German cars, I've just had enough of their service and parts prices. Over the years the amount of actual service needed in cars has gone way down - I remember the '70's where I had to replace plugs, oil, adjust valves, timing, replace points and condenser - every 6K miles! It was a VW Bug. But in those days that service at an independent cost like $60. Today you do almost none of those things and yet the service is hundreds of dollars."
February 2016,"sweendogy Its a shame you don't live closer to me. My guy was a top guy over at Ray Catena MB / Audi dealership in NJ. Stuff like you mention would be a fraction of what dealers are asking if he did the work. Find a good reputable mechanic for flushes, brakes, rotors etc. $1100 ouch. I usually sell all my Bmw and MB by there 4th yr. My wife's 12, ML 350 has 48k on the clock and has no problems. Not going to push it but looking to upgrade her ride within this year. Next gen Q50 should be a better model . 2017 not sure . Great lease deals on the 16 models."
February 2016,"Funny or sad? It's February and infinit still selling the q50 as year 2015 new car, with no option for the 16 model - maybe they are skipping this year and will give the new engine a little later and call it a 2017? My s4 has 29k and change and in for the 35mile service - cost for Audi recommended is 1100 with a transmission flush plus filter and some other filer services. I will be paying around 500 for basically an oil change after declining others mentioned. It's been at the dealer for 2 days now as they try to find a volume button replacement (it fell off). Something to be said for Acura Infiniti Lexus service and pricing. The 2016 Audi A4 s type or whatever it's called is a nice looking car but in auto form with 2000 dealer miles my loaner is kind of a sled at best. Inside its amazing - comfortable but it's no sports sedan, in fact it's kind and of a snooze while waiting for the turbo to kick in. Oh and my car was backed into by the neighbors mini van a week ago- nice front side quarter crease - will post pix after the dealer finds a volume knob."
February 2016,"If you considered a small car but ended up buying something larger, a reporter wants to talk with you. Please email PR@edmunds.com by Friday, 2/5/16 with a few words about your decision including the make and model that you chose."
January 2016,I am having loads of fun with the Q50 in the snow!
January 2016,"Andres....unless there were some issues with CAFE standards, I really couldn't understand why Acura moved away from the 3.7. That was a sweet motor...and truthfully, not all that old.TLX-S would be a very nice addition. Not sure how Acura is positioning their turbo technology, though. Seems as if they're sticking with turbos only on their 4 cyl motors."
January 2016,Acura needs a TLX-S with the better 3.7 (vs. 3.5) tuned up to 330+ HP with proper transmission choices. Or maybe they could turbocharge the old gem of a 3.0 V6.
January 2016,"Acuras are funny like that.  They sell cheap for new, but then they don't really depreciate.  TL SH AWDs which sold for what $35K when new the last 2 years of production still have asking prices as CPO cars in the high $20s to low $30K range.Yeah....nice thing about Acuras (and Hondas in general) are how they retain their value. I know the brand is going through a bit of an identity crisis, but as Bradd says, they are good value when discounted as new cars. Matter of fact, tough to find a better value at $35k-$42K."
January 2016,"NY, now you know why I really really like our A3, t really is a nice looking vehicle. Ours being the base model with the extra safety features besides the back-up camera the wife had to have, it's a great package. It feels like a more expensive vehicle than it is the minute you open the door. As much as I like my Golf, like the A3 even more and the white over black is nice, not a combo I'd choose though. Luckily, she's keeping the mileage down so when the time is right, I'd still have a lower mileage A3.The Sandman"
January 2016,"I think at low end it is quicker than it feels, but once the ratios change at higher speeds, it really is sluggish. But it can be worse - new Chrysler 200 I drove recently was just awful at highway speeds."
January 2016,"Acuras are funny like that.  They sell cheap for new, but then they don't really depreciate.  TL SH AWDs which sold for what $35K when new the last 2 years of production still have asking prices as CPO cars in the high $20s to low $30K range."
January 2016,@kyfdx - then the WRX is off the table.  I can't have 2 out of 3 cars in the stable that my wife can't drive.  Does anybody know if the A3 Premium has some sort of backup camera?
January 2016,"@dino001 - there does seem to be a considerable amount of wind noise compared to my E90 which as you know is a bank vault.  I've gotten used to it.  The BMW also had a sticker price of $20K more.  I'm not thrilled with the mileage compared to the engine's output.  There's not much accleration at all, not just above 60! LOL!"
January 2016,"Drove CVT Legacy. Good mileage, but the whining engine wasn't much pleasure. Lots of noise, not much acceleration above 60 mph."
January 2016,"I was thinking that maybe we could tweak the software to delete the term ""CVT"", when appearing in the same post with the letters ""WRX"""
January 2016,"Actually, I liked the CVT in the Legacy (or at least, never noticed it, which is a good thing). A perfectly fine solution for that car.But a WRX needs to have a stick shift. Not an AT of any kind. Kyfdx has my back on this!"
January 2016,"@nyccarguy @stickguy is correct. WRX requires a stick-shift.We let you buy an E30 BMW with an automatic, but now this is getting out of hand."
January 2016,"@stickguy - I know the CVT has its critics.  Rightfully so. One that's not properly designed or engineered could be disastrous.  I do business with a guy who had one replaced on a Jeep Compass twice.  Once on Chrysler's dime @ 60K, then again on his credit card @ 120K.  It is part of the reason I bought the 100K extended warranty for my Legacy.Living with the CVT for 16 months and a little over 25K miles, I'm pretty impressed with it.  Those who don't know (the wife) think it is a traditional automatic transmission (plus I'd get the eye roll if I tried to explain otherwise).  It is very linear & smooth.  It doesn't drone as some reviews suggest (trust me, I'd know).  It also makes the most of my Legacy's meager 175 hp.A CVT wouldn't deter me from a WRX"
January 2016,"Forgot to mention. A WRX should have a stick shift. Not a CVT. Not negotiable.@breld, I really like the TLX. Excellent interior, and I like the way it looks. That is also on my short list for next car in a 1.5 years (and yes, probably slightly used). Though unlike many of you here, I would get the FWD 4 cyl. version. Plenty of scoot for me, and lighter on it's feet, plus cheaper and better MPG."
January 2016,"You can build the new A4 at Audi's website now. Trims and packages seem to be simplified from the last model, at least for now. Again, I think the DSG and ""upgraded"" 2.0t make it an attractive and competitive choice."
January 2016,"@nyccarguy - TLXs are starting to sprout up on the used market as well, and with what seems to be some quick deprecation. I'm not saying the base model necessarily competes with some of the leaders in this segment, but getting one with the tech package for, let's say, mid to high $20k's is a pretty compelling package at that price. Though you'd be going back to FWD, which based on where your heads at, may not be compelling at all."
January 2016,"one thing I would worry about, knowing some of the bombed out roads you drive on, is how tiring the ride/noise would get commuting in the WRX. Seems like a much better ""fun"" car to me!Maybe just because I am getting old, but I appreciate comfort these days too. Though I did come darned close to getting that Civic Si last summer... Now that was a screaming deal."
January 2016,"@stickguy - that A4 is nice, but I think the 2013s & up are facelifted to modernize the look just a little bit more. I wouldn't touch an Audi without a 100K factory warranty. Which brings me to my next point, for less than the $34,950 sticker priced A3 I built I could head to Subaru and get a WRX Limited. I know it's not an Audi, but one thing I'm very happy with so far is Subaru's cost of ownership/maintenance. Plus I dig that functional hood scoop."
January 2016,"you would probably like this one too if B on B is your thing.

Caught my eye enough to come home & build one on the Audi website. 2.0T Quattro Premium (AWD, Pano Roof, 6 Speed STronic) with optional hot seats & sport suspension. Nice package for a $34,950 sticker price. 220 hp / 258 lb ft torque"
January 2016,"IMNSHO, your only sure bet to get a newer BMW that actually drives-at least a little-like a traditional BMW is to find a Sport/M Sport 2 Series, 3 Series, or 4 Series."
January 2016,"I plan to look at Audi, MB and BMW next time and go the CPO route to insure a vehicle that should last a good amount of time. Will pounce on our A3 if she decides to get something else though as her mileage will be pretty low in a few years. If not, leaning towards BMW to see what the fuss is about.Sat in a new Civic and liked the ergonomics and all. Will be interesting to drive one and see how much it's improved since my 2006 LX. Besides the HR-V, nothing else in their lineup moves me in any way. Felt like I've done that already.The Sandman"
January 2016,@roadburner totally agree
January 2016,A CPO car is only as good as the certifying dealer; I've bought 3 CPO cars from my local BMW dealer and they were all in excellent shape.
January 2016,"one good thing about the luxo brands is the nice long warranty. the dealer I have been keeping an eye on has had a number of 2 MY (even some 1 MY) used models, so we are talking 2-3 years elapsed max. So 1-2 years BtoB + another 2 years powertrain left on it. So while not certified, still plenty of coverage in case of any bugs it might have when you buy it."
January 2016,"@sandman_6472 while not lux CPO related my wife bought a CPO Honda CR-V in 2010. Car had very low miles 15k, ex-l with nav and was Honda certified. I bought the car sight unseen 200 miles away and picked it up- we had it for a month and it mostly sat (less then 300 miles, so 100 miles minus the pickup) until we were planning a big east coast trip of 1200 so I decided to look under the hood and noticed the oil level was low- also noticed a leak- looked around one tire was a little low- started looking at structural stuff noticed some gaps larger then others on the front end- then found a piece in the engine bay -and googled the serial number which I found to be a lower piece of the bumper.( or older bumper) - took car on a Sunday to my local Honda dealer (huge chain) and had the service manager who also is a certified Honda tech and asked if this car should of been certified- and he pointed out 10 issues including major front end damage that would have disqualified this car from such CPO status - I was lucky he was willing to put this in writing and making my case with both Honda and the selling dealer easier in getting compensation. Net net - you don't always get a certified car- BUT if you go to a honest bigger dealer (and go lux) you have a better chance of getting that peach. I bot a 8 month old s4 2 years ago - non CPO- got a good deal and have had no issues(knock on wood) sorry about long post."
January 2016,That X-3 looks like it's running very well. Interesting to see this. I never performed an oil sample analysis.

December 2015,"Am thinking that a CPO luxury level vehicle is the best way to buy one used since the company's have a certain check list of things that must be done besides an oil change and tire rotation. Personally, I'd have more confidence in purchasing a vehicle that has been CPO'd than one that hasn't and would be willing to pay a slight premium for it just knowing the odds are in my favor for a more pleasant ownership experience.One thing about the folks who frequent these forums, we all seem to have a passion for our vehicles, that passion that makes us want to take better care of our vehicles and keep them in tip top shape.

December 2015,"This is why getting a CPO BMW or any other brand that offers free maintenance is usually a good bet, since the new owner doesn't pay for service and can be in and out of a service department in about 15 minutes."
December 2015,"Well, the X3 was practically new; it had 16,500 miles on it and was just over a year old. You are absolutely right about prior owners; they can either enhance the reliability or ""poison the pond"" as it were."
December 2015,"And that too! Of course, for that to really work it helps to buy the car new. I'm also conscientious but I've had to pay for the previous owner's neglect sometimes....or worse yet, for the factory's engineering gaffs."
December 2015,I don't think it's good luck- it's conscientious and consistent maintenance.
December 2015,"Yeah, but not everyone with a miled up X3 has a knowledgeable dad to fix everything, nor do they have your good luck. Remember, risk assessment is based on an actuarial. If you just interviewed 100 year old men you'd never predict actual life expectancy."
December 2015,"Well, at the 182,370 mile Oil Service my son's X3 also needed two serpentine belts as well as rear pads and rotors. Oh the horror!!!"
December 2015,"Yes I think that's exactly right---usually 100K, or 90K, or maybe 105K, is a big service and many people skip out before having to do that. Also it's not unusual to need tires and brakes at that mileage, which are normal wear items. I mean, how many sellers would do ALL those things and then sell the car?"
December 2015,"Perhaps some of that comes from having to replace serpentine belts, timing belts, etc at or near the 100K mile mark?"
December 2015,I bet we could find some
December 2015,I have a co-worker who has a first year new Gen camero with 145K miles on it and no major repairs on it. Of course I told him now that he spoke about it openly he will have problems now with it.
December 2015,"Yeah, I would expect a new-ish car to still be in pretty good shape at 80K. But parts do wear. Maybe the glove box door is as good at 80K as it was when new but parts that go round and round and up and down have to show wear at 80K. And don't forget the psychological barrier of 99.9K miles and how that affects resale value. I think there is a mileage or number in people's heads as to when a car is ready for repairs. Not sure what that number is, but 99,999 sounds about right."
December 2015,"@tlong, sounds like my (now gone)2000 TL. Had some stuff around 140k (struts, tires, motor mount). Then nothing really for about 4 years up to 175k, then a few breakdowns in rapid succession, just before my son graduated (he had it at college). Rear window motor failed, coil packs died, alternator crapped out. He got good at calling AAA. Plus one HID got wonky. That was a painful year of supporting old car long distance! Thankfully never broke down in transit."
December 2015,"That 80k mark was probably correct up to about twenty years. Since the late 90s it seems that has stretched another 30k or so. Heck, back in 60s and 70s you started having major repairs by 70k and a car over 100k was worth next to nothing."
December 2015,"Well that 80K marker doesn't mean something outright fails. It means it has become substandard. Many many people drive around quite contentedly with cars, that if subjected to inspection, could justify quite a few repairs. At 80K for instance, your car's struts still work fine, but they aren't anywhere as good as new, and a worn ball joint wouldn't exhibit any difference to the driver. Nor would mushy motor mounts, glazed fan belts, or cracked exhaust hangers."
December 2015,"Yes, I much rely on one car to do it all, and I can't have breakdowns. I don't have the time or money or patience. My S4 was fixed same day I took it in; the leaky windshield washer fluid tank was actually a hose that came off of the headlight washer system that attaches to the tank. Can I blame this on the body shop or Audi? I think 90% chance the body shop is to blame since the leak was by the front of the car, 10% chance Audi should have made the hoses with better clamps. Fortunately, I'm able to drive without windshield washer fluid, and the tank must have a 1/3 or 1/4 reserve below the hose lines so it still worked, was just low soon after using it a few times (tripping a warning light)."
December 2015,"My experiences don't match that - I usually don't find significant repair costs until around 120K, My Acura TL (2005) is at 155K right now and I had my first significant repair at around 130K, which was $1300 for some suspension work (control arms, etc.). And that has been about it other than the routine stuff. I also had a Jetta go to 143K, an Accord go way over 100K with no issues, and a Mercury Villager with the first big repair around 170K."
December 2015,"And then there are the dreadful cases of the dealer being unable to fix the car, even under warranty, or it requiring numerous attempts."
December 2015,Sure it is.....who wants to hassle with repairs whether it's covered by warranty or not. Number of recalls is also a factor. Sure it gets fixed for free but can be a hassle if not done during routine maintenence.
December 2015,"Sure it's cheaper because you have amortized the depreciation, and even $150 a month in repairs is 1/2 or 1/3rd a lease or car payment. But, when buying new, it's worth considering a particular model's historical reliability record."
December 2015,"A lot of this is situational. If you have 5 vehicles there is always a spare if one if one or two aren't available. No long commutes or retired with time to spare. Most depend greatly on one car and don't have the time or want to hassle with repairs. It doesn't take a brain surgeon to understand that keeping a car for the very long term is cheaper. However, money is not the only or even the main factor for many especially those that buy luxury cars."
December 2015,"I think right around 80K, most cars are going to start to cost you money, or time, or both. At least potentially. Some people are luckier than others, or more conscientious, as the case may be. It REALLY helps when you own the car from new!"
December 2015,"Haven't had to do any nursing as I see it; and aside froma bit of interior wear it looks and drives like a car with one-fourth the actual mileage.,"
December 2015,I did the nursing an old car along long distance once. Never again. Plus the thought of my daughter calling me to say she broke down along the side of the DC beltway is terrifying!
December 2015,"My son brought his 2004 X3 2.5i home from college; it just turned over 182k miles. My wife has been letting him drive her E90 3er while he's home to keep excess miles off his truck. Funny thing; my wife and I both usually prefer light and nimble cars, yet we both like driving his sled more than her E90. I can't put my finger on why exactly- but there it is. Since he's had it at SC it has needed a new battery and a starter, but at that mileage I can't complain too much. The suspension is completely untouched; it's going to the dealer in a couple of days for an Oil Service so we will see if anything needs attention. Even if something does turn up I won't be that upset, as we bought it in 2005 and paid it off in 2007. It would take a lot of expensive repairs to equal eight years of lease or loan payments(over $46,000- based on the average U.S. monthly car payment of $483)."
December 2015,actually sounds like they addressed some of the key issues. I could be tempted by the 2.0t option!
December 2015,Interesting engine choices from Nissan errr Infinitihttp://www.caranddriver.com/news/2016-infiniti-q50-official-photos-and-info-news
December 2015,It's certainly getting some nice reviews.
December 2015,"With the increased hp on the 2.0t and the DSG trannie, the new A4 does seem very competitive."
December 2015,"read the review in one of this month's car magazines on the new A4. Sounded really nice. Interior though seemed pretty familiar, but I suspect the fancy new dashboard screen is cool."
December 2015,Nice shot!
December 2015,I would also guess the rears would wear faster if you lived on a hill and used the parking break a lot - like my wife does. Maybe wrong on this but who knows - 30k miles and have to do rears hurts when you go to a Honda dealer. Glamor shot time
December 2015,"Interestingly, the B58 reverts back to a mechanical water pump. However, the timing chain/VANOS assembly is now located at the rear of the engine..."
December 2015,A while back we were discussing best engines....here's a new list from Wards 10 Best.http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2015/12/wards-10-best-engines-2016-equal-parts-performance-parsimonious/
December 2015,My 2008 Passat got new brakes on the rear at around 99k miles. The fronts were still good when I sold the car at around 105k.
December 2015,"I've been told by techs that since front brakes do most of the work, the OEM brake pads on the rear are thinner. The goal is so that all four wheels reach replacement at the same time. The 2005 Passat I just traded had the rears done at 60K and all four were due to be done when I traded at 135K. I never did the fronts in that time.I also just changed the rears on the my 2011 Explorer at just about 60K as well."
December 2015,"It does seem that way, but typical for BMWs."
December 2015,"Yeah.. my dealer quoted around $600 just to do the rear brakes on my '06 model BMW. A lot of that is the OEM BMW rotors. Really, really pricy. I had my independent do the job with BMW pads and sensor, but with aftermarket rotors. Saved about half."
December 2015,"Same with my 06 Passat. Rear pads replaced around 50k, rotors left intact and didn't need resurfacing. Not sure this answer was correct but the service advisor told me there was more bias dialed to the rear brakes than in the past to take some of the stress off the front brakes. (?)"
December 2015,"Are there other BMW dealers in your area? If not, sounds like a captive audience and little chance for getting another quote unless an independent shop does the work."
December 2015,"Happened in my (former) TSX & our Pilot as well. It doesn't make sense as the cars are platforms are FWD & the cars are nose heavy. One service adviser at a Honda dealer told me it is because they put rear brake pads ""the size of oreo cookies"" on the cars."
December 2015,Honda's for some reason had a phase where the rears wore out much quicker than the front. I learned this when it happened to my Accord.
December 2015,"Geez, that's BMW 7-series money."
December 2015,Exactly.
December 2015,Ferodo Street Sport pads. Expensive? Yes. Worth it? Yes.
December 2015,Why would rear brakes be the first to go? Seems counter-intuitive.
December 2015,"Clarification -- new rotors were only required, so they said, if the pads were being replaced. Can't imagine what other conditions besides a brake rotor and/or brake pad replacement are even possible. The good news, they did it at no charge.My neighbor was not so lucky -- at 55,000 miles, the front brakes (pads+rotors) were changed on his X5. Parts were, at the time, $900-ish. And then, of course, was the labor. Front only. Front only. Stunning -- and painful."
December 2015,For ALL FOUR WHEELS?
December 2015,"They fed you a line; when my BMW dealer replaced the rear pads on my son's X3 at 132,214 miles I was told that the rear rotor thickness was within BMW specs and replacement was not required. markcincinnati said:BMW costs, thankfully covered, were a small four figure number for new brakes for a 2008 X3. Whew, avoided that one.
Wow. My dealer charged less than $1,000 to replace the pads and rotors on the X3 at 60,618 miles."
December 2015,"I've had two A6's have their brakes replaced and I have the wear pattern progression of both my wife's SQ5 and my S4. She has over 50K on hers and the dealer says she'll probably need new REAR brakes in less than 10K miles from now. Not sure what that means with respect to when the FRONT brakes would need replacing.Audi suggests new rotors, on our BMW's the service dept said BMW prohibits a ""brake job"" from being carried out without also changing the rotors. On my 2005 A6, I had all four brakes (rotors included) replaced at around 48K miles at no charge under the Audi advantage. That option, via the Audi advantage, now is only free for the first 12K miles if I read the AA correctly.BMW costs, thankfully covered, were a small four figure number for new brakes for a 2008 X3. Whew, avoided that one.Audi prices, still breathtaking, seem to be lower, but it seems to me that the costs would be still at least 75% of the BMW costs (at the dealer). On my 2001 A6, I bought cross drilled rotors (not from the dealer) and took them to the dealer for installation.I love the brakes on our Audis -- and 50 to 60K for replacement doesn't seem horrible -- what does seem to be the case though is that the costs (using Audi parts) do seem too high. Yet, the brakes are one area that I am certainly not willing to go no-name brand installed at Midas, or where ever.We'll probably get the new REARS on the SQ5 at the dealer and pay a couple hundred bucks more for peace of mind."

December 2015,He's in MA which most likely has high labor rates just like CA
December 2015,"I could get you a quote from a California Audi shop, which of course will reflect our labor rates. I don't remember where you are residing, sorry. So, you want a quote for pads and rotors all the way 'round?"
December 2015,Thank you community for the answers - much appreciated. I will look Indi as I have a service due in another 3500 miles or so. Has any Audi or s4 owner had to do brakes yet? Or BMW person ? If so mileage at time of service would be appreciated
December 2015,"At my BMW dealer I get a 20% discount on service as well as the parts and accessories I pick up for DIY projects. My Mazda dealer usually has a coupon I can use, and of course they also gave me free oil changes for as long as I own the car. I also have a few indie shops I can use that do excellent work."
December 2015,"Agree regarding finding a well qualified shop -- one that specializes in your brand, for these cars are breathtakingly expensive to maintain and repair after the OEM warranty/""free"" service period expires.ONE factor in favor of the dealer -- and it may or may not impress you -- they (ours anyway) will do it right the first time and if not, make it right for no extra charge. That has not been my experience with the folks who don't charge like a dealer.Nevertheless, there are competent specialists in most cities, and my opinion is that they will save you money. My wife likes the loaner program, so she values the free loaner very much."
December 2015,I'd bet you could get that done at a very good indie shop for under $1000.
December 2015,"@sweendogy - you should definitely research some independent shops in your area. I'm sure there are many that are more than qualified. For instance, the mechanic that works on my car. He gets OEM parts from the part manufacturer, not necesearily the auto manufacturer. Let's say Audi uses a certain sensor for the brakes. He'll get the sensor in the Bosch Box, not from Audi. His overhead is also much less than the gorgeous dealer with loaner cars, flat screen TVs, free WiFi, coffee...Let's say the dealer wants to charge $1500 to do pads & rotors on all 4 corners, a solid independent shop might charge $800 or so."
December 2015,"General question...Has anyone had to do any repairs on these cars lately.? Brakes, tires anything non-oil change related. Reason for the ask wondering when I will have to go for brakes and dreading the potential cost. Knock on wood 27k miles not a gremlin to be found- also 430 mile round trip recently almost did a round tripper at 27mpg without a stop but wussed out as the gas light came on with over 2 gallons left. Any Color appreshaited"
December 2015,"Consumers reports probably is the most representative of real world times. They drive like normal people. Light changes, hit the gas! street start (rolling at 5 MPH) is also good indicator of flexibility. Exposes cars that need to have the snot revved out of them and clutch dumped to get moving.40-80 is probably the best overall window of useful power application."
December 2015,"I look at 0-100 and 50-70 in-gear times to get a good idea of the overall power and flexibility of the drivetrain. That and responsive handling(with fairly high limits) are non-negotiable. I strongly prefer RWD and three pedals, although I can be persuaded by a decent DCT/DSG; ditto for AWD that actually enhances high performance driving- see: STI and the S and RS edition Audis."
December 2015,"Here...Here! So true.I do remember when I put so much stock into 0-60 numbers from the car rags. That is, until I read an article (probably from C&D or R&D) that showed how they came up with those numbers. Usually, it was a get the revs up, drop the clutch, and try to keep it in a straight line, sort of ordeal. I don't drive like that (at least, not any more).These days, I look at the entire package. Steering, handling, suspension's abilities to negotiate rough pavement without dancing...somewhere down the list is acceleration. Got to admit, even lux cars and mundane sedans are pretty darned quick these days."
December 2015,"Swinging back to the topic of shopping entry level performance cars (but not forgetting what we were knocking about), I personally don't pay too much attention to numbers when shopping for a car. As many car enthusiasts know, there is a ""car's numbers"" and there's ""how a car performs in the real world"", and those two things can be very different."
December 2015,I'm sure since the product is in beta testing we shall see more numbers to come.
December 2015,"I guess my sarcasm didn't come across. I agree, a leaky washer fluid tank is hardly anything to worry about. If that's the only thing that goes wrong in 37K miles, that's pretty excellent in my book."
December 2015,I think I said that you had checked out the numbers.
December 2015,"It is a good number compared to the advertised hp, but 331 hp isn't all that extraordinary compared to a lot of other performance cars on the market. stickguy's comment made it sound as it 331 hp is some astronomical power number and it just isn't."
December 2015,Well since BMW quotes the power of the 340 to be at 320hp. I would think 331 is a excellent number.
December 2015,"Did you read the article that I posted? I don't think you did.... It was a Beta test, more testing to come."
December 2015,"I never implied anything of the sort with BMS. Advising people to research data from impartial sources rather than the manufacturer seems like good advice to me, whether it's ""lasts three times as long as leading deodorant"" or ""highest interest CD available today"". Consumer Reports built an empire on this very principle. If a manufacturer's claims are substantiated they are rewarded. C'mon, you don't blindly accept every claim from every product. You check it out. You checked out BMS, I know you did. Would I do a second dyno test after spending say $600 on a chip or re-flash or whatever. Sure I would. This is also the method of coming to forums. We want to know other's experiences about entry-level performance cars. We want to read calibrated road tests. We want assurance that we're buying the real thing."
December 2015,"So you can't point to any one company but you are willing to post that we shouldn't trust these dyno runs because of ""possible"" issues? I highly doubt that BMS will post wrong info, they aren't a big company that could hire a PR firm to undo the damage of such wrong claims."
December 2015,"Seems like you can add in a correction factor prior to the pull or you can mess with the pressure sensors. Some types of dynos would be easier to cheat on than others of course. Dynos, after all, are a major sales tool. This issue comes up in other forums when complaints come in about certain dynos in certain shops reading suspiciously high, all the time, every time. So I can't point to any one company or incident, but there is obviously monkey business going on here and there. How they do it, I don't know exactly."
December 2015,Please tell us how numbers can be conjurer?
December 2015,"Less than one wants, more than one needs."
December 2015,331 hp at the wheels is decent but nothing extraordinary.
December 2015,"331 at the wheels isn't enough? Is everyone big daddy Don Garlits now?Assuming 20% discount you are talking about an actual 400+ rating, right?"
December 2015,"yeah, but.....dynos are not absolute numbers, they can be conjurer's tricks. I'd like to see results from say three independent dynos. I can make a dyno give you any number you pick. There are a number of videos on YouTube in which dyno claims are tested---some prove true, some miss the mark."
December 2015,"So the numbers are in on the new BMW 340. BMS just Dynoed one, 331 to the wheels, it's quoted as making 320hp.. Now with the new Beta version of the BMS JB4 it makes 379hp at the wheel, that is with pump premium unleaded. a nice 48hp jump with a +3 lbs of boost..http://www.bimmerfest.com/news/884502/burger-tuning-just-posted-jb4-beta-dyno-numbers-for-the-340-380hp-380-tq/"
December 2015,"Both the Mazdaspeed Intake as well as the Hypertech Sport Tuner have CARB approval. As to why Mazda didn't sell the car that way from the get-go? In the case of the intake I'd say probably it's due to the fact it uses a washable filter, is a bit louder, and requires a bit more effort to access the filter. As for the tune, Mazda actually did offer a tune on the Australian 3 MPS Extreme, which boosted power by 18 hp and torque by 33 lb-ft."
December 2015,"Mr_Shiftright said:I don't think he missed the point. I think he's making another point. Maybe we could look at it this way. If it was simple and cheap to give a Mazda 3 some 60 more HP, why wouldn't Mazda just do that? It would give them a tremendous edge on the competition and would make the car the darling of the auto magazines. The Mazda engineers must have been weighing something other than cost in this decision. After all, Mazda could build those mods you made for a fraction of what it cost you. 
Well, one data point is hardly a thesis. Another issue we know little about may be emissions and EPA certification. Do mods change those and how would that change legal picture, if sold as an official model?"
December 2015,"Because it is a limited warranty. It is a modest gain in power in those instances and they only need to cover it for 50k, 60k, or what have you. They may know, just for example, the unmodded engines can go 150k, while the modded ones go 120k. Either is certainly covered by warranty, but they'd rather have more of the 150k cars running around to uphold some face. If they made strictly vehicles that only lasted just past their warranty, it wouldn't bode well for their reputation."
December 2015,"heck, the BMW tune is ""free"" to BMW since they have the computer in there anyway. So it seems like a no brainer to give the car all the extra power for the same price."
December 2015,"I don't think he missed the point. I think he's making another point. Maybe we could look at it this way. If it was simple and cheap to give a Mazda 3 some 60 more HP, why wouldn't Mazda just do that?

The Mazda engineers must have been weighing something other than cost in this decision. After all, Mazda could build those mods you made for a fraction of what it cost you."
December 2015,"Dino I'm sorry you can't grasp the idea that the extra HP from the chips haven't reduced reliability, even Roadrunner has stated he has no problems with 154K miles on a car. All my motorcycles engine have modifications and have been stone reliable."
December 2015,"You're missing my point entirely. It's not if they can take it, it's which configuration is optimal for certain position in the market, considering all factors. Apparently they believe factory configuration represents a better mix for the market. You say they warrant those mods. Just because it keeps the warranty, doesn't mean it's equally reliable. Do you know what portion of that price is set aside for the warranty? I don't. What I know are principles behind the engineering and they teach me nothing is free, everything is a tradeoff. Small, or large."
December 2015,"I believe BMW and for that matter most sport car manufactures have engineered their engines to perform with added stress and still be reliable, I asked this before and you and others haven't comments.. BMW markets the MPK and MPE for their cars, if it would cause added stress and lower reliability why would they make them and warrens them? Maybe they know the engines can take it? Nah that can't be it."
December 2015,"I suspect the longevity of your cars relate much more to the high level of maintenance you give them then to the alleged benign nature of the modifications. Also I am sure you would agree that not all chips are engineered to a high standard, and that the consumer who is shopping price rather than reputation may end up with some rather bad results.I did some homework when I modified the supercharger on my car. I opted for colder spark plugs a larger intercooler and using the very best engine oils. So far so good. I will throw a check engine light though if I do a long hard climb up a mountain on a hot day. No doubt related to fuel mixture."
December 2015,"I think it depends on the vehicle as well as the power increase that is sought. On my modified cars I have only pursued modest gains in horsepower/torque. Those gains might erode the reliability at the margin, but not to any significant extent. UOAs consistently indicate that the engines in my MS3 as well as my Club Sport are in excellent shape, so I'm not losing any sleep over the tweaks the cars have received."
December 2015,"Well said. There is no way of saying with certainty that an individual vehicle broke because of the mods. However, the statistics and principles of physics say that the probability of such failure increased, it could be by a little or a lot, depending on how big the mod was, how the car was driven, etc. It's fine to mod the car, if that's what floats one's boat. The cost may be instantly evident, or deferred in time (perhaps beyond the ownership span), it may be high or low. The benefits may as well be worth it for the owner, outweighing that cost, I'm not disputing that, either. I simply disagree with the ""zero cost whatsoever"" notion."
December 2015,"I think that the engineers that design the car could tell you, on a statistical basis, what the likelihood is.My teenager thinks you can chip a car, with no adverse effects, ever. But, then again, he has never paid a car repair bill. Want to see the effect of mods? Go shop for a used Subaru WRX, note the mods, then note the repairs."
December 2015,"Sure, it doesn't affect fuel economy...unless you actually use that extra power, at which point, why tune it at all? So, yes, it does increase fuel usage when you are utilizing those extra ponies. Nothing wrong with that.As to ""same reliability,"" well, that's a premature argument, and lacks a control. You actually have no idea how it has affected or will affect the reliability. I broke my 135i. Did the mods do it or was it doomed to happen even if stock? There is no way for anybody to know."
December 2015,"But how about reliability, longevity? Can you say with certainty, it's unchanged? Noise, wear, low end vs. high end torque. I suppose it's possible that current factors of safety are so high that the lowering them does not bring appreciable differences. I just caution against ""it's all free"" attitude. In nature, nothing is free. You always pay somewhere. Engineering is an act of balancing competing interests, as people have different interests, it will result in different products, but everything comes with a price."
December 2015,"My MS3 gets the same mileage as it did prior to installing the tune; there's no magic involved- the tune modifies the ignition advance, fueling, and boost primarily at higher rpm and throttle openings. At cruise the car is running on what is essentially the stock map, with perhaps a bit more spark advance dialed in.For what it's worth, BMW also claims that their MPPK does not affect fuel economy."
December 2015,"You say that, but yor statement violates basic principles of engineering. You essentially say you found a way to get something for nothing, no energy in, more energy out, by a wave of a wand. I wish I could do it in structural design, but I can't."
December 2015,"Count me in as one who modifies their cars and who has yet to find a down side(with the exception of my first car, where I added a cam with about ten degrees too much duration). My M6 received a Dinan chip while my Club Sport has a Turner/Conforti chip; it has over 140k on it. My MS3 makes over 60 hp more than stock via a Mazdaspeed intake and a Hypertech tune- and it has 157k on it.I guess I must lead an infinitely charmed life..."
December 2015,"ANd people want more, so your point is?When it comes to Chipped stuff, I get the same MPG as I did before I chipped my 320i, same reliability, so again your point?"
December 2015,"Exactly...if you order mods from BMW, you are making a choice about what you are getting and what you might be giving up."
December 2015,"But some people want to have it just the way it is - for them this mix of performance, reliability and gas mileage is just right, not some chipped stuff. Want more performance (power, suspension), less mileage, more wear (on tires, brakes) and lower factor of safety, got pay up, plain and simple."
December 2015,"The Sport Package on the 320i is really a great package, give you all the suspension parts , seats, and steering wheel (M Sport) wheels and tires plus for the first time the 320i can be had with the M Sport Adjustable suspension, this is part of the track package. When it comes to leasing, a 328i with the same packages as the 320i, will lease for less money or slightly more. So the 328i over all is a better value."
December 2015,"I agree to a point, however, BMW offers factory performance upgrades, I'm sure BMS and others do the same thing these factory upgrades do, more boost, timing, fuel/air mixture."
December 2015,"I wasn't agreeing about automatics in general, it was only with respect to 320i buyers. I'm always reminded of the idiot I met at my dealer's F30 intro party. Some of us were talking about the F30's potential track capability and one poor fool chimed in to say that he would never take a car to the track, because he works too hard keeping it clean. He went on to say the reason he wanted an automatic was because ""I want to be able to get in the car and not have to think about anything."""
December 2015,"Taking it on a racetrack also counts as not ""wearing"" the car."
December 2015,"That just doesn't apply anymore, otherwise I am a poseur because I bought my 135i with the auto to get around the track faster.No one thinks the rules apply to them.."
December 2015,"That just doesn't apply anymore, otherwise I am a poseur because I bought my 135i with the auto to get around the track faster."
December 2015,"Used to Be a Pet Peeve, Now Just ConfusingI used to represent these remarks:I participate some, but read at lot of postings on Audiworld. I read the posts of folks who seem to research and often agonize over the new Audi they have or are about to order.Then, as time passes, their new prize possessions arrive and they take pictures of their soon to be delivered rides -- they post them and seem to beam with pride about the new car they have acquired.Next, pictures of the new cars in the owner's driveways or garages are posted -- and the captions on these pics are ""Let the Mods Begin.""Later, the details of the aftermarket wheels, tires, engine management chips, breathing management aids and even brake rotors are detailed along with the window tinting expenses and, sometimes, even elaborate retrofitting of navigation systems to cars not factory equipped with nav systems are laid out, including the sometimes breathtaking costs required to add such features aftermarket.In some cases the modifications involve the suspension systems, exhaust systems and underhood plumbing (for the super or turbo chargers) too.The expenses seem to have no ceiling -- and as soon as one is completed, the next improvement is lusted after in print on the Audiworld forum for that particular model.Often, so it seems, these mods exceed the costs of simply ordering the cars with the factory upgrade. I mean, really, I have seen folks mod their A4 SLines so much that they reach and sometimes surpass the MSRPs of the car so lusted after, the S4.The mods that make the A4 have more power often will void the warranty. The S4, stock, comes with a very nice warranty.Why buy a nearly $50K A4 and mod the crap out of it so that you have more than the cost of an unmodded S4 in it, knowing that the S4 is likely to outperform the modded A4?Is the joy of modding the joy? If a stock S4 can be had for about the same cost as a modded A4 (which then loses its warranty) what in the wide wide world of sports would posses someone to do this?BTW, I said, it takes one to know one -- but I must admit, my modding was limited to a chip put into an Audi turbo engine for a total cost well under $1000. But I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now.Color me confused."
December 2015,Yep...
December 2015,count the pedals. That will help weed them out.
December 2015,"I think that a ""real enthusiast"" who isn't a horsepower junkie might buy a properly equipped 320i- but I'll concede that probably 99% of 320i buyers are ""lease to wear"" poseur/dweebs.BMS= Burger Motorsports; their JB4 Performance Tuner is a very well regarded piece of equipment in the BMW community."
December 2015,"Factory engineers have to compromise to give consumers a streetable package, decent MPG, good longevity, and a car that passes all emissions requirements. If they could just chip a car and give it a large HP boost over the competition, they would have done it. Obviously they didn't for some reasons related to the above parameters."
December 2015,"Couple of things what is BMS? (My wife gets the other MS monthly) In my eyes BMW has the right to void any warrantee - certainly on leased cars because they make mucho duckets on the used market - I get that.@Mr_Shiftright has a point here - if you can afford the extra payment go for power. BMW offers ""el cheapo"" to get people in the door. Real enthusiasts will pay more for 328 or 333 or even m cars."
December 2015,"Yes, before I put the BMS on Rick's 328, I did back to back rides, and even though the GT is heavier it felt faster. Now that the GT has the BMS, it is much faster then my 320i."
December 2015,"I made a mistake when I bought my 320i, I should have gotten a 328i. Listen learned... I almost pulled a trigger on a BMW Loaner, basically it was a fully loaded 328i, M Sport, Tech, DHP, Premium, Drivers Assistance package, heated seats. It only had 4K miles on it, MSRP was 52K, final sale price was $44K, but I would have had to roll about 9K into the deal, lease payments would have been about 576/m with zero out of pocket. decided not to do it. I'll tough it out until Oct 2017 when we a another ED. I like the M2, but I think it will be small, I'm hoping that BMW will build a M4 Grand Coupe for 2018, if not then a 440i Grand Coupe it shall be, with the MPPK, and MPE, which makes more HP then the BMW stage 1."
November 2015,"@flightnurse - I completely understand what you are saying. There are those like yourself who want a little extra oomph (I drive a 175 hp 4cyl Legacy daily so I know about needing and wanting extra oomph), and those that modify the car within an inch of its life. I really don't think BMW wants owners modifying their cars in any way. They don't even want owners checking their own oil with a dipstick for cryin' out loud.Going with what @Mr_Shiftright said, did you price out a 328i similarly equipped to your 320i? Now that you have Rick's 328xi GT back stateside, have you driven the 2 cars back to back? Do you plan to keep your 320i for the long haul or will you start looking once the end of the 50K warranty is coming near?I hope you don't think I'm trying to pick a fight with you. I'm honestly curious to your mindset. I'm completely neurotic when it comes to ""pushing the envelope"" with certain things. I KNOW I'd be the guy that gets caught & has to fight not to get my warranty voided.Just as an example, this past Saturday night my wife & I took our 3 kids to an AHL (minor league) hockey game. We always get the kids something to eat when we go to an event, but we do like to bring our own juice, water, & snacks so we don't spend a car payment on concessions. My wife brings a bag in, holding our daughter & gets waved right through. My bag gets searched thoroughly & a few bottles of water as well as bags of chips get tossed before I walk in."
November 2015,"There comes a time in the quest for HP when, if you want a faster car, you should go out and buy a faster car."
November 2015,"Brad you are missing the point, BMW knows that people will chip their cars and have a safety net built in regarding added HP. I do not think the BMS stage 1 will cause the engine to be less reliable then a stock engine. I have 38K miles on my 320i and ever have had an engine issue or code thrown. OF course there are those with 320i's who are really pushing those engines making upwards of 300hp. I would assume that BMW, Audi and any manufacture with a turbo engine would assume a certain percentage of owners would ""chip"" their cars to get the extra HP from them. If they don't, then they aren't being realistic."
November 2015,"I distinctly remember having this discussion before. @flightnurse also has his 320i ""chipped."" It is definitely an issue that varies from dealer to dealer. If you've got a service department that is enthusiast friendly than you should be OK. If your dealership's service department is a ""by the book czar,"" then they will find the 6 degrees of separation between your leaking wiper fluid tank and your chip. Once they figure it out, they will void your warranty. Unfortunately I think part of it is the litigious society we live in today. BMW is very specific about not wanting its customers to modify its vehicles in any way. This includes everything from chips to tires. BMW or its dealerships don't want to be liable."
November 2015,My son and I met Steve Saleen at a car show several years ago; a really nice guy- he autographed several posters and brochures for my son.
November 2015,Well I am entitled to do that AND have BMW pay for the repairs.
November 2015,There is another Steve in Calif who builds cars for Ford and uses Fords engines in his cars that has a license issue.
November 2015,Steve's license is always hanging by a thread; I think he has taken every traffic school offered in California. Satch knows a few good stories about him...
November 2015,"You mean I can't put 200 hp blower, race it every weekend and expect the engine and transmission last for million miles? What an outrage"
November 2015,"@Mr_Shiftright No ""tune"" is for free, something has to be given awayIt's amazing how hard that is to grasp."
November 2015,"That sounds about right, and he should know. No ""tune"" is for free, something has to be given away."
November 2015,Dinan get about 50 more HP and charge $1500... Steve Dinan stated that BMW engines are good to about 15% more HP without putting added stress on the engine. But their tune add's much more then 15%.
November 2015,"There's probably an effect over time, since there is more stress on components from both increased HP and no doubt, more aggressive driving, but maybe that just means a new X part at 80K rather than 100K. Seems like a low risk item, and BMW owners have confidence in Berger. Naturally, they sell this tune only for offroad use only and won't ship to California of course. It would be interesting to measure how much ""dirtier"" your engine becomes. They're basically messing with boost, timing and mixture, so it must affect emissions in some respects. Seems like a bargain if you're only paying $10 per 1 HP. Think of what some people spend to get 100 more HP--a lot more than $1,000 bucks."
November 2015,"It could if BMW would find the modification is the cause of the issue, however, the BMS makes less HP then the Dinan upgrade. I've had it on my car not for two years without problem, and so far I haven't read anyone having problems with it in their BMWs."
November 2015,Yes
November 2015,"FN, does it affect one's warranty?"
November 2015,"I ordered a BMS stage 1 for Ricks 328i and it arrived Friday, even though I have been under the weather, I spent a whole 20 minutes installing it. It made a big difference with my 320, it really has made a HUGE difference in Ricks 328i. According to BMS the stage 1 increases 40 HP, and 50lbs of torque I do not doubt that."
November 2015,"The proportions of the 1er are a bit odd, but I find it to be an entertaining drive(DCT notwithstanding). The 2er is a nicely styled car, but so far I've been extremely underwhelmed behind the wheel."

Would truthfully like one of those after i trade the Golf down the road. Really is the perfect size for me and prefer a two door vehicle now. And by then, all the chicks will have flown the nest so affording one won't be an issue. Might as well enjoy ourselves in retirement and leave them all a little less!!The Sandman"

Went 10 miles the last Sunday in 9 minutes including city driving - very proud of that given city I live in. Winter tires and rims now on the experience not as fun (or stylish) but I will be laughing at f150 owners once we get a decent snow storm- like we did every week last year."
November 2015,At least the fluid tank will be replaced under warranty. Things happen. Doesn't sound like this rises to the level of bashing.I could be wrong.

November 2015,"Wellllll . . . the platform underpinning the Cayenne, Q7 and Touareg are shared. The new Macaan shares about 1/3 of its foundation, so to speak, with the SQ5, but each company puts it own completely different finishing touches on their versions.I have a great deal of fondness for the VW Touareg, but few would think it was same SUV as the Cayenne.The various brands do much to differentiate their offspring from the donor chassis. Audi and Porsche use different transmissions, engines, etc. VW, no matter how high up the chain it goes isn't the same SUV (as the others) any more than the Passat is, er, an A6, etc."
November 2015,"If the car is designed with it in mind, the space would be made. I just opened the hood of my new Passat after owning it two days and there is a giant space available for something like it."
November 2015,"Rick would get calls from the Hyundai deal to come and trade in his Genesis and the salesman would give him the big pitch about how Hyundai has made strides in quality and refinement. On one of his secret shopping assignment we went to a Kia dealer to look at the new (then) Cadenza, we both liked the car, it was room, the list of standard equipment was extensive and the price (base) was right in the middle of the V6 Honda Accord line.Talking with the salesman we asked about the K900, he laughed and told us that each Kia dealer was getting 1, and that is it. But of course some dealers didn't sell it and did a dealer trade to move it off the lot, the car was more of an exercise in, ""look what we can do, and showcase what Kia could be."" When it comes to Hyundai and the Genises and Equus I think you are going to see Hyundai move up scale with that brand. Both cars are bargains, they are reliable, and really a good bang for the buck, it has taken Hyundai years to be able to sell cars like those here, and yes, Virginia they really do sell Equus. I'm thinking the accents cars are going away, and left for Kia to sell."
November 2015,"It was simple, VW wanted to let buyers know that their cars are just as good as those other premium brands. Look at their product back then, the passt was really high end as far as fit and finish, and materials used, but it also was more expensive then the Camry's and Accords too. But we know that the upscale of VW failed and the bean counters got a hold of the cars, the new passt is nice, but no where as nice as the previous gen. The Golf feels upscale and some of the materials used is nicer then what one would get in Sentra or Corrola but those cars have more standard equipment then the Golf.BTW, I wonder how many ""joe"" buying public knows that VW, Audi and Porsche are all owned by the same company? When we were looking for a SUV, we looked at the Touareg TDI, the salesman didn't mention that the Audi Q7 and Touareg were the same SUV."
November 2015,"Hyundai just announced a new upscale brand, Genesis. They say something like 4 or 5 models will be introduced. Interesting. Probably not right away, but if the brand sticks, I'm sure thy'l bring one to ELLPS, it's going to be interesting how it will score."
November 2015,"that unit looks like it takes up a lot of space. Seemed to be as big as a battery. that is going to be a tough sell. Sure, they free up room at the bottom of the engine, but that won't help with packaging under the hood! Unless they put it on top of the engine, like the old Subaru's that had the spare tire there."
November 2015,"Hey, they could also sell a follow-up oil analysis!"
November 2015,"Correct. Dry sump and the oil filter is integrated. As for the underside inspections, that can still be done as part of a service.A major benefit is the ability to recycle the system. The used units and the oil are returned to Castrol and they in turn would ensure the oil and the components are disposed of in an environmentally friendly manner. Of course, Castrol has a business angle as well. Since they own the patent, any vehicle outfitted with Nexcell would have to use this cartridge."
November 2015,"Our experience with Acura, Audi, BMW and Infiniti over the past decade+ is that the oil change includes an inspection, report and other fluids top off; also included is a wash and vacuum. Tire pressure, too, is checked and set and sometimes tire rotation is part of the deal.We drop the car off at 6PM, pick up the loaner and come back the next day at 6PM and pick up the car; conversely, if you don't want that level of involvement, you can opt for the dealer to come to you, pick up the car, leave a loaner and return later with your car, all services accomplished.90 second oil changes seem like something you might want on your car once the od shows in excess of 50,000 miles -- MAYBE.. My opinion is that I want to visit the dealer for the above noted services even after the warranty has expired.Of course, THIS TIME, my grand plan (?) is to ""CPO"" my own car (at the dealership) which will extend the factory warranty to 100,000 miles. This ""experiment"" also includes buying two ""service packs"" which will take the factory mntce program to 85,000 miles.My wife's 2014 SQ5 just hit 49,900 miles -- and we're going to ""run naked"" on this one -- thinking we'll trade it in sometime shortly after it crosses 90,000 miles, since there seems to be a huge resale drop in value at about 100K miles. This is all new territory for us, since her SQ5 is the first car we've owned since 1977. I'll let you know how this works out in a couple of years."
November 2015,"interesting. but probably not as great as it may seem. First of all, hard to see it being cheaper overall, since you still have to pay for the oil, and the contraption. plus, to get a 90 second change, you are giving up key parts of the process. That is, inspecting the underside of the car, and checking all the other fluids, air filter, etc. That is the biggest part of the infrequent service, which tends to be generically referred to as an ""oil change"".heck, the changing the oil part of it probably only takes 5 minutes or less. Drive over the pit, pop the hood, remove filter, put on new filter, put in oil, drive away. Oh, remember to close hood!does look like a slick system. I assume the filter is all built in (but can you top up the oil level in it?). Could also have advantages in packaging, if it works like a dry sump so no oil pan needed? Would have to see a better description of it.but purely in terms of changing the oil, I still want every thing else checked at the same time. I can spare the 1/2-1.0 hours once a year!"
November 2015,I had read about that new system from Castrol on another forum. It's a great idea but it will require the commitment from an automaker in order to get it started. Who will be the first?
November 2015,"http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2015/11/07/oil-change-costs-quick-lube-castrol-nexcel/74615512/Regarding oil change intervals:
""Improvements in the quality and durability of modern oil have removed the need to change it at 3,000-mile intervals,"" Kelley Blue Book analyst Karl Brauer said in an email. ""Consumers are wasting their time and money if they change oil with less than 5,000 miles on it.""Kelley Blue Book analyst Rebecca Lindland said ""engine technology has evolved so the engine runs cleaner and oil last longer, allowing for more miles between changes.""Many vehicles can travel 5,000, 7,000, 10,000 or 15,000 miles before needing an oil change, according to the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery. To be sure, however, AAA recommends checking your oil level once a month to ensure smooth operation.Drivers should check their owner's manuals to see when the manufacturer recommends getting an oil change. Many vehicles from the 2000 model year and newer can be checked here: /www.calrecycle.ca.gov/UsedOil/OilChange/FindInterval/."
November 2015,"Same here -- the only thing, other than mntce, we've done is replace the OEM Grand Touring tires at 30K miles.This one may finally dethrone my all-time fave Audi, my 1995 S6.It [the 2014 S4] has already zipped past my 1997 A8 as a far better performing (and luxurious) car."
November 2015,that's an *enormously* expensive enterprise.
November 2015,"A reporter is looking to get in touch with car owners who are waiting for replacement parts, etc. for their faulty Takata air bags. If you're an affected owner and you'd like to help, please reach out to pr@edmunds.com by no later than Monday, November 9, 2015."
November 2015,Crossed 35K miles in the S4 and it still hasn't given me a good reason to go to the dealer for warranty service.
November 2015,"Around here, they forced the Lincoln dealers to become standalone several years ago. Plus, they closed some, too. So, maybe closing some of their stores allowed the stand alones to harvest more customers and be able to make it on their own.laurasdada.....Jag store near my 'burg has a beautiful dealership. Probably as impressive as any luxo dealer in the city, including Porsche."
November 2015,"My Jag/LR dealer was going through an upgrade when I purchased the XF. But, as the XF hasn't given me any reason to return to the dealer, I've only been back once for the first, complimentary service about a year ago. Man, I'm not getting my $ worth, in terms of free food offered at the dealer!"
November 2015,"I think that is one of the issues that Ford has with Lincoln. A lot of Lincoln dealers are included with Ford dealerships and not stand alone. The Ford dealers around here are pretty generic and don't provide that special atmosphere and experience that luxury buyers seek,"
November 2015,"I read the test report of the new Genesis 5.0 sedan in C&D, and, mostly, the report indicates the Genesis 5.0 Ultimate Super-duper bla bla bla could be considered to be a lot of car for the money (and the handling issues seem to have been largely erased, to boot) -- if it were a Mercedes E class. The issue is that certain less than impressive feeling of going into the dealership and seeing the $50K+ Genesis alongside some lesser model priced (via lipstick painted on the windshield [very claaaasssy]) well below $20K. At least the A3's seem to not be THAT out of character next to the A6's over at the Audi dealer.And, as was mentioned above, the service department at the Audi, BMW and Mercedes dealerships are brilliantly lit and hospital surgical suite clean (or so it seems). But the Hyundai service bays, while probably competent don't look like places I'd want to walk in/on in my Cole-Haan's.The whole ""Genesis as a brand"" vibe, currently, needs a refresh. At least the brand -- naming -- will be undergoing rationalization, à la Audi, BMW, Cadillac and even Infiniti (mostly), etc.Now, then, speaking of VW, the new VW stores have very nice service departments and waiting rooms -- perhaps not quite up to BMW or Lexus standards, but close enough for Jazz. Of course we have a Lexus dealer that has a big buck chandelier hanging prominently in the customer area; and, we also have a Chevy dealer with a huge ""wall of fire"" fireplace in it as well as a sort of mini Chevy museum inside the customer area. Go figure.Nevertheless, there is something about the Genesis line that I believe foreshadows a serious threat to the high-zoot Europeans. And, I like that -- keeps them on their toes.At this point, though, I agree with those who find the juxtaposition of the Genesis line with the Hyundai line somewhat difficult to swallow.Time will tell."
November 2015,"Remember, Mazda thought about doing this as well back in the 90's - brand was to be called ""Amati"". Would have included the Millenia and, I think, the 929.I agree - stand alone stores are really needed to make this work. Hard to sell $15K Accents alongside the $60K Equus and provide the type of buying and servicing experience expected by the buyers of the latter."
November 2015,Standalone stores were the plan. Then that nasty little worldwide recession hit and they had to scale back. Nobody was interested in spending the money to launch a new luxury brand.
November 2015,"Still can't fathom the giant mistake by Hyundai in not taking a page from the Lexus/Infiniti/Acura playbook. You cannot sell a true luxury car alongside mainstream cars. If they want to be taken seriously by luxury buyers, they have to establish separate Genesis brand and dealers. Should have done it from the start."
November 2015,"Exactly. And, VW already has a luxury brand - Audi. Still don't understand what they were thinking bringing that to the US. Or anywhere, for that matter."
November 2015,"One word should be at the top of ""the memo"" to [US] Genesis store owners: Phaeton"
November 2015,"The problem is that Hyundai won't be putting the ""Genesis"" brand into their own stores. It will be more like Scion - a corner of an existing Hyundai store. Not sure if they are forcing the dealers to upgrade their facilities if they want to carry the 'brand', either.My Hyundai store does the most volume in the state, but the facilities - both sales and service - are a bit shop-worn. Not sure you can provide a ""Lexus-like"" experience that way."
November 2015,"I am very much looking forward to the ""brand"" Genesis. I think this move could poke and prod the Germans and the Japanese (and I hope the Americans) to provide even more in the way of features, functions, reliability and durability, and of course, performance.Competition will strengthen the category -- good for us all."
November 2015,"Mark....once again, good observations.Given that Mark and I live in the same area of OH (Cincinnati and its 'burbs), I concur, we get little in the way of snowfall. When and if we do get it, it's either a dusting, or a BIG snow storm. I have a snow blower. I've gone 2-3 years sometimes without using it.So, why the AWD in ELLPS? Must be a ""tick box"" for the upscale brands, particularly once they cross that $50K threshold. Personally, I would have no issues going RWD...matter of fact, I had done so for years with no ill effects. But, there's a perception around here....you pay that sort of money, you better get all the manufacturer's tech/features that come in their play book. AWD is one of them.All that said, AWD mechanisms have become pretty sophisticated (everyone has a version of torque vectoring these days), and effects handling in a very positive way. Plus, the days of yore, when AWD systems were big, clunky and heavy, have passed. They are now controled by computer, using light(er) weight materials and seem to be fairly robust and reliable.IF it weren't for the enhanced handling of the Torque Vectoring AWD systems today, I'd probably look to buy my cars in warmer climes where I could find RWD examples to buy, and drive them up here to park in the GG estate.Sween...I heard about the Genesis finally moving to be its own brand. I think it's the right move for them. That's the ONLY way they'll get ELLPS people in their showrooms."
November 2015,"It was noted that during a recent ""downturn"" in the business cycle, your posts dried up to a mere trickle. Some were even short.Business must be really good these days."
November 2015,"Sandy, in theory it is not the same engine. mostly the same, but Audi may be tuned differently, which could explain the different feel, and premium. But, more likely it is just that the Audi has more sound insulation or some such. Check the specs on the 2 cars. see if output is any different (peak HP/torque, at what RPM). if they are the same, probably just psychological ploy, since premium buyers expect premium fuel!I had this issue with my RDX. Same engine family as IIRC the Accord (only the last letter was different). Had almost identical (within 1-2) ratings both ways, at the same RPM. I could find no difference that meant premium recommended on the Acura but not the Honda applications.I have used both. Never found a difference."
November 2015,"good banter here of late ... I am still an manual purist but I agree with Mark the transmission tied to the engine of the s4 is pretty perfect. It shifts so quick, is so veristile being a gentlemens salon to a sports sedan in a second and can get 30mpg on the highway- in fact as my s4 gets older (25k miles) it gets 20-22 in the city. Compared to my g35x it's night and day as I was getting city figures on the highway- and I loved that car. On the awd weight issue thing... With the optional limited slip diff you could never guess when pressing car into turns that its awd and weighs as much as a whale. I love the car. I can't wait to drive an s3 because for me it has everything I would need and would love to see how it compairs. Well as Infiniti, Acura, caddy, Lincoln, jag struggle to battle the big three a newcomer has entered. http://www.nydailynews.com/autos/news/hyundai-launch-genesis-global-luxury-brand-december-article-1.2423042"
November 2015,"I know one thing, the wife's A3 and my Golf both have the 1.8T engine but hers just seems to drive smoother. Think hers is heavier and maybe that's the reason why. While hers calls for premium, mine wants regular. And her first oil change was at 5K while mine was at 10K. I do know her interior looks and feels a bit nicer than mine. Being our first time going German, these are just my initial reactions to what I see and feel. Maybe next time I'll try a BMW just to see but hope they still make a small vehicle like the 1 Series by then.The Sandman"
November 2015,"Why Drive ‘All-Wheel’ drive cars (that have automatic transmissions)?Those of you who have, er, suffered through my 5,000+ posts over the past years know that I am an advocate for – some might even say obsessed with – quattro, X-drive, 4Matic, SH-AWD, 4Sure-4Sure, etc. drive trains. Several folks do adamantly oppose all-wheel-drive, favoring instead rear-wheel-drive (and only rarely favoring front-wheel-drive). Likewise some folks are seemingly violently opposed to any transmission that lacks a clutch pedal, regardless of the tonnage of empirical evidence suggesting some clutch-pedal-less models actually outperform those with a clutch. Not long ago, I was one of the Luddites who bemoaned the death of the manual transmission cars – now, however, with both my physical skills and reading habits apparently still at peak performance, I hereby concede the 7-spd DSG transmission (and its shift programming and ability to ‘learn’) offered by Audi (and others) is superior to even the best 6-spd manual I’ve ever had the pleasure to have known.But what I’m on about – in the majority – today is the darn near universal adoption of all-wheel-drive as either literally or virtually standard on the premium cars we opine about here: Acuras, Audis, BMWs, Cadillacs, Infinitis, Lexus, Mercedes and Volvos. As a practical matter, here in Cincinnati at least, it has become increasingly difficult to find just about any model from these manufacturers that aren’t ‘typically’ stocked almost exclusively in its AWD configuration. Cincinnati generally does not have much in the way of snowfall, so I find it hard to believe this phenomenon (the explosion of AWD premium vehicles) is unduly influenced by our winter weather (which produces some, but not much, cold and snowfall.)The, um, ‘purists’ decry AWD’s weight penalty, added complexity and cost, and seem to associate the addition of AWD to a BMW (especially) or Mercedes (or Porsche) as akin to the brand publically emasculating itself with a rusty razor blade. To these folks, well, “It ain’t a purty sight,” to watch their beloved RWD stick shift wielding brands eschew everything that made them special.Horse-hockey!First off, let’s stipulate we’re (I’m) talking about the cars we can buy to drive on the public streets, roads and highways almost exclusively. This means I’m not going to presume you’re shopping for a new BMW or Cadillac or even Mercedes C class in the $50,000+ range so that you can drive (your new machine, your personal means of transportation for the things you do in your life) from the dealer to the race track or drag strip (if such things – ‘drag strips’ – have somehow managed to stay off of the politically incorrect list and, of course, still actually exist outside of an historical reference) as if such activities are de rigueur.No, what I’m on about here is our everyday (and every weekend) cars – no matter that they may be some form of a Luxury Performance Sedan (brand and model) configuration.In order, I say, you’re better off with (in order) an AWD, FWD and finally RWD vehicle – generally speaking. Yes, there are activities and (mere) moments where your beloved RWD may demonstrate its superiority over the other drive line configurations. But, from a practical perspective, RWD for most folks is the ‘least-best’ configuration if you actually buy your car to drive (principally, primarily – or virtually exclusively, that is), year ‘round on our public streets, roads and highways. Conversely, AWD is the best configuration you can employ to navigate our public streets, roads and highways.Now, thanks to Bing and Google, it is possible to find apparently endless studies, tests, opinion pieces, essays and love letters for your favorite set-up. However, what does appear to be happening (again) is what was once (in the early 1980’s) referred to as the time between the parenthesis, the time between eras. In the context of both ‘Megatrends’ (the book I am referencing) and the number and location of a car’s driven wheels (and manual transmissions, to a lesser extent), ""[Some] are clinging to the known past in fear of the unknown future."" Believe it or not, over five years ago, in the March 24, 2010, edition of the Wall Street Journal it was written:“Rear-wheel drive may not even be that important for some of BMW's new customers. Mr. Reithofer (then BMW AG’s chairman) told analysts. . .that BMW had a survey that found 80% of the customers for the BMW compact 1 series, which in Europe is sold mainly with four-cylinder engines, didn't know it was a rear-wheel drive car.”The same 2010 article concluded: “The truth is that most drivers probably can't tell whether they are driving one kind of car or another. As technology narrows the performance differences, ""luxury cars don't have to be defined by which ends drive them.""On-line comments posted in response to this article included:""I grew up driving RWD cars in the snowy mid-west. I can tell you FWD cars take all the fun out of winter driving. My first experience was with a rented Toyota corolla near Vail, CO. With a foot of fresh snow I was able to easily maintain 55 mph, with the car tracking like a champ. Any RWD car would have been in the ditch over 35 mph.""And so it goes.RWD may – but it is increasingly difficult to prove – offer that certain je ne sais quoi, a ‘quality or trait that cannot be described or named easily.’ But technology has virtually wiped out the recognizable differences and, I would argue, has – in the best configurations such as those offered by many premium auto manufacturers, literally wiped out the unrecognizable (some would call them measurable) differences.Still, some (or many depending upon your bias) front-wheel-drive cars suffer, at least somewhat, from the reputation as being unexciting to drive. Maybe, like so many other things (or everything else?), it’s all about ‘da money’ – FWD is cheaper to make, provides better packaging and can also provide lower emissions and higher MPG’s. Yet, with the apparently relentless increase in the up-take of AWD cars, CUV's and, of course, SUV's, that may not be true; it may be that the market [you and I] simply perceive AWD to be the best (and remember perception IS reality)!Then, when the market (aka ‘you’) do finally get yourself to the point of either wanting better and better performance, or perhaps wanting the Ultimate Driving Experience, you end up in a top o’ the line 3, 5 or 7 series – with X-drive, natch.Nothing even comes close to a fine fine German AWD sedan (as we discuss them here, classified as either ELLPS or LPS cars). RWD (like the manual transmission) is rapidly becoming an historical footnote – far as I can tell, most Millennials have AWD or FWD vehicles and can’t even drive a stick.Of course, if they're driving a DSG equipped car, they are almost certainly shifting better than you or I, on our best days, can shift a stick.. . . and then you die.Drive it like you live."

October 2015,HA - I had a 1978 Audi Fox GTI.- Ray[ Bought it FOR ME ! ]
October 2015,"I got my first Audi in 1977, it was a '78 Audi 5000 with Power-pack (which just meant it had power brakes, steering, locks, windows, antenna. I think the sunroof was crank.)It had a 100HP 5-cylinder engine, was FWD and at the time it was the nicest car I had ever driven -- even nicer than the BMW's I had driven to date.Next up was a '79 Silver Fox GTI (got it for my wife); I remember this one as it had corduroy seat covers.Over the years we've had dozens of Audi's plus three BMW's 1 Infiniti, 1 Acura and 2 VW's. We have little to complain about our Japanese cars, but, when all is said and done, ""nothing satisfies like beef,"" er, German cars, that is."
October 2015,"Mark, what was your first Audi? While we were in France in 1975 my mom had a 71 100LS automatic. It had in board front disc brakes that had to be replaced frequently, otherwise a good car. Mom really liked it. Dad had a company car, a 75 Renault 30 with the PRV V-6. That one stayed in the shop. What Audi was your least favorite and your overall favorite? You certainly have been loyal, going thru the dark period of unintended acceleration."
October 2015,"Geez, I guess I know I've gone through too many cars when I can speak to all these cars being discussed from personal ownership experience over the last year or so. Had a Passat with the 1.8t a little over a year ago, the Mazda 3s just recently, and the current S4. The wife traded in a GTI on the S3, and the daughter has an '08 A3 2.0T. So, lot of experience with VW's 4 cylinder turbos. I specifically went for the Mazda3 to get a different feel - a more traditional n/a 4 cylinder with a linear feel in acceleration. I'd say there is a very distinct feel between something like a 1.8T A3 and the Mazda 3s. And I'd add the 1.8T, in most any of the applications, feels a bit more upscale. Having said that, I still chose the Mazda3, whatever that's worth."
October 2015,"I'm around 3,700 miles now on the S4, so haven't hit that 5k mile mark. To be honest, the car has felt real strong to me from the get go, so if it starts to ""kick it into gear"" at 5k miles, I suppose it'll be a pleasant surprise. The wife's S3 is by all means very quick, but I do appreciate the more linear feel, and sound, of my S4."
October 2015,"Geez, Mazda has been putting the 2.5 in the 3 for several years.  Same engine as in the bigger Mazda6 but it gets worse mpg.  Guess different gearing as it's the same tranny."
October 2015,"Argghhh. My wittle head is so confused. When you said 3S, I read it as S3. I checked Mazda's website and they don't make it easy to find the 2.5 comes in the Mazda 3."
October 2015,"that motor is in the 3. The 2.0 is in the 3i, and the 2.5 is in the 3s."
October 2015,"Agreed but IMHO, it's not fair to compare the upgraded Audi motor to the base nee only Mazda motor. If Mazda could shoehorn the 2.5 (184/185) in the 3, then it would be a fair comparison."
October 2015,"agreed Andy. to me, the ""luxury"" brands were clearer in the old days. Caddy for sure. BMW was never luxury really. And Caddy really messed up the message when they tried to go real entry level (I guess the Cimmaron was the first attempt at an ELLPS?)a better word (that you used) IMO is ""prestige"". Audi is more prestige than Mazda. Volvo traveled in the Prestige area to an extent."
October 2015,"Rob, the 3S has the 2.5l engine with the 184/185 outputs. Really a quick car since it is pretty light."
October 2015,"They can and they have.. e.g. Cadillac and Lincoln. Even Buick was considered a ""prestige"" brand until perhaps the mid 60s."
October 2015,"Since Mazda offers only the one engine, it's really unfair to compare that to the 3S engine.Mazda 32 litre155 HP150 Torks2931 lbs.19 lbs/HPAudi A31.8T170 HP200 Torks3175 lbs.19 lbs/HPIMHO, the vast majority of us would not notice any difference."
October 2015,"I'd choose the BMW as well. But, my budget doesn't stretch that far, vehicle wise."
October 2015,"After nearly three dozen Audis since 1977, I can attest to the new engine feel that happens at 5K miles and at least once -- and my wife swears it is at least twice -- at a later mileage intervals. Indeed, my wife's SQ5 just turned 45K miles and her MPGs have climbed to over 27. My S4 with 35K miles is closer to 29 MPGs -- and we're talking over the course of a 100 mile one-way drive from Cincinnati to Columbus at speeds between 75 and 85 MPH.Full disclosure, front tire inflation 43, rear 41 psi.I use cruise control, my wife doesn't.Perhaps other companies produce cars with engines that reboot themselves several times over their lifespans, until I started driving Audis, however, I never noticed this being the case, however."
October 2015,"3S has 184/185 HP/Torque. so more HP than the 1.8T, a little less torque. They are comparable performance wise I think. Mazda might be a little quicker."
October 2015,"How many miles have you racked up on the new S4? There's been reports the engine really kicks it into gear once broken in at 1,000 and then again at 5,000 miles?The main thing I've noticed is the S4 has long legs. Whereas the 2.0T starts to run out of steam at 90 MPH, the S4 will get you to 120 MPH + in not too many heartbeats."
October 2015,"Honda is good on safety, but if I was forced to have a head on collision between the 320i and the Civic, I'd choose the 320i for my bones and body. How about you? Be honest."

October 2015,"We are in agreement. The badge does add some cost, but there is some justification behind it, such as materials, build tolerances, engineering. Stick - can they? Sure. They haven't just yet, as far as I know. Most manufacturers build to a pricepoint. They wanted a $30k MB, so they built one they could sell for $30k."
October 2015,"Well, if mainstream brands can't go ""up"", can Luxo brands go down? Thinking of the MB CLA and upcoming BMW (1 series?). The FWD models trying to cover the bottom end. Did the descend into Acura territory? Has the civic touring elevated to that?I just think the entry level arena has gotten very murky. Mucho overlap."
October 2015,"I don't think ""luxury"" is about gadgets but about the quality of materials....and yes...the badge on the grille does matter, as does the MSRP to some extent. I know this doesn't speak too well of human perceptions vs. reality, but remember that experiment where the people dressed in white lab coats seemed more ""believable"" to participants than the people dressed in ordinary street clothes, even though both were saying the same thing?"
October 2015,"I've tried to convince myself a ""lesser"" car is good enough. It just isn't. I did that when I leased an '06 Accord EXL V6. Figured ""hey, it has everything in it."" It only took a few months before the road noise, quality of materials, seat comfort, etc, got on my nerves. There is a reason why some cars cost more, and it isn't just because of the drive wheels or the badge. Do you think it costs MB the same money to build a turbo CLA as it will cost Honda to build a turbo Civic? I seriously doubt it."
October 2015,"Not to throw gas on the fire - but, why?The new 2016 Civic will be available with a 174HP 1.5L turbo ... not too far off from the 180HP available in the 320i.Given that BMW is moving away from the 'sport sedan' feeling they are famous for, what really is the difference between the two?Drive wheels - Civic is FWD; BMW is RWDAnything else?I've always wanted to own a luxury (or ""prestige"") make, but I'm finding it harder and harder to justify the $5-10-15K premium when the driving experience is really pretty much the same."
October 2015,"well, I don't know about the term itself, but I feel there is definitely a big difference between a true luxury car and a mundane car loaded with options. No matter how many gadgets you throw on a Civic, it is still a Civic, and it won't compare to a 3-series in the end."
October 2015,"I've said it before and I'll say it again- in today's market the term ""luxury car"" is meaningless. Back in the day if a car had power windows/ locks and air conditioning it was considered a luxury car but now almost every car has those things as well as many other entertainment and comfort features. There is still a difference between ""prestige"" cars and those whose badge carries no particular cachet. Therein lies the difference between a BMW 1-Series, or an Audi A3 and a Hyundai Genesis, however lavishly equipped.Since prestige is based on brand image it may not seem like a valid distinction but ""perception is reality"". Every single one of you knows the difference.Perhaps the name of this topic should be ""Entry Level Prestige Performance Cars""."
October 2015,"Agreed, the current Mazda 3 lifted the bar for its segment considerably- especially with respect to the interior."
October 2015,"I came real close on the Mazda 3. Just did not quite work out. But I did think you could have rebadged it as an entry level Audi, with little or no changes, and people would have fawned all over it."
October 2015,"Even though I traded in my Mazda3 for the S4, I will whole-heartedly agree on your comments on the 3 being a ""cheap car that feels nice."" Mine was the Grand Touring model with the appearance package, and at $26k, it was (and is) an excellent car. Great driving dynamics, adequate power, and a better infotainment system than my Audi. To be fair though, the overall interior quality is inferior, in some measure, to the A3/S3. The Mazda is certainly on par, if not superior, to its peers, but you are indeed getting something for the extra cost of even the entry-level Audi."
October 2015,"Funny, that's also what I see with TRD. I wouldn't pick that! (not that I want a pickup anyway).In regards to my original Mazda 3 comment, I'm just kind of a value buyer and to me Mazda is what Honda used to be - sporty and high value. To me a fully loaded $30K or so Mazda 3 (what I categorize as ""a cheap car that feels nice"") would provide the driving dynamics and still luxury interior and features that would be more pleasing (to me) than a much more stripped A3 at a similar price that is ""a nice car that feels cheap"". I've owned an Audi in the past and to me the A3 is just a bit too downmarket for the brand. At the time I bought my A4 with a 6 cylinder, sport package, manual tranny, in 1998, the A4 was the ""value choice"" as compared to the BMW 3-series of the day. Having gotten that out of my system, next car I get doesn't need to have that badge any more. I'm milking the miles out of my Acura TL but in the next couple of years it will be time to choose again."
October 2015,"For most of us here, I assume, we really don't care what other folks think, within reason of course. If you like the Audi, BMW or Mercedes BRAND, you like the brand, other's opinions are of tertiary importance.The cars we like are liked by us, because WE like them, not because we might have to explain to our buddies that we're driving a Genesis made by Hyundai -- or a whatever made by whomever.My thesis was simply, don't change the brand. The downmarket Rolex is NOT called a Rolex -- I simply don't think an A3, TODAY, or the CLA, TODAY, should be Audi branded or Mercedes branded. Maybe these models will rapidly rise so as to fit in the family. At this point, if I can get my hands on a new S4 in a year or two -- and it has not been pushed down in some way -- I really don't mind the A3/S3 being what I think, TODAY, should be a member of the VW family.Evenutually, however, if the A3 foreshadows a decline, well, I may have to reconsider.I looked at some ""high end"" KIA's today. They are feature rich and very attractive,. They seem high value -- a nice, no very nice, cheap car. But, and it is probably me, I cannot see myself driving a car with KIA on the steering wheel -- I just keep seeing Killed In Action. Of course when I see a Toyota with TRD on it, I see ""turd,"" and I just can't imagine ""what were they thinking?""I guess the phrase, to each his/her own, leaps to mind, too."
October 2015,"Guess I prefer to drive what I like now...and can afford! Before I retired the first time, had to drive econoboxes due to finances and family situation...raising our kids. Now the situation is different and no longer need to drive those kind of vehicles and tried going the CUV route back in December of 2013 and bought a mid-line Hyundai Tucson. Very nice vehicle to be sure and enjoyed it for awhile but it just was a bit too big for me so just over a year later, swapped it out for something smaller. Wanted an A3 like the wife had bought the week earlier but didn't have the $ for one so got a very similar driving vehicle in my VW Golf. Perfect size and fun to drive plus I feel like I've got a 3/4 A3 so all is good.Luckily, I don't worry or care about what others think about what I drive or where I live. Sure I would've liked to have bought a nicer vehicle like the A3 but didn't want to live beyond our means like so many folks do and I drive too many miles to lease. But, since I never looked into leasing and the payoff once it's up, maybe I could've gone the A3 route. Maybe next time...who knows!!The Sandman"
October 2015,"My wife got her S3 this past August and absolutely loves it. For her, it was about getting something with much of the ""character"" of the GTI she traded it in, but in a package that was more refined and mature. The S3 may feel rougher than an S4 (more on that below), but I would say it's much more refined than, say, a WRX. No doubt you're paying for that premium, but once you really load up a GTI, WRX or certainly a Golf R, the premium for the Audi gets much more palatable (at least it was for us). Now, I was impressed enough with her S3 that I returned to the Audi dealership and bought my S4 a few weeks later. And, after a few months of driving my S4 and having ample seat time in her S3....I'd agree, for the most part, with @markcincinnati regarding the difference in luxury between the two. In fact, and I posted this on the CCBA forum too, this S4 may be my favorite car I've owned. The balance between the sporty dynamic and luxury is impressive. To me, it feels like it falls in between two of my previous cars - an e90 335i and an f10 535i, offering most of the comfort of the 5 and most of the sport of the 3. Sort of a Goldilocks ""just right"" choice. I had debated between the great DSG and the manual, but in the end, I figured if Audi was still gonna offer the manual, I was gonna stick with they dying breed. And it is a great manual trannie - very ""easy"" to drive in traffic and for me, really adds to the overall experience. Not that there aren't times in my long work commute that I would prefer a nice auto, but I'll take advantage of it now while it's still being offered - doubt it will be for much longer."
October 2015,Your ARE what you drive wear...
October 2015,"Interesting comment, having one in the family people are hard pressed to believe that Hyundai built the car. For people like yourself, the badge on the hood makes the car."
October 2015,"Rolex does make a cheaper watch - it's branded as a Tudor.  Instead of a Rolex movement, it has a movement made by ETA, which makes movements for a lot of watchmakers including Tag, Movado, and Tissot.  Rolex didn't want to ""sully"" the Rolex name but still wanted a piece of the medium price watch market."
October 2015,....and he doesn't have to worry about anything on the drive train for awhile!
October 2015,"Yes, he does. And his friends who know which end is up, will know that he is a very savvy car buyer. Those who are status conscious, those who have to own a Rolex and drive a BMW just for the status, will look down their noses at him."
October 2015,"At the end of the day, that Genesis owner still has to tell his friends he drives a Hyundai."
October 2015,"I think there are certainly many examples of products that are -- for whatever reasons -- equal to or even better than other products but the two products are in different classes. Let me give a non-auto example: Tissot makes/markets watches. These time pieces are often feature laden, attractive and cost a fraction of other Swiss made time pieces. Breitling makes/market watches. These time pieces are often feature laden, attractive and cost many multiples of ""similar"" Tissot time pieces.It is possible to pick up a ""higher end"" Tissot with about every modern watch feature and function (complications) known to humans -- and the thing will cost hundreds of dollars (and is often discounted on top of that).It is virtually impossible to pick up a ""lower end"" Breitling that has only a date a sweep second hand function for under $2,000. Far as I know they both will tell time equally well and both will last for decades, lifetimes even.Tissots, even ones studded with diamonds, are not considered high-end watches. A watch super-store such as Tourneau sells Rolex, Movado, Tag and also sells Bulova, Seiko and Tissot -- if a Tourneau outlet is near you, check out the brands, perhaps you'll see what I'm referring to. The Rolex is to BMW as Seiko or Tissot is to the Genesis. The market perceives what it perceives. And in the instance of BMW vs Genesis like Rolex and Seiko, ""Perception is Reality."" Dimensions, decibels at 70MPH, number of speakers in the sound system, suppleness of ride or even country of origin doesn't change -- or hasn't thus far changed -- the reality that the Genesis is not currently considered an LPS vehicle; indeed, it is also not, yet, considered an ELLPS vehicle.It, the Genesis, is a ""cheap car that's really nice""[sic].Similarly, the Toyota Avalon isn't a Lexus -- probably for the same perception reason. My feelings of consternation regarding the A3 vs the rest of the Audi lineup (or, similarly, the entry level Mercedes vs the other Merc's) still stands. Likewise: My belief that Tissot makes timepieces that equal Breitling's products, insofar as their ability to keep time, also stands -- but I don't for a minute think that Tissot or Seiko, etc, are high-end Premium watches. Genesis' cars, no matter how feature laden, no matter how statistically similar, etc, are not in the same class as BMW's. The market's perception, not mine, not yours -- currently indicating BMW is LPS and Genesis is not -- is reality.Maybe there will be a reversal of fortune for both of these successful companies -- thus far, there is scant evidence of that. Perhaps, however, Genesis will -- eventually -- come to be perceived as a Premium Car. Time(pieces) will tell."
October 2015,never say never.
October 2015,"Well, I may end up in another BMW yet. I posted this over in CCBA as well...I was prowling my BMW dealer's used car lot today and found an Estoril Blue 2013 F30 335i M Sport. At first I thought it was the xDrive automatic that they have had a bit of trouble unloading, but it turns out that this is a one owner local car that was just traded- and-incredibly-it's RWD and has a manual transmission. It also has most every available option, including M Sport brakes as well as the M Performance aerodynamics. Don't know the price, mileage, or CPO status, but the car may be worth considering. It's nowhere near as quick as I'd prefer, but that can be fixed easily enough. I had whittled my choices down to a 2013 Boss 302, a new Mustang GT Premium with the Performance Package, and the new WRX STI. Now this shows up to possibly muddy the waters."
October 2015,"Is it really??? Have you owned one? I would put the Genesis sedan against the 5 series and E class, same size, just as quite is not quieter, ride is supple, standard equipment is greater then both of the Germans, just because it's built in Korea doesn't mean it's not a luxury car. In fact no one answer my question, when it comes to price, and which price we going to use to determine if the car is a luxury car. You think car maker determines this."
October 2015,"Not sure I buy that if there's no real luxury there. I drove a Mercedes A-class in Europe a few years ago. If they decided to bring that car here, would that automatically make it EELPS? Not in my book - no luxury (and not much performance) at all."
October 2015,"I'd love to get my '06 A3 back for a day and show you all just how many itty bitty little cost cuts Audi made to the current A3/S3 model generation. I still think, however, that Audi is doing well because they do the least amount of ""cost cutting,"" of any brand.Check out Infinity's cardboard loose in the track feeling moon roof cover. Now check out your S4 moon roof sliding cover. Night and day. Check out the lack of aluminum sills on the rear doors of the Infinity. Check out the trunk. Check out the way the finish is where the roof rails would go."
October 2015,"It's all about branding. You're right, they don't make economy class Rolexes. Auto makers should not be diluting the quality of their brands by cheapening them. Want a cheaper Audi? Buy a Volkswagen."
October 2015,"Point taken, but my sense is that the S3 was, much more of an economy class vehicle -- hence my remark that this freshman effort might have been better if it had come out from the VW side of the house. Even a sub-$50K S4 has a substantially more solid feel; and the look at the interior one enjoys and can touch and feel from behind the wheel is, well, Premium.I like the phrase: ""cheap car that's really nice"" -- unfortunately, I can't say I thought the feel of the S3 was in keeping with the rest of the Audi lineup we get here in the US.I read an article about the ways mfgrs approach cutting costs -- one of the mentioned ways was that a car company can elect to make the surfaces you see, but don't touch often, much thinner or with a lower grade of whatever material the surface is made of; also the ""glove box"" can be made of a cardboard like material and so forth.The S3 seemed much more like every ""trick"" in the book to drive cost down was used, much moreso than the other Audis and BMWs we have had since 1977. My 2014 S4, by contrast simply feels more substantial.Now, then, I have not seen the upcoming B9 A4/S4 family coming in 2016; and, it is possible, certainly, that it may have adopted the wring cost out ""attitude"" the A3 family seems to have embraced. If so, more's the pity.Also, the new ""el cheapo"" economy Mercedes (below the C class) seems, too, like a cheapening of the brand.For these companies, I would suggest they look at a similar (failed) attempt to bring out ""lower cost"" representations of the brand by BMW. I think I, too, would rather have ""a cheap car that's really nice"".Perhaps Mercedes can't bring out a non-Mercedes brand, ""economy car,"" but Audi, I think, should have brought out the A3 as a nicer VW than a not-as-nice Audi.In our market, Toyota got it and came out with the Lexus brand, Honda the Acura brand and Nissan the Infiniti brand. For years, too, GM saw the market approach that seemed to work was to ""always have another brand to aspire to"" starting with Chevy and topping out at Cadillac. I understand the Buick Regal GS is a very competent, ""nice"", car -- but I also believe GM doesn't have, in the Regal, a Cadillac ATS clone.When the accountants (so it was said) started to rule the day, we started seeing badge engineering -- and while platform sharing does make some sense, taken to extremes, it can also sound the death knell for a previously great brand. Does anyone here really care that Ford dropped Mercury a few short years ago? There was, really, nothing special about them compared to their virtual twin Ford models. There was a time, however, that Mercury was different, some would say special, more special than a Ford.Lincoln is probably still on the endangered species list for similar reasons. At least Cadillac, to name one, has differentiated itself from Chevy and Buick. Had it not, we could very well have started carving Cadillac's tombstone.Mercedes and Audi, for example, may have started on a slippery slope as my attorney friends like to say.Does Rolex make any ""economy class"" time pieces?"
October 2015,"Genesis, nice as it may be, is really stretching the definition since Hyundai is not a luxury make. 3-series is clearly entry-level luxury."
October 2015,Priced as MSRP or payments? Just saw an ad here in Phoenix for a 2015 Hyundai Geneses sedan for $299/m or BMW 320i for $259/m
October 2015,It should be simple. Entry level luxury is the lowest priced models of luxury makes.
October 2015,"""...S4 has its faults -- and it was $57K+, nearly $7K more than the S3...""The flip side argument about refinement and cheaper feeling S3 is that $7K ain't chicken-feed, so the delta in cost has to come from somewhere, no?"
October 2015,"When I sat in the A3 sedan, it felt kind of like a ""nice car that was cheap"" if that makes any sense. (referring to quality as opposed to price). My 1998 A4 was about the same size as the current A3 sedan but the older A4 was a much nicer car inside.Alternatively, when I sit in something like a current Mazda 3 that is loaded, it feels like a ""cheap car that's really nice"".I actually think I prefer the latter. So I get what you are saying about the S3 vs. S4. It's not just about speed, it's also about quality and refinement.People who want speed, alone, can get a Mustang or a Subaru WRX and forget the refinement. Supposedly you go to Audi for some luxury and refinement as well. So yes, the A3/S3 seems a bit like a cheapening of the brand, just like the new baby Mercedes. Moving downscale to try and get a different audience, but in the long term do these types of vehicles damage their brands, and are they really luxury (even entry level) any more?"
October 2015,"Being quicker to 60mphThere is a lot to like about the S3. There is a whole lot to like about the S3 if you've not driven an S4. The pricing of the S3 does seem, if you go to a dealer that has both S3's and S4's on the showroom floor, difficult to justify -- again if you've driven (or own, especially) a B8 S4 post 2012, for instance.I found the S3 to be a bit quicker than the S4 (both cars are equally fast) -- or it felt that way, perhaps -- at the slow speeds. But the S4 with the DSG in ""S"" mode, does seem to be able to get things done in a more sorted, I would say ""better"" fashion; the S4 is noticably smoother and, yes, does things with a feeling that it does have more urge, than the S3. This may be a function of the extra gear, I dunno.The S3 seemed to dart -- perhaps it seems to ""flinch"" when the wheel is turned. That reaction certainly is indicative of some level of responsiveness, but I did find the S4, even when set to dynamic mode, to be responsive without flinching.The S3 felt light -- and that is a good thing. But when you close (er, slam) the doors on the S3 (vs the S4), the sound is slightly tinny, evoking some sense that I can only say reminds me of my 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance: flimsy. Please note -- I am not saying the S3 is flimsy. It does ""sound"" decidedly less solid than the S4 when the doors are slammed however.For short trips, the S3 was a blast to drive -- but on the frost-heaved Interstate highways we have here in SW Ohio, any speed less than 80 was choppy, harsh almost. In contrast the S4 at 70 over the same surface just feels solid and ""firm.""The S4 at any speed under 100 (I couldn't get the real estate to get the S3 over 100 on our crowded Interstates here in Cincinnati) is quieter, one could almost call the S4 luxurious, smooth, supple, etc. The S4 feels like a premium car from just about any perspective I can think of -- while the S3 seems like every surface that you can touch is a bit thinner, hinting at being brittle, in fact. The S3 is made of good stuff, but the stuff feels a bit more economy class, than premium class, however,The thing is, I do like the S3, but it almost seems like it should have been brought out first (in its present iteration) under the VW logo, rather than under the four-rings.I took a second drive in a balls-to-the-wall equipped version of an S3 and found a drive around the interstate surrounding Cincinnati (I-275) to be almost punishing -- especially at any speeds under 80. The S3 is a modern day buck-board when equipped with the largest wheels/tires (in summer config) and with the Audi-Drive-Select set to Dynamic.Yes it is a very high-end go-kart. And, to me, a very high-priced one at that.My 2014 S4 has its faults -- and it was $57K+, nearly $7K more than the S3, that is -- but the S3 needs to go to finishing school to shed some of its harsher edges. Hell, it can even keep some of the ""boy-racer"" characteristics, since I am of the opinion that I don't want the S3 to be a substitute for an S4, anymore than I want the S4 to be a substitute for an S6.The S3 may be -- in fact the statistics seem to say that it is -- quicker than an S4 (not faster, quicker), but I am not looking for Audi to produce a WRX or WRX STI (not that there is anything wrong with those Subaru models). I am looking for Audi to produce and market Premium and even perhaps Super-Premium Luxury Performance cars.In some respects the S3 doesn't represent that ideal as much as the marketing materials proclaim.If you have an S3 and love it -- I congratulate you and do understand how you could be justified in feeling that way. This long-time Audi maven, however, thinks the S3 should be sent, IMMEDIATELY, to finishing school or that the price should be cut about 15%. Being quicker than an S4 just isn't enough.DILYL"
October 2015,"InculcationAs I look at the posts here, I notice there are some of us who have thousands of posts, some have dozens. I could be wrong, but I also assume there are people (and I have been one from time to time) who lurk, but don't post. Moreover, I also assume there are folks who may research (and dream about) their next vehicle using the manufacturer's web sites. The problem with doing that is that those sites are entirely marketing oriented -- there is nothing that could provoke ""other brand (and maybe even other model) thinking."" This is one of the key benefits of participating in an Edmund's Forum -- you may be provoked.One of the most popular classes of cars is the class that is discussed in this very forum, ELLPS -- but even within our ranks we differ on what is or is not EL (entry level). I often argue that EL pertains most to the basic chassis (grossly, the ""size""). This means a BMW 3 series, no matter how modest or how out there (in any way you wish to construe this) is an ELLPS car (meaning I would include an M3 unless or until some more granular classification is heartily adopted by folks who flock to Edmunds.)I found it difficult -- but I acknowledge other's POVs -- to consider two Acura's, for instance, built on separate wheelbases/chassis to be candidates for ELLPS classification. Likewise, I have difficulty considering, again as an example, both the A3 and A4 offerings from Audi to be considered in the same class. Again, my rationale is more size (length and width, i.e.) derived than MSRP or HP or torque, derived. Also, I think a certain Premium-ness is required to be in this club.Recently, there have been ""trial"" balloons loosed suggesting that the A3 family, now that there is an S3 available, merits inclusion in the ELLPS category. Folks [some] suggest that the acceleration numbers put forth by the S3, since they are a few tenths of a second less than that of an S4, render the S4 a good candidate to be passed over when one is shopping in the over $45,000 category. After all, a balls-to-the-wall S3 can be had for something in the $51,000 neighborhood and a maxed out S4 can command $10,000 more. Why bother paying more is the either stated or implied thought.Having two late model Audis gives both my wife and me multiple chances to ""legitimately"" test-drive almost every car in the Audi lineup, since they are all in the loaner fleet. I may have mentioned my wife got to be the very first user of a 2016 A8L for 24-hours while her SQ5 was in for new shoes and an all-wheel alignment and oil+filter change. Last week, my turn came in the form of an A7 (which, I must say, I was underwhelmed with).Couple these multiple legitimate test drives with the hobby test drives we repeat Audi customers are afforded, and you might be able to grant that the missus and I are very well qualified [amateur] Audi experts.With this as a backdrop, I must tell you about yet another S3 experience we've had and the conclusions that can be drawn vis a vis the S4.Being quicker to 60mph . . . see next post."
October 2015,Yes; I've use Top Tier fuel in everything save the Jeep for years.
October 2015,"roadburner - We have become true believers in using only Top-Tier gasolines -- and now that Costco participates in that designation (and we have two Costco fuel locations fairly close to home), even the prices for TTG aren't shocking anymore."
October 2015,"I run a bottle of Techron through the MS3 every 3k miles; no other ""cleanings."" In-gear acceleration times have remained consistent since 40k miles so I don't see a need for any other treatments."
October 2015,"Any issues with needed sludge and carbon deposits/build-up cleaned? Injector, induction, and other cleanings? I know my A3 seemed much more lively after one of these services, but it was no Jiffy Lube job, it was a serious induction system cleaning."
October 2015,"If the TBN is over 1.5 and wear metals(aluminum, copper, iron, lead) are tracking within about 25% of universal averages(adjusted for mileage) I would think that your oil is probably being changed too early. Aside from the break in period and the variable valve timing actuator TSB the UOAs from my MS3 have been remarkably consistent- even when the car has seen the track.As for long-term reliability, the MS3 is currently at 156k and the X3 is knocking on 180k."
October 2015,"Here's my statement: I change the oil, at the dealer, every 5,000 miles. For all I know it is a waste of money, not any real ""insurance"" whatsoever. The 10K intervals are based on several factors, one being that these cars do have large oil capacities. My wife's Infiniti suggested oil change intervals of 3,750 with non syn oil. We changed the oil on that one every 7,500 and used full syn oil.Maybe this is snake oil, so to speak.I have no insider info that says 5K changes are necessary. Logic only leads me to the conclusion that 5K intervals cannot hurt and MAY help with engine lifespan.I really like my S4. There is, at this point, no known US availability date for the B9 S4. I figure I need to keep my current car probably another 2 years. I have every incentive, therefore, to HOLD onto this S4 -- and god knows repairs to German cars are breathtakingly expensive.So, I figure it this way, ""what the heck, twice as many oil changes have no material downside."" If you follow the mfgr's representations pertaining to mntce, you are certainly OK within the OEM warranty period.Said it before: Drive it like YOU live."
October 2015,Dino I think the computer can take into account max temp.. My service intervals are less during summer months
October 2015,"They have the ""condition based"" service, which is capped at 1 year. They lowered the mileage cap to 12k, I think. Condition based service is calculated by the computer based on driving severity. The only thing it doesn't take into account is environment. They don't have oil sensors (I don't think anybody does), so if it gets dusty or contaminated, you wouldn't know it."
October 2015,"Well, still hard to imagine that 14-15K is good, but could be.my point was, the intervals were much shorter (5k?), until BMW starting covering it, at which time the interval jumped to 10K+. For the same engines. So either they were ripping people off (or letting their dealers do it!), and stopped when it was on their dime, or they significantly cut the confidence cushion!"
October 2015,"BMW uses synthetic oil, and the study's shows that synthetic oil last longer so why change the oil when not necessary."
October 2015,"I guess you can't know for sure, but what line in the sand results from a UOA would you use? Some people might draw their line in the sand more stringently, and of course, driving conditions and habits can change any individual's results, even with the same car and oil."
October 2015,didn't the BMW service intervals jump right when they started paying for the service? I'm sure it was pure coincidence!
October 2015,"I know what not one but two highly trusted mechanic's/shop manager's said. I also know that manufacturer's have a built-in incentive to make cars last as long as the warranty, but no longer. Planned obsolescence forces you to buy more new cars more frequently. This strategy works great except some manufacturer's have the decency to have the experience of their customer's more in mind rather than just the short-term bottom line. Also, a lot of luxury companies still offer either free maintenance, or try to sell discounted packaged pre-paid maintenance. It's a lot cheaper and easier to sell if you can say 50K miles of maintenance, and only have 5 service visits. They only need to make it last the term of the warranty, or the lease. An owner might have other desires and concerns."
October 2015,OMG -- Fact-based analysis. What's the world coming to?
October 2015,"Have you had a UOA performed at 5,000 miles? If not, how do you know that changing the oil at that mileage provides ""insurance""?"
October 2015,"Both my wife and I have the Audi Advantage Pre-paid program; however, we have an oil and filter (and check up overall) performed EVERY 5,000 miles, meaning we pay for every other interval and the odd intervals are paid for as part of the Audi Advantage.The cost of these additional services is minimal and, if you plan on keeping the car beyond 50,000 miles is very inexpensive ""insurance.""Of course you can elect to keep the 10K interval and for all I know things will be fine -- we have decided at this time we want to be MORE THAN FINE and figured doubling up on the oil and filter changes is worth doing.We are, too, planning on buying the service packs at 45K which will provide no charge services at 55K and 65K. We will, however, keep up the every other interval (meaning double) practice.Mine (the S4) can be CPO's prior to 50K miles which will extend the warranty to 100K miles -- my wife's, since we own it, cannot be CPO'd, but we're going to run the risk of something bad happening and go ""naked"" after 50K on the SQ5. The plan, currently, is to trade the SQ5 around 90K, since a BIG HIT in depreciation happens when you drive the car off the lot and again at close to 100K. We may or may not lease the replacement for the SQ5 and I may or may not buy my next one -- however, at this point, I do plan to buy my S4 off lease.Plans are nothing. . . .Planning is everything . . . .Drive it like you live."
October 2015,"It's a bit like apples and oranges, but I have over 20 UOAs on my MS3 and they indicate that M1 5W-30 is good for at least 10k miles in that application, and note that DI turbos are supposed to be particularly hard on oil. And M1 0W-40 is fine for 10k miles in the M54 in my son's X3."
October 2015,"Mark in regards to the A7, I think it's one of Audi's better designed cars, I would love to have one myself. But not too sure what packages I would want on it, sport package would high on the list."
October 2015,So why not follow manufacture recommended service? What do you know that others don't?
October 2015,"I just got my 35K mile service at 34K miles (did it early). I did it early mainly due to the fact I skipped/missed my 30K mile oil change. Don't listen to Audi if you plan on keeping the car a long time; best advice is change the oil every 5K miles no matter how good the oil is. If you plan on not keeping it much past the 50K warranty, then Audi's advice to do 10K maintenance intervals is sound. Otherwise, the best advice I've received is that it is not a good idea to skimp. What did your 35K S4 service include?I told them to include the engine air filter whether it said to do it or not. They also did my cabin air filter, the motor oil, and I asked for a front brake service including new fluid as my pads were starting to scratch metal on metal on 1/2"" ring just a week before my scheduled service (took two weeks to get into this shop from when I called; they are too good and popular and busy as a result!). Rotors when correctly priced even the large fronts were only $125 each, but still a hard pill to swallow twice now for me (due to track-use). This time, (unlike the first which was totally my fault for ignoring the sensor lights), I didn't get all the dummy light sensors warning me my pads were low; might need to ask Audi why the brake pad sensors didn't warn me and to pony up for the rotors as a result  Also need to ask my shop again what the diagnosis/theory is for the failure of the sensors to warn me I was scoring my rotors with metal on metal contact. Perhaps the pads were unevenly worn from overheating during 100+ degree track days; causing the lack of warning. Need to follow up with them. My front pads are not really meant to be track abused more than probably 1 weekend (they were put through 2 as well as 19,000 miles).CR came out with 2014/15 results of the most reliable Car brands, and Audi as real-world observance between you and I seems to agree with, is at the top of the chart along with a couple others for good reason. Impeccably built, quality controlled, and constructed is what comes to mind as the right words.I was charged 2.1 hours for 35K service which included the oil/filter, air filter, cabin pollen filter, brake fluid flush, & inspection. Charged 1.5 hours to replace the front rotors and pads."
October 2015,"Well ... yes and no. I just purchased a new ""Ford four door pickup truck (with what darn near looks like a car interior, only nicer)"". I opted for the new for this year twin-turbo 2.7L engine, which is entirely unproven. (As to longevity, I mean.) If I had planned to keep the truck ""until the wheels turn square"", most likely would have opted for the old school V8 engine. With this particular engine (the twin turbo), if I were to decide to keep it past end of warranty, I will most likely spring for the extended factory warranty BEFORE the base warranty expires. Just something about the first year for a brand new engine, especially a ""twin turbo"" design ..."
October 2015,"Mark, I like your A7 review..thanks. My problem with it is that it is verrry low to the ground making egress especially interesting for some."
October 2015,"Miscellaneous TopicsIs there a spreadsheet (that I don't have to create myself) available (on line) that allows the user to plug in numbers -- and make some assumptions regarding repair and mntce costs -- to come up with the ""cost of ownership"" for buying and holding (at least 5 years) vs leasing (for at least 3 years)? I'd appreciate a URL if anyone here knows of one. I mentioned this before -- and it did have to do with a GM car in the spirit of full disclosure -- but my neighbor with 80K on his somewhat late model ""paid for"" Pontiac Bonneville was, according to him, making maintenance and repair payments that were not too far below his financing payments. He went ahead and got a new big-boy Dee-Lux CUV (Chevy) using the logic that if he was going to make payments on a crappy, unreliable, old car, why not make the same payments and be driving a new car with a warranty.He also bought a super-nice Ford four door pickup truck (with what darn near looks like a car interior, only nicer) -- and plans to keep it until the wheels turn square. Perhaps Ford trucks are really hard to kill or wound.Took my S4 in for the 35K service interval + a tire rotation last Thursday night; got an A7 with 5K miles on it; car was apparently a base model with 19"" wheels, winter package (F/R heated seats, steering wheel) and LED headlights. For all intents and purposes, the window sticker I found in the glove box bottom lined at $69K. The option packages did not include the upgraded sound system, but, oddly Nav and voice command and BT communications and WiFi hotspot were all included. It also had premium paint (a kind of crystal black). Perhaps Premium+ doesn't merit a separate line item (which I thought odd, since there was an A6 Prestige on the showroom floor).The A7 was sublime -- library quiet, supple, smooth -- the thing oozed from point A to point B. As Col Potter once said, ""there aren't enough O's in smooth to describe it."" Of course he was talking about some very old scotch whisky as I recall.The upgraded wheels and tires (with all-season designation) were probably on the car for styling purposes since the car lacked the sport suspension option. But I hoped the A7 would be a true Luxury Performance Sedan -- especially for nearly $70K.In a straight line and at triple digit speeds, the car was, to repeat, sublime. However, I really could not find much of that German Taught feel I assumed would be present. Oh hell, the thing seemed very close to mushy, with ample body roll and, despite quick turn-in, a huge tendency toward understeer at any slightly above posted limits upon entering a curve or twisty section of highway.I had been, previously, loaned an A6 with all of the sport option boxes checked off and it seemed much much better than the A7.The thing sure was purty however -- but not nearly $10K more beautiful than a comparable A6 -- and driving it although not exactly a chore, was, hmm, rather a disappointment. I was able to pull into the dealer in the A7 and five minutes later drive out in my S4 -- the main straight line difference was that the S4 is not quite as quiet as the A7, but everything else about the S4 -- from the sound system to the sound of the engine at full cry -- was superior. Now, then, however, would I have the need to drive myself and 3 passengers on a 100 mile trip to Columbus, Louisville or Indianapolis, well the extra rear seat leg room of the A7 would be appreciated.I guess the S cars have the power to spoil (me at least). I simply would not pay the extra $13K for a relatively stripped A7 -- and if they were both $57K, the S4 would still be my first choice. Makes me wonder how much better, even, the B9 S4 will be over the A7's.Drive it like you live."
October 2015,"Yes, no button on the console like the Jetta I drove had...just pushed the button and the car started up. At first I didn't like it but after a couple of days, I loved it! Would be so much easier to not have to deal with a key at all!The Sandman"
October 2015,Maybe Sandy means keyless start.
October 2015,"When you say ""power start"" do you mean ""Remote Start"" since all cars have power start.. BMW does not offer remote start on the 3,4 or 5 series cars, which is ashame living here in the desert, it is nice to be able to start your car before getting into to cool it off.."
October 2015,"My '15 Golf SE doe not have power start and after having it in a loaner, would really have liked to have it. Not sure what 2016 will show, but doubt they'll add it. Thinking one day all vehicles will have power start and keys will no longer be necessary.The Sandman"
October 2015,"Hmmm. In my 47 years of driving cars (only motorcycles until I was 20) I've had 7 that accumulated ~850K miles, with my 240Z's 224K miles the highest. So, there are three of us that do this sort of thing on here anyway. I'm not counting the 200K I put on my '71 KW, but those two years I was driving my car a lot less."
October 2015,"I don't suffer from Shiny Object Syndrome, I buy cars I really like and hold on to them. 20 years in the case of the Club Sport, 13 years in the case of the Wrangler, and 8 years in the case of the MS3. That said, I've still owned 20 cars over my 42 years of driving. For my current 5 car fleet I budget $425 per month for maintenance and repairs- I guess that's really stupid- I should probably just lease 3 cars and make payments of upwards of $2100 month; that way I'd certainly save money."
October 2015,"I suspect that's true in many cases - business deductions, or if you buy every 3 years or maybe even every 5.Of course I'm a always over 100K kind of guy so buy and hold makes a lot more sense. I've had many cars over 100K and even over 150K. When I see people who've had like 20 cars in 30 years I'm amazed. I've been driving over 40 years and I'm on my 5th car!"
October 2015,"Most of the leases from the car companies themselves are sub-vented. The thing is, part of the formula is based on MSRP -- and while the mfgr can inflate the residual and reduce the money factor, the issue of the MSRP still makes certain calculations limited in outcome. The good news,so to speak, is that these severely sub-vented leases make it possible to have a 5 series for a mo pay that one would think appropriate for a 3 series. We did buy my wife's SQ5 and leased my S4; I put nothing down. As she approaches 50K miles she finds she cannot CPO the car, but can buy Audi extended mntce. I, on the other hand, can have my car CPO'd and buy the extended mntce. I'll have both low payments and a 100K warranty and prepaid mntce to 85K. By then I'll own the car outright and likely have been under mntce and warranty the whole time with a payment less than my wife's 66 month finance (which did require a down payment).It is getting somewhat difficult to come up with a scenario where buy and hold is as attractive as lease and dump. Our plan, unless new information changes things, is for me to buy my S4 off lease and for her to trade the SQ5 prior to 100K miles. You know, my company just pays X amount every month for our IBM iSeries computer -- and every so often we get an upgrade to a newer faster bigger model. We'll be paying for the systems FOREVER but we'll always have full mntce and always have the latest and greatest computing power.Maybe cars are like corporate computers. Line items on the budget -- X dollars per month, which seems to yield bigger and faster at every upgrade.For $700+ (adjusted to keep pace with COL) per month forever, it appears I'll be able to have a new upgraded version of one of these ELLPS cars in perpetuity. That may seem not affordable at some point in time, and I know that time will likely come eventually. Mean time, it seems like keeping current with content and technology will be ""situation normal.""Drive it like YOU live."
October 2015,"If you want to play with the big boys, you better bring your check book! (smile)"
October 2015,"Like I said, I got what I thought was the best car for me... I just happened to get the best deal on it, too.I do think the M3 does pretty well, but the M5 drops pretty fast at first (new 2014 started at $93k and is worth $68k trade now vs $64k and $50k, respectively, for the CTS-V). I know AMGs suffer. We'll have to see what happens with the ATS-V."
October 2015,"BNW has issues with the 550, but the other models are holding better, but we all know that BMW over inflates their residual on the leases. But if you take a M3 and ATS V-Sport I'm sure the BMW will have a higher sale value, the same could be said with the M5 and CTS V Sport."
October 2015,Well GC got a hell of a discount on his CTS too. Best deal doesn't always mean best car.
October 2015,"Mustang was new. It was about $4k over 18 mos.As a percentage, the Stang was about 15% through 18 mos and the CTS about 26% through 10 mos."
October 2015,"Was that Mustang GT brand new? Hard to believe there wasn't depreciation on a ""new"" car."
October 2015,"Which puts you at about $1100 or $1200 a month, just in depreciation. Ouch!!!And compare that to your last new car, the Mustang GT, which practically cost zero in depreciation over .. what was it, 18 months, 24 months?"
October 2015,"I don't have any Cadillac lease numbers this month, so it's hard to say. In the past, Cadillac has had pretty low MF as compared to MB, BMW, etc., so that helped on the lease payments. It's also important to remember that other brands artificially inflate the residual to make leasing more attractive - at the expense of having a car worth less than the buyout at the end of the lease.If you think the lease numbers - especially residual value - are about reality, I'm here to refute that."
October 2015,"Make no mistake, the other luxo models depreciate steeply, too. I've lost about $13k-$14k on my CTS in the first year of ownership (only that low thanks to discount). A comparable 550i is down roughly $20k (assuming I could have gotten about $5k off, which I'm totally guessing at). They have to heavily subsidize their leases, too."
October 2015,"I think another compounding issue is that if the pricing is similar, the depreciation of Caddy is higher, so lease monthlies are going to be higher (that's my guess, I haven't checked). Since a lease is basically the financing of depreciation, the greater depreciation would actually make Caddy MORE expensive than those other brands, would it not, and is that actually the case? Or is GM basically reducing the price (effectively) by subsidizing the leases to remain at least at parity?"
October 2015,"Never been a big fan of Caddy's styling, but I always looked at a previous CTS Wagon as a ""far out there, maybe one day"" alternative. Graphic's problems ultimately crossed out it as a possibility and lack of a proper sports wagon, or other type of lift/hatchback (5-door of any kind that is not raised) does not help, either. I'm kind of stuck with 3- or 4- series, even if I wanted something else. E-class wagon is too big and too expensive for me at this time. Don'd care much for cladding on the Allroad. I may check out V60, but seems like it has pretty bad mileage in its proper ""R"" form (not to mention dealers don't have them - I may look at S60-R as a proxy). All others dropped out."
October 2015,"I'm obviously in the ""undervalued"" camp. Although I did get a significant discount on my CTS, which pushed the decision very far in Caddy's favor, I did compare to BMW and Jag (never made it to the Benz dealer) and, since I value performance, preferred the Caddy. Even if it was the same cost, I would have thought the CTS the better car, although it is possible the steeper depreciation would have swayed me if not for the discount."
October 2015,"Here's another issue that Cadillac faces: The Auto Mall (AM).You can go to the AM and in the space of a couple hundred yards (feet in some cases) you can see the Cadillac dealer, the Lexus dealer, the Lincoln dealer and the Ford, KIA, Chrysler/Dodge, Hyundai and Honda dealers. So, you test the Cadillac, then a couple of minutes later be behind the wheel of a new Infiniti or Audi or BMW if you want.With the MSRP of the Cadillac so close to that of the Lexus or BMW, etc, and with the ability to almost literally test drive several brands on any given Saturday, Cadillac probably seems -- at this point -- to be overpriced or for whatever reason is undervalued. I just returned from a 4-day trade show in Las Vegas (at Caesars) and after the day's end I would walk down to the Forum Shops at Ceasars. I found several high-buck watch stores and one that carries many high-buck brands and some less expensive brands, too.Seeing these watches, I thought about the Cadillac as I looked at the Tissot watch collection and then the Movado watch collection after having looked at the Rolex and MontBlanc watches.Tissot makes some very nice watches that don't require a second mortgage -- I'd take a Tissot over a Seiko any day. But, once we get to, perhaps, over $1,500 to $2,000, Tissots just seem overpriced. At that price I can move to Movado, but once I get to over $2,000 to $2,500 for them, I start to think, Tag, MontBlanc or even Breitling despite the price jump. Somehow, the $4,995 MontBlanc, although expensive, doesn't seem as expensive as a $1,795 Tissot or $2,995 Movado. The Tags, too, can soar in price, but they don't actually seem out of line, even at $6,995 or higher.Cadillac, today, may be Movado, in some cases, however, it may be perceived as a high-end Tissot. For me, that means, if I'm going to pay THAT much for a Cadillac, I might as well get an Audi, BMW or Mercedes -- and if I am on a budget and want a bunch of stuff (high content), well a Genesis starts looking as good as the Cadillac and priced appropriately. Genesis is Tissot, but can make you believe you got the Movado.Cadillac today can't quite pull of making you believe you got the BMW -- other than the price you are asked to pay.I'm just not in the market for a $4,995 Tissot.The malls may be a great place to shop efficiently, but when Cadillac is in the lineup, it just seems -- at this juncture -- overpriced."
October 2015,"I guess it all comes down to if you find the current generation GOLF an econobox or not. I found it to be quite well detailed and trimmed inside and out. The chassis is strong, tight, and light. All good things. I haven't test driven the Golf R yet; that's the next step. I'd bet money the rare flaws I found in the Mexican built Golfs/Sportwagens is non-existent in the German built R. Another big-time PLUS for the R in my book vs. other Golf's. That alone makes it not just ""another"" Golf to me. I will say the DSG in the TDI Sportwagen is lazy. I would bet more money it doesn't have the same programming in the R. As to what the Golf Sportwagen SE is missing vs. my S4:1) HP, quickness, and speed. 2) Real Leather Interior (though I like the Pleather VW is using). R uses real leather seating surfaces. 3) It is smaller; though more utility possibilities and flexibility with hatch design. 4) Sportwagen doesn't have Audi Drive Adjustable settings for steering, exhaust, shifting, and other characteristics (comfort, auto, sport), but I think the R does. 5) The hatch doesn't open on its own with the push of a remote button like the S4 trunk. 6) Surprisingly, I think the Golf's do pretty much all have push-button start, rear-view cameras these days.7) No electronic Parking brake on the Wagon SE (big handle still); though the R might?I'm sure I might think of a couple other things, but this is all I can come up with for features right now."
October 2015,@andres3 - all good points you make but who besides a real car nut would throw that kind of extra cash into a GTI to make it an sudo R. Not my point as the same could be said about the focus st vs new focus r. The enthusiast will pay the premium- but in doing so you stil get the basics of both a regular golf and focus - same with a3/s3. Some of that is not all bad - but for the regular guy who's looking to go fast and both be comfortable would be disappointed in the details . I test drove the stI years ago and the thing that turned me off wasn't the constant buzz coming from the exhaust it was the frameless Windows on the door- yes something that minute turned me off as it screamed econobox Impreza.
October 2015,"The $10-15K extra for the Golf R is worth it as compared to the GTI. As someone who threw thousands into a former A3, I should know. You get better brakes, better suspension, better drivetrain and tuning. Most importantly, many of the engine components are beefed up and forged; so you can still tune your Golf R safely to 350 HP +/- for very little money. Whereas running 300 or more HP on a regular GTI by matching the turbo in the Golf R works, but can start to take away your durability and reliability. Also, the R is 3rd generation Haldex AWD."
October 2015,"I love the TLX, but in FWD 4 cyl form. great transmission."
October 2015,I like the Q50 & I've even warmed up to the TLX in its V6 SH-AWD trim. Both cars offer tremendous bang for the buck which is very important in this category.
October 2015,"Still would rather the Q50 over the ATS/CTS. But that's probable just me! ATS YTD Sales = 18,839Q50 YTd Sales = 31,603"
October 2015,"""Aside from how poorly it holds its value over time, and the quality and detailing issues..../i>There's all you need to know right there. The CTS is plagued with quality faux pas.

They'd rather revert back to ""GM does no wrong"" attitude that they had pre-bankruptcy. They've forgotten we dug them out of their hole and gone back to ""business as usual."""
October 2015,"Sometimes the problem is that image is just tarnished. They're making pretty good cars, but the name says Old People Boats. Hard to shake that. And of course the franchise agreements the dealers have with GM pretty much constrain much flexiblity for GM. I would have said close down Caddy and start a differently-named luxury division, but probably not practical."
October 2015,"A bit cruel, that article...it implies that the general public views the Cadillac CTS on the same status level as the Hyundai Genesis. I think the author is correct, but it's a bitter pill for GM I'm sure. Somehow Cadillac has to instill the prestige that the aging Escalade has with the SUV crowd back into the CTS."

I commuted with it for three years - a bit noisy, but generally easy to drive, steer, not too harsh (for me) on the back. As long as you understood what you had, it was fine. I traded for my current 328i, because that's what I wanted - a finer, nicer automobile, with some more ""stuff"", even if (quite a bit) slower."
October 2015,"I don't think I could have lived with an STi or EVO as a daily driver, so maybe this car has to be categorized as a wonderful toy to own in addition to something else. I suppose by year 2000 standards it might qualify as somewhat ""luxury"" but I doubt it would meet today's competition in that area. My kind of car, though. Small but Fierce, that's my motto."
October 2015,"It will be similar to daily driving a Hellcat, GT350R, ZL1, R32, STi et al. The difference is the Focus and the latter two shows what can be done with less than 3 liters of turbocharged fury."
October 2015,Not sure I'd pay $37K+ for a car that sounds like a can of gnats. I wonder if this car would actually serve as a daily driver or if it's too tweaked?
October 2015,$37k focus - as mentioned the golf r similar car - the subi sti ain't cheap and if you ever been in / driven one it's amazing track car but it's not a sudo lux csr. .

Regarding the Shadowline trim, according to BMW's ordering guide the Shadowline trim was not part of the standard equipment sport, but only on the M Sport, however, our GT has the shadowline trim on it.

October 2015,"Same here, my wife's 2009 E90 has a full beige interior and the carpets and seats show the tiniest speck of dirt. It doesn't help that the more recent BMW interiors don't age all that well; the interiors of my 2007 MS3(156k miles) and 1995 E36(142k miles) show much less wear."
October 2015,"I've always liked a white car with a coral red, chestnut, or saddle leather interior. I agree, it has to have the dark carpeting. White or silver cars with black interiors, to me, are lack-luster."
October 2015,"I like black.In BMWs, the colors are really nice... Terra, Saddle Brown, Chestnut, Coral Red, etc.. I really don't like light gray or beige. Especially if the carpet colors match. I can live with lighter seat material, if it has black or dark gray carpets."
October 2015,"Agree, I don't like black. Only car we've ever had with black interior is our Mazda 5 and the black carpet shows every bit of dust and particles.I've had blue and beige and prefer them both. Blue is currently out of style but I really do like the slightly yellow creamy leather color. Many beiges are out there but some are a bit bland. My Acura TL has a more rich beige they called Camel - it's almost like a light orange. Looks much better than black IMHO."
October 2015,"After having black leather in my Accord, I said never again. too hot, and dreary.but when my son got his Jetta, he purposely chose black instead of the tan (could have had either)."
October 2015,"I have black interior and I like it. Saddle brown is pretty good, too. But I've seen a lot of white and beige around here. Now - the higher level models, like 7-series probably do have more black interiors than anything."
October 2015,"Because that is what sells. Now this according to a couple of Client advisers I have spoken with. For BMW black interior is the color of choice, I don't get it, since it makes the interior of a 3 series look small."
October 2015,"Ain't it the truth regarding the limited colors available -- and, at the risk of being creamed here -- why do all these high-buck German cars always seem to have black interiors? I ONCE got a black interior (and that was in an Acura TL) because the dealer discounted the car so seriously once he found out that I would walk out rather than have a black interior car. I got rid of this car as quickly as finances and family would allow -- I get inside of a black car and my mood darkens, my optimism vanishes, the interior seems so tiny, hot and constantly dusty.Yet, you walk into the Audi dealer and there is this beautiful A6 3/0T Prestige, sport package, upsized wheels, and every functional and fun option man or god has created, all for the bargain basement price of $68K and the dealer ONLY has them with black interiors.Have we become so uncreative, so bleak, so moribund that we can only ""see ourselves"" in black cars, gun-metal gray cars, white cars -- all with black on black on black interiors?Now, as you know, I resent seeing a $ next to the color -- and ONLY black gloss or white gloss are free colors, but the interior options usually provide several no-charge options at least once Premium Package (which they all have) is included.My dealer actually, now, has a lot of cars on the lot and on the ""overflow lot"" several miles away from the dealership. But they're all black, dark-silver, gray or gloss white -- most with the dreaded (by me) black leather interiors. Reminds me of:""And they're all made out of ticky-tacky; And they all look just the same.""Black cars with black interiors must be the PC equivalent for cars these days -- well except they offend the hell out of me. Oh gawd, have you, lately been invited to a fund-raiser at someone's country club (with valet parking)? We were invited to a fund-raiser to raise money for inner-city disadvantaged kids; ""business attire"" was specified, so you trot out the dark suit, tie and shiny shoes and pull up to the valet behind a line of black, gray, silver and white German cars (and the odd Lexus or Jaguar) all the while unable to suppress the lyrics: ""And they're all made out of ticky-tacky; And they all look just the same."" It was all for a good cause, but it certainly was a sad indictment of where we've come to.I keep telling myself that I'll bite the bullet and pay for the paint color next time -- we'll just have to wait and see if I can actually pay extra for a paint color other than black or white. What a world, what a world -- I'm melting, I'm melting [sic]. . . ."
October 2015,"No BMW dealer I've dealt with has ever had a new BMW in their inventory that I would consider buying. For example, even if I wanted an F30 335i or F22 M235i, the cars at my local dealer are all equipped with xDrive or automatics- or both. And most all of them are black, white, or silver. Meh."
October 2015,"Many people still buy cars because they have to get one right away. Accident, old one died, etc. so has to be some amount of inventory.All custom orders makes less sense for volume, ""appliance"" brands like a Camry or civic."
October 2015,"I agree that your friend store owner would rather his business model changed, if he could, and sell cars from a book. However, the reality of US customer and his/her need for instant gratification (whether it's cultural or induced from the past) and the dealers play into it by holding large inventories. So, once they have such inventories, they used large amount of capital and are paying interest for the financing, rent for the location, upkeep, electricity. The calculus changes - instant sell of a car from the stock means no more interest paid and more working capital for the next unit. Essentially, the incentives and motivation reversed in favor of the stock. Upscale brands are straddling between those big volume stores, where if you say ""order"" you have them running from you screaming bloody murder, and uberluxury, where virtually every car is ordered (like Rolls Royce). They are walking the line between one type of customer, who want a car today and another, who want the car, but can wait, if needed.Also, some people limit their choice to a color and perhaps couple of optional items (rest is not important), they focus on those plus price, others would rather walk on foot then get a car with a missing feature (or one feature too many)."
October 2015,"Someone said the dealer would rather sell off the lot than promote/sell a car not yet built. From the time I had purchased my 5th or 6th Audi -- and became friends with my dealer/owner -- he told me he would much rather have only ""test drive"" inventory, service loaner inventory and some used cars. He shared with me that ordered cars have some profit, whereas cars on the lot have less profit. He said he wished US customers were more like European customers, in that they order cars -- dealers are not for the purpose of inventory control, rather they are in the business of demand creation and demand fulfillment via taking orders.Out of nearly three dozens Audis since 1977, my wife and I have only purchased one car off the lot, and that was a 1996 A6 (that we leased for 12 months) that we used until our 1997 A8 (which took nearly a year from order to delivery) came into the US.I find buying off the lot to mean one thing -- compromise. You pay more and you often settle for something that is simply not exactly what you wanted.I don't get the thought process of waking up one Saturday morning and saying to your spouse, ""let's go buy a car today."" Of course y'all must think me daft since I start buying my next car the day after I pick up my latest car -- test driving is a serious hobby for my wife and me, that is. We test drive cars for, perhaps, 36 months then we order one and pick it up 2-6 months later. It is quite educational -- the test driving that is -- and it is low cost fun, to boot.Drive it like YOU live (natch)!"
October 2015,"My understanding isn't that the import taxes are that much less on a used car, Rather, ED cars do not have holdback on them, don't qualify for dealer incentives or bonus money, and the US subsidiary profit is wiped away since they didn't sell the car. Hence the manufacturer saves those funds and passes that onto the consumer."
October 2015,"Which taxes? Surely not my sales tax. Florida taxes new and used car sales the same, anyway, I think. Perhaps you are thinking of US custom tariff, which if true, would make sense. I have no idea what tariffs are on vehicles, as they are generally included in the price of the product and not itemized the same way say state sales taxes are."
October 2015,"Mark, the MSRP for a ED BMW is still lower then the ""regular"" MSRP, since the car is considered a used car to the US government and so the tax's are lower.This is not new, news, I think I mentioned this in one my report. 2% is roughly less then a grand, it's known that 10% off regualr MSRP is the norm for a good ED price."
October 2015,"Neither. The price is simply negotiated same way as it were US delivery, with ""ED MSRP"" and ""ED Invoice"" values being NOW:ED Price (MSRP/Invoice) = US BASE Price (MSRP/Invoice)*0.93 + US OPTION price (MSRP/Invoice)+US Destination (same both levels); SOON:ED Price (MSRP/Invoice) = US BASE Price (MSRP/Invoice)*0.95 + US OPTION price (MSRP/Invoice)+US Destination (same both)Essentially the ED Invoice is what the dealer pays, whereas ED MSRP is what it sounds. You negotiate with the dealer where you hit within that spread. Values strongly depend on markets - some dealers don't even want to hear about discounting from ED MSRP (following theory of always preferring selling a unit from the lot rather than one not built yet). Unlike US deliveries, ED vehicles are not subject to allotments, training fee, or some other fees BMW may charge the dealers. Conversely, ED is not eligible for certain customer cash rebates (the disclaimers often specifically say that), such as those you may get by participating in their ""Drive"" events. I believe BMW Sports Club discount does apply."
October 2015,"If flying to DC in gross polluting high NOX emission jet planes begging for bailouts for failed business enterprises didn't hurt the Big 3's reputation much, certainly tricking the EPA won't hurt much either other than fines that go into somebodies pocket."
October 2015,"Small additions/corrections:1. Only BMW price is negotiable, others are set by manufacturer. In other words, BMW uses exactly the same invoice-to-retail scheme, just at lower levels. I think the difference comes from BMW using dealer same way to purchase the vehicle, whereas others may be using their dealers only to handle the paperwork (and purchase is direct from them).2. BMW 7% (now going to 5%) discount on both invoice and retail price applies ONLY to the base price of each line (e.g. 328i, 335i, 535ix, etc.). All options (such as metallic paint, premium pack, nav, etc.) are priced at same level as US delivery. Destination charge (BMW loves advertising ""from"" without inclusion of those $900+, like we actually had an option of not paying it - I really hate that, it's unseemly) is also full US level, no discount. This makes the ""blended"" discount closer to 5.8-6.5% for more heavily optioned vehicles - now it will be just about 4-4.5%.3. BMW DOES NOT include hotel stay, only transportation from the airport to the hotel downtown, or directly to BMW Welt. 4. BMW will feed you over the course of the day at BMW Welt in their cafeteria and you also get a talkien 20 euros credit or so in their restaurant (won't cover full meal, but will be OK to buy something with it).4. X-models are made in the US for the entire world, thus are not eligible for ED.5. I think Porsche may actually have a surcharge on the price, but I'm not sure about it.I totally agree - the ED is not about the money discount, it's about the experience. We are still lucky here in the US to get anything. Canadians, or others (Brazilians, Europeans) get the BMW Welt delivery, but no discount."
October 2015,"The ED MSRP and Invoice is 7% and will be 5% less than the normal MSRP and Invoice price. It is possible to negotiate a better ED price on a BMW than the official prices as there is some profit left for the dealer.It is quite possible to pay more for an ED car than taking a car in stock but some people feel the trip to the Welt in Munich is worth it.My understanding is the discounts are as follows:Audi - 5%BMW - 7% going to 5%Mercedes - 7%Porsche - 0%Volvo - 3-10%All provide one night's hotel stay, 15 days of insurance, shipping back to the US, and airport transfers. Volvo adds 2 round trip air tickets and a tasty meatball meal in their cafe. Volvo even has tourist programs available that you can book at the same time. Right now, Volvo is also offering and extra $1000 discount in European deliveries."
October 2015,"BMW reduces ED discount from 7% to 5%.Does this mean that the discount that is offered a retail customer will be 5% off of MSRP or 5% off of the negotiated selling price at the US dealer?At the time (late 2013), I got 6% off of the MSRP of a 2014 S4. My wife also got that percentage off of an SQ5 a couple of months later. These ""S"" cars are usually discounted less than the non-S versions, so we thought 6% off of US MSRP was a decent deal -- and we both got EXACTLY the car that we wanted, not the second color we would except, etc, but the exact cars we wanted.Now, having said this, does this mean that it would actually be possible to pay MORE for a new BMW purchased through the ED program than it would cost to buy one from a dealer in the US for US delivery?Or does it mean negotiate your best price and THEN take 5% off for ED?My experience is that 5% is not all that hard to get from a US dealer, thus making the ED option less attractive with a reduction of 2%."

October 2015,"First I did a double take; second I did a spit take; third I gagged; fourth I cried (well, almost)Data point: My Audi dealership is owned by a billion+ dollar company. This dealer group has the Audi dealership and the Cadillac dealership within a few hundred yards of each other.I did test drive, among other things, a Cadillac CTS when I was shopping for my new 2012 and 2014 cars. I was actually impressed with the CTS, but thought is was, er, mushy compared with the taught German and Japanese cars in the over $50K price range. I did think that once the suspension was recalibrated that the Cadillac could be a real contender. Cadillac must've thought so too, since the pros all seem to fawn over the ATS and CTS cars (appropriately optioned).So, as I overtook what looked like a ""fake"" CTS this morning, I half expected it to be a kit car -- you know a CTS overlay on top of a LaCrosse or something even worse.Yikes!It was a new CTS with a ""Landau"" roof and a bunch of chrome and ""gold"" bling. I assumed this car was a joke foisted upon someone for some unknown and sick reason.As I pulled next to the driver -- an apparently older American (remember I am one myself) -- I became so mad at the dealer, not the driver, for making this CTS tacky by any 2015 standards I can think of. Can you imagine any Audi, BMW or Mercedes dealership gold plating the brightwork of one of their cars, let alone putting a fake leather roof cover on it? What's next coach lights?I thought this kind of tackiness was perhaps at least a decade+ behind us.Are there no ""rules and regulations"" that Cadillac dealers must comply with? I mean it is one thing to see a new Camry or Accord so, er, adorned, in fact, I expect Camry's to be tackily dressed. But, at this stage of the game, how is it that a Cadillac dealer slipped through the time-warp cracks falling back to th 80's or 70's?I hurled. I do not fault the senior citizen for their purchase, OK, I fault them a little bit, but how is it that some SW Ohio dealership in 2015 could even think this was a good thing for the brand?The CTS and even the ATS would have been on my short list based on all of the positive praise the pros have lauded on it. Now, I just can't see myself even bothering to test drive one, knowing that there are such ""super tacky"" versions out there.This dealer should be shot (metaphorically speaking)."

Let's hope they don't fall off the map like Infiniti and Acura or all of us will be forced to go into a BMW or worse mB dealer to get a German .

For example, I am hoping to be able to buy the next gen S4 (with a gasoline engine). Other than the possibility that the billions this will cost (to say nothing of the time it will take) could kill the company and all of its held companies, what is the likelihood that the ""VW Group"" will actually cease to exist on the planet earth? To do that, I would assume the divisions of the company would have to be sold off in pieces with the proceeds being used to satisfy the debt and punishment that may well be heading their way; and I would assume if the car companies were sold to cover the cost of the litigation and the ""cure"", there could be an opportunity for the new ""owners"", so to speak, to keep on keepin' on, better than ever, unfettered by the costs of the litigation and punishment.So, the question is posed: in 2017 (for example) can I still have ""high"" confidence there will still be cars to buy from what is left over after the dust settles?Winterkorn be in deep trouble based on the reports this morning . . . either he knew and lied or didn't know meaning his lights were on, but no-one was home.

September 2015,"Seems like the EPA ought to have a testing process where the equipment rides in the car and sniffs the tailpipes while driving. I'd want to know that ALL cars had been checked for cheating - gas, diesel, the works."
September 2015,"How could anyone think this cheat would not be discovered?Maybe because (I'm speculating) they've been doing it not just since 2009, but perhaps they were doing it before and getting away? Who know how many undetected defeat devices were out there in the past? I'm not big on conspiracies, but they clearly do exist."
September 2015,"One of the key comments -- and one that I agree with -- is that the advantages that diesel (engines) have over gasoline is/has diminished. The thing is, do we know how much we've seen the gasoline engines catch up with the diesel?Clearly forced induction and small displacement engines have contributed to this. Now, or at least it would be fair to say ""soon"" we will have the ability to synthesize ""gasoline"" from termite (well sorta) waste and we just keep finding more and more ways to extract energy from the planet in many forms, including natural gas and shale, etc. I saw another TV show -- which of course means it's true -- that said something to the effect that we have about 99 years worth of traditional fuels -- that we know of -- available to us (at present rates of consumption) in the US.In 99 years, or even 59 years, I would assume we'll find ways to manufacture or harvest or extract energy from sources that today are too expensive or from sources that we currently aren't even aware of. Perhaps diesel is done -- but, isn't it true that diesel contains more energy per drop and has (historically) been some 33% more efficient than gasoline. Moreover, with filters and converters and adblue, haven't we reduced pollution? Of course, perhaps this event will mark the turning point for the love affair Europe has had with diesel and the surging love affair Americans have started to have with it.With the claimed ability to manufacture fuels from bio-substances (garbage, not food, hopefully) and with the claims that we will be able to figure out how to make fuel from water and make it affordable, maybe we've breathed new life into the internal combustion engine.With respect to the ""reason"" for the lie postulated as ""VW didn't want their cars to have less pep and less MPGs if they had made the cars pollute less, it seems like a reason that still doesn't make sense.The engines, mostly, where this cheat was perpetuated were the VW and/or Audi 2.0L, correct? Wouldn't it have been possible to apply the pollution corrective measures on a 2.2L engine to keep up the HP and torque and perhaps suffer an MPG or three drop?Again, this seems like a pressure cooker left alone with the heat on high -- it was only a matter of time before the thing would blow up (spraying beans all over the place). How could anyone think this cheat would not be discovered? I guess I am amazed that it took this long for the ruse to be brought to the light of day.So now these folks are all getting fired. My take is the people who ordered the cheat and the folks who were in a position to blow the whistle and didn't ought to face some PERSONAL consequences beyond being fired (with some kind of generous exit package one would imagine). Perhaps a ""programmer"" who wrote the lines of code could be spared, perhaps. But the programmer's manager who told him/her to write the code, should be in a ""you are personally liable"" position at least somewhat.Did the board know? Or do that have provable, plausible deniability?"
September 2015,"Apparently now BMW is under scrutiny. No evidence, just suggestions or some early reports, media are often wrong at first. However, if true we can say with near certainty that all become suspects. The Europeans better look closely at Peugeot, Renault, Fiat et al. We have a wave of outraged officials all over the world right now. I'm waiting for news that they actually knew about it (at least to some extent), but did nothing, because of their political agenda of ""save the planet's climate by giving everybody cancer"". This may take a while, as those interests are deeply entrenched. It simply didn't make sense to me that suddenly Hans, Pierre, or Giovanni the Public fell in love with diesels, not just cab drivers and fleet managers, even those individuals didn't travel nearly as much as those fleets. Something was amiss . I knew the incentives were in place, just didn't realize how aggressive those governments got into portraying gasoline as source of all evil and diesel as savior of the planet. It's going to be interesting to watch."

September 2015,"Agree. Look at the other compliant (as far as we know, anyway) diesels - mileage margins against their gas counterparts is diminishing, the durability is basically gone, the robustness is gone (they are very sensitive to fuel quality). I'm more and more convinced European diesel explosion was a huge con perpetuated by the officials and manufacturers on the people to lower CO2 with all other more harmful stuff ignored. Euro VI standards are just catching up with EPA and they will wake up to the new reality that diesel doesn't look so great anymore."
September 2015,"I don't think they did it to save a few hundred dollars per car.They did it, because with proper emission controls, their cars aren't as peppy, and don't get that amazing fuel mileage.

After all VW already thinks they're in for over $7B in expenses to get through this. Is it possible that this figure is but a fraction of the cost of not doing the crime in the first place? There may be circumstances that are what might be called justifications for doing the wrong thing for the right reasons. But what reasoning could possibly justify thinking that this was a reasonable risk?I keep looking for some logic, even if flawed that explains why any company would do such an expensive and dumb act.Winterkorn says he was unaware that 11M cars had had cheater software installed in them. How is it possible that this is true? And, unless PEOPLE are punished, what makes anyone think bad corporate behavior won't just keep on happening? And, I'm not talking about the shareholders being the people who get punished, either."

If VW just thought the US EPA was BS, why cheat on the other 10.5M cars?This, besides being illegal, unethical, bad behavior seems like such a boneheaded thing to have done, it is scary.Everyone ALWAYS gets caught -- or at least history is replete with bad actors being caught over and over and over again. This current situation is similar to the behavior Cadillac was found to have been guilty of -- in their case the fine was $45M. My thoughts: if you want a diesel car, you know it will cost more and, generally speaking not have quite the performance parameters we're used to in gas powered cars. Was the fudge factor in these small 2.0L engines so different with the ad-blue technology that folks would say, hell no, this thing's a dog?Other than pain, suffering, corporate shame and big losses, what could anyone have thought would be gained even if there was virtual certainty of not being found out? Winterkorn, apparently, really must be not too bright and too arrogant by about a million percent."
September 2015,Isn't $35K the possible fine/penalty per car?I don't think it has anything to do with the recall/repair cost.
September 2015,"Honestly I'd like to see companies that are blatant cheaters to go down HARD. Unfortunately it doesn't usually happen. The big US banks are all bigger than ever and ready to cause a new economic destruction. I'm sure VW won't be hit all that hard. I used to like VW, had VWs for many years, but the combination of parts costs, crappy dealer service, decontented blandmobiles, and now severe cheating is enough for me to never touch them again."
September 2015,"I won't be so optimistic. Even though the damage it causes (more air pollution) doesn't seem so serious, the cost and fine for recalling 11M cars doesn't seem out of hand for a company this size, the lost trust might be repaired overtime... the law suits from owners and governments around the world can really bring VW to its knees. It's one thing to build a lousy car or falsify the HP or MPG, another to intentionally cheat. One of the above can be criminally charged.Good news is, good cars will be kept, just the share holders will be damned"
September 2015,"Being the owners of a 2015 Audi A3 and a VW Golf SE, both gas models, think this will all blow over and VW/Audi will survive just fine. Seems that all, or most, car companies have had their share of problems over the years, some worse than others, but most have survived and thrived in later years. We're not worried one bit, as we keep our vehicles longer than the average owner does, and look forward to many years of fun driving ahead. If had to do it all again, the only change I think I'd make is I'd have also bought an A3, in a different color though. Since the wife had a bigger budget than I, the Golf seemed to be the next best alternative to a similar vehicle since one seems to be built upon the other.The Sandman"
September 2015,"Perhaps when you reflash, the car becomes undriveable. It may not be just simple loss of power and gas mileage, but such strange output characteristics that it is no longer streetworthy. When car is on rollers, it doesn't push anything. Just guessing here."
September 2015,VW tried a software fix. Didn't work. Check the diesel thread.
September 2015,"I'm still confused at to why the fix costs anything. Just flash the code to stay in test taking trim, and there you go. Mpg and performance, well that will be whatever it is."
September 2015,"My guess is that it wasn't ultimately the cost but the performance that was the real issue. It seems like it was probably c. $300 or less per car to meet the rules, but at the same time power would have been down by a bit, mpg would have been down a bit, and heavy adblue use would have raised the cost for the customer, weakening the case for trading in a gas car for a diesel given the premium of thousands of dollars over gas in msrp.It seems like some people within VW thought the US rules were BS and didn't want to follow them. They wanted their cars to have better performance and better mpg by running their diesels ""naturally."" But the result was that the vehicles put out 5-40 times the pollution that they were allowed to by law. Diesel pollution has been scientifically proven to be harmful to human health, which is why CARB and then EPA established these rules to begin with.So far it seems that BMW followed the rules, although perhaps that will prove to be optimistic. As a result, if that turns out to be the case, BMW's diesel vehicles cost more and get slightly lower mpg. There were probably people at BMW who cursed CARB as well, just like a few people here are, saying, ""those #&* bureaucrats!"" etc. But then BMW got down to work and got the job done.Audi, apparently, followed VW down the bad rabbit hole when it came to the diesel A3."
September 2015,"What kind of additional costs are we talking about for ad-blue annually? (at the 2.0L engine size).This, too, makes no sense to me -- diesel cars cost more than gas engined cars, so is it possible that buying a diesel Jetta for a not easy to ignore price premium vs a less expensive gas engined version hinged on the lack of the need to use ad-blue?I guess it is possible that someone on a budget would spring for a diesel, but again, it doesn't seem as probable to me that someone would do that. My issues with diesel, until quite recently, have been the scarcity of gas stations that also offer diesel. Now, I would see only positives to getting one of Audis new high performance diesels (which all require ad-blue).My wife's boss has an ad-blue equipped diesel vehicle -- loves it, especially the tank range.Me, I have an S4 with a sippy-cup gas tank that only allows, practically speaking, something over 350 miles between fill-ups. My wife's SQ5, on the other hand approaches 500 miles between fill ups."
September 2015,"I think the issue with AdBlue is that you need to keep putting this stuff in, so the there is more maintenance, which defeats ""economy"" car proposition."
September 2015,"The X5 is an ad-blue version -- I believe the ones that were fudged were the little bitty engines that were claimed to NOT NEED ad-blue.This is what is so confusing, I would imagine adding ad-blue technology to the Jetta, for instance, would be on the order of a few hundred bucks per car, not $35,000. It would seem to me that raising the cost of the car 1% (MSRP) would be acceptable to the market, whereas $35K would not.There's so much manure around here on this subject, there has to be a pony around here. Where are the facts?Of course, even $200 x 11,000,000 is serious money.===This just in Winterkorn just resigned -- claiming he had no personal awareness of the lie.I guess that is POSSIBLE -- but for some reason it just doesn't seem PLAUSABLE."
September 2015,"""Most states"" would mean more than half, which would mean more than 25 states. In fact, it's fewer than 20 states according to wikipedia:""States adopting the California standards include Arizona (2012 model year), Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico (2011 model year), New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia."""
September 2015,"Most States have adopted CARB standards, so yes, emissions would be about the same without the EPA. Also, while the EPA might have stringent emission criteria, their tests are obviously incompetent to detect actual emissions, so actual emissions would be about the same, while perhaps the regulations might have lower standards. I'm talking real-world here."
September 2015,"The BMW diesel X5 tested by the same company passed with flying colors. Much more expensive car, obviously."
September 2015,"I am sitting here watching a TV show on the subject of the cost to make the cars in question compliant with their claims. The ""expert"" (I have no idea who he is, but he does not appear to be, currently at least, from a car mfgr), claims something like the cost per car to make them compliant is over $35,000 PER CAR. I don't even know of any Jettas that, new, retailed for that much.Anyone who reads and/or watches conventional media knows that so many of these companies that try to get away with things, don't. Therefore, someone who measures risk must have come to the conclusion that the risk (cost) of the lie is lower than the risk (cost) of compliance. Why else would someone make such a decision, especially if the cost per car would be $200 or $300 as suggested here elsewhere?Another news story claims, that ""as a practical matter,"" (which I assume is code for ""the cost of meeting the standards would make the cars in question unsellable"") there is no CURRENT way to meet these requirements.Sure, discoveries are made every day, and I think it is reasonable to conclude that it is possible to get to zero emissions -- but diesel engines must make things more difficult and/or prohibitively expensive.If I thought I could comply and simply pass the cost along to a willing market, why would I risk even the possibility of being caught fudging the numbers? Something doesn't add up -- I mean why would Cadillac have done the same thing a few years ago, why would the other companies fudge HP or MPG ratings or not fix ignition switches (and in the case of ignition switches there was an inexpensive fix)?I understand there are EPA haters, and of course there are car company haters, but time and again, when it is possible for a secret or cover up to be discovered, it is -- is, for example, Martin Winterkorn, a boob someone who doesn't read or watch TV where it is possible to see a peanut company exec go to jail for 28 years for trying to cover up tainted peanut butter, or GM being called out for faulty ignition switches or Cadillac being fined for cooking EPA compliance records?Said it before, the only way to keep a secret between 3 people is if 2 of them are dead. How many people at VW knew? Did it not ever occur to anyone that a curious guy from the university of West Virginia (or where ever) would test one of these cars and uncover the deceit?As somewhat of a student of Adam Smith, I'm not really sure if this is the invisible hand at work -- it seems more like the work of a statistician who advised (ill-advised, I'd say) management that the cost of compliance is far more dear than the cost of getting caught cheating.I just missed what the President of Nissan was just saying in an interview, but it seems to be something like ""we all do it, because the costs of compliance are too dear."" Wonder how this will all play out? At this point, I'm going with ""too big to fail.""This too shall pass."
September 2015,"what might save VW (at least in the US) is that the issue is specific to the Diesel. Most sales are gas, so maybe those people don't bail?"
September 2015,"Relax. If GM killed 124 people from criminal coverups and only 13 people were fired, VW has no worries, imho. We did the same thing in the '70's defeating the archaic smog devices to get the HP's up! VW isn't going anywhere. GM is still here. And now Chrysler wants to buy them. I assume Marchionne now has a second candidate for merger potential!http://www.allgov.com/news/top-stories/gm-executives-avoid-prosecution-for-124-deaths-caused-by-cover-up-of-faulty-ignition-switches-150921?news=857466"
September 2015,"Say what? Did he really just say that? ""Without the EPA, ... emissions would be about the same...""Really? Seriously? He said that? Okay, now I understand why others are asking for an ignore button."
September 2015,"well, obviously they could make the cars pass the test. For no extra money, because they did pass the tests. the problem isn't that they didn't pass, it is they essentially did a ""cheater"" tune job themselves (as opposed to owners that chip a car to get the same end result). I assume the ""fix"" is just a flash update to make the test cheater tune the standard and only option. I admit not having had time to read the articles about this. I have seen the ""up to 40x"" stuff (which i assume is worst case, not close to average). But is there decent reports on what the HP and MPG hit to running the ""test"" tune all the time would be?"
September 2015,"@markcincinnati Keep in mind that the emission, fuel economy, and safety standards are not decided in a vacuum. Manufacturers and their lobbyists work closely with the EPA and NHTSA to come up with achievable targets. The government knows they can't pick arbitrary standards that would make products so expensive that the average consumer couldn't buy them. It's all negotiated.As for VW and the inability to meet the target, remember they are able to meet the target when the vehicle is in test mode. I'm guessing that performance, fuel economy, or cost targets could not be met without the test mode, hence the deception."
September 2015,"According to an article I read somewhere, but can't find right now, someone with familiarity with emissions systems said it would have probably cost VW only $200-300 more per car to make them actually pass the test. Almost certainly they would have also gotten a couple of notches lower on the mpg and hp scales, but it could have been done. The gov't is not asking for the impossible at this point. About 8 years from now, however, things get challenging with CAFE mpg standards. But with 8 more years of R & D on that front, who knows what improvements we'll see.Many midsize cars sold for 2016 already meet the CAFE mpg requirements for c. 2021."
September 2015,"I've been reading and watching the TV biz channels as they pontificate on the meaning of all of this stuff. The current news is that this is a re-run; Cadillac did it (got fined) Ford did it, etc. Apparently 11M (VW's numbers) vehicles had this software installed. Well, Honda got caught a few years back -- same thing.The list of ""who's done it"" seems to be much bigger than the current scandal. This doesn't forgive any company -- and it is more serious than Hyundai fudging the MGPs of their cars or Acura claiming their cars had more HP than could be tested, and so on -- but the thing is, I have read (in car magazines) interviews, over the years, from top car company executives who have claimed the MPG and emissions requirements go ""to the practical limit"" of technology then go beyond what is known to be capable for any realistic sum of money. Nothing said here is meant to forgive the lie. However, isn't it possible -- in the current climate -- to find some ""objective"" engineers and/or scientists who could say ""here is what we are able to do TODAY at this price; here is what we're able to do TODAY at that price,"" and so forth. I understand if a Martin Winterkorn goes before ""the government"" and says ""this is what is possible at a cost of $xxx per car; and what you want us to do would cost ($xxxx) per car"" the government doubts the veracity of the remarks.So, the government wants a car to emit this much pollution and go this far on a gallon of fuel (or whatever is used to power the vehicle); apparently it can't be done at a market acceptable price today. Then you factor in that CAFE often gives a pass to trucks, so the mfgr goes ahead and creates a 2-cylinder car with a cardboard back seat, no sound insulation and made with the lightest weight materials -- that are inexpensive -- known to the designers.I guess it is possible to increase the EPA ratings in all of the good ways by making cars out of carbon fiber and unobtanium, and powering them with a fuel cell and a solar sail -- but, said cars will cost 300% of the traditionally built autos. So, you're $25,000 car will satisfy the EPA, etc, but, it will cost $75,000.This, if at least in spirit is correct, is unworkable and for most folks unaffordable. Again, this does not forgive lying, but I can only assume that the corporate thought process, since it keeps happening over and over, arrives at the conclusion that the cost of getting caught is less than the cost of [attempting] compliance. Since the cost of compliance is apparently, like unobtainium, simply too high to adopt.Too big to fail? Who knows if VW is too big to fail -- but if the death of the VW enterprise is the eventual cost of this transgression and disregard for law, well, ""who's next?""I would hope the regulated, rather than lie, make a convincing, compelling case in response to unreasonable and/or unaffordable legislative requirements. Here is what I want: a car that accelerates to 60 in 3 seconds, gets over 75MPG, tops out at 155MPH, stops from 70MPH in 100 feet, holds 5 people and their luggage and costs $25,000. I have to assume this is like the old saw: you can have this product or service: fast, of high-quality or inexpensive -- pick two. Seems to me the regulatory agencies, the world over, expect it to be ""pick three.""We're not there, apparently, yet."
September 2015,"As this VW fiasco evolves, I stop feeling strange seeing the amount of people who would view things solely from their personal interest, while disregard the goodness of others, the general public, and the necessity of things that keep the society in order. I guess a strong faith to Adam Smith is needed. That said, the integrity of most people in this forum is quite commendable."
September 2015,"Not that strange. My taxes pay the EPA's bureaucracy, ineffectiveness, and waste.Without the EPA, seems to me car prices would be lower, emissions would be about the same, and my taxes would be lower. Also, the Colorado rivers wouldn't be as polluted, but that's another story.This goes to the heart of the gov't doing more harm than good with each department and policy it enacts, be it the IRS, the EPA, the Military policing of the world, the CHP and its traffic enforcement methods, and on an on."

September 2015,"Knowing how the financial institutions' thievery involving the financial crisis in 07/08 was addressed in the US (moderate fines at best, not even one exec imprisoned for the downfall of the entire economy), I suspect that the US government will slap their wrists and have a moderate punishment. Hopefully the EU regulators have a lot more teeth than the US does."
September 2015,"What also bothers me here is that those VW's are small in numbers, but we all know how ""clean"" are trucks, buses and pickups. VW cheating is a big deal on the priniple, but I would not go as far as calling them some kind of superpollutants. They may be ecxeeding limits 40 times, but one can ask what kind of limits are on those stinky and noisy schoolbuses and semis, if their spewing big black clouds is within those limits. We can only be thankful that we don't have diesel engines in same percentage of passenger fleet, as Europeans. I hope this will wake them up. I doubt it will happen overnight, but perhaps it's a start. Diesel has its place, just not in a cheap small car. Want to pay up, like BMW, Benz, fine. But can't have the cake and eat it, just as VW promised."
September 2015,"Maybe, maybe not. Keep in mind that the emissions requirements in Europe are not as strict as the CARB/EPA requirements so under the current tuning, the 2.0 may meet their standards. My understanding is that a new emissions requirement just went into affect in Europe on 9/1 that brings diesel requirements much closer to the CARB levels. It's possible that the VW won't pass this new standard."
September 2015,"The answer is YES. 18 billion is just a potential. I expect that settle at 2-5 billion plus a few scapegoats of middle to high level. The real one is if there is any issue with European market, half of their staff is going to prison. BTW, 10-40 times would probably not pass 20 year standards, so the deceipt is beyond staggering. This is not Hyundai adding couple of mpg, or Toyota overstating the engine power by 5 hp. This is a systematic and brazen sabotage of the system. What I'm concerned about us IF such a systematic deception happened in other places, then it may simply too big to fail and the whole thing will end in some half-a..d apology and promise to do better. BTW, it will also prove that the whole emission boondoggle cooked by the politicians was a fantasy in the first place."

September 2015,"70% of autos sold in Europe are oil burners. I would expect that 50% of these are the small block engines.

But, why is it such a big deal to feel the need to fudge these numbers? If the bright people at VW can't cut emissions without ad-blue, so what? I'm sure the answer will be ""the price of each car will increase a little to a lot, and that would be unacceptable to the shareholders since sales will obviously be hurt,"" Hmm, at a potential fine of $37,500 for each car involved -- there is no way it would've cost this much in additional MSRP with an associated decrease in units sold.Three people can only keep a secret if two of them are dead.Don't Germans ever watch TV?"

Most buyers don't know that, though, since the EPA's name is on the official ratings.Instead, manufacturers ""self-certify"" and submit their data to the EPA. The agency tests about 15 percent of the new cars that go on sale each year, but it simply doesn't have the resources--in staff or in funds--to test every new car.It's worth noting that in the wake of fuel-efficiency rating reductions by Hyundai and Kia, and then by Ford (twice), the EPA has said it will step up its verification and may require manufacturers to confirm their lab results with on-road testing.But that's in the future. The VW trickery was discovered by a third party, which then passed it along a chain of contacts until it reached CARB and the EPA.(We've heard through the grapevine that ICCT shared its results with a Detroit Three automaker, which was actually the tipster to the EPA, but we've not been able to verify that--so treat it as rumor until proven otherwise.)"

If the EPA’s allegations are true, VW knowingly broke the law with some of their most important products and could face severe financial and criminal penalties. And even in an era of recall after recall, Automotive News puts this well: “Compared with other run-ins between the EPA and automakers, VW’s alleged violation stands out in its brazenness.”BTW, it seems that the scandal scope so far were the ""miracle"" engines that didn't require AdBlue urea injection systems, an expensive system present also on some of their models, as well as BMW, MB, etc. I remember them boasting how great it was that those engines didn't require those systems. Now we know why.I can only see it getting worse. Once Europeans officials get the scent, this has a real potential of destroying the company altogether.

September 2015,"Well, yes and no. 1. It was not time to buy banks after first news of big loan losses broke out in 2007. It was just a beginning. You needed to wait 18 months for that to fully play out (March' 09).2. It was not time to buy when BP platform went down. It took over six months.3. I already mentioned Lumber Liquidators. The resolution is nowhere near.4. Same with Target breach. This one was shorter, as more and more breaches came to light and market got sensitized to such news. It's almost never good time to buy right away after some truly company-specific adverse news with possible long-term consequences breaks out. It takes the market some time to price all the risks, scope the damage, also there will be initially enough people who will try to play it as ""opportunity"" without fully understanding the scope. The experience is, when one big bad news comes, there will be a lot of follow up stories that will create more and more concern. It's only when the pessimism reaches certain levels, way out of proportion to the actual damage, then it's time to buy. Usually months, sometimes longer. There is one important thing - the news must be really significant (potential 20 billion bucks levied by US government is important), legitimate (there are rumours, hoaxes, or embelishments happening all the time) and long-term (""more to follow""). The market is about pricing today future earning streams of companies and possible risks to them. Most of the time, traders try to exaggerate every day news so they can make a bit of more money. However, there are days, when it may be the opposite. Sometimes, the right thing is simply stay away until the damage can be assessed and pessimism gets too high. Not just yet for VW, IMHO."

September 2015,"The regulators in Europe are two-fold - European Commissions for Union-wide regulations and then the governments who adopt those regulations on their schedule, add something, sometimes negotiate removing or modifications. Then local officials enforce those rules (diagnostic stations, etc.).From what I read, it's very likely, all manufacturers may have gamed that system over there - VAG may be just the beginning of really ugly truth. I may even pose a small conspiracy theory that many people at high levels knew what was going on, but kept quiet because of carbon emission policies running amok. Everybody wanted to show progress, so they kept blind eye on some things that contradicted official line. There were articles published before this scandal on emission levels in big cities over there and numbers simply didn't add up (the supposed reductions due to better standards, vs. actual levels). The defeat software may be the reason behind it."
September 2015,I wonder what the regulations are in Europe and whether VAG and even others are also gaming the system?

September 2015,"In light of the recent scandal at VAG and their diesel ""special emission testing software"", seems like my words about a diesel scam were much more prophetic than even I imagined them myself. I thought they were just playing games with the emission testing to make them look better, sort of like the EPA gas mileage tests are gamed by many manufacturers. Now it looks like it was an actual scam. I have always been a vocal skeptic when it came to diesels in small passenger cars and I never fully believed in their ""superiority"" at the first place. Knowing how old diesels behaved, I knew that new ""superclean"", ""superquiet"" generation that we have now, had to come as at a significant expense. Common sense says that gasoline is much cleaner than diesel, yet the claims were the opposite, the numbers did not add up. I thought it was durability and maintenance and there were confirmations from the native markets of those cars, where there are systematic premature failures of double mass wheels, particulate filters and other parts. Essentially, it's been established by now that diesels are not expected to last any longer than gasoline engines as they used to and they actually may last shorter. Now it looks like it was a big scam altogether. I did not imagine that one. I wonder if European officials will follow and dig deeper into their testing procedures to see similar issues and more than just Volkswagen. It may be a start of something really significant."
September 2015,"My son is a car nut, but I doubt he could have avoided it; he was brought home from the hospital in my E24 M6 and spent his toddler years cruising in either my Club Sport or the T-Bird Turbo Coupe(a manual, of course). He always had a ball riding in my press loaners- especially the X5 4.6is, 645Ci, and Alpina B7. He even had the privilege of riding shotgun with Mike Valentine for 30 minutes at Mid Ohio- in Mike's GT3 RS 4.0. That said, he's not a Euro-snob, as he likes the Boss 302 as well as the C7 Corvette. I'm proud to say that he shares my ""No Boring Cars!"" philosophy."
September 2015,"When my daughter was 17 and took over ""my"" Volvo (which was intended to be her car when we got it), she named it. And first thing she did when we replaced it with the VW was think up a new name for it.she also couldn't wait to get a car, and loves to drive (the act, not just going someplace). Maybe she is a throwback? She did pick a college 8 hours away, and has zero expressed desire to move back in here long term after graduation! My son is also majorly hooked now on German iron after getting his Jetta. got about 16 months left on his lease, and has already been researching the replacement (likely and A3, unless he gets a better paying job and springs for an S3!).could also just be genetics at work? He did go to the car show every year since he was about 7 months old."
September 2015,"I took a look, not a drive, a look, at the latest and greatest Mazda Miata which lists for a number beginning with a 2. Not sure I'd want a two seater (then again, if the kid and 3 or 4 of his friends can't get in all at once, maybe that would be less, er, distracting). But, the point is, this car seems to be ONE of the exceptions to the ""no alluring cars"" comments I made above. Also, there are a couple of VW's that seem to have some sizzle to them.The thing is, it seems a lot of folks (of all ages) seem to think the market has very few noteworthy cars until the MSRP gets to a breathtaking number. How is it possible for some to and most not? Perhaps we've come to a place where differentiation is either not appreciated nor demanded by the market.The thrill (could be) is gone.That I can go out and get an S4 or something else comparable is all well and good -- but overall the folks today, upcoming, seem to actually WANT to live in their rooms or their parent's basements.. For me, at age 16, I wanted to go see the world (within about a 25 mile radius at least), without mom and dad, and the car afforded me with that ability. My wife, an attorney for a Fortune 1000 firm, and her attorney buddies even name their cars -- do 16, 17 18 year olds do that anymore?I must admit, I find it refreshing to know that for some the thrill is alive and well.My wife says (about her SQ5) "". . .every mile's a smile.""An oldie, but goodie: ""They've paved paradise and put up a parking lot."""
September 2015,"Nice write-up @markcincinnati. As a stepfather to a 17 year old, I've found it interesting how the acquisition of a driver's license and a car for teenagers these days seems far less significant (or even desirable) these days. What used to signify freedom and the ability to spend time with friends at times seems more of a chore for ""kids these days,"" who can simply ""interact"" with friends from the comfort of their own rooms via a screen. And, to be fair, from the parents' point of view, and somewhat dependent on where you live, traffic congestion and road conditions create an environment that certainly makes me uncomfortable sending our teenagers out ""cruising."" I agree there are plenty of alluring cars at all price levels. In fact, I think some of the most engaging vehicles are in the non-luxury, compact segment. Hence, my recent ownership of a Mazda3, replacing a mid-size luxury car. Unfortunately, it seems the luxury makes have started reserving the sportier, more engaging experience for the upper-end niche sport models. Whereas previous models of a 328i could provide a very engaging drive (and a manual for that matter), it seems you have to step up to an M3 now to get something as dynamic. So, ALL price levels? I don't know - I think there's something missing in the middle. Compacts such as my previous Mazda3, a Civic Si, WRX, the BRZ, etc. are certainly engaging. But if you want to combine that with more refinement and some of the luxury trappings we enjoy, you have to step up to the other end of the spectrum. Hence, my replacement of the Mazda3 with the S4."
September 2015,Wow! That is a nice wagon! Love it.
September 2015,"Now, this is a new 5er I would actually buy- a B5 BiTurbo Touring. A friend got to drive it while covering IAA Cars 2015 in Frankfurt..."
September 2015,"My 2₵: The Value of AllureOur “highways” – well not all of our highways, roads and streets – used to be something most of us looked forward to embarking upon in our cars – even in what for most of us in hindsight were piece-of-crap cars; e.g., my first car – one of mom and dad’s two cars – was an early ‘60’s vintage VW beetle (the thing didn’t even have a gas gauge). Shortly after I got my license and had pretty much resigned myself to driving a 36HP stick shift car with a fabric sunroof and AM radio and a sort-of heater, dad traded ""up"" (?) for a Plymouth Valiant with a slant-6 engine and a “three on the tree” stick shift (and first gear was not synchronized). This four-door “babe repellent” also had an AM radio, but it was also equipped with factory A/C – which seemed odd for an otherwise stripped of all creature comforts vehicle.I loved these cars – I knew they were pieces-of-crap, but I blocked that from my thoughts since these cars gave me freedom, tunes (on the AM) and what felt like unlimited mobility to drive from my bucolic and very sleepy, very little town (pop. 2,700 assuming everyone was home) north of Dayton, Ohio, to the big city (Dayton, if you’re wondering is still just barely a city in my opinion). Truth of the matter is that I rarely needed to drive the 50 mile round trip to Dayton, nor could I regularly afford the 50₵ worth of Clark’s premium gas (Clark only sold premium gas at that time, if you’re wondering) required for such an adventurous outing. Today, in contrast, our highways and byways now no longer symbolize [much] freedom, rather they are often seen as barriers to freedom:“Well I left my job about 5 o'clock, it took fifteen minutes go three blocks,Just in time to stand in line with a freeway looking like a parking lot.Damn this traffic jam, how I hate to be late, it hurts my motor to go so slow.Damn this traffic jam, time I get home my supper'll be cold, damn this traffic jam.” James TaylorWhen my 16 year-old-self got behind the wheel, it was darn near magical, the car was a mechanical being, to be sure, but somehow I was able to anthropomorphize my steed (really, a 36HP VW Beetle was a steed, no kidding) – it became an extension of me, I was no longer driving a machine, I was driving art, it was so cool it was hot. Crank up the single-speaker AM radio until it distorted and back off the volume a quarter turn and carefully balance the “tone control” to pump out all the bass that piece-of-crap speaker could muster. Everything was possible.Now, I have to admit, as much as the VW Beetle was not exactly a babe magnet, well the Valiant was truly a babe repellent, even though I figured out how to double clutch the thing to make certain I didn’t “grind a pound” every time I shifted to first-gear. Even so, the Valiant still represented possibilities and made promises to me (that it virtually never kept, I must admit). Still, everything was possible (in cars). Sundays, dad always would say “Let’s go for a little ride”. Off we’d go: Mom, dad and me in the other family car, the ’63 Chrysler Newport with push-button transmission, power steering and power brakes and both front and rear AM radio speakers. This one had aftermarket A/C even though dad bought it brand new from the next not-as-little town over Chrysler-Plymouth dealer. Ah, a big V8 and torsion-quiet ride, big whitewalls, bias-ply tires and full wheel covers – chrome everywhere – bling! Someday this will be mine I thought.This car would be a babe magnet, I was sure of it.Today, some of us, probably most of us, have lost that sense of possibility when we get behind the wheel, after all most Americans are getting into appliances, machines that simply cannot be anthropomorphized; and we’re getting to roads that allow movement like a pig through a python. In fact, if the 16-year-old's on my street are any indication, the future drivers aren’t even interested in driving until mom and dad make them by telling them “We’re not going to continue being your taxi service any more”.Then, the automobile gave us a sense of excitement, perhaps danger (benign danger, mostly, but we certainly thought we were baaaad dudes: ""Man, c'mon let's un-tuck our shirts and put masking tape over the word, 'root' on our root beer bottles"") – a sense that we were darn near outlaws, men (boys, really) without rules, barely a code, to constrain our freedoms. Woo hoo, “We're back in the saddle again”.Today, we’re mostly left with a deteriorating highway infrastructure that really can be dangerous, but driving cars that are, if nothing else, certainly very much less deadly but mostly without any gravitational pull. The fact that a KIA (fill in the blank) or Toyota (fill in the blank) is quicker, faster, safer, almost pollution free (by comparison), comfortable as can be and will have power everything, possibly GPS and probably AM, FM, and Satellite Radio, plus CD, Bluetooth and iPhone connectivity for the iPod function doesn’t forgive the allure that even in “SE” guise these appliances lack. I mean, really, my piece-of-crap VW Beetle had more allure than many of the things that pass as cars today possess – combined. Not many of us care either, as a glance or even a stare out of your office window to the highway below can attest. The cars go by and perhaps one in fifty is worth another second or two of your gaze. In a few short years, certainly less than a decade, the cars will be driving themselves about 75% of the time, because no one gives a damn. The cars lack allure. We’re over them. If there were unlimited mass-transit ""tubes"" that you could hop in and out of on a whim, well hell, why bother at all to go for another new Mazda or Chevy or Ford or Dodge (fill in the blank)? Nothing to see here, move along, you’ve got homes, let’s get to ‘em.Those of us on the entry level (or Premium class) luxury performance board here know about allure – FN’s trip to Europe driving a new BMW (his BMW, not a rental), now that’s what we should all aspire to. We’re again on the precipice. Again? Yep, we’re about to lose something we’ve always had – the sense that our cars are an extension of ourselves, hand-in-glove, everything’s possible (when we're in our cars). Gone, too, is the romance of the “little ride” with our parents or with our children. The thrill (of the next time I get to drive) is gone (one hopes not forever) for many. The romance, nay, the sex-appeal of sliding in behind the wheel of your new Chevy Caprice almost has no contemporary analogy except for those who allow themselves at least a $50,000 car purchase.Does it really take $50,000 to get allure? And, if so, how did it come to this? My father was a 6th grade math teacher, my mom a librarian, almost all cars purchased were “previously owned” (there were only 2 exceptions out of all the cars they ever bought that I can recall), yet “my” cars, my piece-of-crap cars were alluring, exciting, almost thrilling. I contend it is not necessary to spend $50,000 or more for an alluring car. I also contend that there are few car companies that realize they are killing or perhaps already have killed their future customers' interest in their products by not building alluring cars at virtually every price point. [Frankly, KIA may be one of the few exceptions despite my inclusion re: non-alluring and comments above.]Now where did I put the keys to that Valiant?"
September 2015,"Just did a bit more research - it appears that the DSG (7-speed) will be offered on the FWD models on the upcoming A4, with the AWD models continuing with the 8-speed. That's according to a Consumer Reports article. I can't say that I've driven a FWD A4 - for some reason you can't find them here in Colorado - but I have to imagine that DSG is a nice upgrade over the CVT."
September 2015,"breld:One can only hope you are correct. The DSG, of course, that I would expect would be the latest and greatest 7-speed DSG such as is offered as the optional (to the manual) transmission on the current S4. The press releases I have seen and have translated, however, claim the S4 will have the 8-speed Tip. Current A4 2.0T models come with the 8-speed Tip, but NOT the DSG 7-speed. Now, then, however, therefore, notwithstanding:The current iteration of the S3 ONLY comes with a DSG transmission -- a 6-speed version. I assume there are factors that impact what is and what can be, but I have to assume the 7-speed DSG is heavier than the 6-speed DSG. What I don't know is if the 8-speed Tip is lighter than the 7-speed DSG, however.I see no logic (marketing logic, which is as opposed to 'real' logic) in Audi offering US customers the A4 with a 6-speed DSG since most of the A4's sold in the US the past few years have been 8-speed Tips. I assume the number of takers on FWD A4's in the US is quite small, so for practical purposes, I will exclude them from my following remarks.Many of those in the market (for an Audi A4) for the first time, are probably cross shoppers, shopping against BMW, Mercedes and perhaps even Acura, Infiniti and Lexus. In a world where ""more is better,"" I can only assume a new Audi A4 will receive a ding if it doesn't offer at least as many speeds as the cars it competes with. BMW 3's will soldier on with 8-speed ZF sourced transmissions, Acura will have, what, a NINE speed transmission? Mercedes 7-speed, Infiniti 7-speed, who knows if Lexus will, for the 2017 MY offer 6, 7, 8 or more speed automatics -- they've been having 6-speed units on the AWD versions and 8-speeds on the RWD cars, so, perhaps they have or will soon be upgrading to all 8-speeds or, who knows even more speeds?The new shopper will HAVE to consider number of gears as a data point and if, for some reason, Audi chose to offer 6-speeds (DSG or not) while the other guys had 7, 8 or 9 speed units, I would think there would be some logic to the buyer saying, ""MORE is BETTER, so Audi is now not at the top of my list.""I have not seen any evidence, and boo hoo (no sarcasm), it certainly appears that the DSG 7-speed will no longer be offered on the B9 Audis.The only good news is that the 8-speed Tiptronic hardware and most especially software does continue to improve by imitating the DSG via a very expertly developed shift program. Said it before, I'm at least OK with the 8-speed Tip since it remains the best torque converter automatic I've yet driven.""Don't it always seem to go, that you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?"" - J. Mitchell"
September 2015,"If I recall correctly from the articles on the A4, that actually will come with the DSG as the sole transmission. With the upgraded 2.0T and the apparently improved driving dynamics, that should be very competitive in the segment."
September 2015,Now that's funny.
September 2015,"Here 'ya go, Gents.....http://www.leftlanenews.com/frankfurt-preview-2017-audi-s4-89670.html"
September 2015,"Congrats on joining the S4 owner ranks around here. In my opinion it is a car that does everything really well, still, I""d rather the choice be between a manual or DSG rather than an 8-speed Auto/Tip vs. CVT (for example). If the 8-speed is a light unit; that's one consideration, but being 8-speeds; find it hard to believe the weight savings came from the tranny. Heard it's 254 lbs. lighter than the outgoing model; that's good progress! However, they made it even bigger, which makes me wonder if they could have shaved an additional 100 lbs keeping it the same size."
September 2015,"@breld - When the car would reach your dealership in CO for re-delivery, you'd trade it in!"
September 2015,@flightnurse - thanks for sharing your experience! No doubt it makes me want to do this some day with my wife. Like you said - those memories will be ingrained with the car itself!
September 2015,"As someone who just recently purchased an S4, and chose the 6-speed manual over the DSG, I'll add that it was a difficult decision due to the DSG being so darned good. As others have pointed out, shifts are imperceptible, other than from an audible standpoint, which I liked. Now, I haven't been the biggest fan of it in some of our other cars (TT, A3), but I thought the particular application in the S4 was outstanding. At the end of the day, I made my decision based on ""one last go"" with the manual. I appreciate that Audi still offers it on the outgoing model, and thought I'd take advantage of it. That was a significant reason why I don't have too much heartache over buying a model that I knew would be replaced in the short-term. I suspect the manual won't be offered on the new model. When the S3 isn't offered with it, and they just took it away from the R8, I can't imagine why Audi would choose to offer it on the S4. In any case, if I were to upgrade to the new model in the future, I don't think the 8-speed tip would deter me. I've had similar transmissions in previous cars (535, X3) and thought they were great."
September 2015,"Nope, @nyccarguy had it right; it was a Lexus RX 350 to clobbered the front right end of my S4. I was shopping Subaru when the wife was looking for a new automobile recently; they lost out to the Golf Sportwagen, with get this, DSG & TDI. You know, other than the red paint looking terrible in 10 rather than 20 years, I'm not worried about the shoddy repair work anymore. The car has remained uber-reliable other than that one leaky coolant hose someone in Escondido, CA was probably responsible for. I haven't found anything other than a loose child seat hook bracket cover to take it back in for warranty; I need something else to go wrong so I don't waste my time over a little black plastic trim piece in the back seat. I think at the track the other weekend with temps as high as 109 degrees I cooked the bright red S4 badge paint on the brake calipers, maybe I can claim ""finish paint"" warranty on it and get new calipers  They are more of a smokey maroon now; though I haven't tried to clean them. Being so reliable, I think I'll keep mine until it gives me reason to not do so, especially since it has been proven at least one S4 that @graphic_guy had was troublesome."
September 2015,"I'd agree that Audi's implementation of DSG is spectacular both in 6-speed form in my '06 A3 (they mastered this 9 years ago at least), and in the 7-speed iteration of my S4. In D mode the S4 is smoother and more ""auto"" like than in the A3. To me, the tiny bit of lurching when coming to a stop is normal, I'm used to it, expect it, and don't notice it at all as such. I have heard that Audi did get some complaints with the early DSG's for not being very ""auto-smooth"" like. People didn't seem to understand it behaves more mechanical, more connected, and that it is a good thing as it is more like a manual in that sense. I don't mind feeling the shift under power. I'm afraid this change has nothing to do with drive-ability or consumer feedback, but simply a bean counter telling Audi they can make xxx $$$ more per car by using a cheap transmission rather than the best but pricey DSG. This bean counter is in for a rude awakening when sales plummet. The new R8 gets Audi's best dual clutch transmission, so they have figured out how to make it work in very high HP and torque heavy monsters. I think the review above comparing the very good 8-speed auto to DSG will echo a lot of other people's reviews of the ZF-8 speed tiptronic. It is good, but not quite as good as DSG. Progress going the wrong direction. Perhaps the mid-cycle refresh will correct the mistake, or it is Audi's way of raising the carrot to make people purchase the RS4 to get the right transmission."
September 2015,"With all due respect and a showing of [my own] ignorance, I wonder what driveability issues are you referring to?Given that both hardware and software components are in a state of constant revision, I can share some observations from the perspective of one who has a 2014 SQ5 (8-speed Tip) and a 2014 S4 (7-speed DSG) in captivity.The programming of the Tip makes it the best iteration of the ""slush"" transmission -- as someone called it -- I've ever driven. The DSG is the smoothest transmission I've ever driven in that, when left in auto shift mode, the shifts are basically heard, not felt. I know the transmission has up-shifted by ear and by virtue of the drop of the tach needle, but the progression in feeling is unlike traditional torque converter auto transmissions and unlike manual transmissions. Both the Tip and the manual transmissions have a momentary disruption of forward momentum when the transmission decides to shift or when the driver depresses the clutch -- watching from the side, when either one of these transmissions is up-shifted, the heads of the driver and a front-seat passenger are momentarily ""thrown"" forward at the moment of the depression of the clutch or up-shift of the auto -- there is no such throwing or lurching with the DSG -- in fact in that ONE aspect, I would think the DSG could be said to be somewhat like a CVT. Somewhat, not much, but a little ""somewhat.""Downshifting, again, is an area where the DSG excels -- when in full auto-mode ""S""port shifting program, the DSG transmission rev matches to the imminent downshift and the ""second"" clutch engages with virtually no kick. Only a manual transmission even comes close to this, but having said that, the DSG is so much smoother on a rev-matching down shift it isn't even close.Now, I've driven the S4 (DSG), SQ5 (Tip) and S6 (DSG) equipped cars -- of the three, two of them are just that little bit better in terms of their shifting prowess and smoothness. Again, with all of the above subtleties stated for the record, it is apparent that someone at Audi (or whoever writes the software) has done everything they can to make virtually all of the ""dead giveaways"" that you are driving a Tip as invisible and imperceptible as possible. In short, unless you're really looking for HARD EVIDENCE that the SQ5 isn't a DSG, you might not really notice the SQ5 is not a DSG. Over time and with the availability (as I have) of two very very similar cars to drive back-to-back for comparison, well, you probably would be able to discern the subtle differences between the DSG and the Tip. At this stage of my own posterior meter, I can tell the difference between the DSG and the Tip -- the Tip, NOT the DSG has some hint of drivability issues and even placing the Tip in ""S"" all of the time doesn't completely wipe out the ever-so-slight shift hesitation and shift lurch behaviors, although you really have to be paying attention to notice them.I have not (yet) driven an RS7 -- frankly because I just don't think it is worth $120,000 (even if I had millions in the check book to do with as I please). I also don't think an S7 is worth $10,000 more than an S6 just for the body style. But I'm also the guy who resents an extra charge for ""paint"" beyond gloss black or gloss white.I bring the RS7 up, not to reveal my proclivities and, er, cheapness for things such as pearl paint colors, but to remind anyone who needs to know, that Audi puts the very specially programmed 8-speed Tip in the RS7. Several reviews of the car noted their assumption that the RS7 transmission was another very fine implementation of the DSG; and, then, noting later in their review how virtually imperceptible the Tip is from the DSG as executed in the RS7.Under full throttle in dynamic mode, both our S4 and SQ5 are prodigious accelerative forces of nature -- both of them emit the joyful ""PHLTTTBBB"" (aka fart sound) upon up-shift and when in S mode have quick paddle shift moves (but paddle-shifts are just a smidge quicker in the DSG, however).Again, were the Audi folk to gift me (fat chance) a 2017 MY S4 Prestige 8-speed Tip with a torque vectoring rear differential and with red leather seats, I would be a happy man. Of course, this is based on my assumption that the hardware and especially the shifting software of the 2017 S4 Tip had continued to move it even closer to the characteristics of a DSG (which appears to be the programmers goal).I have heard that the BMW implementation of the dual-clutch auto did indeed have driveability issues -- but I have only heard that the Audi and Porsche implementation and programming of the DSG have few, if any, critics.What are the Audi DSG transmission issues?And, why, if the DSG is not a fun, friendly transmission for daily driving, do they (the mfgrs) keep making the programming of the Tip versions as close to the feeling of a DSG as possible?"
September 2015,"First it was a Subaru not a lexus, second with the devalue of his S4 his trade in value is less. The accident I'm sure is on his car fax."
September 2015,Car manufactures will never make everybody happy. I would assume too many customers complained about the driveablity of the DSG in normal traffic Enthusiasts will always lose out.
September 2015,Don't wait. Order another one to your specs. Trade in and get one of the last of the current generation while you can. Reset the warranty clock & get one that hasn't been clobbered by a Lexus RX.
September 2015,"I heard the bad news that not only did someone at Audi make the horrific decision to de-content the new upcoming S4 with a slushy 8 speed ZF auto, but they also decided not to make the 6-speed manual an option.If this is true, Audi should really just make the S4 with a CVT and call it a day since that would suit the customers this move is intended to impress. If the manual was made available, and my '14 S4 was totaled in the near future (hope not, but hypothetically speaking), the lack of a DSG option would make me get the 6-speed manual if available, if I was getting another new S4. Otherwise, hello Golf R!"
September 2015,"Mark...don't know if you saw the details...-Turbo 3.0 V6 (no more supercharger), 354 HP, 369 lb/ft, available from 1,300 RPM to 4,500 RPM.-6 speed manual (maybe), but most will get an 8 speed auto (no DSG) with a Torque Converter.-weighs in at 3594 lbs.-40:60 torque split front to back with standard Quattro-expected starting price of $50K"
September 2015,"Ray, thanks.."
September 2015,"Mark we saw one RS3 in Europe it was a 3 door hatchback, just cursing on the highway with us slow pokes, Since the #40i has gained HP the S4 should too."
September 2015,flightnurse -I have not been on this board recently [ not in the market in the near future ] and read several of your BMW ED posts - thanks for posting.Reminds me of the 2011 BMW ED trip with my daughter.- RayEnjoy the car when it reaches you - again!
September 2015,"The new S4 has been announced and the details are impressive -- of course the question for the US market, as usual, are led by: When will this (or some very similar version) be coming to our shores? The timing, for me, would be calendar 2017 at the earliest, but sometimes Audi shoots itself in the foot (if you ax me) by delaying the really fun cars for at least a year. Of course, I just read there will be an RS3 coming, with 350 HP, etc, which makes me wonder if folks will look at a 356 HP S4 and shop it against the RS3.Presumably, the S4 will be longer and wider, so perhaps the size, not the HP will mitigate and dilute the temptation to cross shop. Or perhaps the RS3 will be priced out of reach compared to the S4. Now, then, this makes me wonder if Audi may think it needs a non-avant RS4 to go up against BMW and Mercedes high zoot models (now that the RS5 is gone).If history is repeated, the new S4 will not take a breathtaking leap up in MSRP, but will take more than an evolutionary leap in content and refinement.2017 (calendar) could be a very exciting year indeed."
September 2015,Thanks FN....Great pics and a great travelogue. What a great way to buy a car.
September 2015,"So we left Beaune Wed morning about 9am, destination, Charles de Gaulle (GDC) airport, most of BMW drop off locations are at airports, we were scheduled to fly out of CDG, but the day before I found a much better flight out of London (Rick has a couple of ex-co workers now living in London) cancelled the original flights now book our new flights out of London Heathrow, all flights were booked on Frequent Flyer Miles, and one nice thing is when you cancel there is no charge, most airlines these days will charge you a ""close in"" fee if you book an award travel with in 2 weeks, however, since I have elite status with AA, that is waved for me. We super slabbed it to CDG, nice thing about France is speed limit is 130Kph, which is about 80, But like any country people travel faster then that. I averaged 90mph. We arrived at CDG at 130pm, got he car washed, (US customs requires the car to be ""clean."" there is a carwash at CDG, 8 euro later car was clean. Now, if you have been to Paris you know he city is horrible to drive in, and the French are just crazy drivers (really look at their cars), however, the route I programmed took us to the outside of Paris and missed most of the traffic. About 30 minutes before getting to the airport, the windshield cracks, I did not hear a rock or something hit it. Luckily the insurance on the car (that BMW pays for) will replace it. We get to the drop off location of the car, sign the necessary paperwork, and we are done, we say good by to the car, wont see her for at least 2 weeks. Total 3127 K driven on this vacation. Yes, there is a crack if you look in the middle of the photoFarewell photo...The Euro plates will stay on the car when it arrives at the Dealer, and the Dealer been instructed to leave the front plate on (AZ does not require a front plate.)This trip was about bucket list items, so another one was to take the Eurostar to London, the company that we dropped the car off took us to Gare du Nord train startion which is in the heart of Paris, it was an interesting drive.. We made it in 40 minutes, lets just say the French just do not care who they piss off. We bought the tickets at the train station, and was on board minutes later, we got the last two seats together facing forward. When we got on the train, there was this french women sitting in one of our seats, the business class trains are set up with single seats on one side, and two seats on the other, the two seats are set up to seat facing each other, so two people facing the direction of travel and the other are not. We we arrived, in her very broken English she wanted us to take the other seats, we said no. We knew from the seat map when we bought the tickets 3 people were sitting here, not 4. Come to find out, she decided she didn't like her single seat, plus a friend of her was on the train and wanted our seats. so they can sit together. Now the other passenger arrives (older lady), then the cabin attendant. The single rider (older lady) sits where the young women was to have sat, but she was refusing to move, and wanted us to sit in the other seats. Rick doesn't like traveling backwards. We tell the cabin attended this and we wanted our original seats, the young women speak french (but I think she speaks English too) to the cabin attended, so we end up in this circle of language, I think look at the young women, and said, I knew you speak English, so stop playing games. I was right, she did, so she understood everything I was saying, which really pissed me off. So I told her that we wanted our seats we reserved, if she didn't like then go find another compartment to ride in. She refused to move, needless to day, she won to a point, we were just moved to the Business Select Premium cabin... Like I said before of the French, We can do this because we are French.. It's the attitude that really piss's me off.. Europstar trains and dirty, they are getting new trains, I hope they have WIFI... We arrived in London about 7pm, Ricks friends picked us up and took us out to dinner, then to our hotel.ConclusionThe whole trip we talked about how this car will invoke memories as long as we have it. This is really the only way to buy a car, BMW will allow you to keep your trade in until your car arrives, I'm sure Audi and MB will do the same thing. The only difference on our next one, in the fall of 2017, we wont visit to many cities... Have been home now 6 days, and just got over the Jet Lag.... I'll call tomorrow and find out where the car is and if it has been assigned a ship yet, once I know the shipping line and name of the ship, we can track it's location..."
September 2015,At least Canadian...
September 2015,Couldn't the French claim that if it wasn't for them we'd still be speaking England's version of English?
September 2015,Maybe next year.. headed to Nicaragua in February.
September 2015,"The bar has been set for trips and pics of vacations. Who's next? Not gonna be me, at least not this year."
September 2015,You guys have more fun than I do on vacation. Must be the $500 tours..
September 2015,"Second winery Chassagne-Montrachet This is a smaller family winery, however, they product some excellent wines. It was harvest time in Burgundy so the grapes were flowing, we were shown around the winery by the owner and explained the whole process.So many of us remember Lucy crushing grapes with her feet, well, they don't do that anymore, they have machines for that. The machine rotates and crushes the grapes and the juice flows down.Crushed grapes Jucie from the crushed grapes, yeah look bad, but tasted good. Once they are done crushing the grapes, they are placed in huge vats and all the sediments settle to the bottom, this is done 3 times before the juice is places into oak barrels to ferment. Here is a map of the area where the winery is at, each color represent different types of grapes, one thing I learned was, the vast acres of grape vine we saw, are not all owned by just one company. The map show inside the vineyards small sections with lines in them, that indicated what this winery owns, as you can tell they are scarred all over the place. This is how it is done in France. Grapes that just arrived, and was picked about an hour before the photo was taken, yes, they were very sweet tasting.Father and Son loading the crusher for next batch.Next we stopped by one of the most famous and most expensive wine makers in the Burgundy region Romnee Conti average bottle of wine from this winery is $300 US. and no we didn't buy anything here..Next we went to Chateau Du Clos De Vougeot, The Clos de Vougeot vineyard was created by Cistercian monks of Cîteaux Abbey in 12th century, this is the only vineyard that is ""enclosed"" by a rock wall, and that is still intact today as it was in the 12th century. I could go on about this place, but do a search on it, it's an amazing place. Lastly we went to a very small winery, very interesting concept, the owner build a restaurant underground that features food and wine from the area. He also has a small collection of ""stuff""WineMore stuffThat was it for the tour, we were tired!! Had a great time and the A8L was awesome, I loved the message seat.. Now we get to wait for our wine to arrive. Lastly off to Paris to drop the car off"
September 2015,"When we arrived in Beaune (Sat evening) at the resort we stayed at, Rick asked me, ""So, when we doing the winery tours?""... Ummm, Winery tours... I guess I forgot to book that.. You can't come to the heart of Burgundy country and not go on wine tours.. Now the walk of shame to the concierges as this is going to cost me.... Dearly... Spoke to the concierges, told him what we were looking for, he nodded, and said he knew what to do... Oh lord, this will cost me.. Fast forward to Sunday morning, the same concierges informed us that he has us booked, cost 500 euro for the both of, and it's a PVT tour.. I knew it was going to cost me..So monday morning at 0900 on the dot a black Audi A8L pulls up and the driver, David, walks in and introduces himself to me, mind you, never meet the guy before. Introduces himself to Rick, and off we go.Ok, this is how one travels around wine country in France. David was great, and if anyone wants his contact info, please let me know. He worked in a few wineries around Beaune, knows a lot of people, he was able to get us into all the wineries for free and in before the crowds arrived. Very knowledgeable person and personable. First up was Chateau de Pommard The tour was great, we were taken down below where the wine is stored, very interesting and educational.After aging in the oak barrels then the wine is bottled, then stacked. After the tour it was tasting time Don't ask how much we bought... Interesting note, doesn't matter what winery we were at shipping cost to the US was the same..."
September 2015,"So as I mentioned Beaune, France is in the heart of the Burgundy region of France. So the first day we just walked about Beaune, it's much bigger then what Rick and I assumed it was. Now, most towns in Europe are old, and Beaune is no different, we are talking settled right around 1440, so the charm of the city is the age, and how clean the city is. Besides being in the heart of the Burgundy region Beaune also is known for Hospices de Beaune which was founded in 1442, it's an amazing place, hospice holds a special place in my heart. So sit back and enjoy the photos of the city."
September 2015,"You haven't been to Europe, I would have to day, that 75% of all 3 series we saw was a Wagon, We saw lot of A4 and A6 wagons, but yes here in the states we want SUV's... I'd take a wagon over a SUV any day."
September 2015,"Well, not here, but many other places.The marketing mavens have rendered them evil here, so we get to deal with SUVs, SAVs, & LMNOPVs, and god knows what else because, well, the sheeple ""like"" them.Oh boy."
September 2015,Wagony-wagons aren't such hot sellers anymore.
September 2015,"The only way to tell really is to import it, but I think it would sell well."
September 2015,It's a beautiful car but I predict that MB would sell 10's of them in North America.
September 2015,"Actually, that's about the only way to get one without all the stuff that the dealers order theirs with and with the one or two options you care about, like color."
September 2015,"Howdy group sorry about the silence, we are back in the states, so I can finish this photo log.So we drove from Marseilles France to Beaune (pronounced Bone), France. So why Beanue, France, Beaune is the wine capital of Burgundy, all the top winery's are here, Rick is into wines, and he wanted to come here. The drive up took longer then expected. We ended up getting caught up in a traffic jam at one of the toll booth's, the machine wouldn't take people's credit cards... That was a mess.. The photos are few, Typical small town/village in FranceSo you don't think I couldn't post a cool car photo. This car needs to be imported into the US, it's a CLS wagon, talk about Form over function, It is stunning in person.. This was the first one we saw parked, and had to take a photo of it.Enjoy"
September 2015,"FN - Regarding your eqipment specifications: I see you went to all that trouble to arrange for ED, then got a strippie!  (jus' kidding).At this point, it may be too soon for you to have reached the conclusion that we have, with respect to th around/top view cameras, but after living with my wife's Infiniti with that featire, it should be standard eqiupment (on all cars), I would imagine insurance claims and costs would decrease especially from parking lot fender-benders. Cool tech, IMO right up there with ESP and ABS.Sounds like you have a super-nice Bimmer, congrats on that!Frankly, to get this much interest and entertainment (to say nothing of the education/oinformation) most folks would have to pay. Edmunds and you have essentially made this possible for free. What a deal!Drive it like you live."
September 2015,"Excellent pictures and comments traveling Europe. Some serious wheels at that wedding for sure (except the limo, of course!). They really are getting good at bending metal at HyunKia!"
September 2015,"Mark, the car is basically fully loaded, that was the nice thing about about doing a ED, Now for 2016 BMW has made major changes to the 3 series, but the GT and 4 series car's haven't gotten the ""styling"" changes like the sedan, but other ""changes"" they have. ALL 3 series and 4 series cars come with sport suspension as standard, as well as sport seats, NOW, for some odd reason, BMWNA does not think the north american x-drive cars should have the sport suspension, doesn't matter if you get the M sport package or Sport.. So the trick to is order the Dynamic handling package, and had the same time you can order the M Adaptive Suspension (think GM's magnetic ride.) So with those two options the DHP is only 1K and the M Adaptive Suspension was only $700 your x-drive will have the moves of RWD cars. So with that, we also got the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Tech package (we love the heads up display) Drivers assistance package, Auto High beams, Alarms is standard for 2016. So we have 2500KM on the car, I love the ACC, but I wish there was a way to turn the adaptive part off, here in France if the french see the slightest opening between you and the car in front they will merge right over so the adaptive part of the cruise leaves about 8 car lengths so of course the french moves right in, so what does that do, slows the car down even more, because it now has to leave more room between you and the car in front...GPS, it's interesting, give you an example, when we left Marseilles for Beaune, we programmed the new hotel into the GPS, We first used the address of the hotel, the GPS couldn't find it, so we used google and found it that way. At times the GPS gets confused (like some women when they drive) and the directional pointer on the Nav screen will just spin around and it's not giving me a direction in which to go. This has happened a couple of time far, I'm hoping that problem will go away once the car hits north american soil..Lighting package, the 3 series get LED lights, we have Xenon, which are adaptive. The Auto High Beams are nice, I believe I can get the Euro High beams coded in the car, in which one of the high beams will go to normal lights and the other high beam stays on.Heated Seats, haven't tried them out yet..Side and Top Camera's, we have a 360 degree view of the outside of the car, cool feature.Premium Package, I love the Comfort Access, lots of cool features can be coded into the car, but you have to have Comfort access to do it. So all F3X cars have a toggle switch to go between Eco-Pro (boring setting, it's to help save gas) Comfort, Sport and Sport+, since we have the SAT (Sport Automatic Transmission standard BTW) we gained Sport+. Sport + allows for the some of the elec nannies to turned off or not interfere so quickly. Now my 320 has the same toggle switch, before I got my car ""coded"" to activate the SAT, when I would go from Comfort to sport the only thing that really changed was the throttle setting, it was more sensitive in sport. The GT with X drive handles wonderful, when we were in Lake Como, it was raining very hard, and at times I tried to get the car side ways, had it in Sport and it would not do it. Sport Seats, I haven't had much time to play with them, they are comfortable but could use some more adjustments.. Over all I like the car, we went back and forth on getting the 328 or the 335, part of me wish's we got the 335i, it's all all about the power..At the Welt, I sat in the rear seat, MAN talk about room, and the seat in front of me was positioned for me...We are averaging 24 with the car, which I don't think it so bad since we are averaging about 90 on the highways..The Drive today was to have taken 4 hours but ended up being 8.5, lots of traffic and a problem at one of the toll intersection...Night all..FN"
September 2015,"France is the only country that acts like this, I speak Spanish, and I sign in American Sign Language, but sorry I don't speak french... If you don't like it, that is your issue not mine. So far the rudest drivers have been the french, if there is a cm of space they will take it, no signal they will just come over. Had a run in with a motorcyclist today, he wanted to cut in, front of me, and got all bent out of shape because I wouldn't back up to allow him to pass... He stood in front of our car and [non-permissible content removed] at us, that was until I got out of the car, he hoped back on his bike and took off, the karma of it was he rear ended a car about 5 cars in front of us, a55hole..."
September 2015,"I agree with the sentiments regarding civility, manners, rudeness, surliness, etc. I did take history in elementary, high-school and at Miami University. As a visitor in many European and Central European (I've not gone east of the Czech Republic or Poland) I have not ever felt I should be entitled to anything due to America's participation and help in past wars. I have Brussel-ian, Italian, Netherlandian and Luxemborgian (?) relatives. My relatives all speak at least three languages, the folks who live in The Haugue speak, Dutch, German, French, Italian and English. The locals in Prague, universally seem to speak, in this order, Russian, German, English and Czech (some also add another language, either French, Polish or Italian). So many folks, however, seem to have a first goto language.My point in some previous posts was the contrast between citizens of various countries -- the French were rude (at least some were); initially, I would not automatically assume they would know if we were British or Americans -- all the menus use the British flag to indicate which part of the menu is in English. I don't recall ever seeing the American flag in any country on a menu to indicate English translation here. I rarely told anyone where I was from, unless asked -- which the folks at Oktoberfest in Munich seem keen to know.I don't think anyone I've ever known who has been to Europe goes there with anything less than a sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the countrysides, the diversity of the cities (knowing that they are not 200 years old, but multiple times 200 years old). I know of no one travelling to a European destination, who has anything but a desire for a vacation -- it has never occurred to me to think too much about WWII, while visiting a European country, for instance, other than my trips to Poland (Krakow, Warsaw) where we went to the concentration camps, the salt mines. Then there was the trip to see old Warsaw which was lovingly restored after it was virtually leveled during the war. Even Prague which does have some remnants of Soviet occupation, seems much more of the now, not the then, so to speak.I have been to Germany and Italy the most, and I have been to German museums which do put history on display -- the good, the bad and the pure evil that we all have learned about. In Amsterdam, I went to Ann Frank's house, which was also presented, er, ""objectively."" Been to Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin, too -- went to the museum, which again put some very unpleasant things on display. But the trip to the Doges Palace in Venice with the torture devices on display, is also quite eye opening.I don't recall any resentment of the US on display anywhere -- the museums didn't editorialize or express regret, anger or, hmm, je ne sais quoi. I saw nothing that would encourage an American to somehow believe in their superiority. There were, generally speaking, no ugly Americans -- or even ignorant ones as were depicted in the Hepburn movie, set in Venice, ""Summertime.""Continuing . . .Took a tour of the Maginot Line, and my tour guide -- French -- made fun of France for ""how you say, a lame attempt to prevent the Germans from invading."" We did smile at his attempt at humor, but again, most of my two dozen+ trips to Europe have been as a guest in the [whatever] country, and I was pleased to be able to be a guest, in fact, I often was humbled by the locals as they were multi-lingual, whereas I was only able to speak a little German (I took lessons for about three months back in the 20th Century). I expected very little out of the local folks I would interact with, other than a certain level of courtesy since they were, after all in the hospitality business; and I did not condescend to them. Yet, go figure, the French sometimes seemed on the verge of being annoyed by our presence with the exception of those involved with customer service at very high buck restaurants and our hotel, the PARIS - LE GRAND ($500+ per night, 5 stars). BTW, the hotel is an oh wow experience. I loved it, but I would, knowing what I now know, never stay there again (since most of the time we were there, in our room, it was night and we were in the room with no lights on, sleeping; I can find a very nice place to sleep for less than half that amount (often 3 stars), in other words; if my goal was to just stay at the hotel, I might think differently, however.)Anyway, FN has really come through for us all -- lots of great travel and adventure, great pics and of course some car talk. I, for one, would love to hear more about the car, the driving -- any positives, any surprises, overall impressions, any ""I wish it did this"" comments, etc. It is a BMW, after all, so I would expect it to do almost everything in fine fashion, but still. Hey FN, what features and options did you configure the thing with, and which ones are you most impressed by? Is this your first vehicle with Sat Nav, if not, how is BMW's interface in your opinion?Back to some travel tips. . . Far as I'm concerned, Paris should be on everyone's list -- at least once. I've been there several times and despite some surly service folks, I would go again in a heartbeat, even seeing the Mona Lisa, so far, has not gotten old. Darn thing is really tiny though.Paris restaurant that I particularly enjoyed: the Jules Verne (in the Eiffel Tower): http://www.lejulesverne-paris.com/enIt may be a bit touristy, but the food is to die from, er, for, I mean.C'est la vie"
September 2015,I agree 100%. I just can't stand the French attitude; in contrast I love the Italians and they seem to love us- and we DEFEATED them...
September 2015,"Agreed. There is no excuse for lack of courtesy, regardless if where you are. Then working in a service industry, it should be you way of life."
September 2015,"I don't mean to sound like an ""Ugly American"". It's just that you hear so many comments from Americans of all stripes about rude and boorish behavior from the French. Shame on any American who treats a French visitor rudely because they can't or won't speak English. Also shame on any American visiting France who feels they are entitled to special treatment because of what happened during WW II. I'm just asking for common courtesy."
September 2015,"Here is the thing - those bailouts create resentments, especially when you consider that France used to be a superpower, cultural and science center of the world. Until WW2 French was the language of cultural elites and scientists (most articles with scientific breakthroughs were published in French journals). All of it went away in just few years, after a humiliating defeat (France didn't put much longer resistance than half sized Poland, attacked from behind by Sovients). Reminding them about it is not helpful, it's kind of like this big kid from high school with good heart but no manners pulled you out of the school yard butt kicking and then every time he sees you, or visits your house, he loudly proclaims to everybody who can hear how much he sacrificed and how grateful you should be to him. BTW, this kid is now getting all the awards, accolades, you used to get, college scouts come to see him, not you, etc. You get the picture.To be clear, I'm not trying to diminish your father's sacrifice, or Americas role in the War, or the fact that people in Europe should be grateful for it. I'm from the part if the world that had misfortune to be ""liberated' by the Red Army and I would trade with French in a second. However, you also need to understand the wounded pride, which resulted in irrational lashing out against the very people who don't deserve it, but are close and convenient. The best way to deal with it is shrug it off and not get too flustered. It's just ignorance. Also, you need to remember that while substantial sacrifice was made, USA was also by far the greatest beneficiary of the new world order after the War and the casualties suffered are not even in the same order of magnitude and devastation than those suffered by the Europeans. Average European sees America as a net beneficiary of the War and it's not an unfair view from the global perspective (grant you not necessarily you father's).American soldier came, fought gallantly, often died or got wounded, but then came back to his country that was intact and stronger than ever. French, Polish, or even English soldier had to stay in their ruined country, rebuild it from ground up, sometimes starving in the process, often having his family decimated. Having those proportions being remember, you may find out much easier to get along, even with French."
September 2015,"I've never been to Europe, but my wife visited Italy about 3 yrs. ago. Her interactions with the locals were very positive. She'd love to go back. As for the ""surly French"" - I've heard that same comment from many Americans of varied backgrounds who've visited France. My opinion is if it wasn't for Americans like my late father who participated in D-Day they would be speaking German now. And my late Aunt told that to a surly sales person she had an unpleasant interaction with in Paris. God Bless America!! FN, thank you so much for going to the trouble of posting your travels and pics. Very enjoyable and enlightening."
September 2015,Spoken like someone who knows what they do at Ft. Knox (besides store gold). I've been involved with the engine since about '94.
September 2015,"These sensitivities can run very deep and show up in surprising places. For example, in Belgium there are Flemish (Dutch) speekers and French Wallons. Brussels is a French speaking enclave in the middle of Flanders, the locals feel the have been ""invaded"" by French speakers, both government and European Union officials. You can imagine the Flemish not appreciating that. It is considered polite there (at least by the Flemish) that when you want to communicate in French, you ASK if they speak French. They do, but they want to be asked. Similar thing goes in some post Soviet Union countries. They all are working very hard building their national identities, often overcompensating. Most speak Russian, but they again have to be asked."
September 2015,"And that is why the French don't like Americans. Most don't even bother to try to speak in French instead expecting everyone else to speak English. Well guess what - they do but they appreciate your faulting attempt to speak their language. Once you start to ""embarrass"" yourself they will speak with you in English. It's called courtesy. How would you feel if a tourist came up to you in Cincinnati and started speaking in French without even an attempt to speak English? I'm guessing the same as that waiter.When I travel to Quebec, my limited French gets a smile and a hearty English reply."
September 2015,FN...loving youre report and pics. Thanks!
September 2015,"walking around Marseilles you see some interesting things, and cars, so enjoy today's photos.. Scooters are the way to get around town, and let me tell you they will let you know it too. Just a random shot Yes, they are looking for the next winner of The Voice of France here in MarseillesOk so we are americans, we stopped in a Mikey D's to get a coke, interesting place, you can order take out or have it served at your table and order at this Kiosk, the McCafe is a separate area in Miky D's, they had pastries and macaroon's.So now it's all about the car's we saw, the first if a Peugeot wagon, very popular and a looker too.Another Peugeot hatchbackHere is an Audi A2Here is a surprise, this is a Kia, called a Ceep, very good looking car.We can park how we want, because we are French..The Mediterranean, and sorry guys no topple women at this beach...An Alfa 147, another popular car in EuropeThe names car companies give their cars, we had a good laugh at this one. So the next couple of photos are interesting, we ran into a wedding procession of the well to do, all the license plates were from Monaco. This AMG did not sound stock at all..Now this is what the Bride rode in, a limo of a Chrysler 300 with a RR front end...Now some random photos of the cityOn our walk back to the Hotel we came upon this glass cover, very interesting, this is a photo of my taking a photo straight up, looking down at me.Just the harbor So some of the Chrysler cars are brought over here but sold as Lancia, the 300 is called the Thema, It's a big car over here..Thanks it for now, off to Beaune France."
September 2015,"Mark, I'm 52, I agree with you on the travels of Europe, and the secert if taking a train is to take an over night one.."
September 2015,"You can buy a ""pass"" ahead of time, but since the machine was in french I didn't know how to use, so at each toll booth, I'd pay with cash, now the most expensive toll was in Italy, 32 Euro"
September 2015,I would only return to France if we were at war with that country- and I had an M1A2 with at least 500 rounds of M830A1 ammunition.But that's just me.
September 2015,"You commented about German, er, personalities then followed up with your observations about French personalities. Granted, my European travels have been entirely recreational, but I would say that only in 2 countries have I ever noted an attitude that was less than gracious. France (several times) and Switzerland once in Lucerne (come to think of it the person in Lucerne had a heavy French accent.)The German people have always been friendly, polite, courteous and sometimes playful even. I've been to Oktoberfest about 6 times, and when going into a beer tent, you join a large group of people at a picnic table and within a few minutes it seems the folks are wanting to know about the US, US sports and are trying to teach us Americans some of the German-only songs that come up every 15 minutes or so between good ol' Rock and Roll. A gentleman and his father were in Munich for Oktoberfest and when they found out my wife was a lawyer, the older man bought my wife an order of peeled radishes (covered in salt) from one barrister to another. We had a great time. The folks on the subways in Munich, too, are always willing to help you figure out which stop will get you closest to your destination.In France, on the other hand, we went to a bistro, like you see in the movies, in Paris and the waiter gave up his picture for the dictionary next to the word ""surly"". Apparently since tipping is not as serious as it is in the US, this waiter was actually pissed when we thanked him (in English) when he brought us our wine, beer and cheese saying (in heavily accented French) ""why can't you people even TRY to speak French?"" OK, well perhaps I could say merci, but other than asking ""how's the weather"" and saying ""I like chocolate ice cream"" I didn't think I wanted to embarrass myself or run the risk of butchering my communications (especially since the menu we were given was multi-lingual). How wude!The staff at our (5-star) hotel in Paris was totally gracious and friendly, but my impression, from several interactions with the locals, was that they don't like us much -- or maybe they just don't like me. I went ahead and gave an American tip anyway, who knows if anything changed. The Italians were huggers and both-cheek kissers (didn't have that happen in Germany, but they were friendlier than the French.)FN, I have no clue as to your age -- I am 63 -- I started going to Europe when I was about 20 years younger (and richer), but it can be done for not too much money, if you realize that most of the time you spend in a Hotel it is dark (meaning, 3-star hotels with air conditioning work just fine). Once I got over the sense that we needed 5 star hotels (because, well, you never know), we found we could see Europe for not much money (saving our coin for fine dining instead). Also, we don't use cabs anymore, we figure out how to use the trains and subways -- and for the long trips, we splurge on first class train travel if the distance is over 5 hours. Also became a fan of night trains with full size beds (saves on hotel bills too). My point is, unless you're much much older, I urge you to make this trip one of many, many more you should take. Benelux was a fun couple of trips -- Amsterdam, Brussles and Luxembourg city, do it again, do it again. Anyway, you've taken me, at least, on a great vicarious trip with you two. My only regret is that you didn't get an Audi, but there's always next time. Keep 'em coming.Ciao (baby)."
September 2015,"Yes to all. France has a transponder system call Liber-T that works like EZ Pass. The toll booths take cash in multiple currencies including Euros, US Dollars, Swiss Francs, UK Pounds, et al as well as credit cards."
September 2015,"We were at two ""rest stops"" and both were like that. Might have gotten them on a bad day. But so far the attitude of the French is, We've French we can do that, seems to apply."
September 2015,"Curious FN since you had a picture at a tool booth. Is there some kind of transponder, or do you need change in the right currencies? Or bills with these being a manned booth?I'm so used to EZ pass now, couldn't function without it."
September 2015,"@flightnurse, I love your Europe posts and pics.  The rest stop in Italy looked fantastic - we sure don't see anything like that here. The French restroom surprised me.  I guess there are lazy employees in all countries.Keep 'em coming!"
September 2015,"Some people will view your comment that people driving faster AND safer at the same time is blasphemy for the myth believers of ""speed kills."""
September 2015,Thank you Mark...
September 2015,"So we drove from Erbusco to Marseilles France yesterday, we decided to just do the superslab and get there fast, well 8 hour fast..So my impressions of Italian drivers, they aren't as reckless as you hear about, they follow most of the German or Austrian driving rules, 1) they only use the Right lane to pass, 2) they use their left turn signal if they want you to move over, and 3) yes, some are crazy.So we are motoring down the A5 autostrata and come up to slower traffic so we slow down, then barreling down on us is a VW passat wagon (they are big in Italy) and yes, it's a TDI.. The VW driving is flashing his lights, turn signal on, looks pissed that I didn't move over, Once we clear traffic and people move over (this whole time VW driver is inch's from my bumper) I nail the gas (we have 2200km on the car) and wham, talk off. VW growing smaller and smaller in the mirror. Top out at 135mph, we reach slower traffic, VW own barreling down doing the same thing, flashing lights, turn signal, giving me the Italian salute, not too sure if it was a good one or bad one. Again, once traffic opens up, and people move up, I take off, and the VW gets smaller and smaller in the mirror. Again, top out at 135, reach slower traffic, again VW driver flashing lights and turn signal, this time once we clear traffic, I get in front of slower traffic and pulled over the right land (this A5 has 3 lane's in each direction) and the VW pulled up, it's quite funny, he can tell he has it floored but not moving so fast, I nail it get in front, and pull away. Had to slow down speed limit lowered to 110 kph. VW owner catch's up and passes me.. He finally got what he wanted. It's interesting that it doesn't matter what country they are from they all barrel down on you at warp drive then get stuck on your bumper like that is going to make the car in front go faster.. FranceWhat to say about France, if you think the Germans have an aire of attitude, you need to come from France. The attitude is, we can do that because we are french... Merging traffic, they will pull in front of you if there is day light between you and the car in front, they don't care about their cars, well most french don't. We stopped in Monaco, did the tourist thing, stopped in front f the Casino, and got a photo of the car, TALK ABOUT CROWDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The cars, WOW, the Cars, I got one photo of a Lambo, lots of make there too. The streets are narrow REALLY narrow.. Lots of construction going on and our GPS wasn't updated on this, so it took a little longer to get to the Casino, but we got there.Marseilles What to say about Marseilles, I didn't know much about the city except it was a port city. It's a very old city, and it shows, when you come in from the toll road, you come in through the slums, the GPS worked great, some of the streets we went down, were REALLY narrow,dirty, and stinky. Insane is a word that Rick used a lot....My thoughts of Marseilles, lots of immigrants, usually from north Africa, lots of different cultures, Christians, Muslims and so on. Have seen some women in Burka's walking about here and all over Europe, the native people of Marseilles aren't happy with most of the immigrants. It's a very diverse city, the food says it all, more on that later.So here are the photos from our trip to France.. In Italy they have rest stop's but nothing like what have in the US, the rest stop has gas, food and places to eat the food outside, and they are SUPERCLEAN... The next couple of photos is one place we stopped to get gas and something to munch on.So we stopped at a French version of the roadside gas/convenience store what a big difference, the placed looked like it was about to be shutdown, hardly no drinks in the coolers, and the bathrooms look disgusting (this was the real reason why we stopped) see for yourself. A far cry from what the ones in Italy looked like,So car's in Europe, we have seen some American cars over here, here is a photo of one that we had a good laugh at.Monaco is supper clean, VERY clean in fact. Monaco is not a country, it is part of France, but it is a Principality, their license plates say, Principality of Monaco on them..So I know you are all waiting for that Lambo photo, so here it is..Traffic lights are interesting here, if you do not stop behind the crosswalks you will not see the traffic lights, but the French being The French have a fix....Once again the GPS, she works well, she really does but at times I have to wonder, when we left Monaco, we put into the GPS the hotel address and said, the faster route, even toll roads, well..... For about 60 km we were on two lane country roads, then finally back on the toll roads.. She tries..So I'll end this installment with a photo taken from our Balcony over looking the harbor and looking at the monument that is roughly 500 yrs old, it's a night photo.."
September 2015,"Circle, the GT is my partners car, in the photo at The Welt, I'm the Younger one, (by 9 yrs)."
September 2015,"To live and work, Germany; to live and live and live, Italy. My wife's family (from Columbus, Ohio) have an apartment in Venice (and they are so gracious as to give us the keys whenever we go), so we ALWAYS to to Venice. And, we do love Venice, but, to me, Venice is good for about 3-days before it gets on my last nerve, the place is just so crowded and, if possible, just keeps getting more and more commercial. A short train ride from Venice, however, is Verona -- a city (well, town) that while certainly for the [German] tourists, retains walkability without pain, and, for my money has better restaurants, by far, than are widely available in Venice.The ""oldest restaurant in Italy, Europe? the World?"" is in Verona -- it is called The 12 Apostles, and the food there bests even Tantris (Munich's best, I think). Apostles is built right on top of the original Roman road, and if you tip the manager, he'll take you to the basement which as a plexiglass floor allowing you to walk on the Roman road, more or less. http://www.12apostoli.com/en/Hmm, I'm seeing a pattern here -- I live to eat!FN -- reading your stories and viewing pics have been, these past few days, the best parts of my day. Gratzie!"
September 2015,"So the trip from Slovenia to Erbusco Italy was a straight shot on the Autostrata, as we wanted to get to the resort we were staying at, it exceeded our expectation, it is nestled in the foothills of wine country of northern Italy, the resort is surrounded by grape vineyards, a perfect place to relax. Once we arrived, we just drove around the area to take in the sights.Yesterday we went to Lake Como, now lake Como is shaped like an upside down Y, for me it's one of the most beautiful area's of Italy, when we left the resort it was gloomy and overcast, on the trip up we got hit with a very heavy downpour which cleaned the windshield of all bugs! We stopped in Varenna for lunch, then took the Ferry to Bellagio (yes, the hotel in Vegas is named after the city.) Then we drove home, but the rain had stopped but was still gloomy. Didn't matter the area is still beautiful. Hotel in Varenna, just on the water.Waiting for the Ferry to arrive, the Bently's owner saw our plates and asked where we were from, when I told him he stated he was jealous of what we North Americans can do with the ED.Out on the lakeLastly when we got back to the resort, there was a Infiniti Q50 that had a 2.2l turbo-diesel Oh yeah on the start of this adventure, I got a ticket for going the wrong going down a road, the damn GPS told me to go, but I didn't see the sign saying One Way... 27,50 euro fine...We are off to Monaco, Nice and Marseille (staying in Marseille.) Ciao"
September 2015,"BMW has what they call Individual colors for both exterior and Interior leather colors, as well as Options, when you choose an Individual color the car gets painted at a different facility, so the added price is the while process. Now, the 3 GT is not built at the same factory as the 3 sedan, touring, 4 coupe and grand coupe. So for our GT to get painted mediterranean blue, the body would and parts would have to be taken off the assembly line, shipped to where the 3 series is built, painted and send back to the original factory for completion. BMWNA does not allow for Individual options on the 3 series in the US, but they are available for BMWAG customers.We took the BMW factory tour this time and watch 3 series sedans and wagons being built, was very interesting to watch."
September 2015,"Yes the Genesis was a trade in, BMW will allow us to keep it until re-delivery."
September 2015,"It's all marketing and revenue maximization. Show a lower base price, but then make sure everything is an upcharge. BMW has been doing this for decades, Audi (at least in the US) not as long but they are getting there more and more.It's the same reason you can get a certain cell phone for some lower price but the base model has only 16Gb which is pretty minimal. Of course the upcharge to 32 or 64Mb is way out of proportion to the actual cost of those changes for the manufacturer. Instant profit!"
September 2015,@markcincinnati - I agree with you.  They do it because they can.  For the second time in 4 years has specifically told the Porsche dealer she refuses to pay $800 extra for metallic paint.  Her 2011 Cayenne was White.  Her 2016 Cayenne is White.

September 2015,"Because they can . . .Maybe this is old fashioned thinking.It seems to me, if you're going to market your car with a choice of ten standard (non-custom) colors, the price should include the cost of the paint. When the customer requests a ""non-standard"" or custom color, well, whatever the traffic will allow should govern the price.I've taken the tour through the Audi factory in Germany (6 times), and they are very proud of the part of the tour where you get to see the paint booth. There is a display near the paint facility that has the entire spectrum of available colors displayed as somewhat large paint chips (for the workers or the customers? to see). There were dozens of Audi colors apparently able to be specified -- I would call them non-custom.I understand that Pearl Swirl Pink is probably not a color chosen often, ditto some fantastic purple swirl colors -- but, I assume the fact that they are ""on the wall"" means the factory just didn't make a one-off paint blend for a customer (perhaps Bentley does this, but I would not imagine Audi would not for $1,000, in other words.)We're down to two (black gloss and white gloss) standard colors these days -- literally every other standard color costs extra. The Audi Exclusive line (should one venture into their paint pallet) costs even more on top of that.It just irks me to be charged for something that shouldn't be a question. Silver is not a custom color, hell, even the purple infused black Audi calls Panther black justifies a $1,000+ optional add on. Pull the other one.I know, I know, everyone does it and seems to get away with it -- and I do assume that some paint colors cost more to fabricate than others, but couldn't these companies just bury the cost in the base price and let the customer pick what they want. This is especially annoying since most folks don't order their cars, and therefore have no say. Rare is the car on the lot that is gloss black -- the ones on the lot are pearl black or panther black or oolong black or whatever the name du jour is. But at anything over 10 feet away, they all look black and shiny.Even the Ibis White (a free color) looks little, if any, different than the metallic white offered -- beyond 10 feet away.I had no issue paying for a full-on leather interior (no alcantara, that is) for my S4, but I would have been miffed if leather was standard and yet RED leather was $1,000 upcharge. God help me if I wanted the leather in a non-standard color.I'd gladly pay for a heated steering wheel or heated rear seats -- those options weren't available. But 'cmon, black or white paint or pay up? Luckily I am fine with white.Now, my wife, on the other hand, just rolls with it and says, $1,075 for the color is OK. I've watched the cars being painted, mostly it's done by robots -- does it really cost THAT much extra to get one in silver? Roll up your arm and bend over!"
September 2015,@flightnurse - your car looks sensational in Imperial Blue.  I like those wheels too.  Did you guys trade in Rick's Genesis?  Or do you do that when you get the car re-delivered?
September 2015,"Dino thanks, yes it's Imperial Blue, we both wanted Mediterranean blue but to get that color it would have been 4 week delay and $1930 bucks.. My 320 is Jet Black and know all about how dirty they get, but thanks for the warning.."
September 2015,The Q50S is silver....looks clean for a very long time...can't see any dust!
September 2015,"Congrats, Nurse. I have dark blue, too. Mine is the older version (Deep Sea) rather than yours Imperial (I think), but they are quite similar. One word of caution - the car always looks fantastic when just washed and detailed, but it's absolute dust magnet. That blue will show you every speckle of dust. I learned to live with it."
September 2015,FN....double WOW!!!!!!
September 2015,Excellent photos. I see your son's GT is one of the larger cars on your journey.
September 2015,Wow!
September 2015,"So it's 1045pm had a great day, we are staying in Erbusco Italy, it's about 20 miles east of Bergamo, where my surname is from, going to meet cousins I have never meet before.. We are staying in a place called L'Alberete it's a hotel right in the middle of wine country, the views are breathtaking. So to catch you up on the driving from yesterday, we left Salzburg to go to Lake Hallstatt, what a place, and the tourist love it. It's also home to one of the biggest salt mines in Austria. The Drive there was about 2 hours, nothing to really report, ate lunch hung around and left, about 2pm. Now this is where it gets weird, we I put the info into the Nav system to get us to Ljubljana, Solvenia I told it NOT to take toll road or highway. This was a big mistake. The Nav system said it was about 200 KM away, and said we would arrive about 6pm, About two hours into the drive I noticed the time to arrive keep getting longer, I went back into the nav system and saw what was chosen as the route all ""B"" roads.. I fixed this but we were so far buried into the ALPS it didn't matter, we saw some great places, then we came upon a accident. After sitting for about 30 minutes, one of the fireman came up and told us we can wait 2-3 hours before it is cleared or we can turn around and take the ""detour"", when I asked him about this detour he couldn't answer the question, mind you the Nav gave us an alternate routes but we had to go forward about 20km before they took effect (that wasn't going to work.) so we turned around and followed people who were just as lost, but they spoke German. We got a gas station and asked someone there, they gave us direction and found the detour,once we got half way through the detour we turn the Nav back on and found us a route to get moving. But this route, routed us OVER the ALPS, we hit the highest point of 1765 meters (close to 6K ft) we finally got into Slovenia, and arrived at are hotel about 815pm, about 2 hours later then we wanted.. Ljubljana is a wonderful city, we hit the town about 845 for dinner, we were supised on how many people were walking about, we were by the river that splints the city in town. Lots of history there and we both want to go back. It's a very modern city.Salzburg has large elect bus network, but you have to see this mess all over the place.Austria, like German have a lot of lakes, this is just one of them. Here we meet a daughter and father who were riding bikes from Munich to Lake Halstatt they are on holiday..Hatchback and Wagons are all over the place in Germany and Austria, this has to be one of the more popular models around Europe, I would day 90% of them are diesels I saw many 118d or 120d's. BMW also makes this as a 3 door hatch, also the A3 5 door (the one we get) as well as the A1 is very popular, and most are oil burners. First real photos of the car in bright sunlight the blue look amazing..The 3 series has a mid-life cycle for 2016, but the GT and 4 series do not get one, however, both the GT and 4 series have received some updates that the 3 series gets. First the Rims, these have more of a grey tone to them less silver, also the middle consul and AC controls are different and lastly, the rear exhaust is black not silver this photo shows the rear exhaust.The next two are in Lake Hallstatt, truly an amazing place.Last is a shot of a town we detoured through, got to love iPhones and GPS, I had no idea the name of this town, but when you take a photo with the phone it says the GPS coordinates and will stamp the photo with the name later on. The name of this town is Bad Aussee, it was really charming. BTW I don't think this town gets this many cars..."
September 2015,"I don't think people really know why they moved over into another land most of the time, maybe just out of habit.So driving over here is a treat, and the people really know how to drive, they do drive faster then posted speed limit even on ""B"" roads, but they are safe drivers. You do not see them texting, or talking on the Cellphone, or putting make up on while driving, plus on ""B"" roads there are bike all over the place.. It amazing to see how many bike share the road. Now, no bikes are allowed on ""A"" roads. ""A"" roads would be like major highway, ""B"" roads are just that the back roads. But people are very focused on driving, when we came into Solvenia, you wouldn't have known, the roads are in excellent condition, smooth as silk. So we are in Italy, the A2 Autostrada was fast and smooth, car is passed the 1200 mile point and now we can open her up. had it up 135mph rock steady. more on that later time for some cappuccino..ciao bella"
August 2015,@flightnurse - excellent pictures and play by play of your ED journey! Keep 'em coming!
August 2015,Don't let science get in the way of good politics and government funding...
August 2015,"The fact traffic enforcement concentrates on speeding tickets (which lead to virtually no danger or accidents), and routinely completely ignores left lane passing laws is one of the biggest crimes of the past century. Police should absolutely ticket the driver causing the problem (the left lane impeder) rather than the symptoms (people passing on the right).No one ever accused the highway patrol of using logic or common sense though."
August 2015,"I actually found the previous generation A3 and GTI to differ greatly. However, with the GTI continually making many improvements, I find the 2015 GTI to finally be up to snuff. Of course, since they've caught up at VW with the GTI to the A3, they no longer offer a 5-door A3 (although I think that's changing with the A3 E-Tron's)."
August 2015,"Mark our car is a US spec car, the nav is in English, but we have it set for Kilometers to work with the signs.. Everything is in English except for distance. I'm getting to know how far a meter is...What adventure it was today, we went from Salzburg to Lake Hallstatt, then to Ljubiana, Slovenia. Lets say a trip that would take roughly 6.5 hours total, took 12... I'm too damn tired to write it out, I'll post in the morning, it is currently 11:23pm and I'm pooped.."
August 2015,"Traffic flow = the ""Natural Speed Limit."" Several studies show that if the speed limit on a given highway is 65 and the flow is 80 - 85, that the flow remains virtually unchanged, when the speed limit is raised to 75 or 80 even. The flow of traffic like the ebb and flow (rise and fall) of the stock market really does have a mind of its own. Efforts to enforce (and seriously fine) lane protocols would do far more to increase the safety of many of our highways than ""speed traps"" will ever do.There will be folks who drive at 110MPH when the speed limit is 65 or 80 -- that doesn't change. If the natural speed is 85, the ""NORMAL"" range will be 80 - 90MPH. Go figure.Me, I do pass on the right, but only after sincere and polite attempts to get the Left-Lane-Bandit to move over, I'm crazy, I know, but I do have physical symptoms that arise when I pass on the right -- it seems like breaking a societal covenant restricting and preventing us, mostly, from having ""stupid attacks.""Thankfully, I can't recall someone driving at 30MPH in a 70 zone in the left lane, I would think I would probably use my voice command cell phone to call 911 to report a very dangerous situation, then I would pass on the right and get the hell outta Dodge!"
August 2015,"yeah, I don't get the idea of making it illegal to pass on the right. I would hope, however, if a state has both no pass on right AND stay right pass left laws, a cop is going to pull the left-lane camper over instead of the right-lane passer.I find myself passing on the right many times a day."
August 2015,"I'll give them a chance to move over.. but, I'm not sitting in the fast lane for 5 miles behind someone doing 10 MPH under the traffic flow. At some point, you have to go around. What if they were doing 30 mph?"
August 2015,"I was blessed to be able to spend five weeks in Europe in the summer of 1981; just knocking around with a friend who taught at a French-English school in Deauville. She and I toured Austria, Germany, Italy, and Switzerland. Eight years later a friend of mine and I wrangled some press passes for the Frankfurt Auto Show; we brought our wives with us and spent two ""Press Only"" days in Frankfurt and then rode around Germany for a couple of days. We hope to go back sometime sooner than later. My mom's side of the family came from Diersburg. I'm one of the few people who had relatives who flew in the Luftwaffe as well as the AAC..."
August 2015,"A friend of mine is married to an Ohio State trooper -- he claims that passing on the right is many times more of a contributing factor to crashes than speeding. Bet the speed laws, however, are quite rigorously enforced.Why is that? Are the fines from speeding higher than from passing on the right infractions? Wait, wait, don't answer that, yet: If the speeding fines are, for example, $100, then passing on the right fines ought to be $250 -- you would think once the word got out that such infractions would sharply shrink.I'm one of the people that thinks you should either take laws off the books that are routinely ignored or that the infraction fines should be made proportionate to the potential bodily and property damage that such infraction, if ignored, suggests. And, then, of course, enforce them. So, if my friend's trooper husband is correct, that passing on the right side really is suicide and that speeding, in an of itself is less likely to cause death and destruction, why not ""align the time (i.e., the fine) with the crime"" so to speak? Full disclosure, I have little compunction about driving 85 or 90 in a 70 zone (with assured clear distance), but, as noted, I break out in hives and nausea if I am dragged kicking and screaming into passing on the right due to some moron who certainly must be ignoring my repeated wink, wink, winking left turn signal ""the universal (and polite) signal to please let me pass.""OK, I have one more ? to pose -- I took driver's ed in high school, I took a course to learn to teach driver's ed in college -- why is it we are taught to maintain about 15' per 10MPH assured clear distance between you and the car in front of you (on the highway, not on the crowded stop and go streets of, say, Manhattan) yet, if you were even to attempt to keep 90' between you and the car in front of you on the state highway or Interstate highway at 60MPH, you are assured someone will risk heaven and earth, life and limb to squeeze in between you and the car in front of you and then essentially brake hard, thereby causing a ripple effect of some dozens and dozens of miles on such thoroughfares as the long flat and straight stretch of highway say between Cincinnati and Columbus OH?Has no one even heard of the pop-sci occurrence called The Butterfly Effect?"
August 2015,"we have the stay right, pass left law here in NJ. It is rarely obeyed and almost never enforced. The Pennsylvanians on our roads are almost guaranteed to ignore it, from my experience."
August 2015,"Well, that's one. I guess I'm talking about a ""national and cultural"" mindset that almost literally develops hives or some other nasty rash when contemplating the notion of passing on the right and ignoring a polite three wink left turn-signal.Perhaps a Federal law is closer (and I shudder at saying that) to what I am talking about.Pass the Epsom Salts, please."
August 2015,"It happens everywhere. I see people all the time getting over to the left hand lane although their current lane doesn't have any traffic in it. If they move to the left and are impeding traffic due to their concentration being on their cell phone, I will slowly pass on the right, beep my horn and give the international ""hang up the phone"" sign so they get they are moving too slowly."
August 2015,"If I'm not mistaken, here in Colorado, you can get ticketed for driving in the left lane on the highway if you're not passing. I'm not so sure how much it is enforced, but I do like that the law is at least there."
August 2015,"???Driver of a late model Lexus merges onto I-75 south, immediately moves to the left-most lane, slows to 50 (apparently setting cruise control) and using one free hand, starts holding the phone to his ear -- the conversation apparently goes on for many miles, although I broke protocol after a few miles and committed one of the most vile acts anyone can do behind the wheel . . . I passed on the right after my repeated attempts at turning on my left turn signal were ignored.I'm all for most freedoms -- really. But, you can't yell fire in a theater (unless there really is one) and expect to be covered by the first amendment. I guess, technically, there is no reason you can't hop onto a major federal highway and drive in the left-most lane at 50 MPH (the speed limit here in Ohio has, in many places, now been bumped to 70); I also assume passing on the right side (or suicide) isn't illegal. But, and it pains me to say this, I would vote for laws that would disallow both of these behaviors, were such items placed on a ballot. But, then again, I am also in the minority that votes.We're doomed.Just another reason I can't imagine the frustration of owning/driving an RS7 or M5 or CTS-V, etc, where in wide wide world of sports can such machines be driven using more than a fraction of their engineer-imbued ""talents?"" Not that a Prius is all of a sudden looking good.One more note - I would imagine that driving in Italy would be a free-for-all (and Rome, actually, is). But, other than perhaps a slight decrease in speed, the folks driving on the Italian Autobahn (the autostrada, as I recall), behave pretty much exactly like the Germans -- lane discipline, left lane to pass and the lanes get faster the further left you go, period. Folks respond to a wink of your turn signal to get over and, from what I can tell (other than in Rome) there is no road-rage.Although many of our Interstate road surfaces are pock-marked, I generally think we have a well thought out (mostly) highway system here, that is rendered far less efficient that it could be by either ignorance, stupidity or lack of driver training. Instead, here, we rely, in this order, upon: Enforcement (sort of), Engineering (a somewhat distant second) and Education (a very distant third.) I would think we could drive faster, experience fewer delays, fewer hours lost per person, per year, etc, if we just made getting a driver's license require a bit more rigor. One would think, considering the death-rate, that getting a DL should require no less preparation and education than getting a pilot's license. My wife got her pilot's license before she was old enough to get a driver's license -- and she thinks that getting a DL is about like getting a box-top off of a box of Wheaties.Something is wrong with that.One last note: I love test driving all kinds of cars, despite my completely above-board bias toward Audis, German cars and European cars, generally. I have taken so many folks on test drives these past 5-10 years, I can't remember just how many. Not one (other than my wife) has ever had ABS engaged (that they know of -- although I wonder if they just don't know what ABS braking feels like); and the thing is, when I -- in a large deserted parking lot -- get them to engage ABS, the moment the pedal pulsing starts, they [so they say] instinctively know to release the brake to the point the pulsing stops.I have been through 4-two day Audi Driving Experiences (on ice), 1-two day BMW Driving Experience (not on ice) one Porsche Driving Experience (1-day) and a Cadillac driving experience (also 1-day). Every instructor literally starts the training with the following exercise: accelerate to about 50MPH from a dead stop and when you reach the orange cone laying on its side at the end of the ""runway"" press the brake pedal ""as if"" this is a panic stop. To a man/woman instructor, the command is ""when the pulsing is felt through the pedal, press the brake as hard as your leg can press -- imagine your goal is to BEND THE BRAKE PEDAL.""The reason given for this ""press harder"" instruction is always, ""braking force will continue to increase the harder you press, even with Brake Assist (which bases braking force somewhat on the speed at which the driver presses down)."" I've seen this impact myself on dry, wet and icy pavement.Yet, when I try to get someone who is testing a new car to brake with any degree of urgency, the instant the pulsing is felt, they release the brake -- which, were this a real emergency could increase the probability of a crash.We need to license drivers much, much more rigorously. And, despite this old fashion notion, I think knowing how to drive a manual transmission would be helpful too, much in the same way it is said that video games are helpful prerequisites for so many endeavors.I happen to love my DSG transmission, but in a heartbeat, going back to a six-speed manual wouldn't be anything but fun.We really are doomed!"
August 2015,"FN -- I don't know how everyone else feels, but I want you to know you cannot post too many pictures as far as I'm concerned. I rented a MB in Munich (an E class) -- this was a few years ago -- and it had navigation. The entire thing was in German. Although it offered up arrows and the map, although in German, was easy enough to figure out. I actually got to know the word for left (turn) and for right, so we were able to use the system a great deal of the time. It got a little dicey in town, but when we put in a Hotel (name here) we mostly got close enough for jazz to it.Is your navigation lady German or English speaking?"
August 2015,"I've never had the pleasure of traveling to Europe, so the stories and pictures FN is posting are really welcome.Enjoy the rest of your trip, and keep the updates coming!"
August 2015,"It's a wonderful part of the world -- enjoy. Five of the seven times I've visited Switzerland and/or Austria, the weather was rainy, snowy or otherwise inclement. Be thankful for the wonderful weather you appear to be ejoying, and thanks for the updates."
August 2015,"Regarding drivers who don't use hands free technology in their luxury or near luxury cars (or any car where that technology is available): IMO most of those folks are either too stupid or too lazy to use it. It's the American way to use the quickest, simplest route. I guess there is the arrogance factor to also consider. Some drivers feel that they can drive safely with the phone in one hand, one eye on the phone and the other on the road."
August 2015,"So more adventure with FN, Fussen to Salzburg. The nav system on the BMW can be set to drive only on highways and toll roads or not, so this leg, we didn't want that, we wanted the scenic route, so we entered the address of where we were going to stay (Villa Trapp, you know the Von Trapp Family) and off we went, Rick and I both like the heads up display. About half way there Rick hit the ""mode"" button on the steering wheel and somehow reset our destination back to Ettal. I wasn't paying attention to this, About an hour later I noticed some of the area looks familiar then I noticed what happened on Nav screen. no problem, reprogram the Nav and off we go. The country side is amazing, green as far as you can see, NO trash on the side of the roads, no billboards. On the back roads you get a lot of people on bikes, so you have to watch out for them. Overall Cars, motorcycles and bike get along well. Fast forward arrive at Villa Trapp, looks wonderful outside, inside looked great too, but HOT, we checked in and get to our room, come to find out the room does not have AC, and the room was very hot, and no WiFi past the first floor. I started my Nurse Practitioner program, so I'm in school again so need to be connect. and the bed was a twin, I'm sorry we both wont fit in THAT bed. We go downstairs talk to the lady who checked us in and someone at the Hotel did make a mistake but they are all filled.. We declined got a refunded, I fired up my Sheraton app and booked on points at the Sheraton Salzburg for 12K points a night. When we arrived, the front desk agent told me we had been upgraded to the Presidential Suit, one of the perks for being a 150 night/ yr platinum member. Room is outstanding to say the least.The photos in order, Small town/villeage This was the first GT we have seen on our trip, it's a 318d.In old Salzburg in one of the squares. Up in the fort over looking Slazburg, too this with my iPhone in Panoramic mode.Over looking old salzburg and the River Salzburg.At 1650m at Tageserlaubnisschen on our way to the Eagles Nets. Since this is a car thread what better photo then a Audi R8 and a 66 Mustang Convertible."
August 2015,"So just to chime on what is is saying about mobile phones, when I first got my job with Sony, I bought a Panasonic ""trans mobile"" phone. It was the size of text book, you could either mount it in the car or take it with you. OF course I thought I was cool at the time, that was until I got my first bill... After that I used it strictly for work. Mobile phones where just starting to make their way into cars, this was 1987."
August 2015,"In the mid-1980's, I owned an Audi (what else?) 5000CS turbo quattro, then Audi's top-of-the-line car. Manual transmission, power everything and a new to the market feature (and quite a rare feature on almost any car outside of an Audi, BMW or Mercedes) anti-lock brakes. For some reason I ordered the car with the optional wool covered sports seats, eschewing the standard leather treatments. But that’s not important to my warning and plea to anyone reading this.This mid-80’s Audi had a permanently mounted voice controlled and activated cellular telephone. While driving, if I uttered the phrase “Turn on telephone” I could “Call home,” “Call office,” or recite a phone number – one number at a time, wait for the phone to repeat the number, and so on until the full number had been spoken, then dial. Hands free, eyes free. It was 1985.My first Audi S6, a 1996 model was the next Audi I purchased that came with a factory phone (it was hidden in the arm-rest) permitting voice command. This version was updated and allowed me to recite the phone number in single digits without waiting for the phone to parrot my number back to me.When I then purchased a new 1997 A8, I was somewhat amazed that it came pre-wired for a phone, but without a phone. Of course I ponied up for another voice activated phone. When I got my 2003 allroad it came with a special in-armrest holder for an Audi-branded phone and it also came with On*Star which was also a phone (voice activated) and an email client (that read my emails to me and also allowed me to send emails by speaking). My 2005 A6 was bluetooth equipped and came with a list of phones I could buy from several different providers and also had a special, in-armrest holder/charger that was invisible with the arm-rest cover closed.My 2009 A4, 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD and my 2014 S4 also are equipped with bluetooth and they also have pig-tails for charging and [iPhone] music connectivity. Every one of these cars I mention, since 1985, has had hand and eyes free phone capability and ever improving voice command capabilities.I finally have gotten around to keeping my iPhone in my breast pocket, but for years my iPhone often was in the trunk where I put my brief case. The phone works fine when it is in the trunk – and now, since I do use the phone for email and texting (after pulling over), I tend to keep the phone in the cabin.Every few seconds or minutes someone has a crash or is killed and the “incident” (they are not accidents) causing the property damage or living being damage is attributed to texting or other mobile device distracted driving.The technology exists to disallow talking and texting in a moving vehicle. I assume no challenge would exist to make the phone work if it is being used via bluetooth hand and eyes free initiation. The clock is ticking backwards, to zero, to a time when we will have no ability to use these communication’s devices in a moving car.Here’s what confuses me: Since there had been some kind of hand and eyes free, voice-activated communications available since the mid-1980’s, how is it possible that I cannot drive more than one mile out of my rural subdivision without seeing someone driving their ELLPS (and I’ll keep it to ELLPS cars, even though such technology is hardly limited to the Premium class and above) with their phone held up to their ear (requiring one hand)? As I get closer to the Interstate and traffic density increases, I could probably throw a handful of rice into oncoming traffic and hit more cars than not whose drivers are holding their phones – and I am certain many of the rice grains would hit bluetooth equipped vehicles.Before you respond, here’s another data point, most of the cars have one person in them – the driver.I get my car serviced, I am provided with a loaner – before I pull out of the dealership, I pair my phone with the loaner’s Bluetooth – if I’m distracted, this takes 30 seconds. My wife actually has the service manager pair her phone with the loaner, figuring it’s part of the Audi Advantage (and the service writer always takes the 30 seconds to do this for her without issue).I thought, way back there 30 years ago, “I can completely be focussed on driving this stick-shift turbo-charged ‘hot rod’ quattro thanks to my hands and eyes free cellular phone.” Is this technology not “way cool”? And, is this technology not a HUGE safety feature, right up there with seat belts, crumple zones, ESP and ABS, sealed beam headlights, disc brakes and so on?I do want to be able to call home or the office without touching the phone, without looking at the phone and without pulling over and parking due to the inevitable governmental safety nanny. I want to delay yet another restriction brought on by my fellow drivers who opt for the most dangerous and deadly way I can think of to make a phone call.Of course, maybe we’ll be allowed to used a phone in the car once cars start driving themselves. Mean time, I’d just like to advocate for voluntary cessation of in-car phone usage if it is not hand and eyes free.""Don't it always seem to go . . . that you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?""

August 2015,"Back in the '90s a CCA member I know used ED to get an E34 535i; while in Germany he took it to AC Schnitzer and had the engine's power bumped up considerably. He instructed ACS NOT to add a custom valve cover or any badges, etc. that would give the game away. When the car made it to his dealer the engine had a noticeable lope. The salesman offered to let the Service Department check out the ""misfire,"" but the new owner declined and happily drove away..."
August 2015,@flightnurse really cool pix and story. Interesting option way of getting a new car- the frustrating thing maybe the wait for it to come stateside
August 2015,Which shares a lot of DNA with the new MINIs.
August 2015,"Actually, the new BMW X1 is supposed to be largely based on the Active Tourer FWD platform."
August 2015,"Excellent choice, FN. I wish your son the best of luck with his exceptional choice!"
August 2015,"US MSRP for the car was 53K sale price was 47K We flew into Frankfurt, then onto Munich the flight to Munich was a trip.. I'll post a lot more about this whole adventure."
August 2015,"More photo's are to come and it's been stated it's the Europe only Active Tourer, which was to come to the US but BMWNA said no. VERY Roomy !!! Lots of cool cars over here, one thing I noticed is, MB, BMW and Audi's are de-badged of the model, most if not all of the Euro ED cars had no car identifier on the rear, it's on option for them, but BMWNA does not allow US customers to do that... More photos to come and Video, we are in Salzburg."
August 2015,"Agreed! The car looks great, and the experience seems awesome!"
August 2015,"Yeah, the ED MSRP is 7 percent off base model US MSRP plus destination and options are priced at US MSRP. It makes base models especially great deals, then as you add options, the discount gets smaller. So for example 50k base plus 5k options plus 900 destination it is 52.4k, or 3.5 grand nominal savings. However, you don't get any additional rebates, like those cash credits or rebates that BMW sometimes throws for the US delivery (disclaimers often specifically exclude ED). You can negotiate the price down from the ED MSRP toward their invoice just the same as US delivery (unlike Benz or Volvo, which have the ED prices price fixed), but many dealers would have none of it. Don't know why, perhaps it's just posturing, but I heard of that several times. I think it may be their way of discouraging of doing it, as they always prefer intant gratification of delivery, so the attitude may be, fine, but I'm not doing a damn thing to incentivise the deal vs. my stock. There are also complications with the trade, if you want to make one, as there is about three month from signing the deal and getting the car. Essentially, you lose any leverage on the trade price, unless you are willing to give the car at time of the signing the deal.Bottom line, the actual savings depend on the context of its actual going transaction prices for stock Deliveries. For models selling close to MSRP, like say M-models, the savings are great. For those selling closer to invoice, or having extra cash rebates, it is less. However, factoring the extra vacation experience, even if the savings aren't as big as the face value, it's totally worth it. BTW, you can combine ED with so-called Performance Delivery in South Carolina, which makes the experience even more awesome. Paid night at Sheraton, dinner, breakfast, morning at a track, doing quick loops, braking, skip pad (not your car, just one that's a same or similar similar model; they put me in 335), then a factory visit, plus X5 off-road course after lunch. All at no extra charge. If only have a chance, I will do it again."
August 2015,"My wife and I have been to Europe/Germany perhaps twenty to twenty-five times (some trips, not many, didn't include Germany, that is) -- we always fly into Munich, even if our destination is Venice or Zurich or even Vienna. Of all of the European cities we've been to, Munich is the one where I think I could live AND work. Much as we like Verona and Prague, and even Kraków (and what's not to like about London, Paris and even Brussles), Munich is THE city where I think I could work. The train from Munich to Venice, via Innsbruck is the most beautiful ride we've ever taken -- and OMG in winter, as my friend says, ""If there is winter in heaven, this is what it MUST look like.""But, as usual, I digress. I really do have a, hopefully legitimate, question for you flightnurse: What would have been the American MSRP of your new BMW and what was the difference due to buying the car via ED? The last time I looked into this, it seemed that the price delta paid for the trip -- and then, if you factor in the cost of renting a car, you actually end up paying only for your hotels and food, making the trip to some of the most beautiful sights on the planet about equal to or less than a trip to the US west coast (from Cincinnati). Of course, I would agree, if you're in Germany and/or other European countries, you may splurge on restaurants and (if in Italy) clothes and other items unavailable in the US.To wit: if you two read this and are going to circle back to Munich, our 2nd favorite restaurant on earth is in Munich, it is called Tantris. Tantris, Munich: - http://www.tantris.de/home.php Note the tie in with Audi on the page that is displayed at the link. Bon Appétite! (I had to misspell this to prevent the nanny from suppressing it. . .'cmon now!)"
August 2015,It is a 2 Series Grand Touring- a FWD seven passenger minivan. Meh.
August 2015,Ditto!
August 2015,"Oh, I totally agree on the price argument. I would find it very difficult to spend 6 figures on a car unless I had ridiculous money to blow. But, even then, when I think about a lottery-winning wishlist in a 20-car garage, it just makes far more sense to me that I would have 2 or 3 nice classics or retrorods rather than a $100k new car."
August 2015,"FN, living vicarously with you guys and your European delivery. Car and scenery are beautiful. Keep us up on things and enjoy."
August 2015,"someday, maybe I will be able to do that. another couple of years until college bills are finished. Maybe that will be the treat for us!also, what is the little red one in the background behind your car? Is that a new 1 series, or a little hatch that I would love but will never make it to the US?Wouldn't mind a profile shot of the new car either!"
August 2015,@flightnurse - thanks for sharing your ED experience & photos!  Looks loke a great time in a beautiful country!
August 2015,"My late Father would not have considered any thing from Europe, Japan....anywhere other than U.S. based brands.I think his wants/desires were based on the marketing of his era (40s-50s) when U.S. based car companies ruled the market. Just like GM wanted, you started with a Chevy, went to maybe Oldsmobile, then Buick and finally, Cadillac. Ford started you with their namesake, moved you to Mercury, and finally Lincoln. Chrysler started you at Plymouth, then to Dodge, then to Chrysler, and finally to Imperial (yes, my Father had one...no branded Chrysler but Imperial).Cadillac, Lincoln, Imperial were the pinnacles of automotive excellence during those decades. European, and particularly Japanese brands were viewed with disdain in our household, at the time."

August 2015,"So we picked up Ricks BMW at the Welt, much different experience then when I got my 2005 330 back in 2005. They really treat you like a VIP. We are in southern Germany in a Town called Fussen. We are off to Salzburg for a couple of days. The car looks much better in person then we had thought it would, the Rim's are different then what BMW had showed up, we like these better.The photo is at the spot where most of people on Bimmerfest take thier in front of the Neuschwanstein Castle, Disney also designed Sleeping beauty's castle from.Taking delivery at The Welt"
August 2015,"We took my buddy's Mercedes-AMG E63 to the 1/8 mile strip tonight. My best run was 8.12 seconds- which is the fastest the car has gone. Beat a 1970 Buick GS Stage I with a built 455 running slicks and also dispatched a modified Lexus IS F. It was my first visit to the strip since 1976 and I had a ball. The spectators' initial reaction, ""What's a Mercedes doing at a drag strip?"" changed to ""What kind of motor does he have in that thing?"""
August 2015,"I just got into the Q50 so the Tesla will be a few years off. I think I will take you up on a test drive soon, however. I always wanted to experience the car since it became available. I'll let you know if/when I do."
August 2015,No range anxiety for me.
August 2015,"When are you making the move? I've never had the guts to take a test drive since they seem [still] out of reach.But I'd be interested in your experience from test drive to buy to owning. I'd bet most of us would be interested, too."
August 2015,Tesla for me.
August 2015,"I did look at a Panamera -- and with anything even close to the content of the A8, the price would shoot over $100K.The Audi that I would think much more competitive (in every aspect) with the Panamera is the RS7. This A8L was an ocean-going vessel -- the fact that it felt smaller than its barge like dimensions doesn't make it anything that would be attractive to someone who would look at either an RS7 or Panamera, if you axe me.While I liked the temporary experience, I wouldn't even consider one, personally. I wonder if the S8 might be more of a Panamera cross-shopper. Don't know . . . and not all that interested in making a comparison, at this point, life's too short. A half step between an A4 and A6 is about the size I find interesting today.About $58K for my S4 and about $65K for my wife's SQ5 -- what's that come to?"" $123K -- for TWO cars. Something just seems ""off"" about spending that much on ONE car -- but I could be wrong. There comes a point where I read about the $85K Cadillac V or M3 and their accelerations to 62MPH are in the neighborhood of 4 seconds. I then go back in time and find the same magazine's numbers for my ""lowly"" S4 to be 4.8 seconds (some magazines claim even quicker). I'll keep the $27K for other things and make certain never to challenge an M3 to a drag race at the local traffic light. I'm all for big bad acceleration, etc, but all that money for such a relatively small increase in acceleration is something that I find very difficult to justify, especially since it is so rare I can ever floor my non-tumescent S4 for fear of overtaking and rear ending just about everything else on the road."
August 2015,"$86k? Eh, I'd be looking at a Panamera or Tesla, methinks"
August 2015,"I've Got Friends in ""High"" PlacesOK, time for the 45,000 mile service on the '14 SQ5. Dropping the car off the night before, picking up a courtesy car for the day and coming back 24 hours later . . . routine.""I'm sorry, I don't have any SQ5 loaners . . . but I've got this freshly PDR'd car that has 35 miles on it you can have, if you don't mind. It's an A8L. I also have a new A7, but I thought you might like to be the very first customer to drive the A8.""Actually, I had hoped for an A6 -- considering some of our recent ""chats"" here on edmunds. But, it is so very unlikely we'd ever willingly, knowingly and with our own money go for another A8 (not that we didn't like our previous one), well, why not.I am a lover and geek on all things Audi, but frankly I just don't spend any time keeping up with the A8 or R8 cars, I needed an edumacation . . . .This was the L version -- the back seat space is larger than some closets or storage sheds, if the thing wasn't so quiet at speed, you'd need an intercom to speak to the pilot were you seated back there,Otherwise, we set the drive select to dynamic (the rep looked at my wife who set this parameter after starting the car, and said ""go figure"" -- my wife is used to an SQ5, after all) and turned on the heads-up display, found some nice tuneage on the sat radio and drove off in eerie silence arriving a triple digits speeds in the blink of an eye. Yikes this thing must be electric it is so quiet and smoooth (and this one had the air suspension, which I suspect is standard and the 20"" wheels with summer only rubber.)Full LED front and rear lighting -- and everything that could be motorized was -- and oh that fantastic, should be mandated by the Feds, Top View monitor (how I miss that one aspect of our 2011 Infiniti).I finally got the sticker out of the glove box and noted this puppy was a V6 (333HP) -- my S4's V6. Impressive in this size car as it never seemed to want for any bit of power -- there was always plenty on reserve.Air conditioned seats -- ahhhhh cooling those hot crossed buns -- I had forgotten how nice cool leather can feel, even on a hot summer day.Here's the real deal, however -- while the car is, even were it free -- too large, it feels not much larger than my S4. Also, I cannot tell a lie, it is not as nimble as an S4, and certainly not as powerful as you would expect with the extra girth the motor had to manage, but it seemed quite capable of convincing perhaps the vast majority of folks that it was a sporting-like sedan, not just a luxo-barge. The top view camera made navigating a tight parking garage this morning easy-peazy. If you have $92,000 (but this one had a nearly $6,000 Executive package credit, wiping out the Executive package price) laying around burning a hole wanting to be spent on a new luxury but still very much a driver's car vehicle, say no more, look no further. I can't imagine my neighbor's 7 series (also an L) which, by comparison, seems so stark and strident inside -- and which cost over $110K could be more attractive, price weighted.I don't know how the 2016 A8L 3.0T is thought of by the pros, but this amateur thinks for $86,000 nothing even comes close -- in this class (large luxo-barge).Of course, had I that much coin to drop on ONE car, I would still ""settle"" on a full-on great balls of fire S6 Prestige with the custom red leather seats.Now that would be something to write home about.Me, I'm looking forward to a slightly larger 2018 S4 with all the cool tech this 2016 A8 has on it.I wonder if they ever provide RS7's as loaners -- I'd bet not."
August 2015,"This morning a friend called and asked me to take his latest toy for a drive; said toy is a 2007 Mercedes-AMG E63 fitted with the Weistec M156 Power Package 1, meaning it makes 441 hp and 394lb-ft of torque measured at the wheels. He's a bit intimidated by the car and wanted me to wring it out. Now THIS is a car I can truly call fast with a straight face. Stock it would do 0-60 in 4.2 seconds and run the quarter in 12.6 seconds @115 mph. My friend also likes drag racing and he wants me to run it at the local 1/8-mile strip. He's had the car down in the low eight second range but I think the high sevens are entirely possible. Of course, I had to take it down my personal road course test track and the car was pretty much unflappable(the car sports Michelin PSS rubber). I had forgotten how much fun the AMGs of this vintage could be. Oh yeah, it will also do a fairly impressive burnout..."
August 2015,"So, we arrived in Munich today, was picked up at the Airport in a BMW 750Ld, nice car, great engine, Tri Turbo inline 6 diesel. it makes something like 450lbs of torque. was interesting to watch the drive navigate the highway. We topped 150mph, I've read about about this car, was great to be driven in it. Friday we take delivery of Ricks BMW. This whole discussion been interesting, GM needed to make room for the ATS, that meant the CTS needed to be price higher then before, GM needed to take a couple of play from the likes of Lexus and Hyundai more content at a lower price, then slowly raise prices I don't think the CTS was moving up the price trail as it was being improved. Now, I have two neighbors who have CTS, both are V6, both have been stone reliable, one is a 2012, then other is a 2013. I remember when the ATS cane out and a couple of people where praising the car, Myself and a couple of others pointed out the biggest issue with the CTS and ATS was simple, their size, they are too small in the segment they are in. Granted some people like that, but the buying public does not and want the size. When GM gets around to increase the size of both cars, the next generation of the 3 and 5 series will be out and be bigger and better. Once again, GM is playing catch up."
August 2015,"Mark's comment about GM's quality going to hell in the 70's and 80's and paying a price for that is well taken. During that time I was starting a career and family and money was tight. All I could afford was Chevys and I was satisfied, until my '79 Chevette. It broke down 12 miles from the dealer's showroom the day I picked it up and had to be towed back. That was just the beginning of the problems. I traded it for a Mazda GLC several months later and have owned nothing but Japanese cars since, with 2 reliable Fords in the mix. I now have a Volvo S60, as I mentioned in a prior post and an Outback, my 3rd Subaru.I wish GM well and would love to be in an ATS or CTS, but I just feel I can get a better car for less money elsewhere. And the crappy dealer experience others have talked about also gives me pause."
August 2015,"With newer magnetic ride control suspension systems, it seems logical that the ""sport"" suspension will be more ""automatic"" along with the softer settings when you want the smoother ride. Just like what happened in the transmission arena."
August 2015,"Apparently they are not interested in ""driving dynamics"" as much as they used to be -- on the other hand, we'd be hard pressed these days to find virtually any up and coming ""customer"" to even consider a manual transmission; sport suspensions, too, seem to be largely in the rearview mirror -- I remember when MOST of the cars in stock had sport suspensions, sport seats and at the same time a good many of the cars in stock were manual shift models, replete with Premium pack, power assists, and other options of the day.Now, the few sticks offered are strippies (often) and for the most part, the cars are -- as noted -- getting squishy, less taught, with less of the performance edge. Although, oddly, HP and torque do continue to climb.You gives and you gets (sort of).The Infiniti sales rep remarked ""I don't know why anyone would want paddle shifters."" What's up with that?"
August 2015,"effectively BMW is aging with their fanbase. Caddy had a head start, and once they ""age out"" you are kind of stuck. At least BMW is still bringing in younger buyers at the bottom end, even if they are a different type than they used to have!"
August 2015,"I think its simply a matter of age. You gotta reach far back to find most of the Cadillac fans, like my dad and father-in-law, and they aren't buying cars in that pricerange in their golden years. Those same people would NEVER consider a BMW. The BMW faithful, on the other hand, largely have a car history that dates back to the E30-E36 era, and those cars cemented their fandom. Cadillac is now chasing a younger crowd who never previously gave them a 2nd look, while BMW is slowly alienating its fans with softer cars. How will that all pan out? We'll see."
August 2015,"I do think in the past, that there was a loyalty to a brand or car company that isn't as strong today. I know my dad was more of a GM man than Ford man and he had a disdain for Chrysler yet his first car was a Plymouth and he told me it served him well. Dad wasn't that keen on Chevys, but he was ok with Pontiac, Olds, or Cadillac. For some reason Buick didn't have any appeal to him. Though there has been the odd Toyota, Datsun, Subaru that have been bought as secondary cars and cars for my sisters to drive for college (early 80's), my parents until retiring their 98 Aurora, have stayed the course with GM products. They currently have a CR-V."
August 2015,"I maintain it all starts at the network size - too big to control and maintain consistency, especially for premium brand. It simply doesn't fit their current volumes, looks like by favtor of three. Also, it seems it's not just those bad dealers, it's GM's relationship with them that appears to be dowright toxic."
August 2015,"Whatever Happened to . . . .I mentioned as part of one of my rants/posts that when I grew up in rural Ohio in the 60's, there were Chevy ""guys"" and Ford ""guys"" and even some Chryco (aka mopar) ""guys."" The passion of the Chevy folks was the relentless kidding of the Fix Or Repair Daily crowd and of course the other way around (General Mess of Crap, as I recall). The Buick car company had seriously powerful cars -- my buddy drove a Buick Special to high school every day (and this was a full-sized V8 packin' hot rod -- don't let's it mass confuse you, you face off with the Special, you see tail lights.) Of course there were Goats and Stangs and my favorite (Beep Beep) Plymouth road runners that, in a straight line, were scary good and ready to smoke the rear tires, or actually SHRED the rear tires.My cousin had an Impala SS (a two-door affair with a HUGE butt but also gobs of tire smokin' power) with a rear deck speaker WITH REVERB! Whew, I'm all verklempt.The faithful high schoolers became faithful, loyal customers of their chosen brands -- my parents first had Hudson Hornets, then, with the demise of Twin H power (dual carbs), dad moved to Plymouth, then Chrysler -- I recall when I was in college he got a Cordoba, with fine Corinthian leather and the fake leather half roof.The point is, my uncles were loyal to their brands -- my Augusta, GA uncle always had Pontiacs, his two brothers, one of them my dad had Chryco cars -- my uncle had a Plymouth Sport Fury, Plymouth's answer to the Chevy Impala Super Sport. I mean these folks, then, wouldn't be budged from the brand.What the heck happened? Now, before I go into the weeds too deeply, I must say my friends are mostly loyal to a brand. My BMW driving friends will probably never stray. My buddy who drives Acuras, just won't even bother shopping elsewhere.So what happened -- one would think there would have been at least some vestige of brand loyalty and that ought to translate to Cadillac as well. Apparently not.What I have found is ""American"" car dealers didn't get the memo that must've come out at the end of the 70's or the early 80's. I simply, personally, can't imagine putting up with the crap these hold over dealers ""Fast Eddy's"" or ""Juicy Lucy's"" and their ilk deal.Is it a matter of the dealerships? Is it a matter of . . . what? You'd think if you were a dealer facing a declining market, that you would ""go undercover"" and see how the most successful dealerships treat their ""clients"" and flat out imitate that behavior.Sure, you may have to kiss a lot of frogs, but eventually you're going to learn what the attraction is -- at least at the Premium and Lux brands -- a Cadillac dealer with even one Fast Eddy or Juicy Lucy on the payroll isn't going to cut it.Of course, this doesn't wipe out all of the sins of an iffy product, but maybe it would help.Man, if I were Audi's former, now Cadillac's top US Exec, I would be calling in every favor I could to, as Young Frankenstein once said ""Get me the hell outta here -- don't you recognize a joke?"""
August 2015,"Having only one well selling model makes Cadillac very vulnerable. Think Acura - without MDX it's basically non-factor. The cars may be good quality and even better value, but nobody cares. RDX had a jolt recently, but I can't tell if it's sustained. TLX, CLX and especially RLX are not selling, the last one will be a rare classic in ten years  ."
August 2015,"Maybe Gm needs to only sell GM branded cars- Gm corvette, Gm escallade ..etc. get rid of the massive dealership network and duplicate cars like Chevy small suv and Buick small SUVs. If they need to keep caddy / Buick name call the cars Gm Chevy impala or something. Massive overhead continues to kill companies. Now I understand and have read in the news that major companies ""reorganize"" at certain times like today's http://www.thestreet.com/story/13263357/1/microsoft-msft-stock-dropping-on-site-closure-job-cuts.htmlLooking below I'm scared for us companies"
August 2015,"My put is that any car made by any manufacturer these days that survives infant mortality (doesn't need the dealer to mess with it inside of the first year or 10K miles) will run well and true for 100K miles or much more.If, on the other hand, your new gem needs to have the ham-handed dealer ""technicians"" bless it with their skills, you are well and truly screwed. It's a crap shoot. Hopefully you get a good one. Maybe you don't. The odds are better with some brands than others.I've driven several vehicles for well over 100K miles and have accumulated over 1.4 million miles overall. As in going to hospital, the way to success is to keep out of the shop. Most of mine have benefitted from the manufacturer's quality system, not the dealer's. YMMVSometimes that's not possible.Yes, I know, those of you who lease and/or change cars before the tires wear out are in a different cohort. Party on."

August 2015,No more Hummer! A certain clientele need BIG.
August 2015,Popularity of the escalade has always been a mystery to me.
August 2015,"Spot on.
Audi can claim one big victory in 2014: it outsold Cadillac. Life has been difficult for Cadillac lately as it struggles to make the leap from premium – expensive cars – to the luxury category – cars whose valuable brand command an extra margin. Cadillac raised prices last year in an effort to look more exclusive, then was forced to bet a hasty retreat when customers stayed away. At the end of January, a Reuters analysis revealed that Cadillac was sitting on a four-month supply of unsold CTS sedans and six months worth of ATS sedans. Strangely, while its newer passenger cars languish, Cadillac can’t keep up with demand for the old-style Escalade SUV, some highly optioned versions of which, Reuters discovered, can carry prices in excess of $100,000."
August 2015,"Agreed. Outside of Escalade, Cadillac is in a bind very hard to solve."
August 2015,"dino001:Let's stipulate that your observations are accurate. We then need to say that we can't un-ring the bell. As a practical matter, while your comments would still be accurate they would probably not be made or even too much cared about if what emerged was a ""great"" car from a great car company (isolating Cadillac here).I went to a friend's birthday party over the weekend -- of course after the dinner, some of the typical male/female behavior emerged with the two genders gathered in two groups catching up and being social. One of the well-wishers apparently was well off enough to have had several Ferrari's and he was remarking how he had never had any car have a $10,000 bill for what he would classify as routine mntce (a new clutch for a manual transmission Ferrari). His beloved Italian had just cost him this much -- ouch!The conversation about cars was ""on."" In the parking-lot population of a couple of dozen premium cars (from Europe and Asia) there was a lone Cadillac CTS coupe. We all agreed the car was handsome -- the owner added his own comments suggesting that he agreed the car was beautiful to behold but that it had been a lot of trouble and that his [few] Cadillac owning friends had not one satisfied member amongst them. I'm not sure what all of the ""big"" problems were, but problems seemed to plague just about every system a car has, according to him. The birthday boy (age 60) has a Mercedes V8 coupe (the $125,000 version whatever/whenever that is) and a Sonota with 120K miles on it. He wants a Porsche -- don't know what one -- but he says he can't beat the Sonota for its 100% reliability (and, at 120K miles, I would expect he would add durability, too), so he drives it to the office and saves the Merc for weekends. He also has one of those giant Yukon XL SUV's and a couple of Harley's.Were I a Cadillac employee or affiliated in any way with Cadillac, this would have been a cringe-worthy event, with folks saying mostly positive things about everything but Cadillac's cars; and the things being said about Cadillac were enough to make someone in the market, draw a line through the brand altogether -- with the possible exception of the Escalade.One couple drove their new Mercedes GLA crossover -- which I was able to see up close and personal, interior included. Very nice looking car -- especially from the outside. Interior fit and finish seemed nice, but man the thing was really small inside -- smaller, I think, than an Audi Q3. I don't know how much actual utility it had, how many groceries it could carry, but I do think it is one of Mercedes best looking products in years.My take away from the whole evening -- pertaining to cars -- was that Cadillac is not in a particularly good place right now with respect to what ""the people"" (the market) are saying. Here [Edmund's] we've got folks saying ""are you kidding"" with respect to the price vs the competition and you have the bourgeoisie saying the cars are, well, pretty much crap with respect to reliability.Best of both worlds?! Yikes."
August 2015,The only decision I can make is with my wallet and my vote. My wallet will not vote for GM or a separated Cadillac.
August 2015,"I think the ""old GM"" is in the comeback exactly because that bankruptcy was tainted by politics. Law blatantly disregarded - for those who don't know, stakeholder's payoff order was changed in favor White House political backers (i.e. unions) rather than those who (by law) deserve it most (senior bondholders with secured notes). This basically taught them wrong lesson. In essence, the process was not painful enough. Bankruptcy is supposed to be painful, as it wipes out those with weak interest (like shareholders, employees) and damages those with stronger interest (debt holders, government). It's an exchange - bondholders stop the imminent execution of the debt and in exchange they receive equity in reorganized company. All of that is overseen by a judge in a process that usually starts as adversarial and ends as cooperative. The plan for the reorganized company needs to be approved by a judge, but the bondholders have ample opportunity to give their input and voice their concerns. NONE OF THAT HAPPENED!!! Government came, wiped out those they deemed ""unworthy"" (and used media to vilify them in the process), gave rewards to those who were ""worthy"" (read supported their political cause) and then bullied judicial system to approve the tainted deal. A true disappointment was that the judges did not find enough courage to stop it. I can only guess why. In this climate, how anybody can make real decisions? Those that can be even more difficult and more painful? There is no way. They changed a few things on the surface, a few more a bit deeper, but then everybody moved on, so the old habits can come back."
August 2015,"I've thought about this a lot. Not necessarily the union aspect, as they're a shell of their former self, and wield a lot less power.Agree Sween. Investors want their investment to grow. That's it. That's all they want.What bothers me, GM had a clean slate. Debt wiped out. Had an excuse to wipe out whole brands and dealers with little in the way of repurcussions (Oldsmobile, Hummer, Pontiac, etc). They could have become a great company, ONCE AGAIN! They had the opportunity to become good at whatever they chose. At least in Cadillac's case, they went right back to the same old GM with indifferent quality, buggy technology, subpar customer support, etc.I rent a lot of cars. I've rented a lot of Chevy Cruz's. On the surface, it's a pretty competitive car. You drive it for a few days and understand one thing.....""were the designers and engineers hamstrung by the accontants, again?"". I know a lot of times, even with my CTS, I ask myself...""did the builders, designers, engineers really think this through?"" The answer is usually ""NO""! It's like they got part of the way there, and just ran out of time, or ran out of money, or just stopped before what they were doing was fully baked.circle...you're right. They have become a truck company. Nothing wrong with that. Stick with what you do best. But, to keep trying to convince everyone else they are still a car company...well, that's proved a whole lot more difficult."
August 2015,"Probably the reason GM started offshore production in the first place. As soon as I hear ""union negotiations"", I think of the broken model that they had a chance to fix at bankruptcy but failed and claimed such a success....just kicking the can down the road.See: Buick and Caddy sales. GM remains a truck company."
August 2015,"""good lease deals is certainly a good idea."" Great idea - one problem residual - they can't Don't blame Wall Street for gM problems - TM, HMC and others trade on the big board. I would blame the unions over investors any day."
August 2015,"You're looking at the content. I'm looking at the brand equity. Cadillac simply doesn't have it. There are only two ways to build it:a. Killer product, killer service/experience, high price, low volume, niche product, build it up from there; translation - crash in sales, close 75 percent of dealerships, consolidate production, long and painful process, but can be successful, if executed properly. You make lots of money on every unit sold, but don't expect to be on the best seller list. but Call it ""Jaguar option""b. Killer product, killer service/experience, undercut price - low profits, build brand equity, then start slowly raising it. GM has neither. Requires deep pockets, lots of patience. Call it ""Lexus option"". Patience has never been a virtue of American corporations (especially those publicly traded on Wall Street). Add of course additional issues with memories of bailout, it probably doesn't have the money, either.So Cadillac chose option c: pretend you can get higher prices on somewhat (arguably a lot) improved product without changing any other aspect of your business."
August 2015,they already include maintenance. good lease deals is certainly a good idea.
August 2015,"How about NOT lowering the actual sticker price but figuring out a way to get a bunch of the cars out there via the traditional sub-venting of leases. I would think if you get enough cars out there AND they are indeed a good and reliable (they can work on durable later) product, well economics 101 -- demand will go up as price drops (IF the reliability is there). Include all maintenance, of course and improve the dealership experience to Premium Car (European and Japanese) expectations.Then, assuming all of the above (especially the goodness of the product) comes to pass, THEN allow the sub-venting to erode. As the post above says -- this will be about a 10 year exercise.I must say, after watching Audi and UNINTENDED acceleration etc, 10 years would be a bargain, if Cadillac could pull it off in that period of time.At some point in time, however, the product/brand differentiation has to shift from low price to a specific brand identity based on ""something you're known for"" or perhaps several somethings that you're known for.I know of no one that is a animated and passionate about any Cadillac in the same way many Audi and BMW ""fans"" have passion. When I grew up in the 60's, you had your Chevy folks and your Ford folks -- and you had some (but a lower number than in the Chevy and Ford camps) who were, hmm, ""MoPar"" folks (beep beep). I've been to Audi and BMW factory sponsored driving schools -- and the faithful who attend are meat eaters, red -- as in barely cooked -- meat eaters.Checking out AudiWorld.com for instance you'll find a lot of passion I would assume other brands know just can't be bought. From my perspective, only BMW and Audi have both the breadth and depth of passionate fans -- Cadillac? Well, not so much.We need Cadillac to not just survive, we need them to grow and prosper."
August 2015,"Think about that for a second, though ... there is a reason why Acura/Volvo is cheaper than Benz/BMW [and I'll add Lexus], and its not just because they choose to be. I'll give you a hint: it is also why the Lexus ES V6 is cheaper than the IS V6. I'm not saying you are wrong, necessarily. Just that there are, effectively, 2 classes of luxo cars (IMHO), and Caddy fits in the typically more expensive of those. However, they might find themselves better off cutting prices across the board, let's say $5k, rather than discounting the damned things $10k after they've been sitting around all year. They are already slightly cheaper than the Germans, just not enough, apparently."
August 2015,"That's essentially a full overhaul. Add a name change for a good measure. I truly believe they should try do ""a Lexus"", but I doubt they will. I think they are simply unable to change, first because they think they don't need to (if they did, they'd never put those crazy CTS prices and also priced ATS more in line with Acura/Volvo products, not Benz/BMW). Second, even if they saw a need for change, they are locked into the dealership network that is three times as large as it should be, considering current sales volumes. I'm sure those franchise contracts don't let them walk away at will, there are steep penalties, plus political fallout (imagine those tearful articles of lost jobs in a small town Cadillac dealer). In essence, what they need to do, they can't and they won't. It's just going to be slow dying, probably very slow (they still sell good deal of Escalades), interrupted by some pretend moves and couple of short resurgences (once in a while they'll have a good month, or quarter), which will only postpone it. As before, a belief in a new ad campaign fixing all their ills will be magical."
August 2015,"Jeez, I've wanted a Caddy since I was 16. I got my Medicare card this year, so I doubt it's going to happen. I almost bought a CTS way back in 2005 when they were offering employee discount prices. But the CTS was RWD only back in those days and we live in the snow belt. I looked at an ATS in 2013, but priced with the options I wanted it was out of reach. I ""settled"" on a Volvo S60. Great car and very good dealer experience."
August 2015,"Q...your car is indeed quite nice, regardless of the parameter you're using as a measuring stick....performance, materials, etc.What drew me to the CTS were the steep discounts, too.....along with the fact that I thought the CTS drove better than a 5 Series, and certainly looked better. Have they priced themselves out of the market? I don't know.But, at this price range (or any price range, for that matter), people expect a level of service that reflects the price and status of the car. That's where Cadillac really falls down. They may have put a nice product out there, but they can not pretend like customer service is an after thought (as they have with mine, which has spent it's 30th day in the dealer's shop as of today). Further, either they can't, or won't fix it. I think it's a combination of the two. They are trained to read a computer read out of a fix, and that's it. If it doesn't show a code, they view it as ""operating as normal"".BMW, Jag, Lexus, Mercedes, Acura, Infiniti, etc operate on a level several levels above that type of service.I love your car, I really do. My Cadillac ownership experiences have been a nightmare, though.Those experiences, along with pricing, are what's caused volumes to drop dramatically. They have to fix both simultaneously, and quickly, if they want to survive."
August 2015,"But then there is their cost structure. How low is low and can GM make money? I would bet Toyota didn't make much, if anything in first ten years of Lexus. That's why I'm not not optimistic about them, at all."
August 2015,"Exactly. Now that they are serious, they need to come in under the competition from the start. When I walk up to a window sicker today, I walk away shaking my head. I don't want an anchor price that is in BMW/Merecdes range staring me out from the window of a Caddy. Not gonna happen!They can spend the money languishing in inventory or price 'em right to get 'em on the roads."
August 2015,I have to admit that I probably would never have even looked at the Caddy had it not been for the DEEP discounts they were offering at the time. So y'all are probably right that they should cut their prices to re-establish themselves. I just worry that they would take that as a reason to skimp on the car. This is a seriously nice piece of machinery with an impressive interior. It needs to remain that way.
August 2015,"I don't have a problem with the caddy keeping its name - problem is they kept its ways . No way an ATS and cts should be priced anywhere near its German comp ( not now). When people talk about what kind of deal they got on said caddy - nice job but car should be lower just given track record and current sales trends, given the time of year you can get 10% off a 3 series. Lexus did it right- time to start over again caddy. Would also add to the union stuff above - cannot believe the leader ship will let a potential collapse happen again in less then 10 years. Let's hope they are amarter."
August 2015,"Ah, the UAW. Now I understand. I spent several years researching the history of the U.S. steel industry over the decades after 1970. Interesting stuff.Moving to right-to-work states is a start, but so long as Michigan remains a factor in automobile manufacturing, there will be thousands of dollars on top of every car produced to cover the pensions and other UAW overhead.Detroit is a monument to the union movement and corrupt politicians (yeah, I know, it's redundant)."
August 2015,"I thought the same thing---Cadillac should have had a new name 10 years ago, e.g. Toyota/Lexus. The Lexus name became gold-plated in about ten years time."
August 2015,"They probably should change the name, too. While there is some brand equity left for older folks, I suspect people under 40 could not care less. They need to rebuild, but their problem they don't seem to get it."
August 2015,It's posturing for the upcoming negotiations with the UAW.
August 2015,"ATS was supposed to overwhelm the 3 series. Not for the performance, but the price killed Caddy.Same old GM....separated or not, the virus continues.Someone posted how Lexus was successful and then raised prices in line after gaining notoriety. Caddy should pull a Lexus/Korea Twin pricing strategy but they will not. Instead, boldly following Buick!Pretty soon, the commercials will say ""That's not a Caddy!"""
August 2015,"Well, GM is considering importing Buicks from China but for 2 models. Really, Buick is dead being mfg in the USA."
August 2015,"@qbrozen after doing somesurfing I now I understand the sport v is a 550 comp for sure. I love the caddy looks a lot- amazing they don't have a better following and its caddy own fault for that given its price. With the 2 new products with the ATS and cts these sales numbers should be cause for concern to any one who likes caddy as if this trend continues could they join Oldsmobile.

August 2015,"Tire UpdateI have a couple thousand miles on my Continental DWS 06 UHP A/S tires. While very good from mile one and better after mile 150, now at a couple grand miles on the road, I can offer this:These tires are really UHP tires, they do not, from my perspective here in SW Ohio, need to apologize or explain why they are a compromise shoe. I can think of no attribute of this tire that makes me long for a MAX Perf (summer only) tire instead. I do not track my car. I do not take my car off normal highways, roads and streets. I generally enjoy taking corners and curves as aggressively as possible (given traffic and other safety considerations, of course). When conditions and traffic (and the long arm of the law) permits, I have been known to exceed 100MPH (usually on Interstates where traffic is thin and widely spaced).I like a tire to be quiet. I do not want ANY tread noise. Not gonna tolerate it.The handling, braking, ""quietness"", comfort and anything you can think of that describes performance of these tires is (are) exemplary. While not cheap, the tires will not require you to take out a second mortgage, and they should last some 40,000+ miles and still remind you they are (mostly) still UHP tires.Unless you have no need for cold weather or ""light-snow"" traction, these tires should be given a good look-see and test drive (if possible). I don't want to make this too dramatic, but I cannot think of any tire that I have ever had that exceeds the performance of the DWS 06 Continental Extremes.I sourced these from Tire Rack; and after they were mounted and road force balanced my S4 was given a 4-wheel alignment.A+"
August 2015,"@markcincinnati - I don't disagree that a little more rear legroom would be nice than what's currently offered in the 3/4 series and the A4/5, but not so sure how much room there is to slot another model between those and the 5-series and A6. The 3-series GT sort of offers what you speak of, with loads of rear seat legroom on that longer 3-series platform. Whether you like the looks of the vehicle is a different matter. I'm sure the new A4 next year will offer some sort of increase in size - maybe that will be a sweetspot for you. I am finding myself quite fond of the size of the current S4 - from a driving perspective, I liken it to the 335 (E90) I had a little while ago, and compared to that, the Audi adds just enough extra room to make it feel a little less ""compact."""
August 2015,"M5 compares to CTS-V550 compares to the V sport535 compares to the non-turbo CTS 3.6528 compares to the CTS 2.0TThe 550 has a little more peak power, but it is 300 lbs heavier, which is why the vsport outperforms it."
August 2015,@qbrozen I would agree the BMW and v sport are close one is a BMW with a beefie 8 vs a caddy 6-and one with more powerful engine .  bigger thing is one is German lux vs American who is trying to find a younger audience for your grandpas caddy. While they are close the 535 is a better comp.
August 2015,"TweenerI don't know about you, but I do wish there was SOMETHING in between an A4 and and A6 or a 3 series and a 5 series. No, no, an A5 or 4 series won't do. The reason I want something that is really in-between is I just want something a little bit bigger (and this is a contradiction -- I know -- I've flip flopped on this more than twice).I was loaned an A6 3.0T with a sport package. I liked it -- but, even with the sport package it didn't seem to be quite as nimble as I had mis-remembered it would be. Then today, 4 of us from my office went to lunch together -- well the two folks in the back seat of the S4 were ""this close"" to having enough knee room -- another inch back seat space would have been fine -- two inches ample.I keep holding out hope that the new A4/S4 coming out next year will grow slightly in all directions -- but meantime, the gap between the A4 and A6 is large enough, I think, for there to be something that would fit in between; maybe an A5, gulp, sedan? Or a junior A7.BTW, drove an S6 again -- love the power, love everything about it, except it is too big (well it would be most of the time) and it gives off so very few ""S"" cues from behind the wheel, it is somewhat disappointing. It performs great -- has gobs of go and stopping power, and it does have an ""S"" suspension from a capability perspective -- but the car is a cocoon. Usually a good thing, but when you pay that much, it would be nice if it had a bit of GRRR to be found. :@ I'm still lookin' for the tweener . . . plain and simple."
August 2015,"Could it be that the 550 has had major engine trouble with a fix costing close to 15K, lucky BMW is picking up the tab this... I thought about a 550, but once I read the problems and issues I wont be buying one."
August 2015,"Agree completely. It is too soon to charge that much. And, seems to me there are just too many stories like the following:Another long-time BMW owner neighbor, had ONE bad experience with his BMW -- the bun warmers caught on fire. Yeah, I know that is a big ""bad"" experience. So, he gets a new CTS. It has been, no lie, at the dealership more than in his driveway.The thing is, the loaner -- for a time -- was an ATS. He finally said he wanted like-for-like and he now, at least, is driving a loaner CTS. Funny, he has had the loaner so long he washes it and takes IT IN FOR SERVICE.Odds are he'll be back with another BMW as soon as possible (unless I can convince him to at least TEST DRIVE an A6 3.0T Prestige w/sport pkg!)I'm working on it."
August 2015,A BMW 550i with roughly the equipment in a vsport premium is about $75k and trading for $51k at the auction. So it is pretty much on par for the midsize luxo market.

August 2015,"2014 ATS V6 Premiums grab around $32k at auction. So figure somewhere in the mid $36k range retail. The 4-cyl Luxury models, however, are in the mid 20s, so high 20s is possible if you don't want a ""jacked out"" version and can deal with the base non-turbo engine.V sport Premiums are in the mid 40s still, which means high 40s retail. Knock off about $5k for a non-premium model."
August 2015,As an s4 owner I would like to chime in with the subi comments. iMO For the money not a better awd system to buy is a subi with the boxer engine. Someone mentioned cost to own made a valid point the cars are in high demand on the used car market and some used car dealers are having issues getting cars from auctions because even high mileage leased cars are going back on manufactures lots because resale is so strong and they are not producing new ones fast enuf - don't believe me?? https://www.cars.com/articles/junes-fastest--and-slowest-selling-cars-1420680685995/Has anyone watched a full season of baseball...? 162 games .. Same amount of time it takes a caddy dealer to sell ONE ATS car. Wow - no wonder people getting deals on those and other caddy sedans... Wonder after One year and a few Miles prob could get a jacked out ATS in the 20's and a cts v sport in high 30's .. Could that be possible? My take subi a great car for money for sure but it's not an Audi - open the door of a wrx vs an a4 - then close them- huge difference.... Money always matters but not same class
August 2015,"Saw some blurbs on the CTS-V. C&D was gushing all over it, stating BMW M5 has been knocked off its perch.....stating...""A very scary sedan, but only if you happen to be employed by Mercedes-AMG, BMW’s M division, or Audi’s Quattro GmbH."""
August 2015,"The ""V"" would be more in line with that price range, for sure...not an under 300 HP motor. The one I saw was the Performance, loaded, but I'd bet you could not get that particular car for the low $40K range.. low $50's, ok.Still not worth it AFAIC."
August 2015,I thought your disaster CTS was the old model.
August 2015,"that'd be me, and at just a couple grand more MSRP than the $58k 2.0T Performance you mention, circleW, the V sport makes infinitely more sense to me."
August 2015,"Own one. The purchase price came in well below the MSRP you saw (at the time, in the neighborhood of low $40s). Personally, I think it's one of the best looking cars in the segment. And, that little turbo motor is a gem....comparable to the one in the BMW 528i or Audi A6 2.0 (actually, feels better than both).That's where the ""goodness"" starts and ends, unfortunately. It's been a service and reliability nightmare. It's back in the service bay now, going on two weeks. That's on top of another two week stint in service a couple of months ago.To be fair, there's another Edmunds poster here that has the CTS V-Sport (twin turbo V6), which has been flawless for him."
August 2015,"Checked out a new CTS 4cylt T Performance = $58,000 sticker. 272hp/295lb.-ft.Interesting the options listed had no price. Last car I'd consider at that price."
August 2015,"At this point, as I said, most of us are unable to notice the subtleties between most AWD systems, regardless of MSRP. I do not count myself among those who are able to discern the difference; between many AWD systems -- unless they are of the FWD power biased flavor (my TL SH-AWD was FWD biased and it did seem to have gobs of torque steer, which my Audis do not exhibit).Today, Subarus no matter what their content or technology are not in the Premium Class. For all I know they do have Audi AWD chops and are $20K or $40K less. Even the C&D comparo ended with the conclusion that the author(s) would take a 2010 S4 over a new WRX. I read their words, I do not have any experience that would allow me to make an informed (and possibly biased or unbiased) comment on the matter.I would, initially, expect a $60K car to be in some ways superior to a $30 or $40K car, content, styling, performance, the whole package-wise. This would not be an indictment against the lesser cost vehicle.For the moeny, were I to be given a Subaru budget, I would NOT opt for the 5-year old Audi -- I would indeed go with something NEW (very possibly the Subaru). My experiene would lead me to advise someone who wanted S4-like performance for less money, to look seriously at an Acura TLX SH-AWD (Advance). If the Premium Car experience was unimportant to this someone, I would certainly suggest they shop Subaru, especially if one of their criteria was having AWD.I have, very recently, read some reviews of the Nissan Maxima Platinum version -- while not a member of the Premium Class (as defined by someone, somewhere), this new Maxima certainly seems to ring many of the bells that one would normally associate with ELLPS -- although Infiniti folks would certainly beg to differ.Most of what I seem to come across in my google searches are essays and sites that praise Audi's TorSen based quattro system as ""one of the best"" or sometimes even the best AWD systems currently on the market.That Subaru's system may be right up there is something I shall surely remember when I come across such commentary or test reports. Mean time, since we're not speaking/discussing, HERE of either Lambo's or Subbie's systems, I suggest we discuss an even larger issue for some folks: AWD vs 2WD -- my position is that AWD is what the market is looking for and willing to spend money on. I would postulate that one of the hallmarks required for sustainable success in the market is / are four driven wheels."

August 2015,"Nobody says it's ELLPS (it's not), only that its AWD system in sport models (WRX, STI) is at least in par with Audi's."
August 2015,"NSX has been a long time coming. And, just like SH AWD tech, whatever is introduced in the flagship NSX will eventually make it to the lower level cars (like the Perf/Lux TLX).That Subaru can compete with cars that compete with cars that cost $10K-$20K more is telling. Is it an ELLP? We've had this discussion/argument ad infinitum. Entre into the segment is whatever you think it should be, not limited to the badge on the front grill/hood."
August 2015,"Looked at the CPO 2013 335is today; still not all that enthused. I hate the 19"" wheels- more suceptable to damge, degraded ride comfort, and no performance advantage- so figure around $2500 for a decent set of 18"" tires and wheels from Tire Rack. The STI or Mustang GT PP looks better all the time."
August 2015,"Well, both the Subarus and the NSX are not in this discussion topic. Subarus are far from luxury class and  a $150k two door coupe is hardly an entry level sedan."
August 2015,"Will the NSX, Acura's upcoming $150,000 halo car, help spur sales of more entry-level vehicles? That's the plan. Difficult to say if it'll pan out, but I think it will provide some pizzazz and buzz for Acura dealers. Prototypes are now being made, but the NSX won't be for sale for about 6 months as a 2017 model. Auto Blog as some tidbits they've gotten from the engineers and builders of the NSX, which is being built in Ohio:http://www.autoblog.com/2015/08/15/acura-nsx-cosworth-engine-block-details/""Acura NSX will use Cosworth block, plus other neat tidbitsThe blue NSX you see here was built just two weeks ago. Prototype number six, it rolled off Acura's newest assembly line in Ohio and was rushed out to the Monterey peninsula for various car week activities. We had a chance to sit down with several members of the NSX team to discuss the car, the long road from concept to production, and some interesting details. Below are some choice bits from our conversations.Acura is pretty proud of the fact that NSX version 2.0 was designed and is being built in the US. The new assembly line, called the Performance Manufacturing Center, is in Honda's hometown of Marysville, Ohio. While the line is brand new, the building has seen many uses over its lifetime, most recently as a warehouse facility. PMC staff numbers about 100, with 60 technical and 40 non-technical associates.The car uses parts sourced globally, and one of those sources is Cosworth. The engine blocks and heads come from the English firm and get assembled into twin-turbo powerhouses at Honda's nearby Anna, Ohio, engine plant. The Cosworth name is rarely associated with a bad engine, so we were geeked to hear the NSX's 550-plus-horsepower hybrid powertrain has good genes........the NSX buyer will get to make lots of decisions to craft a custom order. Choices will include paint, interior hues, several wheel styles and finishes, and additional carbon-fiber parts and trim; the standard car will have an aluminum roof, while a carbon piece can be spec'd, and available carbon dress-up pieces will include side sills, a rear diffuser, and an engine dress-up kit.The newly announced blue paint, called Nouvelle Blue Pearl, like the red used on the 2015 show car, uses a fancy multi-layer paint process from PPG that does a nice job of highlighting the surfacing and creases in the car's body. It gave the production engineers a headache, however, since it takes about 16 hours to cure versus regular paint's two-hour wait time. Not surprisingly, it will be an extra-cost option.""More at the link."
August 2015,"Mark, if anything, the link proves that Subaru could be argued as a winner. It holds its own against motor with extra 65 hp and two cylinders. It cost 20 grand less in total ownership, even though 2010 S4 has already depreciated a good deal (essentially S4 still is more and anticicapted repairs kill it in this category). Yes, it is also nicer, but I don't see unquestionned superiority. And this is still the pedestrian WRX, not STI, which you can get for that price purchase difference of 5 grand or so. Extra stuff, better AWD. I know, Audi has RS4, but adjusted for the money, Subaru does it better. Engineering has always been a game of optimizing the variables to bring the value. Take WRX against A4/A5 2.0, see who wins. And WRX still costs less. Even STI may cost less than A4/A5. It's easy to deliver a monster nobody can afford. Got extra 20 grand, get S4, got extra 40 grand, get RS4, when available, wanna keep the money, get Subaru."

The Lambo system appears to be in a leadership position what with electronic control of all three differentials.But, my ""assertion"" was in the context of the LPS and ELLPS world we rage on about here on this forum.Techie in nature:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qkd9B1wx540More entertaining and a bit of a history lesson:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z19953Dy_SAHere is another assertion, but this one is not based on any experience or real study of the brand:In the class of cars (""economy car"", according to Car & Driver) Subaru typically is placed, Subaru does AWD better than any of its competitors. My only reason for such a conclusion is that Subaru has demonstrated its almost fanatical dedication to AWD and, over the years, at least one of its cars, the WRX, has been praised as the Japanese S4. The differences and similarities are discussed and dissected here in this comparison of a 2015 WRX to a 2010 S4.

It is also true that Audi has been doing this for decades (in some cases decades longer than other's in its class), meaning others have been at this nowhere near as long. Yet technology has progressed sufficiently that the market may not perceive anything more than subtle differences between Audi's, BMW's, Lexus', Volvo's or Subaru's approach to AWD; but those who make their living knowing about the differences and the subtleties, regularly praise Audi's approach as very significant and often superior. Of course, in all fairness, many of the enthusiast magazines and their editors and staff now spend more ink describing the overall performance of the cars they review than they do on describing and detailing how one AWD choice differs, is better or worse, than another. Often wrong, but never uncertain, I say: ""Nobody does AWD better than Audi."""

August 2015,"I had a 2005 A6 3.2 -- it was TorSen. As far as I know, all [quattro] Audi's that use a ""north south"" engine (longitudinal) are equipped with a TorSen system, not Haldex. Audi TT's and some A3 models (and VW golfs) had east west engines and utilized Haldex mechanisms.Early Audis with the TorSen system were 50 50 torque split, Haldex systems were typically 90 10 (F R) splits.In the US, at least, almost all Audis sold for the past couple of decades have been quattros and almost all of them have been TorSen, culminating in the cars using TorSen having a REAR biased AWD design. The sport differential (rear only) further enabled Audis so equipped to mitigate the understeer prevalent in cars (like Audis) with their engines ahead of the front axle. TorSen AWD systems have many positives but at the cost of added weight.Currently Audi continues to balance the weight of many of its cars to be less nose heavy than in the past. As far as I know, TorSen AWD systems are the only systems that ""bind in real time"" -- meaning they do not react, they just act -- essentially eliminating the torque shift lag time of other reactive systems.In day to day use, I have to wonder, however, if most of us mere mortals can actually tell the difference between symmetrical and asymmetrical (rear biased) systems -- although I do believe it is quite possible to tell you're driving an essentially FWD car that happens to be able to shift power aft (Acura and Volvo spring to mind).Even so, an Acura TLX with SH-AWD can do a pretty good imitation of an S4 much of the time -- in the clutch, so to speak, however, the FWD biased systems often still feel more FWD than AWD to me.I certainly have nuttin' but respect for Subaru; however, I would suspect most folks shopping for a $60K S4 or BMW 340ix probably don't venture into a Subaru showroom -- but, as usual, I remain, ""often wrong, but never uncertain."""
August 2015,"I'd agree on the more car for the money, at least for now. A 428xi GC equipped as I'd like it (and comparable in features to the S4) is about the same money as the S4. I had the previous gen 335xi (E90) and probably miss that car more than any other in recent ownership, other than perhaps the tight rear seat. I think my affinity for the S4 harkens back to the feel of that car."
August 2015,"What he said with exception of CVT and old 4AT Subarus used 90/10 split, 5AT six cylinder engines had 45/55 split, I think.  Don't know today.  Manual Subies had 50/50 with STI extra feature of driver-controlled bias adjustment, I think it was +/- 20.  Audi's setup was also dictated by engine position - transverse had Haldex AWD, longitudinal had Torsen, as a rule of thumb."

August 2015,@markcincinnati - so you plan on keeping your S4 for the long haul?  That is impressive given your history of leasing or trading out once the warranty is up.
August 2015,"The current 335i/435i does nothing for me; perhaps the 340i/440i will reignite my enthusiasm for the marque, but I wouldn't hold my breath. As for AWD, I like Audis OK, but I prefer the more aggressive character of the STI."

August 2015,"I do want to make it clear: I wouldn't throw a BMW 335i out of bed for eating crackers -- hell, I'd probably be willing to BRING the crackers. Translation: If I couldn't have an Audi, I'd have a BMW without any hesitation. For some reason, I don't have the same feeling about the Mercedes models that are often compared to the Audi A4 and A6 lineup (or the BMW 3 and 5 series lineup.)I just think you get more car for the money, at this point in history, from Audi -- besides, I am totally an AWD customer, and also believe nobody does AWD better than Audi [quattro]."
August 2015,"@markcincinnati - helps tremendously. Thanks for the great feedback and summation of your ownership thus far. Like you, we've had several BMWs, and for the current crop of offerings, both my wife and I are simply finding ourselves more enthralled with the Audi product right now, even with the ""old"" platform A4/S4."
August 2015,"breld: My S4 is a mechanical device and, like all such devices, isn't perfect. Having said that, I am now north of 32,000 miles and, other than springing perhaps a little early for new tires, have nothing negative to report with respect to reliability, drive-ability, performance or efficiency. I ordered mine with A/S tires, which does set the top speed limit (which can be changed with a keystroke or two) to 130MPH. Mine is a Premium+ model (DSG 7-speed transmission) with MMI/Navigation Plus, Audi-side assist, full leather [no alcantara inserts] seats (in red), B&O sound system/speakers, Audi-care and Carbon Fiber interior trim. It, with shipping, came to ~$57K; and I paid 94% of sticker (member of the Audi Club of NA, discount of 6%).At my own option, I have doubled the # of oil changes (I go in every 5,000 miles, meaning I pay for every-other oil change.) I have had the car mini detailed twice and a full-on inside and outside detail once (in the 22 or 23 months since I got it). I swapped the OE tires for Conti's Extreme Contact DWS/06's a couple thousand miles ago and the handling took a very big step up and road noise, already low, dropped even further.I would get another one -- without any question (assuming the price doesn't shoot up like Cadillac did to the CTS line). I see no reason NOT to keep it until at least 90,000+ miles (based on its complete lack of any issues, thus far.)I have no clue if these cars hold their value better than or worse than whatever they might be shopped against -- my sense is at $57K, I would have had to take a lesser-contented BMW 335i x-drive. We've had 3 BMW's and this Audi feels more powerful than any i6 BMW we've had, but since the Audi is supercharged, this may not be a fair comparison. I wish the back seat had at least 1"" additional leg room, but since my 22 pound Sheltie is usually the only rear seat passenger, it is not really a show stopper; besides the next gen ""A4/S4"" family will grow in size somewhat, so, again, if I knew then what I know now, I would, without hesitation repeat the acquisition of an S4.My complaints -- ONE; the car came with WiFi based on T-Mobile 3G technology. If I actually could find and keep a 3G signal (instead, mine is mostly at 2G), I would be fine with the WiFi performance. Ultimately, my dealer showed me a secret method of adapting the carrier from T-Mobile to AT&T with some software coding and a new SIMM chip -- I am now, always in 3G. I read somewhere that the 2016 A4/S4's will offer 4G LTE radios, solving the T-Mobile (in our geography) performance issues.Love the feature of being able to Google a destination by voice and having the sat nav take you there -- all hands free.Love the instant response of the power, the 7-speed DSG and the tuneage from the B&O speakers.Regrets? Wish I had gone the extra $1,000 for the Sport Differential (Audi's name for torque vectoring). After driving an S4, you will -- upon sliding behind the wheel of almost any other car -- wonder if the different car than the S4 is, somehow, broke. The 3.0T motor is damn near electric in feel as it whisks you effortlessly from 0 to 60, just about the time you reach the end of your . . . driveway. Ruh Roh! Hope this helps. P.S. I am not too much of a believer that ""new models"" are prone to first-year glitches; I am a believer, however, that often the last year of a model's life-cycle provides the least amount of problems, often the greatest amount of content for the dollars spent and a pretty good chance of a deeper discount since there are no secrets. In other words, there will be a new, B9, A4/S4 model -- MY 2017. The 2016's, therefore will have to have more content and a better deal in order to help dealers clear out the ""old"" inventory thus making room for the new. Audi, I believe, has taken to delaying the availability of the new model until a certain threshold of sales of the old model has passed, therefore providing some ""value support"" both for the dealers and ultimately, of course, the buyers.Discounts will be there for 2016 A4/S4's -- but don't expect to see a $58,000 S4 for $48K just because there is a new 2017 in the pipeline."

August 2015,"My son is almost 21 and has a fairly strong interest in cars. He prefers performance cars but is patient and waiting until he is out on his own to get one. Currently he likes the M3/4, Cayman S, GT350, STI, and the Hellcat Challenger- as well as some true exotics. He has had a lot of exposure to the performance side, hanging out at O'fest with me and shagging rides in fairly quick cars such as a B7 press loaner and a GT2 RS."

But, to give him props, he much prefers my XF to Mom's 535xi (and expects me to give him the XF immediately upon licensure!). His car interest usually starts in the 7 figure range, he seems to admire the Bugatti Veyron. My guess, he'll have one before me..."
August 2015,"mark - I have to agree. I would have to say that most under 30 have no interest in automobiles. As hard as I tried, my 18 YO could care less about cars.You mentioned the freedom that your 93 Newport gave you. I too felt that my 72 Cutlass gave me freedom. But we grew up in a much smaller world. Cases in point:Before I had a grown up job, I had been on one plane trip. I can't count the number of times my kids have been on plane trips. My 15 YO daughter is going on 3 of them in the next 12 months and none of them is with family. We had 3 channels on TV - if your family was rich and had UHF TV, you might have 5. We had one avocado green rotary phone in the kitchen and we didn't make long distance calls. I remember my parents calling the operator to schedule a time for an overseas line to call family for a few expensive minutes of conversation.On Sundays we went to church then went to our cousin's house for a late lunch and a day of fun or the beach for an all day outing involving lots of water, sand, and sunburns.We would go on vacation to the beach two hours away and know nothing of what was going on at home.Kids today - I can't believe I just said that - have the world at the fingertips and that is their freedom. The don't need a car to take them away.It's not necessarily a bad thing. We can lament the interest in automobiles but there are so many more choices available to people."
August 2015,"Young people just express this differently. Many find ""utility"" far more attractive than ""performance"". Perhaps that's what you're noticing. Just as one example. There is a seriously significant ""cult"" of young people who spend big bucks on VW Camper Vans and who travel in packs around the country. They'll drop $35K on a VW Synchro Camper but never on a performance sedan. These aren't hippies, they are working families and often professionals."
August 2015,"You Never Close Your Eyes . . . To many – perhaps most – of us born in the ‘50’s, it is difficult to comprehend or even imagine the apparent blasé attitude of many Americans, most of them born after the ‘70’s or ‘80’s (apparently), toward cars. I work with 30, 40 & 50-somethings. Only those seeing, or soon seeing their 5th decade seem to have much, if any, interest in cars. One gentleman loves his Mini; and is a pretty ardent participant in local and even some national Mini events. Getting him started on what he did last weekend surely invites him to share the pictures from the most recent cross-country Mini event or gathering. He has a map over his desk outlining a coast-to-coast Mini drive, and it is easy to find him gazing – longingly – at that map from time-to-time. Other than that, these “youngsters” seem to care less about what “my peeps” hold dear: Fine cars, fine dining, fine wine and home theaters that require a minimum of a 70” screen.These “yutes” seem mildly, or politely, interested in “my generation’s” escapades, but there is virtually no-one left on the planet who seems to know or care much about cars – far as I know, I’m the only subscriber to any auto-enthusiast magazines; no really, I’m the last one, anywhere.One of the mid-fifty-ish folks I know recently traded in his stick-shift Acura TL for a used RDX (really incredibly low mileage). He had, at least, taken the time to research his purchase, remarking about the SH-AWD and the turbo charged engine (and he loves the DVD-Audio sound system). But, beyond his own vehicle, beyond the Acura brand, he neither knows nor cares.My nephew, a twenty-something wrapping up his undergraduate degree (part time) while working (full time), certainly has the means to drive something that could get his adrenaline pumping, but he has a Saturn – and I don’t think it has been washed anytime in the 21st century, leading me to conclude he cares not at all for cars (his at least). OK, so I can find almost no-one interested in discussing the “Performance Sedan” (ELLPS and/or LPS) class. Must be that when I was growing up the automobile was the symbol of freedom, fun and somewhat even a symbol of a certain status (thinking of V8 vs 6, “SS” vs Biscayne, etc.). Thin red-striped sidewall tires, “Wide-Oval” rubber and Hurst Shifters in your newly acquired Goat ruled my formative years. I couldn’t wait to get my temps, my license and ultimately my own car, a 1963 lime-green Chrysler Newport. I ran the thing without an air-cleaner and pulled the hub-caps (remember those?) and shined the matte black paint on the wheels with STP and Pledge (as I recall, I did this ritual daily – at least during the good months of the year).Today, our office manager a late-30’s woman, cares about cars perhaps on-par with dishwashing machines and dual-fuel ranges; no wait, dual-fuel ranges rule, especially if they come from Kitchen Aid or Jenn-Air.Today’s youth, consisting, in part, of tomorrow’s Premium Class buyers look at cars almost as a necessary evil or, at best, a four-wheel appliance – seemingly the more sterile and passionless the better.It seems to me that cars must no longer symbolize freedom, rather they suggest you're “joining a group” [under duress] – these post-baby boomers somehow “lost that lovin’ feelin’” so many of us embraced then and, without being too sentimental, come close to cherishing today.I recall my sophomore year at college – I had met the girl. She lived in Florida, I in Ohio, and I just couldn’t imagine how we could spend Thanksgiving break apart, so I filled up the ol’ ’63 Newport and made the drive – virtually non-stop – from Oxford, Ohio to Naples, Florida. It is a wonder I didn’t kill myself, I got so sleepy. The point is, the car granted me both the ability and freedom to choose to make the moronic decision to drive, almost literally, down and back over a three-day period (and, since I needed gas money, I had to sleep in the damn car, unable to afford a place to stay). I loved it.“Kids” today don’t take “road trips,” don’t yell “shot-gun” and don’t know that a ’63 Newport had the 361 CI V8, while the 300 and the New Yorker had a 383 and a 413 respectively. Clarification, I would not expect a 20-year old today to know much, if anything about a 1963 vintage automobile; my point is these youngin’s don’t know what 335i, 328i, quattro, SH-AWD, 4-Motion, Tip-tronic or even ABS means. I assume they know the name BMW, Cadillac and Ferrari, however – I hope they do, anyway.Automobile manufacturers have a lot of research, development and marketing to do if they want to return to their former selves, in terms of being Objets de Desír.Those of us who bother to participate here, it appears, are [perhaps] a dying generation."
August 2015,"So, whether it's sooner (this year) or later (next year), I'm seriously thinking of pulling the trigger on an S4. The only other car I'm seriously considering is the 4 series GC. So, @markcincinnati (and others feel free to chime in), I know you've been extremely happy with your S4. Any advice you'd have as far as issues to be aware of as an owner? I assume it's a good daily driver? I know others here have had less than stellar ownership experiences with the model too (GG, right?)Being fully aware of a new model due out within a year, I am a little hesitant on getting the outgoing one, but there's also something to getting a model with the bugs worked out. And I'm leaning toward a manual trannie, which I'm just guessing won't be available this next go around. Thanks!"
August 2015,"Totally agree @roadburner - I've said it before, but we have a local shop here in Denver that we trust that works primarily on BMWs, but also other German brands. If we didn't have that relationship, I would be much more hesitant in buying any used BMWs."

Probably would have saved enough to retire at 51- oh, wait..."
August 2015,"Yep. I'll say that all of those things (expendables) should be pretty obvious in their lack of replacement/repair with a relatively quick test drive and a quick look under the chasis and under the hood.Me thinks this is a case where the owner said...""oooh....look, a BMW. Me want one."" No consideration given at all about its condition."
August 2015,"Michaell - despite my previous declaration that neither my wife nor I found the Infiniti (or Acura) particularly emotionally engaging, I will add to my above urging to get a full inspection (that you PAY for) the following:The Q40, if it is the one I think it is, will be the ""Japanese BMW"" if you care about my perspective; it will be quite the performer, very engaging to drive.Moreover, based on our experience, Infiniti knows how to build a reliable and -- I would extrapolate -- durable car. However, it is a premium car and if it does need repairs, out of warranty they won't be cheap (maintenance, however, will probably cost less for an Infiniti than for a BMW or Audi, for example). At 39 months, however, I would probably have very very low concern, especially if I planned to do 39 months and move onto the next.Whatever you do, should you go previously owned, get the thing inspected and do yourself a favor, shop the used car against a new one if monthly payment and TOC (total operating costs) are of concern -- then after you have the data, make your move."
August 2015,"That works out to about $370/mo.+tax.. You can negotiate a better deal on your own.. Plus, Infiniti drops big incentives on current lessees that could save you even more.If I was writing the ad, I'd mention that the car has 327 HP and has eye-watering acceleration.."
August 2015,"The guy with the bad BMW was posting on driveaccord.net. He didn't mention the purchase price, but he did say he was a college student. It seems a painful lesson has been learned.

There is no free-lunch (well, there is a free-lunch tomorrow, according to the sign.) I crack myself up. I would think the new car would have a lower risk and very high expectation of having lower operating costs than a 2007 model with 100K+ miles on it.Of course, we really don't have enough information to call the two transactions high vs low risk, for perhaps the 2007 was acquired for $3,000 cash, not $13,000 -- the ire of the poster however would seem to suggest that an impossibly low selling price was not part of the picture of this transaction some 6 months ago."
August 2015,"This is a good discussion.I am currently in a lease of a pedestrian vehicle (Hyundai Elantra GT) that expires in about 15 months. Lately, I've been toying with the idea of getting a few-years-old Infiniti (G25x or G37x) as my next car and wonder about maintenance costs. I have a friend in CA with a J30 that has over 200,000 miles on it; he uses an independent shop for most maintenance. He only used the dealer once - to change the timing belt."
August 2015,"Another telling thing: at 100,000 miles the ""perceived worth"" of [even] Audis, BMWs and Mercedes falls off of a cliff -- in part this just HAS to be because there will be EXPENABLES, even if the basic car is a cream puff."
August 2015,I think this is very good advice.++
August 2015,"100K is a tricky mileage point to buy a used car because that's about the time when normal ""expendables"" are starting to expend  . So things like brakes, tires, shocks/struts, belts, hoses, timing belts, battery---all that stuff is coming due at those miles if the previous owner has been relying on a reactive, rather than proactive, approach to maintenance."
August 2015,"Lots of factors could be at work here- did he/she get a competent and thorough PPI(mandatory with older BMWs)? Where is he/she getting it serviced and repaired? If the shop is incompetent the repairs may be unneeded or the problems may not have been properly diagnosed. BMWs don't tolerate cutting corners with dodgy aftermarket parts. Then it might just be a shop that expects you to hand over your credit card, drop your pants, and grab your ankles; I've often told the story about the BMW dealer in Santa Monica that charges almost 3 times more than my local BMW dealer. for the identical service...."
August 2015,"Had the car for 6 months -- has 103K miles on it (how many did it have 6 months ago)? What was paid for the car 6-months ago (was it picked up below retail market? If so, how much below retail market)? Let's just say it was picked up from a private individual ""as is"" and was offered up at $2K below retail market -- that would suggest a still healthy but less so investment of ""only"" $3K in repairs vs what could have been, should have been, etc.Are we counting such things as ""tires, brake pads, struts, rotors, cabin-filters, wheel-alignment and wiper blades"" as repairs? The last time I had to pay for a cabin filter it was a multi-hundred dollar affair, all in.Is this car this person's first BMW or first high-mileage European car? My neighbor with 80,000 miles on a Pontiac (don't know the age), said the car was a money vacuum, in that it sucked all his money out of his checkbook. Most folks, these days are WARY of buying high-mileage cars that are breathtakingly expensive to repair and maintain. And: How many times have we here said European cars are breathtakingly expensive to own out of warranty? Answer, about 139,659 times on this forum alone. Of course, you can be forgiven if you didn't read this board backwards to 2002. Really, we'll let that pass.Key question, was a full, complete, total, non-free inspection performed on the car prior to purchase; if so what did the inspection reveal -- you would think such an inspection would've picked up something that would have caused it to burn through $5K worth of ""repairs"" (see maintenance comment above), perhaps? Whenever anyone I know asks me for my advice or opinion regarding a used-car purchase, I typically urge them to spend the money for a non-biased, not-free inspection from a specialist enterprise. Here in RiverCity, there are several BMW or German or European repair houses (not dealer affiliated) who for a 3-figure number will put together a report on the used car you are lusting for, outlining the expected near term costs of ownership.I always seem to get someone here upset at me when I suggest it is often far cheaper (on a 12, 24, 36 or even 48 month basis) to lease a brand new, with warranty (and often maintenance-included) car than it is to buy a used one with the potential of requiring huge sums of money just to keep it running.What would a 2007 335i go for? Locally a new 3-series can be leased often for a number beginning with a 3. Often Accords can be had for even less, try $219/mo for a strippie for 27 months.And (if it is a BMW) that mo/pmt includes the maintenance and free (well, you know) repairs for 50,000 miles. It seems to me to be hard to compete with these sub-vented leases, unless for some reason you think you are making an ""investment"" in a declining-value asset -- and even with BMW's that's a hard argument to win.Going to an Accord, per se, is not a bad thing or a dumb thing to do -- in fact, such a move may very well be a good and smart thing to do; but unless the Accord in question is 100% new with factory warranty and any mntce program that may accompany it, the same rule of thumb would apply -- get the damn thing rigorously inspected before buying/leasing/financing/acquiring.Some of us are ""types."" After dozes of German cars, my wife and I each went with Infiniti [her] and Acura [me]; we liked the cars for the most part, but it was really quite difficult to build up much passion or, actually, any emotion. My cousin, ""Mr. Honda or Mr. Mazda and now Mr. KIA,"" tried out a German and, although it was no trouble, he just seemed to resent (?) the fact that he had to interact with the car -- he just couldn't get into the ""don't forget to breathe"" tag line sign hanging low and large at the local BMW dealership.Maybe it is telling -- I am not certain ""what"" it is telling, however -- that the BMW's ouster will be followed not by another German or European or even Premium car, but by a Honda Accord. Again, there is nothing wrong with Accord's, but I would typically think folks who like BMW's unlikely to shop Honda's. Were I in the same situation, I would likely be looking to get right back on the horse and, if possible, get a younger -- or new -- BMW."
August 2015,"So Johan de NoclueaboutCaddysschen seems to be saying that Cadillacs should be selling for more than the equivalent BMWs, Audis, or MBs. ?That is not going to happen. The buyers of those cars are loyal and dedicated, and very few of them will ever consider a Cadillac—especially if it costs more money.I'm trying to figure this out, but I see from GM's webpage (and even though he's spending their money hand over fist on his experiment, he's at the same time trying to distance himself from them?) that he grew up in South Africa. He also, as we know, worked for a long time for Audi, and then for Infiniti. http://www.gm.com/content/gmcom/home/company/aboutGM/GM_Corporate_Officers/johan_nysschen.htmlEssentially, Johan de N. doesn't seem to have much of a clue about who buys Cadillacs. The Cadillac buyer wants American luxury, performance, and style—but not at a nosebleed price. They either won't pay that much—or can't.Cadillac has already moved upmarket in the last 15 years. And that's a good thing. But these new moves don't seem rational to me or to some other people.For instance, would Audi owner markcincinnati be willing to pay *more* than an Audi for a Cadillac? I don't think so.And now Johan de Nosebleedprysschen is insulting his own dealer network. ?Bet the dislike for him at the grassroots dealer level is swelling like a Fukushima tsunami....Hire an outside ""genuis"" for megabucks who promises you the moon?

August 2015,"The problem is that those dealers kind of deserve it (at least some), as they don't reflect what Cadillac should be and there is not even a chance they'll ever do. I don't think it's the guy's ego problem. If anything, it's GM's past and present hubris and running the brand to the ground, before he even joined them. They guy is simply telling how he sees they should look in the future. He may be wrong here and there and perhaps not fully get all the fixes right, but it's simply unsustainable the way it is right now. The problem is the constituency, both in the company and the dealers simply is too myopic to see it and attached to old ways. In essence, he has no chance, not because his being wrong, but because there is too much to change and too few interested in the change. Simple declaring bankruptcy, shedding assets and contracts is just a start, not the end of restructuring. Cadillac has a network to sell million cars a year and the product that sells less than half of that with sales are barely moving up in the aggregate, falling in key segments. Essentially a burning platform, to use Elop's language about Nokia. I unfortunately think they may end up like Nokia, too. Perhaps it will take longer."

I suspect there may be other ways to do this, but, one more thing: if a credit check is run through one of the three commercial CB's, there is an ""inquiry"" posted to the formula used to determine your score. Should you have a credit check or worse, multiple credit checks, there is the distinct possibility of a hit (negative) on your scores. Applying for a credit check -- especially without your knowledge would not be a good practice.Please note, my comments were meant to suggest a fundamental difference between the experience we customers face at a Premium European or Japanese vs even a Premium American brand.Actually, since the Cadillac dealer we frequent is next to the Audi dealer where we buy regularly, we are usually just given the keys with the comment, ""take your time.""The overall spirit of what I was commenting about was to underscore DeNysschen's comments. Really, I am pulling for him and for Cadillac. Sometimes, though, it must seem almost like a lost cause. If he can survive, I would assume he could make Cadillac thrive. It's a long row to hoe, however."
August 2015,"No. Credit check can't be pulled from your DL number. They want to make sure you have a valid DL, first of all, before letting you drive their car on their insurance. They also want ID in case you run off with their car. Seems pretty reasonable."

August 2015,"http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2015/08/12/cadillac/31518823/A Day in the LifeDue to our on-again, off-again “hobby” – getting educated about a somewhat eclectic number of automotive brands – my wife and I have had the experience of visiting dealerships and interacting with many current auto models and their sales representatives. Included in this list: Jeep, Chrysler, GMC and, of course, Cadillac. Of course we’ve also experienced Acura, Audi, BMW, Infiniti, Lexus, Mercedes and Volvo, too. But, in response to DeNysschen’s “warning” to GM’s top brass, I can now reflect on what seems to be a different “approach” prospective customers will enjoy when shopping at the dealership of, apparently most, American automotive brands.Have you ever heard of or seen a TV show called “WKRP in Cincinnati?” If so, you will have a somewhat more well-rounded perspective of the Herb Tarlek approach. I want to make sure you understand my remarks are a caricature – an exaggeration. You see, Mr. Tarlek is the sales manager of the fictional Cincinnati radio station WKRP – and he is, well, terrible. His behavior qualifies him to be called either a jerk or a jackass. His behavior and customer’s interactions with him often seem vaguely slimy, borderline unethical and disreputable. Further, it appears that Mr. Tarlek has a problem with women, often calling them “hon’” and usually ignoring them altogether, if they are with a man.Pulling into the lot of [even] a Cadillac dealership, the gentleman sporting a white belt and white shoes barely allows customers to exit their vehicles before invading their personal space and asking them if their “time-frame” is today (since he’s already below his quota and needs to only spend time with customers who will sign and drive NOW.)Then, you are guided to – apparently – the vehicle with the spiffs on it and “encouraged” to take a test drive. You are required to allow your driver’s license to be photocopied and you may even have to produce proof of insurance. Then, the rep gets into the back seat in order to answer any questions that may arise during the test drive.And so it goes – you can’t wait to get out of there, for, during the test drive the chatter from the back seat is incessant, pressing you for “what’ll it take” to get you to close the deal today.Come to think of it, this isn’t as much of a caricature as I had intended.I don’t know if these dealer reps ever shop for cars anywhere else to “see how it is done elsewhere,” but the evidence suggests this is not the case.On top of way too many dealers, DeNysschen has his work cut out for him – I suspect he’ll be incredibly popular with the dealers (uh huh).Unless I knew exactly what I wanted and could pretty much handle the entire transaction over the Internet, I don’t know why folks willing and able to plunk down sums often way north of $50,000 put up with this kind of behavior – oh wait, apparently not enough of them do.Swallow your pride and see if there’s any openings at Audi, Mr. DeNysschen. Cadillac may just be, if not a lost cause, in possession of too much inertia."
August 2015,"Wow. 982 dealers selling fewer units than 282 dealers. I thought Cadillac will have to cut its network in half, but it seems it will have to leave a quarter, maybe a third. This is basically impossible. Just imagine legal battles, payoffs, etc. It is worse than I thought. The bloat is incredible. No wonder GM has such a bad relationship with dealers."

August 2015,"I was in the Prague airport several years ago and there was a Skoda on display -- did a double take, it was a Passat without any of the VW logos, etc. Now, the car was roped off, so I really couldn't peek inside to see if the interior was also a Passat, but, whatever differences there were, were minor.I assume Skoda's are priced lower than VW's and VW's of course are priced lower than Audis, etc.While watching MotorWeek's test of the Lambo Aventador SV, I noticed the ""console"" was pretty much the same as the MMI+ that I have in my 2014 S4. Even the knobs and switches were straight out of an Audi (that would be priced several hundred thousand dollars less.)"

August 2015,"There is still some ""badge engineering"" in other manufacturers, including VAG. In Europe, they have Skoda, Seat, VW models differing mostly by some styling and interior, but essentially identical otherwise (with ""special model"" exceptions). Not as visible here, as VW to Audi separation is much more pronounced, especially within current US market offerings. Other do much worse job of separating models, especially in lower end of the premium brands, where majority of their entry level models are barely changed in comparison to their close common relatives. Lincoln MKZ/Ford Fusion, Acura CLX/Honda Civic come in mind, especially their lower level trims. Even previous generation Audi A3/VW Golf GTI were not as far apart, as they should be."
August 2015,Cool.  I agree that platform sharing isn't badge engineering.
August 2015,"Bradd - the MLB platform is used as the basis for:Audi A5 (Typ 8T, 2007-)Audi A4 (Typ 8K, 2008-)Audi Q5 (Typ 8R, 2009-)Audi A8 (Typ 4H, ""D4"", 2010-)Audi A7 (Typ 4G, 2010-)Audi A6 (Typ 4G, ""C7"", 2011-)Porsche Macan (2013-)As Mark noted, the same platform can be used on different vehicles and get different results.I get bothered by the ""badge engineering"" argument when a platform is shared. It's not like the old days when a different nose and tail was slapped on a car and we have a new model to sell."
August 2015,"Technically the Macan shares about 33% of its DNA with the Audi Q5/SQ5. The two local Audi retailers happen to own Porsche dealerships -- kind of an interesting ""battle of the brands"" with shoppers cross shopping SQ5's with the base Macan. Apparently, if you know where to look, you can actually see the Audi markings on frame members of the Macan.Of course my Audi rep thinks the Macan costs $10-$15K more than an SQ5, and has made a Sticker Comparison to demonstrate that.Frankly, having driven both of them, my take is that for once the Audi interior is second to the Macan's and the Macan has noticeably lower ground clearance. From a power perspective, the Audi has both more HP and torque, but the Porsche's torque, derived as it is from turbo charging comes on at a lower RPM.The SQ5, were it to offer the German Market lowered suspension (which it does not, here in the US), seems to be more car for the money -- but, ahem, what price the Porsche medallion? The Porsche uses a 7-speed dual clutch unit and the SQ5 uses an 8-speed tiptronic with software that does a pretty good impression of a dual clutch feel. Lots of options available on the Macan -- and those options can crank a Macan over $100,000. Our lowly SQ5 Prestige with a couple of options and in Panther Black with red leather seats came in at $65,000. Despite the similarities, there are obvious Porsche touches that are included in that 67% uniqueness -- and while you may argue their value-prop, they certainly do imbue the Macan with Porsche-ness; and, no amount of leather or paint will make the SQ5 a Porsche. You may cross shop them and I'm certain the country-club valet will give either car you hop out of nothing other than a ton of respect (and will likely avert his eyes), but one, after all is a friggin' Porsche.Drive it like you live.NB: My wife decided the SQ5 would be a repeat, primarily because she likes being a bit higher off the ground and because the back seat of the Macan takes a big hit in headroom and cargo space in exchange for having a swoopy rear-end. The Audi, then, gets a nod toward ""practicality"" if you can imagine hauling groceries in a $65,000 Supercharged 354HP 346 ft/lb Torque ""CUV Hot-rod!"""
August 2015,"As someone who worked at Sony during the heyday, the writing was on the wall when I left in 97, every segment Sony was in, they had the top model, but when the walkman died, so did a lot of other products, Thier laptop's had many problems and durability was a problem, Sony wouldn't give up on the DAT player for Car Audio or BETA video recorder, two complete failures. Then Sony cheapened the brand by out sourcing products to be manufacturers in Mexico, other brands were getting better and Sony's products were getting outdated and finally other brands surpassed Sony in sales. If it wasn't for the PlayStation, I really think Sony would be a completely different company then it is today."

August 2015,"Lexus worked, because it was a separate brand. If Hyundai went as far as creating a new brand with separate dealer network, the land grab could work. Selling 70K limousine next to 15K econobox is actually a very difficult proposition. However, the former requires lots of time, resources and patience. The latter can be tried and abandoned in one cycle."
August 2015,"Configuring a, for example, 5 series with X,Y & Z features and options and attempting to do the same configuration of a CTS is a good way to determine if Cadillac is going after the land grab.I have no wish for Cadillac to emulate my historical perspective of Sony's playbook. I observed some evidence that was the approach that seemed to materialize coincidental with the birth of the current CTS.For the most part, I would say I favor the Lexus LS400 approach -- build a comparable car (comparable to Mercedes is the popular conception) and price it so compellingly that it is difficult for customers NOT to shop it.In some respects, it appears KIA has set its sights on the Premium (including entry-level premium) Class and is using the land grab approach. It's sibling company coming out with the Equus, too, seems like a similar approach. Don't know how it's going with the Equus as it, unlike Lexus, doesn't have a dedicated dealer body. That worked out well for the Phaeton in the US, eh?My board is always after me to raise the prices of our software products -- doing so, we experienced growth -- slow growth. We changed the strategy to buy one, get one and sales (revenue) literally doubled. Of course my business is B2B, but in the end, the purchases are made by a human, in either a commercial or retail setting, so I assume there is some carry over.If you want to build market share, go land grab and raise prices slowly over time. If you want to build gross margin -- PER TRANSACTION -- raise the price, but remember the risk is that revenue will likely drop for some period of time (years, in some cases).The economic reality seems, for cars -- unless you're Lambo or Porsche, or another already high-priced established product, etc -- to favor land grab, if you're trying to build or, in Cadillac's place, re-build a brand.I think, in part, BMW has mastered this -- they have created an aspirational brand. Everywhere you turn (we have two BMW dealers in Cincinnati who seem to churn out a couple hundred new BMW owners every month) you see ""yourself"" in [generally speaking] a new 3-series; then, when you've finally ""arrived"" you immediately go to the BMW Store or Sweeny and pick up your new symbol of success. A few years ago, I read an article that said ""Everyone wants to be BMW;"" last year, if you can believe Car & Driver, et al, the headline was ""Everyone wants to be Audi."" Of course the ""Everyone"" was speaking of Audi or BMW's rivals du jour.Hopefully Cadillac will keep improving the product and will figure out someway to make the cars be perceived as ""worth the asking price.""Tick-tock."
August 2015,"Back in January, Cadillac cut the MSRP on the CTS anywhere from $1-3,000."
August 2015,"Those all are too small differentials. They should be such that even after a customary dealer's discount at BMW or Benz, there is still a healthy distance to the STICKER of the Cady. At least for now. The CTS-to-5 series move was correct in general terms, but it should take 10 years, not just one sweep. The sticker shock from previous year was simply too big. There is a history showing such big moves never work. You can't ""declare"" yourself worthy of the price - that's something that comes after years. Lexus knew it and where are they now. Even now one part of their appeal is that they are a value proposition to the Germans - much less of a discount than before, nevertheless they are still cheaper, especially in higher reaches of their respective models. They have a simpler lineup, so there are gaps in comparison, but within comparable models and equipment, the prices are still lower."
August 2015,Well we're getting a hint of it in the New CTS-V Sticker Price.
August 2015,"Granted, I have not gone through the trouble of trying to build like cars, but the CTS starts at $5k less than the 5-series. The 6-cylinders start about $2k apart, so, OK, not so great there. But then you are back to a $5k delta with the V sport vs 550i. The CTS already starts nearly $9k less than its E-class counterparts.The ATS 2.5 is a mistake that should have been killed at birth. Yes, the ATS is only about $1k less than the 3-series counterparts on starting price. The C class, however, is $2k more for the 4-cyl turbo and $6k more for the 6-cyl. An ATS-V is about $3500 less than the starter C63 and $1500 under the M3. So it seems to me they have a bit more work to do on ATS pricing than CTS, although the sales of the CTS would indicate otherwise."
August 2015,Can you elaborate? Are they lowering prices by large increments? This would certainly be interesting news.
August 2015,"Cadillac seems to be revising their pricing structure for 2016, so I think they're getting the message that they have to set a price about $10K below MB and Lexus."
August 2015,"Where is Sony now? Sony started higher because they used to have a product that was at least arguably better and most innovative. Later on they stopped innovating, diluted the brand. Sony is a shadow of its old self. To wish Cadillac to go Sony way is to basically wish it to die slow and painful death.Plus, pricing product higher you have to acknowledge the expected hit in volume. They are claiming the opposite. That's what is not making sense."
August 2015,"It -- perhaps superficially -- appears that Cadillac is emulating the SONY approach. Sony, a few short decades ago was the big buck TV (and later there were many other Sony branded electronics). Back in the day when big name department stores would sell TVs, a shopper could be in selection mode and see a sea of Zenith, RCA, Admiral and even Mitsubishi TVs -- often the Sony family of TVs was separated from the other brands; and, always the Sony brand in whatever size you were shopping for was more expensive. Time passed. Sony proliferated the brand and began lowering prices. Or did the competition creep their prices upward?Eventually Sony showed up in Walmart along side other ""perceived lesser"" brands -- regardless of the price erosion, Sony did keep the image of being the Premium Brand.Lexus, on the other hand, produced a premium automobile, said to be comparable to Mercedes, and charged 20% less. Over time, Lexus was able to inflate the MSRP of the cars to near parity with the premium Germans.Two approaches -- both appear to work to carve out market share.Cadillac seems to be working the Sony model -- price the product more dearly, take the chance that the market will perceive the brand in an increasingly positive light -- ""Cadillac is back."" This is time consuming, expensive and probably WILL WORK ""if"" there is sufficient shareholder and executive management patience to ""not quit before the miracle.""The Lexus -- Land Grab -- approach also has its merits. In a B2C model, I would assume the Lexus approach seems ""intuitively"" to be lower risk. But, the brand will take a period of time to build up the desired perception. Again, corporate and shareholder patience will be required, but since there will be volume, shareholders may think the ""miracle"" is closer than it may ultimately prove to have been.You can't enact either approach if your masters fire you though. The investors -- a somewhat different group than the shareholders -- probably prefer raising prices, since the brand's equity (if the approach works) will certainly be built up.Oddly, in my perception, Audi took the Lexus approach (sort of), but I could argue the ""unintended acceleration"" situation that befell Audi after the 60-Minutes story, FORCED Audi to discount their cars just to remain relevant in the US (remember the days when select prospects received a $5,000 check that could be applied to the Audi 5000 (which became the A6) linup. The approach would seem to be that the MSRP was not discounted, but you were given an up-front rebate.So Cadillac is taking the approach of selling cars that are priced higher -- the Sony approach to market share, sort of.Of course the dealer body has to be convinced along with the customers that this is a long game and worth playing. The dealers, so it appears, are not exactly warming to this approach, however.We'll see."
August 2015,"I'm not against platform sharing, that's a fact of life today. It's about making cars different enough. There are examples of successful platform sharing, such as VAG, where to various degree there are shared components between Skoda, Seat, VW, Audi, Porsche, Lamborghini and Bugatti, but the brands have enough identity and uniqueness between each other. A domestic example of a successful platform sharing would be Cadillac Escalade - regardless how much detest Cadillac's marketing of this vehicle (the commercial with Pharao, Raja, Louis-X??? could easily be in top 3 most offensive and obnoxious ever), it has enough separation from GMC. An example for the opposite also comes from Cadillac - Cimarron. GM's overall track record of putting different badges on practically identical vehicles makes me, should I say, skeptical. They got better, recently. I think Buicks seem to be regaining their own identity, but seems GM is slowly falling back into its old ways - unrealistic expectations, lots of puffery, and lack of support of their dealers, see Graphic's CTS saga, which seems to stem from multiple dealers' unwillingness to troubleshoot the car without a fault code, which is most likely because GM's refusal to give them enough leeway to work the problem first. They can't win luxury market customers, if their dealers act this way, but they do that because of the toxic relationships. Moreover, there are probably too many stores for the brand to be truly upscale. So they trump half million sales target in 5 years, which is high teens growth each year, every year, with currently crashing sales in some key US segments. I understand, big part of the growth is supposed to come from China, which I think is OK, even if recent news suggest a calamity unfolding there (I think it's way overstated).How do you grow sales, when in fact you need to shrink the store count and apply more discipline? It's all completely inconsistent. As I said before, it's a ten year project with very difficult first three-four years and no guarantee for a success. They are unwilling to swallow that bitter pill (what's new about that), they'd rather do what they have always done - peacocking, unrealistic baffoonery. Seems like the bankruptcy taught them absolutely nothing. Looks like the new outsider guy fits their old mold quite well."
August 2015,I suppose not.
August 2015,Aw c'mon now. These are more than badge jobs. They are shared platforms with little shared outside of that. Should we chastise VW for sharing an 8 year old platform between the current A4 and the new Porsche Macan?
August 2015,"well, the Acura dealer does offer them. But in 3 years, I have never been in for anything that wasn't covered under the express service, so I never had to stay more than an hour, so no point in leaving. Hyundai, well, that had 1 oil change, so I just waited.our Honda dealer (when I used them a lot) just had a shuttle. mostly I just waited for the express service. the few times i needed to leave it, either took the shuttle or had the wife drop me off. Hopefully I never have to deal with the VW dealer, outside of 1x year oil change!"

Their sales are crashing, in segments that should bring growth, they don't want to put incentives out, they raise prices, yet they want to sell 500,000 units by 2020. They do say of a small SUV plans. Hopefully more than just a rebadged Chevy. http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/11/us-gm-cadillac-sales-idUSKCN0QG1Y220150811"

August 2015,I'm thinking that the new Shell V-Power Nitro + is for the folks on this board....https://recombu.com/cars/article/is-it-worth-buying-shell-v-power-nitro-fuel
August 2015,"Yeah, you're right, what I said at the OPENING of my post should have been repeated ""about half""-- yet, average just doesn't give enough information to know other than to take a guess that ""probably"" your 50% number (61) is ""probable."" When I took statistics and probability in grad school, my professor asked the question ""If we would like to be told we would be kept at an an average temperature of 106F determined by having one half of our body at 0F and one half at 212F -- his argument was that ""on average, you'd think you might just be a little warm, but that is because you had insufficient data."" It's the numbers on the fringes that can really muck up the meaning of average. My interest would be in knowing a bit more. I mean it, BMW, as we all know, stands for Beauty, Money and Wealth -- and in my experience the BMW owners, shoppers and drivers are YOUNG and possess beauty, money and wealth. Finding out that BMW buyers are older than Audi buyers bursts my bubble.Buick and Lincoln's numbers, however, seem to fit my perceptions, on the other hand."
August 2015,"I don't think anyone said that the ""majority"" were over 61 because the average was 61. The general idea is that probably something close to half are 61 years old, and 25% are above that and 25% below that."
August 2015,I think most luxury owners also cheap out... not just on their rental/loaners...
August 2015,"I always put premium gas in the ""free-loaners"" the dealer provides; my wife does too. It never even occurred to me that putting anything less in the tank was an option. Force of habit, I guess.Yet, even if the allegation that Premium Car owners chintz out on the gas they put in the FREE loaner cars, the engine management computer probably does do a decent job of preventing any real damage.I can't remember the last time I put anything but premium gas in ANY car I was driving -- really, force of habit. I would liken this to having a kid with a peanut allergy, I would just automatically avoid anything I thought might have even heard the word peanut.Sad indictment of folks if they really do put regular in the S4 or A6 or X3 they have just been loaned.What a world, what a world."
August 2015,"Only knowing the mean does not provide enough information to declare that ""about half"" of the buyers are old codgers. To have a really good understanding of what the majority of ages is, you would also need to know the mode, median and range -- to get a better idea of the number(s) that occurs most often. The issue with mean is that a bunch of 45-ish year olds buying a certain car would return an ""average age"" around 45, as you would expect; but, throw in a couple of purchases by some 25 year olds and a few more over 75 and well, depending on the size of the population, you could skew below or above 45 even though the population as individuals is ""over half"" 45-ish.I was quite surprised to see the average age of BMW buyers was ""THAT OLD!"" But, you see, I've been going to the BMW Store here in Cincinnati at least since the mid 1980's, and my impression is that the show room is full of shoppers who are ""really really young"" -- and I have always presumed well-to-do. I went the Audi route when all my friends went with BMW's because #1 the Audi brand had quattro and #2, I always felt you could buy the next higher line of Audi for the same price as the lower line BMW, so I thought the value and performance leader was always Audi (you could say, too, I guess, I was, ahem, more frugal than my BMW lovin' friends).But back to the math -- an average age of 60 does not mean the majority of buyers are over 60. There isn't enough information to know, if all you know is the ""average."" Mean, Mode, Median, Range and while were at it Standard Deviation, on the other hand would paint a much clearer picture of the number of ""old timers"" buying a particular automotive brand.I have one more data point -- every Corvette that I have seen FOR YEARS seems to be piloted by a driver who either looks like Bill Clinton or Bill Cosby (speaking ONLY of a certain appearance that suggests age, not lasciviousness.) But the car seems to be marketed to a much younger person, if you have ever seen an ad or brochure."
August 2015,"I'd concur that there is a very good chance for it. Similar with rental cars - I recently got a PUG Mazda MX-5. After I refueled it with PUG (it was a long mileage rental), the car got much more lively. I'm pretty sure it was full of RUG."
August 2015,"No, I don't have any actual proof, but I just know how people are."
August 2015,"Anecdotal experience.. from all of the luxury buyers that ask, ""Do I have to run Premium in my XYZ luxury car?"", would lead me to believe that's true.."
August 2015,You have data to prove this?
August 2015,"Well sure it means that about half (more or less) of the buyers are old codgers, yes--that's what an average is, an arithmetic mean....presuming you think 60+ is very old."
August 2015,"Since the computer adjusts for the octane, it really shouldn't be an issue."
August 2015,Well the average age of a Bugatti buyer is 60. Does that mean that only old codgers buy them?
August 2015,"MB always seems to have a decent amount of trunk money available. Dealers purchase ""lot queens"" for their service department, punch them as ""sold,"" pocket the incentive money, use the cars for service loaners for 5K to 10K miles, & then sell them 6 months down the road for a good price compared to brand new at a nice, tidy profit. My only issue with buying an ex-service loaner German car is the fact that you know the majority of people put RUG (87) in the car before they returned it even though it requires PUG (91+)."
August 2015,Well that's good but keep in mind that age 61 is still an *average*.
August 2015,Well Lincoln has brought their age down from 65 in 2012 so things are moving in a positive manner.

August 2015,"Sometimes I just cringe when someone calls me sir -- I think it heralds the beginning of the end.I was driving into the office today and made an attempt (1/2 hour commute) to note the age of the driver of every Mercedes I saw. I only saw E's and S's, but I did see a double digit number. I did not make any attempt to categorize by gender or apparent ethnicity. My memory says I saw only two ethnic groups represented ""black and white"" -- and of course two genders. What struck me was the apparent fact that the E's and S's were all AWD versions and were all driven by what certainly appeared to me to be people beyond their 50's. Is this observation in any way statistically significant? Probably not, but it could be, at least, an interesting data-point. I drive through mostly upper-middle income neighborhoods on my commute, FWIW.Before you think I've gone off some rail here, I was having a conversation with a friend about cars and the subject of Cadillac came up -- his comment was that they remain cars that attract ""mature"" owners, retired folk, apparently in his view. The article above about the efforts of the new Cadillac President to change the behavior (mentality) of dealers made me think he was onto something. Cadillac dealers don't act like Audi, BMW and Mercedes dealers -- and they still paint prices on the windshields of the cars on their lots (I make it a practice to avoid dealers who paint prices on the windshield of the cars on their lot, I fear them, frankly.)My perception is that BMW has the youngest drivers of the German Premium Crowd, closely followed by Audi (but that may be because of the Q5's success -- and that it would appear Q5's have a relatively young owner-set.) Audi, too, with the A3/S3 may be trolling for ever younger owners.But, that still leaves me with the observation -- this morning -- that the E and S class Mercs were AWD and all driven by, apparently, Baby Boomers, current Xer's and Millennial's weren't participating this AM, at least.Here I am 64, driving an S4 -- I guess I should be in what -- an A6 or CTS or perhaps a 5 series or should it be an XTS Cadillac. Wondering what, if any, studies of the age of owners exists -- with all the focus on Millennials and away from us Boomers, these days, it would seem to be some valuable data.Ever notice the current crop of Buick ads wherein the ""little ol' lady"" remarks ""Oh MY!"" when she is told she's in a new Buick. Is that a nod toward the past or is that a convoluted way of suggesting that new Buicks will be appreciated by those of a certain maturity and perhaps even attractive to them?Wondering if part of the issue confronting some car mfgrs, could be they need to make their cars seem to be desired by Millennials.Maybe on the way home, I'll count BMW drivers."
August 2015,"So I guess the star on the hood overcomes anything. Essentially nobody else can get away with that, not even BMW - their version of 328/335 with the plastic seat covers usually become lot queens, at least here (can't speak of 320, as those are obviously different kind of buyers, they may go for it much more often)."
August 2015,"Having met you, is that a ""figurative"" fit or a ""literal"" fit?"
August 2015,I sat in a new style C (used). Looked nice to me. Really liked the interior.
August 2015,"I'll be a dissenting voice here and say I like the styling of the new C-class. I think it offers a different, elegant alternative to the comparable BMW and Audi. I do agree it looks a bit too much like the CLA, but not sure that's a bad thing. @nyccarguy - I'm with you that the sport package design elements and wheels add a lot to the overall aesthetic. Of course, when I was looking at the S4 and 428i this past weekend, we went right by a MB dealer and I decided not to stop and look at the C-class. So not sure what that says. I suppose I appreciate the look of the car, but not sure it's a fit for me."

August 2015,"The purchase of the S3 for my wife a couple weeks ago may have accelerated my plans for the Mazda3 being a fun ""in-between"" car. Test drove several S4s this past weekend (couple used ones and a couple new ones, manual and automatic). Also looked at a 328d wagon and a 428i gran coupe (x drive). Wife and I both have historically been very pro-BMW. But ours have almost all been more ""enthusiast-oriented"" (wife had a wagon much like dino's (m-sport manual)), and neither of us are getting too excited about the current models. The 328d wagon I drove felt somewhat ordinary. To be fair, it wasn't as equipped as we would like, but nevertheless it had a sticker of $55k. The 428i I really enjoyed and do love the body style for its looks and functionality. The one I drove was a sport-line and pretty well equipped for the low $50k's. If I really checked the boxes for all the options I would like, it gets to the high $50k's pretty quickly. So having said all that, I'm probably leaning more toward an S4. It's actually quite the value in comparison to some of the other cars I looked at. I think they've done a good job updating the tech in the car to keep it up to date in that way for such an outgoing model. I find it endearing that a car that's been around for so many years is still holding its own against the competition (and then some). And, it's nice Audi still offers the choice of the manual and auto. If I can hold out for awhile, I may still wait to see the new model."
August 2015,"I read once that BMW's styling is based on 3-series and it is ""blow-up"" to their bigger models, including X-series (except of course their smallest models), whereas MB is shrink-down from the S-class. Apparently, the former works better, as it is easier to scale the aesthetics up than down."
August 2015,"I think you're right. Perhaps something changed, or I checked something too much. It is low 50s, indeed, which is similar to a loaded 328. BMW has galloped their prices recently well beyond what it used to be. I remember being absolutely shocked first time I optioned one to a comparable equipment with my E91 wagon. It was something like five grand more on the sticker and still couple of things missing. Admittedly, mine was last year of production, with several options thrown in gratis, or well discounted, but still, the difference was enormous. So I may stand corrected on this. It is annoying though, when local Benz dealer in my area have absolutely no faith in their customers' real wealth, if all they order is MB Tex on C-class (also GLA, CLA). Even E-class comes with MB Tex standard and large percentage of units on dealers' lots have it, which I find absolutely ridiculous. It apparently works. I wonder if that's something people don't realize until it's too late, or something people know, but don't care."
August 2015,"I agree.. the previous one was striking... It's like they tried to make this one look like the CLA, and it worked... it's not a good look."
August 2015,"I also don't like the looks of the new C class. I've actually thought about getting a couple year old C-class at a deal rather than the new ""ugly"" one new."
August 2015,I'm too am not a big fan of the S Class shrinky dink styling.The local purveyor of MB's has over (20) 2013 C300 4 Matic all in the 13-17K mile range for about $32K. Not bad for a CPO unit IMHO.And yes they all have MB Tex.
August 2015,"Dino, I've been on a couple of test drives in the new C Class. Pretty impressive, IMHO. Certainly the interior is the best of the class bunch. I do agree about the MBTex vs Leather. Some say you can't tell the difference. I certainly can, and it's not even close. That being the case, the real leather of the one I drove with the sport seats was of high quality. I do think that the Turbo V6 is a bit of overkill in the car, but it does compare favorably to a 335i or S4. Perhaps that's because the turbo 4 is so smooth and responsive in the C300. The C400 I drove came in at the mid $50s. The C300 in the low $50s. Pricewise, I don't think the Mercedes is disadvantaged at all against the 3 Series or A/S Audis similarly equipped.The dealer that I talked to said he'd take 10% off MSRP off any C he had in stock. That was a couple of months ago. So, not sure if it's still the case, but that makes a very, very nice C Class price extremely competitive.NYC...one of the ones I test drove was a metallic grey C300 sport with the lip spoiler and front chin spoiler. It had red leather sport seats and the open pore wood accoutrements....very sharp. It came in at the high $40s. Dealer said the same as you....about $3,500 more for the same car with the V6 bi-turbo. Personally, I'd save the $3,500 and stick with the 4 pot....and that's saying something about how good the turbo 4 is. In all frankness, I am growing to love all these Turbo 4s these days, regardless of manufacturer. They're really torquey and provide excellent MPG."
August 2015,"MB Tex may be looking upscale, but it ain't. A friend of mine has an older C-class and it positively does not breath, giving you hot and sweaty feel in summer days, which is half of the time in Florida. Combine it with absolutely ridiculous price MB charges for the leather seats and any other significant option and very low in-stock availability (for that reason) and I have no interest in anything Benz. I once entered building C-class, but existed at around 55 grand for C300 (didn't even finish just yet) and 60+ grand for C400. No, thank you. Compared with those, 3-series is a picture of bargain-priced value (it really isn't, but in comparison to MB everything looks like one). Sure, C-class looks better inside, but almost nobody buys 3-series for their interiors (if anything, those have always been deterrent rather lure). C-class is bigger, but that's not necessarily a good thing in ELLPS - those are not bough per pound or cubic foot. It's a fine vehicle, if you like that sort of thing, but it is priced just silly. If you break down pricing to the car and the logo on the hood, it seems to me they charge for the star about double or triple of what BMW does (and admittedly BMW charges double or triple of what Acura does). In other words, the star on the hood costs literally thousands of dollars. I wonder how much dealers sell it for as a spare part MB sometimes gives to dealers very substantial cash incentives once the novelty wears off and they are pretty good in hiding them from the public, so the brand stays protected, but even with that I'm not interested."
August 2015,"What options did you do?The MB Tex is of high quality and the contrasting stitching make it look very upscale, BMW could learn a thing about that.I think MB did a good job with the new C class, I haven't driven one yet, but will in the next year."
August 2015,"Overall I'm not a huge fan of the current body style C-Class.  The baby S Class styling is too much.  I don't like the current S class styling either.  However, I've always got my eye open.  On my way to the beach this afternoon I saw a gorgeous black/black C300 4Matic Sport sedan.  It had the lip spoiler on the back, the sporty looking 5 spoke wheels, the led lighting package.  Very sharp looking.  So I just built one online.  Given that I'm a man of adding few options these days, I just opted for what I thought I needed to make the C300 my own.  $47K & change sticker price.  I'm sure the 241 horsepower turbo 4 would be plenty motivation for my purposes, given the fact that my daily driver pumps out a whopping 175 horsepower.I exited my C300 4 Matic Sport sedan build and started a new build.  Only this time I built a C400 Sport 4Matic sedan.  For about an extra $3500 with the same options, you get a 329 horsepower BiTurbo V6.  I like the sound of that."
August 2015,"The biggest issue I see is production cycle and spare parts. While it may be cheaper to retool than it used to be, it is still expensive. Moreover, by law of many countries the manufacturers have to keep spare parts of their models for many years, I think it is ten or so. Increase number of variations and shorten the lifespan and the cost goes up, perhaps disproportionately."
August 2015,"The automakers would much rather have you buy a new car for tens of thousands rather than plug and play a few modules and keep your current vehicle for a few more years. The technology may ""be there"" to do new things sooner, but it's certainly not a no-cost proposition to continually re-tool parts as plug in replacements for previous ones. And it adds a lot of logistical complexity, too. Your headlight goes out - do you want one non-LED replacement, or two of the new LED equivalents? Let's stock duplicate sets of parts for all the different vintages and variants and versions of parts that are usable in the same basic model of car...etc. And the engineers retrofitting the LED lights to the existing Audi vehicles, the new LTE module to the existing vehicles, the new CPU to the existing vehicles - well they won't be working on designing the next model coming out in a few years then... unless you hire excess engineers for that...The Apple watch (and Android Wear as well) are designed to be mostly peripheral devices to your phones. The battery technology just isn't there to have much power in the watch and have it still run all day."
August 2015,"Opportunity LostMy suggestion was for a cycle of ~4-years, not 1. Also, the experience of driving the automobile is, as I noted, largely based on software and circuit boards. Engine bays can almost certainly house either the tried and true and tired 3.7L (Infiniti, e.g.) or a new cleaner, more efficient and more effective powerplant (make the new stuff available now, don't wait for a new body style, i.e.) -- the point is I was only partially speaking of ""retooling."" Moreover, now that machines make machines, the cost of retooling has decreased.But again, my request is for a compression of time for updates to the brain, heart and lungs (so to speak) of the automobile; later, or less frequently if there is a retooling argument at play, the ritual ""skin rejuvenation"" and lipo-suction can be scheduled.Let me give a few examples of ""improvements"" that probably don't required new sheet metal to deploy (and I'll use Audi as my poster-child since I am familiar with that brand):o Audi will wait to offer LED headlights until the B9 model (A4), but the technology has been in the ""C's"" (A6) for a couple of years. I can think of no legitimate reason this feature was withheld from the market.o Top-view monitor, as much, or more, of an advance as the rear-view camera, has been around for years -- Audi will wait for the B9 class debuts before they offer this.o Driver configurable dash (EFT tech), it too will have to wait for the next generation caro 4G LTE internet connectivity -- also will have to wait, and no upgrade path is offered for older 3G radios buried in the MMI's guts. This ought to be like opening up your laptop, pulling the hard drive and replacing it with an SSD (all for $150 or less) and enjoying the performance of a no-moving-parts storage system without having to buy an entirely new PCThe list of features that could make the car perform better, be safer, have better in-car entertainment, navigation and driver assist aids do not require much, if any, retooling, but they would allow owners to keep their car's systems, on a selective basis, as current as the owner wants.Perhaps this has little to do with capability or cost (to both the mfgr and the customer), perhaps it really is a way to compel (or at least impel) ""the market"" (you and me, perhaps, at the micro level) to trade in, trade up or just ""get new"" -- perhaps the status quo is as we know it today, to imbue aftermarket providers (SEMA) with endless opportunities to sell their wares. Who knows perhaps the mfgrs and SEMA companies are in a symbiotic relationship (I doubt they actually collude, however).It just frustrates the ever-lovin' crap out of me to be almost unable to keep my cars as current as possible. I'd like to be able to pick and choose some of this year's features and incorporate them into my otherwise fine 3-year old.Seems like you can put new wheels and tires on your car with ease -- and W/T combinations can provide performance, safety and styling improvements -- I just believe we have reached a point in time and technology where we ought to be able to do the same thing with the ""technology package"" most cars come standard with, these days (speaking of the PREMIUM CLASS, of course, for this and other posts).A really big clue, to me at least, as to the lost opportunity mfgrs are ""enjoying"" is revealed over on audiworld.com where members breathlessly enthuse about the arrival (yesterday or the day before) of their new cars, then, in the next sentence, conclude ""Let the modifications begin.""Lost opportunity if you ax me.Sort-of unrelated: I finally met my very first non-Apple employee who was wearing an Apple Watch. As she explained it to me, it sounded pretty cool -- until she told me, that if you wanted to do almost anything other than tell time, you had to have your iPhone within about 30-50 feet of your wrist; meaning, effectively, you have to carry the phone to get much, if any, use out of the watch's smart features. I'm hereby volunteering to have an iPhone implanted -- with a charging plug inconspicuously positioned somewhere on my torso. You see: I'm looking to have empty pockets -- while they're at it, they can implant my smart car-key too (Audi keys are about the size of a small potato, for god's sake); I'd rather the car key be included with the car as a stylish and functional Mont Blanc pen. Seriously, I'm starting to list from the weight of all of the ""remotes"" and do-dads and clips and cards I carry in my pockets. Somebody help me, somebody help us all."
August 2015,"Cars are over 100 years into their evolution and other than electronics, don't evolve at the same pace. Smart phones are like 8 years old (if we count the iPhone as the first ""modern"" smartphone; a bit longer if you count earlier ""windows mobile"" phones). So of course the pace of evolution is much faster.Auto volumes are also a lot lower. So it's too expensive to retool every year - unless you want to pay triple the cost. And a car represents a much higher fraction of the average owner's income, so it is not going to be replaced at the same pace as your phone.Regarding software and automakers, this is a very new area for them. They are not that experienced in software at the consumer level. Recent security exploits show how far the automakers need to go to get to the same level of sophistication that Apple or Microsoft are at for their operating systems."
August 2015,"8 Years? Really?Check out this headline: ""Knowledge Doubling Every 12 Months, Soon to be Every 12 Hours""!While you're at it, check out any number of sources on the subject line ""Moore's law"": The observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit has doubled approximately every two years.""Buckminster Fuller created the “Knowledge Doubling Curve”; he noticed that until 1900 human knowledge doubled approximately every century. By the end of World War II knowledge was doubling every 25 years. Today things are not as simple as different types of knowledge have different rates of growth. For example, nanotechnology knowledge is doubling every two years and clinical knowledge every 18 months. But on average human knowledge is doubling every 13 months. According to IBM, the build out of the “internet of things” will lead to the doubling of knowledge every 12 hours.""OK, so where oh where is this going?This is going to the subject of why the refresh cycles of cars (German ones at least) seems to be (especially for Audi and BMW) 8 years. Sure there are ""mid-cycle"" refreshes, but often what happens is some minor styling tweaks, perhaps an MPG increase and certainly an increase in ""content"" -- but, often content increases annually (sometimes for a bump in price) anyway, or at least there is a rejiggering of option package features.What if Apple came out with a truly new phone once every 8 years? What if Lenovo or Dell only coughed up a new PC or server even as long as every 4 years? There are numerous other examples across many products and brands that would literally just drop dead if they didn't substantially change (one likes to think enhance and improve) their products much more frequently than 8 or 4 or even 2 years.Given current technology advancements, check that, given the speed (and frequency) of technology advancements how is it that several significant car manufacturers only really offer more than evolutionary changes every 8-years?And while incremental changes continue in years 2,3,4,5,6,7 and 8, it is -- as far as I can tell -- literally impossible to upgrade your year 2 version with year 6 features, for any realistic sum of money (and in some cases it is less money to replace your 5 year old BMW with a new one than even dream of [analogy] pulling out the old SIMM chip and replacing it with a new one.)So much of our cars DNA is based on software and a circuit board, why not allow the customer who wants to pony up the funds to upgrade his/her car's ""infotainment"" system for the one found in a newer version of his A4 or 5 series?Is the only reason to not support an upgrade path the desire to sell new cars? Why can you keep your 20 year old aircraft current with the latest and greatest avionics, but your can't upgrade your 2 year old car's 3G wi-fi to 4G LTE for love nor money?And the refresh cycle at 8-years? Really? Why does it take 8 years between ""versions"" of these cars? That time frame seems to me to be based on the past, not the currently reality. I think it is time for the refresh cycle to be shortened -- I'd say, based on where things stand today, cutting the cycle in half would pretty much be a catch up move, not a pull ahead move.The days of rendering umpteen versions of a new design in clay, destroying them and doing it all over again, are inefficient -- so much so that if anyone is actually still doing this, it would have to be almost literally ineffective.I've seen some very impressive 3D-printing demonstrations that would seem to eliminate such by-gone days' practices -- the model upgrade can be dreamed up, coded and the printer turned on; model change costs can be slashed as can the time from thought to manufacture to market. No way 8-years is required to recoup the development costs.Computer controlled machines can be changed to produce new body stampings, etc and every day it is not impossible to believe some engineer somewhere has figured out yet another tweak to improve both power and MPG out of the internal combustion engine -- to say nothing of alternative power-trains.So, today's car is part mechanical, part computational, part software, part hardware -- I've kept my iPhone current, and so far each upgrade has been a real improvement. This technology is in our cars and it should be similarly updatable (the time frame, the cycle) and notable improvements should be regular and frequent -- not for free, mind you, but this 8-year cycle between serious product upgrades and updates is a practice that needs to be abandoned as soon as possible."

August 2015,"It's not about the age, it's about customer experience philosophy. My feels is Cadillac's dealers are mentally closer to Toyota's, Vokswagen's than to Lexus's, or Audi's. Part of that is the past, part is the financial structure and the way they are are compensated by the parent company."
August 2015,"For the most part, the typical Cadillac dealer is simply not prepared to sell cars to customers that still have all their own teeth..."

August 2015,"Another story on Cadillac:http://www.autonews.com/article/20150807/RETAIL/150809864/cadillac-works-to-revise-dealer-incentivesMike Colias RSS feed Automotive NewsAugust 7, 2015 - 1:54 pm ETELKHART LAKE, Wis. -- Two main elements of Johan de Nysschen’s plan to rehabilitate Cadillac’s image are to tighten dealers’ inventories and quash their sell-at-any-cost mentality.There’s a big problem though: Cadillac’s dealer-incentive programs today are designed to do just the opposite. One makes cash payouts for growing sales; the other attaches up to $700 in dealer bonus money to every vehicle they order from the factory.De Nysschen, Cadillac’s president, says those programs must change for dealers to adopt a true luxury mindset, one based on an engaging customer experience, rather than sales volume.“The business model has been structured more for the bigger brands inside General Motors, rather than the small Cadillac brand,” de Nysschen said here at a test drive event for the media. “The luxury business is different.”He said Cadillac is in talks with its national dealer council “to develop the next generation of what these programs should look like for Cadillac.”It’s an example of the obstacles de Nysschen faces in reshaping Cadillac’s retail network into something that more closely resembles those of German luxury brands such as BMW or Audi. Most of Cadillac’s more than 900 dealerships are hard-wired to carry far more inventory than other luxury stores, often moving the metal through deep discounts.A Midwest Cadillac dealer, who didn’t want to be identified discussing factory business, believes it would be difficult for many dealers to fathom an incentive program that’s not tied to sales performance.“There’s only one thing that matters, and it’s selling more cars,” said the dealer, who said he sells a couple dozen Cadillacs a month. “I did not come in here today to buy more digital stuff for the showroom.”(more at the link)"
August 2015,"Personally, I like Bob Lutz. His Book...CAR GUYS VS BEAN COUNTERS is probably one of the top 10 business books I've ever read. Lessons there for other companies outside the auto industry. I tend to read his columns and listen to his interviews.He's an ego maniac, without a doubt. And, sometimes I scratch my head at some of what he says. But, I think he's 83 now. And, as such, most people I know that are entering or are in that age range pretty much don't care what others think. So, they say whatever pops in their head.I'll forgive some of that based on giving due respect. Overall, he's a pretty bright guy.He sort of painted his time at GM as him against the big car establishment. Not sure how much is true and how much is bluster. But, he got the company to take chances (i.e. ""new"" GTO, Solstice and Sky....too bad they were products of failed divisions). He derided the Aztec. He tried to move GM. Wasn't entirely successful, but is willing to admit he wasn't, too.Colleague bought a new IS 350 F Sport. I've always liked those. I test drove one a year or so ago. If anything, I like them more after seeing his (darkish grey with red leather interior). Hard to fault the build of it....probably the best I've seen. Still, a little cramped. Maybe that's because I've been used to driving cars a bit bigger than the IS. Seats are wonderful. Just a very, very nice car that goes well, drives well, and is built extremely well. His MSRP sticker said $49K....quite loaded up. He said they discounted his by about $2,500. Pretty good value for $46.5K. Hard to say that about a Lexus."
August 2015,He should have been more clever when at GM.
August 2015,"He says really good things and really dumb things. He's a hip-shooter, so it's bound to come out badly now and then. Probably his worst gaffe was to challenge Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson on climate change on national TV. His argument was that climate change was a complete hoax and isn't happening at all because he owns a house in the Florida Keys and it's not underwater. Yeah Bob...okaaaay......I did like his quote about the government trying to achieve better fuel economy by forcing industry to build smaller cars, which he likened to trying to make Americans less fat by issuing them smaller sized clothing. That was pretty clever."
August 2015,"Wow, I wonder why he gets his own column (as in don't they know?) and why he seems to be quoted so often. I had really almost no idea of who he was/is, but his style is somewhat Donald Trump-like.I do like his column, but it seems he perhaps should be taken with a grain."
August 2015,"I can't really say. I know in politics one can go far without high intelligence, but you must have a superior kind of rat-like cunning to survive. So maybe that's it."
August 2015,Perhaps he's not as bright as you are giving him credit?
August 2015,"Lutz sometimes says things that display an incredible level of ignorance. Inasmuch as he can't possible be a stupid man, I have to assume his ignorance is willful, and he simply doesn't want to know the facts behind what he says at times."
August 2015,"I can chime in here. Two things - he was part of the GM failed management team and was always making excuses for their mediocre-to-shoddy vehicles. And he laughed off the Prius and hybrids in general, even though a few years later GM was scrambling with THREE different types of hybrids that were all going to save the world - the ""mild"" hybrid (I think all of those are discontinued now),- the ""two-mode hybrid"" (I think all of those are also discontinued now), - the Volt (not discontinued, but selling nowhere near original projections....and also wasn't he the designing force between those great successes the Solstice and Sky?Seems that he is more hot air than any real merit."
August 2015,"I agree the lease deals are great on the Q. I originally shopped a used G37S RWD but before I could blink, it was gone! Hard to find in stock RWD S models here in NJ.I give a little ride comfort for the extra cornering anyday. We just wear mouth guards on the side roads! My wife has a CX-9 and it's absolutely wonderful when the road bends with the 20"" shoes (given it's weight). The ride suffers but she loves it! She let's me drive it sometimes!"
August 2015,"I love the way the Q50 S looks with those 19"" wheels and lip spoiler. However, the higher trim package coupled with the absolutely horrendous road conditions here in the North East would steer me towards the base model. I follow the ""lease questions"" board here and am amazed at how cheap these cars lease for compared to their MSRP."
August 2015,"""But what is it about Lutz's column that sparked the vitriol? ""Lutz was part of the upper management team that run GM to the ground and he never admitted to anything. He keeps talking from a position of the industry expert, but on any inquiries about his role in the GM's demise he has gazillion excuses, or acts like nothing really happened."
August 2015,"nyccarguy - Q50 has been outstanding so far. I like the infotainment and not too difficult to use after a few weeks. Can't figure why heated seats don't come standard in the base model, though. The S has brought me the sport suspension/brakes even though AWD and the sport mode tightens up the trans shifts quite nicely. I chose the non-DAS steering. Very nice package for $455/month lease, indeed. Love the blip-throttle downshift, also.I used the eco-mode for about 10 miles!"
August 2015,"Crazy Miranda (Jefferson Airplane)OK, so I read several posts that essentially dismiss Bob Lutz's opinions, essentially just stating that we shouldn't put much stock in Mr. Lutz's perspective.I would be the first to agree that critical thinking is appropriate, and that we shouldn't all turn into Crazy Miranda's or even just accept so and so at their word, ""because.""But what is it about Lutz's column that sparked the vitriol? Generally speaking, his remarks while certainly at least somewhat debate worthy, didn't seem to be ""crazy.""He did retire some 5 years ago but as recently as a late 2014 Washington Post article/interview, he certainly appears to command more than a patronizing amount of respect.Was/is ""your"" dismissal of his comments based on merit or based on some belief that Lutz doesn't know what he's talking about?I would certainly agree with him that KIA is doing one helluva job at design -- but, of course, that much is totally subjective and for every compliment one could dig up, there would undoubtedly be a barb decrying KIA's designs as totally uninspired and derivative.Just wondering why the animosity toward Lutz?"
August 2015,"It's going to take a lot more than a new advertising agency to help Cadillac. IMHO the brand, like GM and Chevrolet, is tainted by a lot of history. They should rebrand themselves completely."

August 2015,"Wow -- well, like they say, ""aim for the stars.""For those of me who care about these kind of things -- headline:""Audi sets 55th straight monthly U.S. record with 20.8% gain in July 2015!""If we start going back those 55 months, I believe we would come to a period where De Nysschen was at the healm -- the fact that things kept humming along after his departure is, I think, NOT an indication that the top guy doesn't matter, but rather an indication of how the products are perceived by the market.As I dust off my graduate school marketing textbook (which is probably, by now woefully out of date), all evidence suggests EITHER to raise prices or increase market share by some method that leaves the perception of ""big bucks"" undamaged. My leasing guru says: sub-vent the leases like there's no tomorrow, get the current product out and seen by the market; meanwhile work behind the scenes on getting products to the market that people WANT (translation Audi Q3, Q5 and Q7 rivals and BMW X1, X3, X4, X5 and X6 rivals).If you ax me, the money spent bringing the all electric Caddy to market was a nice idea, but I don't see it as helpful to what ought to be the bread and butter ATS.Isn't it true that for Audi THE meat and potatoes car is the A4 as the 3 series is for BMW? Shouldn't Cadillac at least consider doing whatever it takes to get ""a lot more"" ATS's in the hands of customers by almost any method (sub-vented leases being a good tool, typically)?Or is it that the cars themselves just aren't ""gettin' it done?"" So no matter what you do within reason, some people will still say ""The Emperor Has no Clothes.""One last random thought, the Audi dealer I shop is owned by a group that also owns a Cadillac dealership a couple blocks away -- so naturally, we do tend to browse that dealership since they know my wife and me as long time loyal ""dealer group"" customers. I have priced cars at the dealership and they are as stubborn as can be about the price they will use to run the numbers, whereas the Audi group seems willing to put the best deal on the table first. The experience at the Audi dealership is what I call horizontal sales, due to the fact that the sales staff is so laid back you have to wake them to get them to sell you the car; the Cadillac dealership still seems to employ a technique from yesteryear, with salesreps dressed in clothes one size too small and largely lacking in product knowledge beyond what they can glean just by looking at the sticker. The approach at the Cadillac dealership is, well, disappointing, even as the cars are getting somewhat more interesting and competitive.Just an observation -- a data point that may or may not be an outlier."

I think it's possible any of them could pull out a narrow win for first place. Despite its big successes, it's a long drop to Audi, and then Acura is not far behind. Caddy seems safe at # 6 for now.But for a brand that for 70+ years was the undisputed king of luxury sales in America, it's been a dramatic fall over the last 20 years."

August 2015,"Precisely; besides, the RS will only be built in Der Fatherland!!!"
August 2015,"Yes. It seems like some Cadillac dealers are literally begging for mercy. And it seems like they're not getting any. I imagine that low volume dealers in smaller cities have helped enlarge Cadillac's overall numbers for decades. But now management might look down at those dealers, which might not be glitzy, and might not have customers who can pay prices higher than BMW's for today's Caddys."
August 2015,"It's not just reliablity, it is also parts costs and dealer costs. While Ford's reliability has been pretty poor lately, even a more reliable German car could easily cost more, especially if you are out of your warranty period."
August 2015,"Absolutely and I said this in these forums during the BK. The GM fans would still have bought the newly renamed GM, and the GM non-fans would be MUCH more likely to buy a vehicle from a revamped company that wasn't named GM. Remember Valujet? They renamed to AirTran and became quite successful until bought by Southwest, in spite of a bad crash and maintenance problems. The name change wiped a lot of the memory away."
August 2015,"Looking at the numbs above Buick jumps off the charts a bit- with that being said remember when gm cut the brand - lost Pontiac and 2 other brands that sucked. Ford sacked Mercury, Christler the worst of the bunch got rid of Plymouth and struggled only to be sold for pennies. The anticipation of a potential slowdown ... The problems with unions... The financial crisis bout to happen ... The end of the good old giveaways at dealerships. gM has to smarten up. Slice a brand or 2 if needed....toyota prob will beat them to the punch again"
August 2015,The only thing going into a ditch in the immediate future will be a number of Cadillac dealers. Heads are going to roll pretty soon I think.
August 2015,"Well, GM knows not how to use pricing in their favor for cars...for trucks, yes. They really aren't a car company anymore and Caddy is the proof they really struggle with that lost ""standard""."

August 2015,"I agree, if Ford is smart, they'll ensure the Focus RS is reliable and durable. If they don't give a damn, well, anything is possible. I guess my main point is I'd be worried (and I think others out there too) about the reliability and support of a nearly $40K Ford whereas with Audi they've already gained my trust, and others probably feel the same way given Audi's recent growth. I'd probably be worried about it with Benz too, a bit less so with BMW. Part of the reason is BMW offers free maintenance for a long time. The other part is I see a lot of BMW's at HPDE sessions/events and they don't seem to require tow trucks or early retirements during the weekend."
August 2015,"I think a big mistake was made keeping the Cadillac/GM names/brands around. They should have renamed and re-badged everything to try and get a cleaner slate from previously burned buyers. They should have followed the example set by GMAC, which became ALLY and they didn't exactly advertise the fact. Change your name, don't use any letters from your previous name (OK; Ally uses the A in GMAC; vowels will be forgiven). So think up a name that doesn't have the letters ""GM"" or ""Cdllc"" in it!"
August 2015,"I wouldn't be so sure that Audi, BMW, or Benz is much more reliable than Focus RS. It might, but it might not."
August 2015,"The reason the leases are expensive is because you have a high inflated MSRP selling price joining the reality of how much they are actually worth at the end of the lease. Someone has to pay for that, in the past it has been tax payers, but most think another bailout won't be granted, so you can't rely on that anymore."
August 2015,"I whole heartedly agree. Anyone who has ever had a car where reliability and durability caused great and frequent concern will always be very concerned with reliability and durability.For instance, you might only pay $37K for a Focus RS in the near future, but would reliability woes end up costing you more than you'd pay for a $50K German car in the long run? My math says it is possible; if you value your time."
August 2015,"My guess is that he was thinking that he was about the get the biggest payday of his life. I bet he's making several times what he used to make at Audi. I'm sure he really believes in what he's doing, misguided though it may be. And he'll be rich enough that he'll never need to work another day in his life—even as he drives Cadillac into the ditch.I think in 1-3 years GM might well get rid of him with a golden parachute. But by that time the damage will have been done...."
August 2015,"Well, there is probably a decent separation between ELR and Volt in terms of almost everything, but motor. However, it still does not get you to 70 grand."
August 2015,for those talking caddy and messing with pricing you are spot on - the ELR is a perfect example of it- car is a rebadged Chevy and is 70k - I would bet I will never see another one
August 2015,"Wonder if De Nysschen sometimes looks back at leaving Audi and thinks to himself, ""What in the wide-wide world of sports was I thinking?"" He was with Audi for 19 years and things were going along swimmingly weren't they?I don't know what he possibly could have done in the short time he was with Infiniti, and I guess he did want to live in New York, but he better work some magic on Cadillac -- soon.Perhaps the phrase is, ""if anyone can, he can.""

August 2015,"I think, too, there is merit in the observation that Cadillac doesn't have enough CUV's to compete with the likes of Audi and BMW. And, despite my own rejection of the notion of buying an X6 when I could have an even better equipped X5 were I to spend X6 money, well, BMW has the X1,X3,X4,X5 & X6 and some ""M"" variations to spice things up even more. Cadillac has what, an Escalade? Were I in charge, I think I would -- for a while -- go for the ""land-grab"" approach to market share. I am certain that is exactly what Lexus did when they came out with a car that lured Mercedes shoppers into the showroom and had these shoppers test drive a Lexus that essentially did everything a Mercedes did but for some 20% less money. Today, I believe the big Merc and the big Lexus cars sell for similar sums and it is accepted.My friend always bought 7-series, for a long long long time; eventually he bought an LS400 (or whatever the 7-series sized car from Lexus was/is), bought another one after that, too. I ran into him taking delivery of an Audi A8L recently. My how times have changed.I assume he might, someday, consider a Cadillac -- but for the kind of money that this list of cars has cost him over the years, I have to assume he wouldn't consider any Cadillac worth some number beginning with an 8.Bad as things are for Cadillac, imagine the uphill battle Lincoln faces.Yikes!"
August 2015,"I wonder if it would have been any different had they simply named the ATS the new CTS and come up with a different name for what is now the CTS. Of course, then people would be up in arms that the CTS shrunk. Oh well."
August 2015,"Agreed - CTS price move should have taken several increments, not one big leap. Hubris? Miscalculation? I wonder if they asked anybody who isn't their relative or on their payroll. To me even a 12-year-old kid could have told them it was a bad idea. Those corporate echo chambers are just like cable news shows - everybody nodding and reinforcing each other how smart they all are (which is obvious, as they all agree). Then the reality strikes - elections for one, or sales of others. Brilliant theories fall apart - but of course, nobody admits to anything, they all have ready twenty-five excuses, why people who voted against them didn't really mean it, or why people who bought something else were somehow duped."
August 2015,"Cadillac's push to raise the price of the CTS to -- I assume -- 5-series territory is not based on a bad theory, it is just that it was [obviously] too early. A CTS at a 3-series price probably could have/should have continued for a bit longer. Those wanting a CTS/5-series sized car were, I think, heading to Cadillac for ""premium+value"" -- isn't this what Lexus did from day-one? Now, a buyer with a 3-series budget goes into the Cadillac showroom, thinking he/she might drive out with a CTS and gets a bit of a shock upon seeing the MSRP of the CTS. I imagine the buyer isn't interested in an ATS after his plans to drive off in an American 5-series for a 3-series price have been dashed. I would also imagine the unintended consequences of the CTS being priced at 5-series levels would be the buyer just goes ahead and gets a 3-series or perhaps finds a ""Summer of Audi"" lease deal that is too good to pass up.I think the CTS, at the same price as a 5-series, is, today, too much wishful thinking on the part of De Nysschen and his marketing team. The market isn't ready, yet, to accept a CTS priced like a 5-series.Pity.And, whoever wrote about my purchasing proclivities is dead-on: While I would not pay nearly $10,000 more for an A7 when I could have an identically equipped A6 for less, I would gladly pony up the $10,000 for optional extras like leather, electronics, wheels/tires and other factory-exclusive customization. Of course, I'd probably wrap it in a pure white colored car, since I also have an issue paying $1,075 for some off-beat blue color option, but would pay for B&O speakers in a heartbeat. I remain: Often wrong, never uncertain."
August 2015,"Bob Lutz was a part of the spineless management of the old GM and even today he still wouldn't take any responsibility. I saw him on Kudlow couple of years ago, asked why didn't GM change its ways before. He responded that UAWs strike fund would outlast their cash pile. I was truly disappointed when Kudlow didn't follow up with ""And whose fault was that?"". GM was still paying a dividend, big bonuses, spending money left and right. They should have stopped the dividend, start hoarding money well in advance of a planned contract renewal to the point that they could outlast the Union - just like literally everybody else in the machinery business did in 80s and 90s. Some actually went bankrupt (Cummins), others went into long strike (Caterpillar), until they broke the power of their union. But that would have been uncomfortable. Perhaps even bonuses wouldn't be paid, as self-set artificial sales goals wouldn't have been met, the stock would have been down for a while. Who wants that, if you can pretend that nothing is wrong, do couple of faces to the cameras, like you are fighting those unions, then sign whatever they bring you and collect the bonus for a ""great job"". As far as I'm concerned, Lutz has zero credibility, even if what he says may be correct."
August 2015,"I think some of what he said made sense, though. My takeaway was that he feels today's pay structure in automotive should favor the designer above all else. All of the efforts by the CEOs and CFOs pale in comparison to the effects the designers have on sales. I don't necessarily agree that they matter MORE ... because what is a beautiful car in an otherwise failing company? Fisker, anyone? But I think his point that they are near the top of the importance scale, and should be compensated accordingly, is a pretty good one."
August 2015,Bob Lutz is not anyone from whom I would take serious advice.
August 2015,"In luxury goods segment, the customization of the taste allows for big premium. It's actually part of the appeal - to have something others don't. Others may have something similar, but not the same. This is me - the color, the exterior, the interior, or these options. BMW used to boast that you could have something like 2 million combinations in their 3-series, just in the US market, this was before splitting off 4-series (I can't even imagine, how many you could have in Europe, when you have three times as many engines). Some people are willing to pay for being different. X5/X6, A6/A7, BMW's GT or GC lines are all catering to those people. It's probably expensive to make those short lines of different bodies, so you have to pay to get them. I consider those ""butique"" lines an equivalent of special leather, Bang and Oluffsen audio, or other high premium options. Some people won't see a value in that (for you it's ""the same"" car), others will tell you that look is worth 10 grand. Just like some people would say that premium leather or audio system are marginal for them and they won't pay 5 grand for those (they may be nice, just not five grand nice)."
August 2015,"Nearly negative 40 percent is a disaster, considering that ATS didn't even reach its midcycle upgrade and their initial stated goals for the volumes. ATS was supposed to capture the fallout of CTS sticker shock, but it seems it did no such thing - people simply walked away completely, they didn't get CTS and they didn't get ATS, either. I wonder if that's just Cadillac's hubris, or a real strategy. For years good old GM was losing money on every car they sold and ""making up in volume"" , but that ""strategy"" was a road to bankruptcy. Perhaps they decided to simply acknowledge they can't sell as many cars as before, but through product improvement, they can reach some sustainable level of sales, albeit lower than before. One possibility is, if they are truly capable of having superior product and financially ready to back up lower volumes, they may attempt to hop over Germans, who are going in an opposite direction, by making their brand more accessible. How difficult is that? Extremely. Even if they can make a product that beats the Germans, the logistical problems are multifold - their dealer network is too big for the lower volumes of ""exlusive brand"", they would have to let go many (which costs money in broken contracts), they will need to shutter or repurpose plants (which costs money) and the risk is the downward spiral may still continue (people see sales falling so they don't wont to join the ""losers"" club). The previous GM had completely gutless management and militant unions, which made any real downsizing impossible. Not sure if the current one can pull it off - perhaps they can. The road to brand rebuild is long and twisted.Cadillac has been a ""volume premium"" brand for many decades now. It was ""super rich"" brand only at its inception. By the time around 50s -60s it was a car not just for a millionaire, but also for the local dentist and lawyer. It meant higher prices than popular cars, but low enough so every midsize town could have a Cadillac dealership. It's not like Jaguar, where they always were a niche player with small network, except failed rebadge Ford Mondeo experiment. Today they seem content with small market segment with very expensive product. Cadillac is simply too big for that. They need volumes. I think it's basically a failure from the sales point of view, even if the products (CTS and ATS) are best they have ever been."
August 2015,ELR ... a rare sighting.
August 2015,"The new boss of Cadillac seems close to crazy to me. He thinks he can charge prices above BMW? Caddy seems to be in free fall. Sad. Although that has seemingly allowed a make I like better, Acura, to pass Cadillac, which I never thought I'd see....http://www.modernreaders.com/why-pay-500-a-month-to-lease-a-cadillac-when-you-can-pay-less-for-a-bmw/29485/lorenzo-tanos""Cadillac Boss De Nysschen Sticks to Guns with High Lease PricesCadillac President Johan de Nysschen, a.k.a. the architect of what many hope would be the luxury brand’s grand comeback, hasn’t had it easy at times. Most recently, he was scored by several dealers in New York who want him to make Cadillacs cheaper by offering more affordable leases and rebates.If you ask de Nysschen, the main thing is to “do what’s right for the brand,” and doing what’s right doesn’t include cheapening a premium brand. But is it still the right thing to do when Cadillac sales are down 1.5 percent for the first half of 2015, while the luxury space continues to surge in popularity? Consider that Caddy’s international rivals – Audi, BMW, Lexus, and Mercedes-Benz – all enjoyed 7 percent growth or better in the same period. Once again, Cadillac is the outlier in its class, and de Nysschen may need to do more. For one, Cadillac has just one crossover despite the popularity of the class, and both the CTS sedan and ATS coupe are suffering in the sales race.One tool Cadillac can use to turn things around, dealers contend, is to offer cheaper leases for its vehicles. In a Bloomberg special report, Potamkin Cadillac (Manhattan) general manager John Bruno related that the CTS once cost under $400 per month to lease. But now, leases are worth over $500 a month, or over 20 percent more expensive, and more expensive than what one would pay to lease a comparable BMW...."""

August 2015,"Maximum Bob's words are to be taken with a grain of salt, imho.No way do I think the long-term reliability of all makes is essentially similar this point. Wishful thinking."
August 2015,"If you get a chance to read the new Road & Track opinion page by Bob Lutz, ""Go Lutz Yourself,"" I highly encourage you to do so.Bottom line - substance, reliability and durability are no longer the issues of concern (""there are no bad cars""), rather it is style that is (and will continue) to determine the success of the automobile. Interesting perspective.I do understand this perspective, but I just can't bring myself to pay nearly $10,000 more for an Audi A7 over an A6 of comparable equipment, content, etc. There are plenty of other examples where the ""slick"" design seems to command big bucks over the essentially identical vehicle. My first ""ah-ha"" moment was during a BMW test-drive challenge for cancer (where you accumulate a donation based on the number of test drives you take in one day). I drove an X5 then an X6, these are the same cars -- somehow the X6 has a substantially higher asking price.And, I actually think the X5 is better looking.To each his/her own."

August 2015,"Good to know. With my wife's recent S3 acquisition, it has me thinking of a used S4 or S5."
August 2015,"Certainly not surprising that Lexus is finally offering a 4 cyl turbo to compete with the other makes. I do find it kinda bizarre that it will only be RWD, and the base AWD offering will be a de-tuned version of the V6. Having said that, it could be a very welcome offering for those lamenting the lack of ""base"" six-cylinder options in this segment."
August 2015,"So Lexus did what I figured it would do, it has replaced the weak 2.5l V6 out of the IS250 and is using a modified version of the NX200 turbo 4.

August 2015,"This AWD Q50S is averaging 26 mpg highway/21 all around (keeping at 75 mph cruising). Not great but acceptable for a 3,700 lb. sled."
August 2015,Most of today's turbo motors can achieve respectable mpg numbers assuming that they are matched with a vehicle with appropriate gearing. My Mazdaspeed averages north of 28 mpg if I keep cruise speeds under 80- that's with a tuned 2.3 liter making about 320 hp.
August 2015,"Sween, my S4 does similarly -- better than the 2.0T I had (2009). I read that the HP of the S4 will be bumped to about 360, probably in an effort to differentiate the S4's performance from the S3. At this point my plan is to CPO the thing at the end of the lease and keep it for at least another year -- hope this doesn't jinx anything: this car has been bullet proof in terms of reliability and service requirements.My only regret, no sport diff."

August 2015,"Well, for that matter, I could probably go all the way down to a Smart car -- but, still not sure how even that would allow me to keep moving when the rest of the folks were at a virtual stand still. Besides, I drove a mini and they aren't exactly what I would call ""quick.""I'm not so much lamenting the continuous move up in power as I am the continuous creep of traffic congestion and the resulting slow down of movement. My friend who lives in Dallas says even urban Texas is suffering from progressive reduction of the speed at which one can drive and accelerate. And, I'm living in about as much ""middle of nowhere"" as I would want to tolerate.Having been to Germany many times, I am impressed how it is still possible to have a high speed autobahn and fairly high speed train transportation even around the major cities. An American Autobahn would certainly be refreshing -- probably not gonna happen though.Mean time, it seems we will have to put up with cars that are generally overkill in terms of their performance capabilities."
August 2015,"I think you should get yourself some quick and agile dwarf car, like a Mini or Fiat Abarth. I find cars like these so much easier to drive in traffic and if you equip them correctly, they aren't the least bit spartan. Unfortunately, not cheap either."
August 2015,"""I Can't Drive 55!""You must know by my id here that I live in Cincinnati. The SMSA of this city is about 1.5M the last time I looked. The city itself has a population of under 400K. Technically, then, most of us don't live in the city. I earn my living, however in the corp limit, as does my wife.I drive to work -- or at least I used to -- on two interstates: I-275 and I-71. I have tried driving on these interstates at the early and late ""normal"" times, and find myself often putt putting along at whatever speed the car can manage ""at idle."" In winter, it is even worse.I have now taken to driving on secondary roads and residential streets -- just to be able to get to 35MPH - 50MPH. I am, currently, driving an Audi S4 -- a car that in the blink of an eye can almost reach triple digit speeds and the thing feels like it is on rails, making it a great hi-way cruiser, capable of an easy-peasy drive from Cincinnati to Columbus at speeds north of 80MPH.I have not driven an RS7, I have driven a 2015 S6, however, and even that was somewhat frustrating since it is capable of feats of fancy that are virtually impossible on the roads I drive to go about my business.I used to think if I had ""Trump Money"", I would certainly go for a super-car or at least an ""entry-level super car."" Not any more.I really enjoy my S4 -- the few times I've been able to really push it, I have been impressed with its ""performance envelope."" I suspect I would find going back to a 2.0T equipped A4 a let down. But, I also suspect I would find moving forward with an RS4 (if a sedan version were to be made available in the US) would be a let down, too -- or at least immensely frustrating.An unlimited bank account would allow me to acquire, for instance, an RS7 or whatever else might pass these days as a super sedan (an M5, too, would qualify). But what advantage would I have -- I rarely can use the full accelerative force my pedestrian S4 provides. Were I to attempt to ""punch it"" I would, more often than not, find myself overtaking and potentially ramming (""rig for ramming speed"") the pokey car in front of me. Cutting yet another second+ off of my ability to accelerate would be -- in theory -- fun and potentially a safety feature (if you say it real fast and squint, 0-62MPH in 3.7 seconds could be a safety feature, couldn't it?) But, uh, REALLY? I think it is safe to say it is so highly unlikely I could ever use that much quickness, it would just be very, very frustrating. Heck, it is already frustrating with the ""urge"" my lowly S4 musters.So, I have reached a point where I lust for the kind of performance that is available and, currently, unaffordable -- but I also balance that lust with the reality that it is not virtually impossible to use such power, it is literally impossible to do so. So, I ask myself, why bother -- traffic is not getting any better, speeds are not getting any higher, abilities to actually use such accelerative force are waning as each day passes.I'm just about ready to use public transportation -- oh wait, we don't have much of that here in River City, so I have to putt putt along in my ""entry level super sedan"" (well sort of), wondering what it would be like to, as my buddy says, ""punch it.""DILYL -- 55MPH actually would be an improvement."

July 2015,"I would have to assume the BMW M3 would be the champ in that comparo. But, since there is no RS4 other than the avant, I see the logic of selecting an RS3. I thought the S4 was the analog to the BMW 335 or 340 or whatever BMW is offered with a blown 6-cylinder as high performance. The M3 would typically go up against the RS version of the cars from Audi, except in this case where Audi only offers up its highest performer in SW format."

July 2015,"Over at Acurazine, some drivers are reporting 38-40 mpg on the hwy with the V-6 TLX, which is quite a bit above the EPA rating. Surprising, but I guess it makes sense, because at 70 mph typically half of the V-6 engine is shut off with VCM. The result is that you're running a 3 cylinder car with the 9 speed transmission at c. 1500 rpm.Some drivers seem to really like the ZF transmission for this reason, but others really don't. Some people seem to have jerky and ""hunt for the gear"" shifting issues at low speeds.So for the Acura TLX it seems like a win some/lose some world going from their 6 speed to the 9 speed tranny."

I seem to recall they bumped the CTS MSRP to 5-series and A6 levels. One of the merits of the CTS, at least I thought, was that you got a 5 series contender at 3 series prices.In any case, I am pulling for Cadillac to start putting up some really impressive numbers in the not too distant future."

July 2015,"The alphabet-soup transmissions are probably wonderful, so long as they work and/or are under warranty.When they break (and they do), then it's time to find out if the technicians at the dealership even know how to spell transmission. Most of them are told to remove and replace the whole assembly. If it's under warranty, then it's ""only"" a couple of visits to the d'ship and some amount of time in a loaner. If it's not. . .Mark is a well-known proponent of never driving anything out of warranty. I've driven most of my vehicles way, way beyond the warranty coverage. We differ.I like manuals. For simplicity and maintainability reasons, I seek out vehicles with them. My drive to and from work every day, and the trip up to the cabin and back, make use of (at most) 20% of the capability of the vehicle I drive. I just need the vehicle to need minimal attention. Back when I drove among Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary & Regina through the Canadian Rockies in the middle of the night, having a vehicle that demonstrated excellent handling was important. Now it is not; the latest and greatest technology is for those who love bells and whistles. Actual driving rarely enters the discussion The Fraser Canyon at 2 am was a wonderful thing.Many pretend, as they go around on-ramps. I'm not interested, but recognize that many are. YMMV ."
July 2015,"Jon Ikeda promoted to General Manger of Acura:http://www.autonews.com/article/20150727/OEM02/150729892/hondas-accavitti-leaves-top-post-at-acuraIkeda, among other things, led the styling team for the successful 2004 Acura TL. He has been with Honda since 1989."
July 2015,"Wonder what the % of manual transmissions delivered to customers is (and if there is any historical comparison available, what that might be)?My wife and I purchased cars with manual transmissions up until 2005 when -- the cars that we wanted -- basically stopped being offered with manuals.I did, mostly, enjoy my first 6-speed auto (a Tiptronic), but always wondered what the same car would be like with a manual. No way to tell, as a practical matter, anymore.Then, I test drove the 2014 S4 with a manual and the 7-speed DSG (dual clutch ""automatic manual"") -- I found the DSG to provide all of the good things (except the actual depressing of the pedal) of a manual, but after a back to back demo drive (of both transmissions in otherwise identical S4's) I decided the DSG actually felt quicker, and it certainly could be a hell of a lot smoother. Moreover, I use the type of car washes where you give your car to ""the guy"" to drive through the tunnel, etc -- and I smelled a burning clutch and heard grinding gears one time too many, so I talked myself into the DSG.Now at some 30,000+ miles later, I find the DSG to be the best transmission experience I have ever had, relegating my love of manuals to be my sentimental favorite, but not for the performance, I used to believe could only be achieved by rowing your own.I am fortunate to also have another Audi an SQ5 with an 8-speed Tiptronic. Oddly, despite the torque converter, this iteration of the 8-speed is also better even than an S4's manual (there is no way to back to back test the SQ5 manual vs Tip since Audi only offers the SQ5 with the 8-speed.) But the 8-speed still has a hint, a vague suggestion really of being ""almost instantaneous"" making it sort of like the Coke Zero of Cola -- it's not Diet Coke, but it's not quite the real thing either.The march forward of auto trans technology is, I would assume, largely responsible for the death and dearth of manual offerings. And, even though the DSG easily justifies its existence, I wonder if all 8-speeds are as good as the tuned version in the SQ5. I would, therefore, imagine there are other reasons for the paucity of stick shifts -- the only one I can think of is convenience, unless the real reason is ""we've"" been marketed to, so convincingly, and been convinced that we've lost the manual dexterity to undertake shifting, and that we don't really need it.I'm going to stick with convenience as the killer of the manual.But, I would be keenly interested in knowing the percentages if such source for that data is available.Thanks."
July 2015,Interesting data as of 2014:
July 2015,"I get they are ""striking, while hot"" but the next car a guy Who is now looking golf gti might be looking in 3/4 years time for a Passat or some suv - mainstream dealers are about volume- seems short sided to me."
July 2015,A few dealers pulled the same stunt with the Z8 and 1 Series M Coupe.
July 2015,"I colleague of mine had pre-ordered a BMW i8 to the tune of about $200k. Much later when the car came in they demanded an additional $50k over the MSRP. He was incensed because this was non-negotiable, and they would not even compromise, plus he had to exert considerable pressure on them to get his deposit back. They definitely lost him as a repeat customer. He had been a repeat customer up till then."
July 2015,"Dealers are simply striking while the iron is hot .. folks are willing to pay above sticker for the new hot thing. First generation Miata, PT Cruiser, GT-R are examples that come to mind.Lot of folks with more money than sense, it seems."
July 2015,"On the comment above - I'm amazed dealers would markup ""hot"" cars and not just go with msrp. Seems like a dangerous game to play as they can piss off customers. If dealers Are really into satisfying customers for more then one car sale- if I went into a dealership and wanted a certain car (like I did years ago looking for an accord v6 couple, manual) and they up priced said car - I would never go back (which I didn't a few years later to get my wife's crv, but I did use there discounted price to get a better deal elsewhere)"
July 2015,Local dealer here in Denver has them for $299 with $1799 down. Not enough miles for me and just a bit beyond my budget.
July 2015,"I'm now on an Ohio BMW dealer's email list because they had a 135is I was interested in(before I came to my senses, but I digress). Anyway, today they sent me an email announcing that they were leasing 2015 320i xDrive sedans for $299-$399 per month- for 36 months with $0 down(10k mile/year). Not a car I'd ever consider, but it does sound like a decent deal for someone who'd want something like that."
July 2015,Many cars have this.  I do the same on my Acura.
July 2015,"An interesting bit on the Q is the tire pressure monitor. It shows the air pressure in each tire. You can see the pressure rise as the tires warm. Cool to start, typically rises from 35 - ~ 40 psi."
July 2015,"That is very true about them being thin on the ground. And VW dealers seem content to markup sticker if they can get away with it, yet they sell anyway. As to VW dealers being jerks, that's the rumour and the reputation. The dealers I went to in So Cal (3 different dealers) were all reasonably accommodating and didn't seem abnormal. Of course, 2 of the dealerships were owned by the same company."
July 2015,"I'd like to try a Golf R, but they are extremely thin on the ground. The local VW dealers can also be jerks- that quells my enthusiasm a bit."
July 2015,"Have you test driven the Golf R? I've heard reports that in real world driving it is faster than the STI. Of course, I know you favor the manual over DSG even if it means sacrificing two tenths to 60 MPH."
July 2015,"Yes, I would prefer a hatch."
July 2015,"What's not to like about the STI. You should like it. I guess there is one thing, you are forced to get a sedan rather than have the option to get the hatch version like the good ol' days."
July 2015,"For anyone interested, I posted my driving impression of the 2016 STI in the Buying and Selling Cars topic.Condensed Version: I liked it. A lot."
July 2015,"Yeah, if only it were so easy to remember ....2, 4, 6 - coupes3, 5, 7 - sedansX1, X3, X4, X5, X6 - SUV/CUV/SAV (whatever)(except for the 4 GC and the 6 GC - the former is the hatch, the latter is a sedan. Oh, and the 3GT and the 5GT - those are hatches, too)Yeah, I think BMW may have lost the plot."
July 2015,"Grand Coupe is a 4-series because it uses 4-series wheelbase and wheeltrack. It also has a rear hatch, which is a hoot to me. I won't buy a car without a rear hatch. The sloped rear is a downer for 6-ft tall individuals in the back seat, but I don't care - I sit in the front and don't chauffeur anybody around."
July 2015,"I have given up trying to keep the BMW models straight. Confusing nomenclature, and seemingly ton of overlap between them."
July 2015,"I agree, GT is not really a BMW in the same way other cars. I liked the general idea, but the execution was in a wrong direction. Now, 4-series Grand Coupe looks fantastic and hits all the right tones - 440i GC (when it comes in 2017) is most likely going to be my next car - unless I decide I can't wait and get 435i GC."
July 2015,"of the cars with 4/5 doors - if you had to vote one off the island, legroom aside it would be the GT every time. If I had to drive my 7 foot grandmother around it would be in the GT."
July 2015,There is 3 inch more leg room in the back and the car is 1 inch wider then a 3 series sedan. The amount of leg room in the back is more then a 5 series sedan. The 5 GT has more leg room in the back then a standard WB 7 series.
July 2015,"The 3-GT is on a longer wheelbase than the 3-series sedan, supposedly to accommodate the Chinese market. Many owners are driven."
July 2015,Let's start with...I've never seen the BMW 3 gt - the 5 gTs that I've seen all look dumpy and for some reason the ones I've seen have smaller 18 inches where 19/20s should be in place. It's a cool concept which seem more at place in the 3- but let's be honest given the choice...
July 2015,"The trick was in the tax structure, favoring diesels. That tax structure was justified by a doctored science, making the diesel engine look like a savior of the environment (vs. evil gasoline engine) due to lower carbon emissions, with nitrogen and particulate data using emission tests that were set up to produce appearance of much lower emissions than real life. As a result, the measured nitrogen oxide and particulate levels in cities did not go down and they tracked it to the emission test overstating the reduction of those emissions. In essence, if new diesel emission standards were followed using real life tests (similar to those in the US), there would be materially fewer engines certified in the marketplace (just like in the US), and those approved would be much more expensive. Hence the ""con"". There are some other interesting particulars in diesel market in Europe - like particulate filters that are often cut out by rogue drivers, because their replacement is horribly expensive, which defeats the purpose of the filter (this is more Eastern Europe phenomenon than Western). Also, it has been well documented that durability of those new breeds of diesel engines is well below what it was before and the maintenance is horribly expensive. Premature failures of double mass wheels, emission systems (especially in situations of frequent short trips, when particulate filters don't have a chance to burn out), increased sensitivity to fuel quality, make those engines equally or even more fragile than gas engines. The old stinker could go for million miles on vegetable or heating oil, the new quiet, ""clean"" diesel, has a lifespan similar or sometimes shorter than the gas engine with higher costs of overhauls. The prices of diesel repairs of those new TDI engines at authorized garages are legendary over there (it's not unique to VAG, same happens to MB, BMW, Peugeot, or Renault). European Commission is trying to rectify the emission situation by tightening the standards to resemble American, but the issue is of course transition time. I believe once new enforcement is in place and costs of engines go up, the proportions of diesel engines in small cars will revert to values similar to those prior the whole craze, which is more than in the US, but much less than today. The move is already happening, primarily due to equalized diesel fuel prices (that used to be much cheaper), observed increased maintenance cost and lower durability (majority of Europeans, even in the West buy cars for eight-ten years, not three or five), but tightening the standard will likely accelerate it.Americans never caught that bug, partially due to unrelenting of the US government on nitrogen oxide emission requirements. From what I understand it was also California that was even more ""anti-diesel"" than the feds. When you had fifth of the market excluded, there was little incentive for the manufacturers to even pursue the technology. After 20 years of apparently failed European experiment, it appears this was one of the few times, US/California governments did something right, even if not knowing why."
July 2015,"For some reason BMW will not offer the sport suspension on X drive cars, so the sport package and M Package are just appearance packages, however, if you do get a X drive car you get the DHP (Dynamic Handeling Package) which the Adaptive suspension is part of and will take care of the suspension problem. Ricks GT will have the DHP, since all GT's are xDrive here in the states."
July 2015,"Plus, you don't even get a sport suspension. Most FXX cars at least offer the option of an adaptive suspension with xDrive. Without it the cars have a floaty ride and even more understeer."
July 2015,"Regarding Diesels:dino001, are there issues/circumstances that argue against diesels? I thought, here in the US, that once the fuel was cleaner and with the advent of ""ad-blue"" that the only factor arguing against diesel being widely adopted was inertia.The message that I have bought into is that diesels -- and this means the hardware and the fuel -- produce more torque and can often achieve some 1/3 better mileage than gasoline (around here premium and diesel are often close to each other in price.) In short, I have bought into the notion that diesels can actually be fuel sipping ""hot rods."" The SQ5 which is a terrific performer, is actually offered as a diesel in Germany, for instance.When my S4's tank is full the ""miles to empty"" reading is 400. I assumed this would mean it would be at least 520 to empty if I had the diesel set up that is in the German market SQ5 in my S4. Based on the AudiUSA website (which, for example offers up a 3.0T A6 and a diesel A6) I assumed it would be a pretty simple calculation to estimate the asking price for an S4d (if one were to be made for the US market) and to then determine how many tankfuls until break even, etc.That ""perception"" which I somehow seem to be reading in your post, may be part true, part myth. Please elaborate -- here's why: I have been against using ""food"" to make ""gas"" since some politician, I assume, started pressing for e85 fuel; conversely, it has always seemed that diesel engines in our cars could be a good bridge to a future where we actually can use less and less fossil fuel.I read your post, however, and I wonder if I just drank some diesel flavored kool-aid some years ago.Again, please elaborate on your point about Europeans being coerced and apparently tricked into adopting diesels whilst we 'mericans adopted, almost universally, gasoline.Thanks."
July 2015,It's just weight + complexity. What's not to like?
July 2015,"I found a couple of CPO E92 335i manuals while car hunting- both had xDrive, unfortunately.Meh."
July 2015,@flightnurse - they sell a $60k LS460 in Arizona ?
July 2015,"That's true, to each their own. My point is that many that say they want to see more diesels, because Europeans have them, so it must be so great, but it turns out those Europeans were convinced and coerced by their governments using tax incentives, penalties, and other means as diesels were supposed to be so great for the environment. Turns out, it was a giant con, based on phoney metrics, made to fit a story. The tide turned, it will take some years to change, but it seems diesels ain't so great when things are made equal. Once the goverments remove those preferences and even the field, you'll see European market move back toward having much more gasoline-leaning market, where diesels will have their place, but the siliness of pusing them into every model will likely stop. It will never be as barren as here, but it likely resemble what was there twenty years ago or so, when those new diesel everywhere hoopla started."
July 2015,"Dino, you can take your stand and use it any car. Do we really need a 120K MB S600? Doesn't a 60K Lexus LS460 give the same ride and comfort? Just because you don't see a need for a diesel power Jetta doesn't mean others do not. Currently here in phoenix diesel fuel is roughly .30 cents less then regular unleaded"
July 2015,"This is not directly related to ELLPS, but many people here expressed their admiration, or at least interest in diesel-powered cars. I just read an article that essentially vindicates my diesel position. European Union is changing its stance on diesel emissions. Up to now, they were giving diesels essentially free pass, or forbearance on tested emission levels. Their current testing procedures measure unrealistically low levels emission (it is by setup) and those levels are used in certification process. Moreover, those unrealistic values look better than gasoline engines. This is similar to old EPA highway gas mileage, when those high numbers were obtained by running cars on a sunny day, with no wind, super even speed in an oval track, with a skinny driver behind the wheel, everything taken from the trunk, tire pressure set up at above normal levels, etc. Moreover, the carbon emission fetish (which was huge in Europe way before our administration caught the bug) lead to additional forbearance on nitrogen oxide, which is much more toxic to humans in immediate effect. Carbon is supposedly bad for the planet, so we have to prevent ourselves from being drowned in oceans, or suffering other horrible ""Inconvenient Truth"" death scenario due to temperatures raising by 2 degrees, but nitrogen oxide killing us before then was apparently OK. This whole setup was to made diesels look much better than they really were, and as such they were taxed at lower levels. All politics.The regulators are looking now to made all emission testing realistic and using those values for certification process. The situations is reportedly so bad that, if implemented immediately, multiple models would have to be withdrawn from the market, which tells you how much skewed the setup was. Thankfully, United States government never bought into that diesel BS to the same degree. I also recall the difficulties with ""clean diesel"" implementation initiative (e.g. Navistar having to pay huge penalties on their engines because they couldn't make them compliant on time), I suspect part of that was that there was no forbearance on the testing. I always maintained that Europeans bought diesels not by choice, but because they were made by artificial market setup. Also, American ""resistance"" to diesel was not as ""irrational"" as many people would try to make us believe. There is surely place for those engines - in agriculture, construction, heavy and midsize transportation, buses, perhaps on SUV-level. I think diesel Suburban, F-150, or even BMW X5 (or Honda Odyssey, if they made it) make perfect sense. If you have three kids and like taking long road trips, diesel would should advantages, My problem was with worshiping TDI Jettas and Passats. They may be fine, but I would still take a gasoline engine every day and twice on Sunday."
July 2015,Love the tire talk and good to hear others are going the 2 set/season route - the cars we drive today have a boatload of safety tech built in but have added weight and power which can cripple you in a tough situation.
July 2015,"As a life-long New Englander and skier of the beautiful Green and White mountains, beyond choice in drive wheels and/or tires, I find a major factor in handling driving in the snow is the fact that many drivers are just not that bright.Until my wonderful '05 TL, I had done quite nicely with FWD/All Seasons, snow-driving experience and a modicum of common sense and luck. The TL was just not as confidence inspiring once the snow got more than a couple of inches deep, so I bought a set of Dunlop snow sneakers on dedicated rims. Night and day. My AWD XF with the stock Contis was a champ in this past winter's several Snowmageddons/Snowpocalypses. However, if I lived in the mountains of Maine, NH or Vermont, likely I'd go snow shoes without giving it a second thought.My Jag XK with the stock summer Dunlops? 1/8"" of snow in my driveway and I was going nowhere!!!"
July 2015,"I prefer two sets of tires and wheels even on AWD cars. AWD + winter tires = awesome. The other reason I like 2 sets is I like summer tires. If I get summer tires I need something else for winter, so I might as well do it right and get winter tires. Around here (Chicago) the snow isn't usually too bad, so I prefer performance winter tires unless it's a RWD car. They're much better on roads that aren't covered in snow than something like a T-rated snow and ice tire."
July 2015,"If you live where there is routinely more than moderate snow (SW Ohio is typically low to moderate snow, for example), I would NOT suggest using A/S tires thinking you'd be OK, even with AWD. Much of the US, however, has some cold without much white stuff, that is where I (speaking only for myself) would stick with the year 'round one-tire solution.Come to think of it, were I to feel the need for a summer and a winter tire, I would almost certainly use dedicated wheel/tire combinations rather than have the wheels be ever so slightly damaged every time I changed the tires."
July 2015,"I'm a big fan of dedicated snow tires, too. If you pitted a RWD or FWD car with dedicated snows against an AWD car with all seasons, it'd be pretty close. The AWD would probably be better on gaining traction for acceleration, but in steering, braking and handling I think the 2WD would beat it every time."
July 2015,@shiftright the shoe drops with dedicated summer and winters for performance cars if you live in drastic weather conditions for the 2 seasons is prob the thing to do. With the winter we had last year prob not a bad idea to get the wifes awd a set of dedicated snows.
July 2015,"Roadburner: Perhaps a bit of a word game, on my part, but I would say dedicated summer and winter tires are the MAXIMUM setup not the optimum. UHP A/S are optimal, just not the maximum you can achieve.I tried the summer winter set up once and didn't like the ""rash"" that developed on my expensive wheels. I would think, today, that the maximum set up would be as you suggest summer tires/summer wheels, winter tires/winter wheels. Having just purchased 8 new DWS 06 UHP A/S's plus paid for the mounting, balancing and all wheel alignment, I guess we're going to wait until next time, which will probably be either on the next car or 40K miles from now.Were money no object, I would like to compare these DWS 06's to dedicated extreme performance summer only tires -- but, since money is an object, we're going to live with the current top UHP A/S's we could get.Thus far, I do think these tires are the ones Audi should choose when the customer checks all-season tires on his/her S4. Probably will fall on deaf ears though. But god, the Grand Touring tires just seem like totally the wrong choice at least for an S car, and I would think for a regular A4 too, frankly."
July 2015,"Dedicated summer and winter tire/wheel sets are definitely the optimum setup. That's what I run on the Club Sport, 328i, and MS3. The TJ and X3 run all seasons year round, but note that the Jeep's A/S tires also have the Severe Snow(winter) rating.Yesterday I had a hearing @70 miles away and I drove the MS3- taking a more scenic and rural route. I can't say enough good things about the Michelin PSS I fitted a while back. Wet or dry, grip level are simply phenomenal."

For 3 years had a guy chirping in my ear about dedicated shoes, now he is a rally car guy.

July 2015,"I wish, sometimes, that we had SoCal's weather -- but, since we don't, and I am (or at least I must be) a lazy American when it comes to changing tires for Summer and Winter, I will continue with the best possible UHP A/S's that money can buy (based on the research and comments from folks here and on the TireRack's site.)Classic Quote:""Clark: Burn some dust here.

July 2015,"I live in the San Diego Southern California region where snow is extinct and rain is rare. I am still running stock 245/40R18 (Pirelli P7's Z-rated speed) Summer tires on my OEM wheels and will soon be trying 255/40R18 Extreme Performance Bridgestone RE-71's on my aftermarket 18"" wheels that are a 1/2"" wider than stock (and several pounds lighter). Not because it is summer season, but because anytime a track event looms on the future horizon, I can just switch out, but I enjoy the extra performance on roads too, and not having to buy tools or spend time swapping them out myself at the track. I think the stock Pirelli's fall under Max Performance, but they are just OK for the times. They'll be replaced with Michelin Pilot Super Sports when needed."
July 2015,"Top speed rating category doesn't give the full picture of the performance capabilities a tire will help your ELLPS or LPS car attain.Most H rated tires do not have what it takes to get the most out of your car, especially the cars we discuss here on this edmunds.com forum.I have no plans and probably nowhere to even attempt speeds in excess of 130MPH, however turn in, overall performance and even improved stopping power are typically associated with the V, Z, W and Y rated shoes.I too remember when Audis always came with Z rated tires -- when you have the ability to compare the same car with H perf tires vs Z perf tires or W perf tires, the differences are not subtle."

July 2015,"How's Them New Taars? ""Taars"" mid-west col·lo·qui·al for ""Tires"" Hopefully this is somewhat of a public service, since I have no financial interest whatsoever in Continental Tires or The Tire Rack or The Audi Connection, despite spending money with all three entities.The new shoes -- Continental DWS 06's -- have been on my '14 S4 (18"") and on my wife's '14 SQ5 (20"") for over 300 miles (in my case over 400 miles); and, today, July 8th, is a day befitting a duck -- steady, steady rain. The puddles have puddles, in fact.This is really the first day I have driven with the DWS 06's on seriously wet streets, roads and highways.Up until today, my report would have been entirely based on dry-pavement experiences. And, to put a finer point on things, the report I would give would have been easily rendered: Excellent handling, turn-in and bump absorption while being both quiet and comfortable (the latter qualified with the phrase ""for an ultra-high performance tire."")I was in a big hurry this morning for a 9:30 meeting which required streets, secondary roads and two interstates to get to. Of course, it rains -- which, in Cincinnati, at least, brings out a driving behavior reminding me of the phrase ""deer in the headlights."" You see, Cincinnati drivers appear to never have seen rain, sleet or snow -- EVERY SINGLE TIME it rains, sleets or snows. This leads to -- hmm, seemingly endless (and unexplainable) backups when the coefficient of friction drops (like today) perhaps not much more than 10-15%. Such is life.With some trepidation, therefore, I decided, initially, that ""ACD"" (assured clear distance) calculations had to be modified to make certain I could stop rather than ram into the ""deer"" ahead of me as he/she somehow managed to lose control of their car due to some standing water.No worries.The ""W"" in DWS (Dry Wet Snow) came through like a champ. The car continued to behave ""about as normal"" -- a rain soaked highway seemed little changed compared to a dry version of the same road, at least as far as I could tell behind the wheel. I half expected some earlier onset under-steer (and I'm sure it would be there at some speed) than on a dry road, but -- with my hand held high in the ""I swear"" position -- I didn't detect any even on that one curve I forgot about as I winded my way toward I-71S.Another testimonial -- of approximately the same conclusion -- came from my wife, who was a couple of miles ahead of me (as usual) in her SQ5 with the same new shoes as mine; she and I were ""open lined"" with our mobile phones and with our traffic info nav screens set to 2 miles. She remarked how unfazed the SQ was under the circumstances. And, if you recall, she had just come from 40,000 miles on the previous gen DWS (sans 06) tires. For her the improvement in the DWS 06's vs the DWS is noticeable but not ""night and day"" noticeable; for me, on the other hand, coming from H rated Continental Grand Touring's, the DWS 06's absolutely have transformed the car into what it should have been from mile one.Two comments on that: #1 My fault, my bad, for not fitting DWS's on upon delivery (like we did with my wife's)#2 Audi's fault, Audi's bad, for selling an ""S"" car with all-season Grand Touring H-rated tires; anything less than the latest and greatest all-season ultra high performance tires raises the question ""what were they thinking?"" Just because an American customer wants all-season tires, does not mean, nor does it even suggest, that the customer expects anything less than the highest performance tires available at the time the car is screwed together at the factory.Clearly (to me at least) many folks on the other side of the pond don't get some American driver's choice to wear one set of shoes on the car year 'round. When we buy a premium sport-performance sedan -- and request all-season tires -- no where is it written that the performance capabilities of the tires should drop from ultra-high or max performance all the way down to ""H"" rated family sedan fitments. Yet, today's UHP A/S tires are a compromise -- but time and technology have advanced to a point where a tire like Continental's DWS 06 UHP A/S can provide a performance envelope virtually equal to and in some cases greater than some Max Performance tires. I would not argue that these tires are fungible with any Extreme Performance or even most Max Performance tires -- but the DWS 06's give up virtually no ground to many other UHP summer-only tires and, as noted can sometimes match the performance of Max Perf models.The moral, if there is one, of the story is if, like me, you don't want -- for several reasons, including ""wheel wear from tire swapping"" -- to change your tires back and forth between summer and winter tires AND you live in an area of ""moderate"" -- not heavy -- snow, these UHP All-Seasons are ""the best you can get"" [today] (until a better one comes along the day after tomorrow -- probably from Michelin).Livin' Drivin' the dream.Mark"
July 2015,"There is a VW S3, but it's called the Golf R and has 5 doors. The dealer that had one in my County didn't have it sitting more than a couple days before it disappeared into some happy buyer's garage. Most VW dealers have zero. Maybe the Golf 400 will be more readily available."
July 2015,"Jurassic Audi?I am happy that Audi brought the A3 to market -- my assumption is this model will bring more customers into the fold. Everytime I visit my dealership, I make certain I get in whatever A3's are on the showroom floor. I must say, I think a base A3 without any options, seems out of place next to the RS7, S8, A6 TDI, and Q5's (and sometimes even an RS8) on the showroom floor, however. The higher contented (with sexier wheels) A3's just like the high zoot Q3's have no problem being a member of the family, however.I have twice driven an S3, and I found them to be quick, powerful, almost visceral -- raw and rough around the edges. For $50K, plus $11 for the ear plugs that would be required, however, I would never buy one. Furthermore, firm is one thing, but the S3 in dynamic mode is harsh, more unrefined than any Audi I've ever driven -- until you get the thing above 90MPH, then it starts to make sense.But, $50,000+ for an S3 -- which may not be too much considering the content and performance -- seems to put it out of the ""boy racer"" league, unless the ""boy"" has Trump as his last name. The current S4 is showing its age, to be sure, but even though there is a new S4 looming in a matter of months, the current S4, for somewhat similar money, still seems far more refined and its supercharged V6 is sublime compared to the S3's sturm und drang. The S3, to an older fart like me, reminds me of the first time my then boss let me drive his new Porsche 944 turbo. When I found out how much it cost, I just couldn't fathom why anyone would subject themselves to that much punishment just to be able to have a car that was supremely capable at triple-digit speeds (in an era when the maximum speed limit was 70MPH -- which we have, once again, returned to here in Ohio, thankfully.)So, perhaps the A3 really is the refined ""little"" model deserving of the Audi rings; but, to me, as capable -- at speed and a caution to the wind driving demeanor -- as the S3 is, it seems almost more like something that should have been marketed by VW or had its roughest edges filed down and more sound deadening stuffed into every crack and crevice.My remarks, it should be emphasized, pertain mostly to the S3, and entirely to the S3 when it comes to driving impressions. An upscale Premium+ or Prestige model A3 certainly seems to fit right into the family dynamic, and hopefully the driving experience does nothing but strengthen that perception.The S3 is a fun car and one that from time-to-time could be a hoot -- a great romp, the Jurassic World Audi, perhaps."
July 2015,"I have to disagree. The new A3 left me feeling it wasn't a ""no corner cut"" Audi. I liked the lightweight chassis and tossable feel of the handling though. The old A3 was light enough to be tossable as well and was excellent with the DSG transmission which had great tuning in '06 (maybe not the tuning a Toyota driver looking for a smooth auto would look for). Also, it was a sport package equipped A3 I had (sport leather seats, aluminum air vent rings, aluminum shift paddles, 10 mm lower ride height, stiffer springs, stiffer dampers; fog lights, spoiler on the roof, awesomely tuned for sporty driving). It had little details with seemingly (at the time) no corners cut. Things like aluminum sills front and back, a power port in the cargo area, lighting for all areas of the interior, and the DSG learned ""your style of driving."" By the way I don't own the A3 because I sold it at about 8 years old with 106,000 miles on the odometer ($8K). The new A3 is smoother, quieter, but not as raw and involving. The transmission is tuned to pretend to be a regular run of the mill automatic unless you put it in S. It would be interesting to look at them side by side at the same time for comparison."
July 2015,"@andres3 - the old a3 you own is no where near the new one unless you opted for the sport pack and manual - vs rthe base current model. Beside the hatch, which I like better the old car is not in same class. In fact prev gen golf better cat dollar for dollar. Like the passion for the oldie but sit in a new a3 and you would be hard pressed to distinguish it from current a6 from the cabin. The americAns might be onto something ."
July 2015,"Wow, Audi is really kicking butt with the A3. Interesting how I found my '06 A3 superior in many ways to the current model, though Americans prefer their sedans to ""sportbacks"" as Audi put it. The sales numbers show that."
July 2015,"Product Life Cycles: It's Time for a ChangeThe Germans -- and for all I know all of them -- produce new cars, not ""refreshes"", about once every eight years. My 2014 S4 is so very similar to my 2009 A4 (that I bought in third quarter 2008), it was difficult for me to actually see much difference, even though mine is a ""post refresh"" version.Here is what this means: an A4 (and you can fill in the blank for your favorite make) available in calendar 2008 (in the US) is essentially repeated with continuous improvements in 2009, 2010, 2011,2012,2013,2014 and 2015, with a truly new car unavailable until calendar 2016. Now, don't get me wrong, my 2014 S4 does have many seen and certainly many more unseen improvements over my 2009 A4. But progress, like time and tide, continues to advance -- and apparently the ""avionics"" are seldom unable to be upgraded, which leaves the last two and sometimes three years of a ""model run"" possibly out-dated.It's no wonder the A4's sales (see post above) have dropped nearly 15% (and there have been decent incentives on this model, and it still manages to have a sharp sales drop off). The phrase often seen in the enthusiast's magazines is ""long in the tooth"" -- and that term is typically used after about 6 years after an all-new model is released. Now, I'm not simply or just talking about the styling changes that typically go along with an all-new model, no, I'm talking about the wheelbase, width, platform, engine/transmission choices and technology advances, the features and functions (available inside the car) and even the audio systems and safety features.Yet Audi, BMW and Mercedes seem hell-bent on this 8-year cycle as if they haven't yet noticed the last couple of years of a model's cycle see a big time sales decline. There is some historical justification for delaying the new model roll-out, and there is, no doubt, an economic reason for doing this -- at least there used to be.Now, new technology -- which makes its way to cars faster and faster and more quickly than ever before -- becomes available about every 18-24 months, which should translate to cutting the 8-year cycle to 6 years, and, frankly, perhaps to 5 years.Conversely, the rapidity of available [technology] change could argue for the automotive manufacturers to take a page out of aviation's play-book -- that is to allow us at least some reasonable ability to upgrade our car's ""electronic"" systems. Increasingly, our cars interface with ""us"" via software controlled devices. Furthermore, even when the new software requires upgraded hardware components, we should be able to swap out the old for the new.I recently upgraded my relatively old laptop by swapping out a spinning disk-drive for a solid state drive and simultaneously was able to move from Windows 7 to Windows 8 -- and you don't need to get me started on the ability to keep upgrading the OS on my Apple devices; and upgrade my home theater from VHS to DVD to BluRay without having to buy an entirely new home theater system.Airplane owners have long enjoyed the ability to, as I said, upgrade the avionics of their planes to conform to FAA requirements or to add additional functionality to their planes.I understand the need to produce newly styled vehicles -- but I believe the life cycles have to drop from 8 to 6 to 4 or 5 years, especially if auto manufacturers remain unwilling to allow us to make some in-between model upgrades. Folks who want the newest styling will always want the newest styling would be my assumption. Imagine if the new iPhone didn't come out for five years after the last one, or if we had to wait for UHD-TV because HD hadn't been out for at least 8-years, and so on.Audi, BMW, Mercedes and all the manufacturers who have these impossibly long lag times between the introduction of new models need to get with the realities associated with the Law, Moore's Law, that is."

July 2015,"Interesting I may try that- I do 40/40 all round - I don't feel the heavy front could be the SD but I would prob have to drive a regular side by side to comp. When I was looking I test drove one w/o SD and found it handle really well- it was set up with summer 19' slicks as well and I loved it, just couldn't match up on price. Mark Thanks for the talk on tires - when I swapped mine I was told this is the last summer on current set. Winters on the other hand have another couple of seasons- let's hope we (up east) don't have a similar winter or it will be less. This car really is a all purpose beast - in the snow with proper shoes (marks term) it's a billy goat- in the summer with slicks and in beast mode it's a rocket that can handle turns- not bad for a stealth kid hauler."
July 2015,"(whispering) Pure Joy. I can only imagine since I don't have the SD, but my wife and I took out an S5 w/SD recently -- it too had the 19"" wheel/tire package -- and it gave new meaning to the phrase ""corners like a snake in a rat hole.""Since it would be financially crazy to do so, I will NOT be trading the current S4 for an S4 w/SD, but still, these DWS 06 UHP's have totally changed how fast I can enter a curve. It does carve like it's on rails!In case anyone needs or wants to know: Front inflation [cold], 42 lbs, Rear, 40 lbs. The reason to do this -- especially on Audis -- is that they are nose heavy and when readying for a sharp turn maneuver the load shifts to the front, so I give the fronts a bit more [air pressure] to work with, figuring they need it."

June 2015,"New ShoesThe '14 S4 I ordered came with the no-cost optional all-season tires. The tire specification was, on my part, deliberate since, living in Cincinnati -- the home of typically ""moderate"" winters -- I know I can't get away with ""summer only"" shoes year 'round. My previous A4 with the sport option came with 19"" wheels and summer only tires, which were great except for two things: 1 - they suck at any temperature below 40; and, 2 - the tread life of the Max Performance Summer Only tires that Audi chose was, optimistically not much north of 11,000 miles. This time, I thought I'd go with an S4 with the A/S's -- and I assumed since I was ordering an ""S"" car, the all-season tires would be the best of the best UHP A/S's on the market, probably Continentals or Michelins.Bzzz! Thanks for playing, but the correct answer is that the tires on the car were ""H"" rated Grand Touring tires, albeit from Continental. The main characteristic of these GT tires was that they were very quiet. Otherwise they seemed out of place, somewhat, on an S4 -- the phrase ""under-tired"" springs to mind.We had, prior to driving my wife's SQ5 off the lot had Continental DWS UHP tires put on the 20"" wheels, and these tires were (considering they were UHP A/S's) a true pleasure, the best of both worlds, if that is even possible.So, here we are about 2 years later (my how time flies), she with 40,000+ miles on the SQ and me with 30,000+ miles on the S4 deciding that we had gotten what we wanted out of the tires on our respective S cars.Meantime, back in the lab, Continental had updated the DWS tires and renamed them, slightly, DWS 06. Now, I have about 75+ miles on my new DWS 06 tires and the SQ gets its new shoes day after tomorrow. For a 100% back-to-back commentary, we'll have to wait until we can drive in on DWS's and drive out on DWS 06's -- but my impressions of these tires on the S4 are from the context of driving in on Grand Touring slightly stiff sidewall tires and driving out on UHP very stiff sidewall tires (and, now that I've passed 50 miles, the slickness is gone).The DWS 06's if you need (or want) all-seasons have transformed the responsiveness of the S4 from very good to ""I can't believe this is even the same car"" great. Additionally, these tires are even quieter than the outgoing GT's and even the ""jolts"" felt when hitting potholes are now, somehow, felt as if through some kind of energy absorbing compound (flubber perhaps?)Here's the [current] bottom line:These tires were designed to end ""your"" (and my) need to apologize for having all-season tires; there is quite a bit of explanation and detail that goes into what Continental did (or at least how their marketing department explains what they did) -- the sum and substance you can look up, but it all falls under the name ""Sport Plus"" technology. SPT aims to provide drivers with much more precise handling (than any other UHP A/S tire on the market) and confidence and security on wet and/or slick surfaces, 35% stiffer sidewalls, and an even quieter ride than the DWS all with a 50,000 mile tread life warranty. I'd say, thus far, their aim is true. These tires make me REALLY REALLY want to carve up the secondary roads I'm used to in my neck of the woods. A set of four, for my S4 was $719.56 and was $908.96 for the SQ5 (S4: 245 x 40 x 18""; SQ5: 255 x 45 x 20"").I had mine mounted and road-force balanced (plus a 4-wheel alignment) for $200, at the Audi dealer.I plan to ""drive it like I live"" for at least another 40 - 45,000 miles. Now I do oh-so-sincerely wish I had remembered to order the Sport Differential.DOH!"
June 2015,It's easier to just take the numbers off..

June 2015,"335 has 3.0, not 2.8, but the point is the same. Now it will become 340. Same size (3.0), more ponies so now (according to them) it is now like old 4.0 V8. To a degree, it's true, but c'mon. Now Benz is doing the same with their models. C300 has 2.0 I4, C400 has a 3.5 V6, etc."
June 2015,"True but BMW has been playing the current badge = what the old engine performance used to do. So the 335 has a 2.8 but it performs like the old 3.5. It's definitely about ""prestige."""
June 2015,"That's right. However, there is a real difference between 320i and 328i in output, regardless of the engine size. Moreover, 320i/328i sold here are the same cars sold Europe with only differences due to market certification. However, US-market 328d was a pure badge gimmick. Europeans have always known diesels are more expensive to make, hence they have to be substantially more expensive to buy. Americans don't fully understand reasons for such a price premium in diesel-powered cars, so something ""badged"" as lower end (320d) would not sell at price that's even higher than mid-level 328i. Hence, 328d, not 320d as everywhere else in the world.BTW, the European love of diesels is clearly weakening. Not that it's gone, but they are not seen as attractive as they used to be. Price of fuel went up so much vs. gasoline (unlike in the US, Europe had had cheaper diesel for decades prior last few years - that was due heavier taxation of gasoline, but now it got offset by higher market pricing due to heavy machinery and generator demand plus more stringent refining requirements), so higher diesel price was offset by better mileage PLUS cheaper fuel. Today, the latter is gone, only mileage is better, so it takes much longer to offset purchase price premium. Diesels are still kings in larger vehicles, like SUVs and crossovers (which are coincidentally getting more popular there), but in smaller and midsize sedans/hatchbacks are getting less and less attractive in diesel versions and the proportions of new car sales are slowly changing."
June 2015,"I'll back Dino, our 328d is the euro 320d, same engine.. If they all use the same 2 liter, then it is all about tune.. Just like the our 320 and 328i."
June 2015,"The 335d was a test car for BMW, it was infact their first diesel car in the use in over 30 yrs, E38 524td, was a good car for the time, but was pricey. So fast forward to the E90 335d, was a rocket, 255hp and 413lbs of torque, it's basically the same engine in the 535d and X5 3.5d. The 3.5 liter was too big of engine for the E90, and I think the 2 liter is too small for the F30, BMW has a 2.5 liter 4 cyl oil burner which would give about 20 more HP and about 50 lbs more torque. It would still deliver in the high 40s on the open road. That would take care of the power problem."
June 2015,"To confirm it, you need to look up the UK specs of their 320d and see that the torque and hp numbers are exact match for 328d US version (I did it for German version). Yes, the labeling has totally departed the engine size about 10 years ago, or so - even before then it was only loosely related (like 323/325 and 328/330 had same engine size, 3.0 liter). However, 328d is simply 320d from UK/Europe for marketing/pricing reasons. If you look at performance figures of 328d (US), they are significantly lower than 328i, more in line with 320i, which would fit as again, it really is 320d, rebadged."
June 2015,"Is that the case? I went to the UK site to see and they offer in the diesel 316, 318, 320, 325, 330, 335. No where could I find the actual engine size. Does BMW actually make 6 different diesels in those sizes?I used the live chat at bmw.uk.co and their reply was the 316, 318, 320 all use the 2.0 engine and the 330, 335 use the 3.0. They are doing the same ""label = how it should perform"" as in the US."
June 2015,"I should have known the 335d was gone, but after 32 years of BMW ownership and CCA participation my interest in the marque has decreased significantly; a couple of weeks ago I found last month's Roundel under a stack of car/motorcycle magazines- I hadn't even removed it from the poly bag."
June 2015,"There is no 335d for F30 model in the US market. It was only E90 and IMHO that model was completely pointless (want a fast car, get 335). I think C&D staff has unreasonable expectations, similar to those who buy a small coupe and then complain about rear seat being cramped, or getting a truck and then acting all surprised it doesn't handle like a sports car. It's a four-cylinder diesel that gets you 40 mpg. Nothing is free in this world. I drove 328 diesel, it was fine, exactly what you may want if you are a diesel buyer (I am not, but I think I can understand what people want when shop for one - it's not what 335d used to be). The badge of course was a bit slight of hand - it's a Euro's 320d model rebadged for here as 328d. The reason is clear, as US buyers wouldn't pay upper market price (couple thousand premium over 328i) for a car with downmarket model designation (320). Badges matter here. It's also simple pricing difference overall (there same models being twice the price here, the differences between model designations do not translate into as significant pricing separation, in relative terms). I'd like to see some statistics on that transfer case. If it's a real pattern, it's a big issue."
June 2015,"I'd agree completely. Not a track day car but neither was the '06 330XI bimmer!

June 2015,"So to say that you are a little bias towards BMW, but to set the record straight, BMW does not import the 335d any longer, the 328d was it's replacement. If you want a wagon, it's either 328i or 328d."
June 2015,"Car and Driver just posted the 328d xDrive Diesel Sports Wagon Long Term Wrap-Up on their web site. They found the four cylinder diesel to be a bit too crude for prime time in the car's market segment. Maybe it's done intentionally to force buyers into the 335d(much like the way Ford sticks a horribly cheap interior in the base Mustang to ensure everyone with two functioning eyeballs springs for the Premium trim level). It's also good to know that BMW's engineers have been hard at work redesigning the xDrive transfer case so that it now fails at 25,000 miles- 111,000 miles sooner than the the t/c in my son's X3."

June 2015,"FN...looked for the 340 on TrueCar last night. They don't have it listed yet. I would imagine the lack of discounts on them is still going to put it above where I would want to budget a car/if I get a new car. I mentioned before, I like these new turbo 4 motors. They are torquey and it's amazing to me how they've almost removed any turbo lag. But, some are a little coarse. BMW falls into that category (as does the one in the CTS).Looking at the 335i xDrive equipped the way I want puts me well into the low-mid $50s. The ""5"" in that number is a place I don't want to be.Mercedes 2.0L turbo is smooth, as is the one in the Audi A4.Still not as silky as say the 6 in the S4, IS 350 or TLX SH AWD, though. Ideally, Acura would slap a urbo on their 3.5L V6. For some reason, except for the previous RDX, Acura has shied away from turbos.Thursday night, passed by the local Acura dealer. They looked dead. Hooked up with my favorite sales person to get an extended test drive of a TLX SH AWD Advance. You can immediately tell they shaved weight from the previous TL for that car. Much more refined, too....especially the suspension. Handles well. Great leather sports seats, as always. Tight as a drum...even the door slam sounds expensive. Pushbutton trans would trake some getting used to. Stereo, as always was ""killer"". Not sure what to think of the dual screen layout. Again, seems like the answer to a question no one asked. Relatively quick....thinking mid-high 5 sec range in the 60 romp according to my buttometer...about the same as my previous TL. Sticker said 46K. Haven't looked at pricing since I'm not in the market. I dunno...thinking it would land somewhere in the low $40s. Very nice car for that kind of money. Performs well. Has all the ""stuff"" you could possibly want. Built well, as always. Looks good (finally). But, I've always liked the looks of previous gens."
June 2015,"For MY16 a similar options 340i is less then a MY15 335i. On the 340i LED headlights are now standard, BMW has shifted many items around, option packages have changed,"
June 2015,"One of the things about the Q50 that I noticed -- having come from an FX with the same motor -- is a certain, er, ""coarseness"" (the pros call it thrashing) that the other Japanese and Germans lack. Now, having said that, the 3.7L motor in the Q50 seems to have been given a extra shot of sound deadening, but at full-cry the engine, which is still good, just shows its more unrefined side.The Lexus, especially compared with the Acura, was a bit cramped inside; but after having had a TL, everything seems a bit tighter, and I would quickly forget the relative girth of the Acura. Yet, the Lexus had a nicer interior than the BMW 3 -- of that I am certain. I am finding out that I am not a fan of the north and south display screens (e.g., in the Q50 and Acura), it makes the interior look a bit chopped up.To each his/her own on that count, though. I hate the pop up nav screen that is all the rage these days -- looks so much like something from the aftermarket (Pioneer in-dash head units come to mind)."
June 2015,"Mark...I concur with you. SH AWD, even in the TLX, is a ""horse of a different color"". While not the performance beast the S4 is, it's not far off the mark in many repsects.I vascilate on the IS 350 F Sport. On the one hand, it's a fun drive. Not a ""bahn burner"" by any stretch, but peppy, with divine steering. Love the seats, too.On the other hand, it's cramped. Certain features are just confounding. Overall, for high $40s all oaded up (and low-mid $40s discounted), you could do a lot worse. That puts it in the price ballpark of the TLX SH AWD ADVANCE. That's a tougher decision when you factor that into everything.That C CLass and the interrior, and the ""smoothness"" of how it drives and operates, while giving up little in the way of ultimate performance can be had in the mid $40s range, too (loaded up and discounted).Now, all of a sudden, I ask myself ""is a 335i worth $10K more?"" No immediate answer comes to mind because I'd have to ponder that one long and hard.No disrrespect meant for those who like the Q50. But, my opinion only, it gets left by the side of the road amongst these others mentioned above. Even the Q50S feels crude by comparison."
June 2015,"The V6 SH AWD ""version"" is, if you axe me, not a version at all, it is an entirely different car. Whatever additional tuning is performed on the SH AWD ""version"" gives it transformed handling (reminds me of an S4) -- and it is not (or perhaps I should say it can't possibly be just because of) the torque vectoring rear differential.Perhaps, in response to someone's question regarding why the Q50 isn't setting any sales records, I suggest driving back-to-back-to back the following: Acura TLX SH-AWD Advance, Infiniti Q50S AWD and the Lexus IS 350 F-sport AWD. Of the three, the Infiniti Q50S is the least impressive. I used to say the BMW 3 was the German version of Infiniti's G37X -- somehow,they (Infiniti) lost their mojo with the new Q50S -- having said that, however, I have confidence they will find it again.I liked the Lexus so much I ordered one, fully loaded, thinking even a Premium Plus S4 wasn't ""within reach"" -- but the magic discount offered due to my membership in the Audi Club of NA, plus some very impressive money factors, made the S4, as they say, within reach of us mere mortals."
June 2015,"I was initially looking at a GTI back in 2007, but the local VW dealers all proved to be hopelessly inept. I checked out everything from a Mustang Bullitt to an X5 4.8is to an E39 M5. I finally decided to go with a FWD car since we were seeing so many Civic Sis, GTIs, Minis, etc.at our HPDEs- I figured I should have some actual seat time in that drivetrain configuration if I was going to instruct those drivers. The Mazdaspeed 3had received extremely good reviews from Automobile, AW, CD and R&T and was reasonably quick so I figured, why not? Funny thing: at my first BMW CCA HPDE with the Mazdaspeed(dead stock, OEM tires) it was raining a bit during the first instructor session. I lapped every car on the track.Twice."
June 2015,"Roadburner, who has been on these boards for, lo, these many years, did a similar thing. He seems to enjoy his Mazda quite a lot, even though he's owned (and still does) several BMWs. Perhaps he will chime in.Some continue to climb the ladder; others step off at the floor that pleases them, or even step down. Perhaps the vehicle has a steering wheel actually connected (mechanically) the the front axle. Perhaps it has a dipstick. Perhaps you don't have to have it towed to the dealer when the battery goes dead. Perhaps it has real tires and a spare.Go figure.I've been up the ladder to the '98 A4, bought new, sport package, 6 cyl 5 speed. I STILL miss that car - but out of warranty at like 60K I started having cooling issues and the dealer of course could not figure it out, to the tune of a few trips of $800-$1200 each. Intermittent on warm days, only when the car was under load like climbing hills, etc. So I got rid of it at 88K, which is the earliest I've ever gotten rid of a car.I've also been up the ladder on the TL - 150K, very reliable, pretty luxurious, but kind of too big and a bit of a wallowy barge. ""The ladder"" of course is many things to many people - it could be cost, acceleration, badge, handling, economy, reliability, any combination of those. Thank goodness we have so many choices. I wouldn't disparage anybody's choices or priorities and so I can completely understand why those who owned BMWs would want something less expensive, or frankly, more involving. In the old days BMW was the high end ""involving"" make and Honda was probably the low end ""involving"" make. Nowadays I'm not so sure it's BMW at the high end and it is certainly not Honda at the lower end any more. Which is why Mazda is appealing if you are trying to be economical but still get some involvement."
June 2015,"I sort of liked the ILX. It was nice and all but actually the car I really used to like was the original TSX, before they bloated it up. I had those as loaners a few times and liked the interior, size, and agility. The ILX is nice but the styling inside and out isn't motivating me. I'm sure they are good reliable cars which would be the plus, but I'm thinking not very sporty. Honda/Acura seems to have lost that sportiness that they had in the 80s and 90s."
June 2015,"Breld, thanks for the suggestion and I would be interested in your thoughts. Feel free to PM me if you don't want to post a lengthy story.I'm sure after 10 years with my TL I would find some things lacking in a smaller car like the Mazda (I suspect noisier, tinnier, etc.). Of course my TL is tinnier than my A4 was. But boy it is nice to have high reliability and reasonable parts cost. I suppose we are all looking for that German feel with the reliability of the Asian makes. I'm sure for those who lease or keep a vehicle a short time it's not so important, but I'm a minimum 100K miles type of guy and so reliability is kind of important."
June 2015,"Andres, thanks for the suggestion. I don't think I'm inclined to spend that much for the S4 although I'm sure I would enjoy it. Also isn't the A4 due for a redesign in a year or so? I'm curious to see what changes. Unfortunately I'm sure it will go up in price some more."
June 2015,"I buy whatever makes me smile. The badge or model number is never a factor. I don't judge the goodness of a car by the number of envious glances it generates or how well it telegraphs my disposable income to other motorists. Or...put simpler, what @roadburner said."
June 2015,"Well, I don't know how much you want me to go into it. I'm beyond the ""stepping up the food chain"" with my car purchases, and appreciate what different cars have to offer. On top of that, I change out of cars often enough that I'm only committed to a particular purchase as long as I am enjoying it, thus giving me the ""freedom"" to try different cars out. When I say I am pleased with the change, it has nothing to do with directly comparing the BMW and the Mazda3 - perhaps that was misleading. For what type of car I was looking for, the Mazda really fit the bill well. I was sort of in a large sedan mode with the 535i (xdrive), having also just come out of a Passat. But with a nice comfortable minivan as the family hauler, I had the freedom and yearning to return to something more on the compact, sportier side for my daily driver. I also was interested in a manual transmission. Such cars are becoming more and more scarce, and the Mazda 3 is a nice choice for those priorities (I also considered a WRX and Civic Si, but liked the overall balance of the Mazda. And my wife already has a GTI, or I probably would have gone that route). The Mazda is very engaging to drive, requiring driver involvement to best take advantage of its (relatively low by today's standards) 184 hp through the slick 6-speed manual. I most frequently post on the CCBA forum, and those that participate there know me (and my habits) fairly well. Lest my current ride be taken as speaking out of place on this particular forum, I have indeed owned several ELLPS vehicles, mostly various 3-series. I've also owned three 5-series, one of each from the past three models (E39, E60 and F10). The F10, while superbly comfortable and sharp-looking, just didn't hit the same notes as my earlier BMWs - that wasn't surprising based on test drives; I knew full well what I was getting into. I just didn't realize how much I'd be longing for the increased driver involvement. So, I went for the total contrast in the Mazda 3. Within a year or two, I suspect I'll land somewhere in the middle, having my eye on a 4-series GC once they start hitting the used market."

June 2015,Glad you are happy with your Q50. I see quite a few of them on the road and like them.
June 2015,"VQ egine from Nissan has won many awards but the biggest issue is, horrible MPG, Harshness in the upper range and not very refine towards redline. Now according to you the VQ is a better engine then the inline 6 from BMW, but motor journalist from around the world would say you are wrong.."
June 2015,"One thing you've probably already thought of is that few brands beyond Acura are likely to give you the 10 or so years of very reliable service that you've had with your TL. If you'd gotten a MB, Audi, or BMW back in 2005, by now it's likely you would have run into some expensive stuff. And I'm not sure it's fair to compare the price of your TL ten years ago with the price of a TLX today. A loaded Audi A3 might suit you better, but it will costs c. $5000 or so more than a comparable TLX.The TLX really does have some significant features beyond your TL. It's much safer, gets higher mpg, has 4 wheel steering, as well as a lot of other things just being dreamed of ten years ago. I liked the handling of our Mazda5 too, but it failed the IIHS crash test. Since the Mazda5 essentially killed the dummy inside, we sold it.Did you like the ILX?"
June 2015,"Ok- you went from a RWD inline six to FWD 4CYCL-and you are pleased- explain.I am not trying to be harsh here I just need to hear your pleasantry regarding this change.I always try to go a step up on the food chain in regards to car- new or used- not boasting, just a goal I set.Currently 535XI- next, probably a 550XI (new) or a 650 (used)."
June 2015,"@tlong - if you get serious about going with the Mazda3, I'd be happy to provide you with my experience. I recently went from my 535i to a Mazda3 S with a manual trannie, for much of the same reasons you are citing regarding your TL. I've been pleased with the change thus far."
June 2015,"tlong....one thing you might want to do is drive the TLX. If refinement is at the top of your list, you might be pleasantly surprised by a test drive....especially the V6 SH AWD version."
June 2015,Why are sales so dismal?
June 2015,"""Beemer/"" You can't get a six in any configuration from BMW Motorrad..."
June 2015,"I can report the Q50 V-6 is one of the best engines I've experienced, even nicer than the I-6 in the 330XI that I leased back in'06. Granted, the supension, road feel and the intuitive qualities of the beemer still linger but the Q ia a very nice ride!"
June 2015,"I agree with your assessment. In fact, I think the TL from 10 years ago is superior in some ways to the new TLX. Although, to be fair, the TLX is available with a V6 too, though they seem to be rare and overpriced. 10 years ago I was able to get a sport packaged equipped Audi A3 for about $30K out the door, nowadays, that wouldn't get me a loaded GTI. Seems to me you might want to try the Golf R, reviews seem to say it is nice, refined, and should give that tight agile feel your looking for at under $40K, if you can find one. I didn't like the A3 for it's too small trunk, too plain interior, but I did like how light and toss-able the chassis felt."
June 2015,"The S4 is available with a 6-speed manual transmission complete with all 3 pedals on the floor! It also amazingly makes the car quite cheap, at under $50K even with extra pricey paint before negotiation. If you have to have all the gadgets and doodads then add $8K."
June 2015,tlong...makes sense.FN...message me and I'll give you the scoop if you want. Most here know it already.
June 2015,"I did sit in the TLX and ILX recently in the showroom. I was surprised to feel that the TLX is really not so different in size or style than my '05 TL - a full 10 years older! The shapes are familiar, the interior still looks familiar, with the expected tarting up of LEDs, different fascias, bumpers, etc. My TL is like 250hp v6 and why would I buy a 4 cyl TLX for the same price or more than I paid for my TL? Too similar for my tastes and although the TL has been a great car, I guess I need a change and the TLX isn't it. I also find the TL/TLX just a bit bigger than I like and I want something a bit smaller and more agile. My TL is nice but a bit too much of a barge for me - which is why even our Mazda 5 feels so nice even though much less power. I'm looking for that tight steering and agility with some luxury. Power per se isn't critically important but refinement is more important."
June 2015,"Perhaps when I mentioned cheap inside, I'm also subconsciously adding ""...for the price"". I could get a stripper A3 for the low $30's, or a max loaded Mazda 3 for the high $20's - and the 3 has more equipment by far at those respective prices, as well as (I think) a bit more space inside but still a small package. I might also consider a manual on the Mazda 3 if I could get one fully loaded - something not available any more on the Audis.I think I favor a bit more of the luxury side compared to some of those on this board since obviously if I wanted pure speed/handling I could go BMW. To get decent luxury in a BMW you pretty much need to add $10K for all the options and even then IMHO the Audis are nicer. But the prices on the Audis have gone somewhat stratospheric since I bought my '98 A4 brand new. At that time the Audi was pretty loaded for the same price as a low end 3-series that was a lot more stripped. Nowadays Audi (to their credit) is seen much more positively than they were in the late '90s."

June 2015,I must have missed something since I haven't seen GG post anything but glowing reviews of his CTS.
June 2015,I can see it now - in 40 years:Here lies andres3Let Me Tell You About My Neon
June 2015,"How's the mileage with the TDI? Strongly considering a Golf SportWagen TDI for the wife. It is winning out over the Forester, even the Forester XT with leather. Regarding another post about Mazda's and Audi's, I too, find the new A3 interior to be a bit of a let down, but only as compared to what is expected of Audi interiors. I think the '06+ A3 interior was superior. Of course, a GTI today can cost more than my A3 did in 2006, so inflation is a factor. I would say the A3 still has a better interior than any Mazda, but of course you pay for it. Nothing against Mazda, and not trying to bash them, but this is my impression from the last Mazda 3 rental I had a few years back:1) All-around good economy car.2) Coming from then being a current A3 owner, it felt like it had really thin sheet metal. Experience felt like I was driving a tin can car down the road as compared to the A3 being a bank vault or tank. Tin can is a bit harsh, probably more appropriate to use that term on the late 90's Kia Sephia rental I had. But there is a noticeable difference."
June 2015,"Think all the Big 3 stereotypical owner experiences everyone always harps on the Big 3 about and many think is history but for some it is still current events and news. Breaking news. Is it 2015 or 1995? His CTS is outgunning my Neon right now for Lemon of the Century. At least my Neon didn't become a complete lemon until after year 3 was over by 1 day. Even worse when I hit 36,000 miles probably just before year 4. That being said, it did need to be towed the first morning after it's first night in the garage at home. For balance, Dodge never told me they couldn't fix it."
June 2015,Those of us who populate other boards will advise you to bring a notebook and lunch.Stand by.
June 2015,How is it a nightmare to own?
June 2015,tlong....have you looked at the 4 cyl TLX? Would that hit your budget?
June 2015,"Funny how we all have different tastes in vehicles. The wife really likes her A3 even better than her old Mazda3s which she really liked. As to being cheap inside, seems fine to us but it's the most expensive vehicle we've ever owned and our first German make...to be honest, if I had the funds, I would've gotten one instead of my Golf but feel like I got a 2/3 A3 right now. The smaller size of both vehicles was a major reason for purchasing what we did as we both like a small vehicle and we both got what we wanted here! Reliability wise, her A3 has been stellar unlike my Golf with 2 unplanned dealer visits in 5 months...can't blame the rims/tires issue on them really as I wanted the swap in the first place. Driving near the VW store this morning, saw the TDI wheels I originally wanted and still a bit pissed that they didn't listen to me but like what they substituted as I only see them on Jetta SEL models.Just wondering what'll happen once the warranty ends on both of them...if any major problems crop up and if we'll both keep them over the eight to nine year plan, Plan A. Time will tell but being the optimist that I am, I'm saying that we'll both make it to year eight...and possibly 9!The Sandman"
June 2015,"One thing I forgot to mention is that I also looked at the A3 - while I do like my cars a bit smaller (I find my TL borderline too big), the A3 was just too tight for me to like and seemed a bit too cheap inside.Regarding the Mazda, we do have an '07 Mazda 5 and I find the 4 cyl quite refined for a 4. Of course it is not a hot rod but it has a tighter turning circle, better steering feel, and is way more agile than my TL, which is probably why I would consider the Mazda 3. A fully loaded 3 is almost like a baby Bimmer and fully loaded seems to be just as nice from an interior POV, an area where to me the 3-series has always fallen a bit short."
June 2015,"tlong....good points. Only for a different reason, I keep crossing off cars off my list that might be interesting, but could be potentially a hassle to own. My CTS comes immediately to mind. Good looking. Has all the ""right stuff"". But, just a nightmare to own."
June 2015,"I don't know about that ... didn't that iteration of the TL have 225 HP? The Mazda, in ""s"" trim, has 185 HP. And, the power to weight ratio might be pretty similar.Yeah, you're giving up the smoothness of the 6 for the potential buzziness of the 4, but the better mileage may make up for that."
June 2015,"It is funny that you say that. I feel the same way: ""underwhelmed"" by not just some, but a lot of cars out there these days. Nothing jumps out at me in the looks or driving department that makes me start thinking about how long until I'm even or have equity on the loan of my Subaru. I look at the price I paid for my Subaru, the features it has that I really like (AWD, Heated Seats) and also what my monthly payment is. No my car isn't perfect, it could use more giddyup. I look at different cars and say to myself, OK this is nice, but not worth $X thousand more than my Legacy and definitely not worth $X more per month.You are going to have a tough time going from your V6 powered TL to a 4 Cyl Mazda 3 though."
June 2015,
June 2015,"Well, I'm underwhelmed by some of the cars out these days. While I could afford a quite expensive car it is not in my current desire to spend more than perhaps $35K or so. My preferences are mildly sporty but nicely appointed smaller cars. So I'm thinking either a fully loaded Mazda 3 which handles really well and can have a pretty nice interior; or perhaps a used C-class. I don't find the Bimmers nice enough inside for my tastes. I'm ok with the current A4 but frankly don't want to spend that much - I found my '98 A4 at least as appealing as the current model. And I really lament the scarcity of manual transmissions and that is probably one reason that I'm not overly motivated by a lot of the available choices. I might consider something like a VW GTI but I'm not inclined to deal with VW and their parts and service again. I find the current Jetta a bore-fest.Part of the reason I've kept the TL so long is that it is really reliable and I've not found anything that moves me a whole lot at a decent price point. So I keep driving the TL while waiting for something more interesting to come along."
June 2015,FN...cool....wanna hear all about it when you return!
June 2015,Enjoy the car & the trip! We want a full write up upon your return;)
June 2015,"that sounds nice. the car, and the trip!"
June 2015,"So after some time, we ordered Ricks new BMW, 2016 328xi GT, Imperial Blue w/ Oyster Interior. European Delivery date at The Welt Aug 28th. Spending 11 days in Europe with the car."
June 2015,
June 2015,"tlong....I know you mentioned you will keep your TL for another year, but have you started looking around yet? If so, what are you looking at?"
June 2015,"Appreciate the input you and others here have given. I guess life is too short to drive a 140 HP Civic EX Sedan 65+ miles a day over a 333 HP (underrated stock number) S4 Sedan. Of course, I don't have much fun doing the typical route on the freeway being stuck behind mind numbing traffic. However, as I've previously mentioned; I've found a very fun route home that doesn't cost much extra time but most definitely costs me extra fuel, brakes and tires. I'll trade the fun for brakes, gas, and tires though; it's worth it."
June 2015,"I agree, I'm an Audi buyer and I wouldn't touch one that has been in a moderate to major accident with a ten foot pole. Not without a big steep discount. Luckily I can just keep mine long term as it turns out it has been extremely reliable not only before the accident, but after (less one coolant hose debacle). The problem is (and the big difference is) you have some control over your miles (move your residence or buy an extra car), but you have no control over an accident that is in the history books, nor future accidents (not at fault) for that matter."
June 2015,"I guess I always figured that unless somebody was leasing, I bought the car so I might as well enjoy it. I keep my cars a long time so I don't worry about limiting my miles, I intend to use the car to the maximum. Currently at 152K on my '05 Acura TL and will probably keep it another year or so. I would say drive the car and enjoy it (the S4) and don't worry about resale value unless that is something critical to you."
June 2015,"I think your priorities are askew, the accident will be the big issue not your miles when you go and sell it."
June 2015,"According to the small claims judge the accident's diminished value was only worth $3K  That being said, it is still twice as much as the insurance company wanted to part with. $3,000 could pay for some nice modifications and improvements to increase my enjoyment even more. I just didn't plan on racking up so many miles so quickly. I'll be at 30K before you know it. Isn't there data to figure you've spent at least .25/mile? I'm probably overreacting, but I don't hate the Civic. I need to put a better sound system in it though."
June 2015,"Well, I'd have to trust the wife with the pricey S4, and she doesn't have a long commute, but she still works 5 days per week so it would still be gaining miles. She's a good driver but I wouldn't trust her 100% with the S4 until she completes a HPDE weekend (which so far I've been unsuccessful in getting her to try). Even with me behind the wheel, someone managed to get into a wreck with the S4 by being just horrible. I'm not sure the WRX STI would depreciate slower than the S4; especially considering the S4 now has 25,000 miles whereas I'm assuming you meant get a brand new WRX STI. The first 25,000 miles are the biggest.If I could live with a stick for a daily driver on congested freeways, The STI would be right up my alley. Since I don't want a stick for daily duty, Subaru is out until they develop a good dual clutch auto-manual transmission. At least they don't' embarrass the STi with a CVT option. The Golf R would be a good alternative...., but even if the S4's extra weight keeps it from handling as well, the tuning options on the S4 are quite extraordinary. You can basically turn it into an AWD muscle car that handles reasonably great considering its weight. The other consideration is the wife is starting to itch for a new vehicle after 8 years with the Civic. Something roomier would be nice since we have a 19-1/2 month old now, and possible wishes for a 2nd in the near future. The Golf SportWagon just surpassed the Forester in the running... TDI; great mileage, and right now diesel is cheap. It is ""JUUUUUSSSST"" big enough with the significantly elongated rear end, and I'm not sure any vehicle is as space efficient as the new Golfs/GTI's. The S4 has performed exemplary as the Sport Sedan disguised as a Family Sedan thus far. 2 kids is pushing it though; but maybe not until at least one of them is much older. The worst thing is being told you should go rear-facing with the car seat up to 2 years. Rear-facing takes up MUCH MORE room than front-facing, and I think the statistics that say it's 5X safer are skewed by really bad drivers."
June 2015,"If you bought the S4 to hold it's value you made a big mistake. I have 30K on my 320i and it's not even 2 yrs old, if you are worrying about mileage on your car, then next time purchase a Dodge Dart. Since your S4 has been in an accident, the value has has been depreciated already."
June 2015,"Dino: I do believe we all pick and choose which objet petit a for which we will pony up the biggest bucks.Perhaps in addition to being confused by my friend's decision to go with the thing he thinks is inferior to the BMW (or whatever) he really wants, I am made somewhat sad that he -- a very close friend -- seems to have such passion for something that is not the thing he will go ahead and spend on.There is always somewhat of a tone, a lament, as he apparently rationalizes not going for the ""thing"" about which he waxes oh so poetic and is also very knowledgeable about. He cites chapter and verse the performance stats and specifications of this, that and the other Porsche or BMW, etc, then apologizes for the KIA. This is a very successful and well educated guy. Perhaps it is that this behavior seems out of character.He has no need to apologize -- to me at least -- for his decision. Our friendship is not based upon his possessions -- and there is no way he could think that the case. Had I the means and a spouse who would permit, I'd get him an M3 or 5 series for pity's sake and hopefully enjoy -- vicariously -- him drive it.I guess a perspective could be that we all settle -- but I don't think that is the planet you are referring to. I do believe most people, most of the time, seek out and acquire the best ""things"" they can. If we all hyper-extended ourselves, we all could -- for a time -- live well beyond our means. I believe most of us with decent incomes and relatively to very good credit scores could ""score"" a $100,000 car. I assume, considering that most of us here are discussing cars that have a median or even mean cost of $50,000+/-, we could ""get a $100K car done."" By that standard, I would have to concede I have settled. I don't live or think that way -- in the particular case of the car, every mile I drive in my car has, so far, been better than the last. I'm driving what I want to drive (not that I don't also have interest in something better).Actually, it was the emotional impact of my friend, rather than touting the virtues of his new Optima, chose lamenting that it wasn't a BMW (5 series, as I recall). That's what got to me. Every mile a smile, as my wife says. If someone willfully, knowingly and deliberately starts down a path that they think will be every mile a ""frown"", well that too would be some other planet than the one I've lived on for some six decades."
June 2015,Why not just swap cars with the wife?
June 2015,"Don't do it.1. You LOVE that S4. You are going to despise every mile you put on that '07 Civic while your S4 sits at home in your garage. Cars are meant to be driven. 2. While your S4 will depreciate more so than a similar car with less miles, it won't be worth $25,000 less. What are you going to do, lease or buy your wife a Civic, Accord, or CRV? 3. The extra mileage the Civic gets will not offset the cost of acquiring another vehicle?Now, if you want to talk about a car that performs at or above the level of an S4 (which you will appreciate given the fact that you do track your car) and doesn't depreciate nearly as much, get yourself a WRX STi;)"
June 2015,Better is entirely based on your criteria. And is very subjective.
June 2015,"I often look at value. When comparing the TL-SH-AWD to the S4, I think no one would argue the S4 isn't better, the argument comes in on whether it is 10,000 or 15,000 dollars better. For me the answer was yes, in my opinion the S4 provided more bang for the buck ""value"" than did the TL. A lot of shoppers probably go off of value, and if the best product presents a law of diminishing returns, then one might just settle on a lower priced option that isn't as good, but provides better ""value."""
June 2015,"Ooooh -- burned.Or, maybe, . . . served.Either way, we all try to move (or plod) through life seeking those things we consider most important. Some of us leave the rest of us alone.Others don't.I won't go political by commenting on which of us thinks the rest of us should do it their way, but I think you get the drift.Then there's the totally plausible notion that some people truly do acquire the best of everything and don't understand why everyone else doesn't.

June 2015,"My current work commute is over double what it was when I first purchased my S4. I now have 25,000 miles already! While you only live once, this kind of mileage is racking up serious depreciation that my frugal side wasn't anticipating. I think I might have the wife get a new car so I can use her '07 Civic EX sedan as my high mileage beater. It also gets great gas mileage. With the saved fuel, maybe I'll spring for the REVO Stage 1+ pulley upgrade kit that takes the S4 to RS4 levels..... and perhaps beyond...."
June 2015,"I did like, very much, my TL SH-AWD, also liked my wife's Infiniti FX -- the engine in the FX did seem a bit more coarse than something that had an MSRP of $50K ought to have had, however. Both of us wanted to love our Japanese vehicles. There was really nothing wrong with either one of them, but they could not hold us since they lacked that je ne sais quoi that even a stripped Jetta is imbued with.You can -- and some folks here do -- remark on either the reliability or durability or both sometimes associated with owning a German car. Our experience with German cars has been very positive overall. Yet, we know about the rumors swirling around about the eventual breathtakingly expensive maintenance and repairs that we surely will face if we keep our Germans beyond, 60,000, 70,000 or even more miles.I can't argue that these dire consequences don't await us, for the highest mileage we've ever kept a German car has been 66K miles -- and that Audi felt ""new"" to me the day I traded it in (on another Audi).The European cars, most notably the German ones are, somehow, addictive to drive. I would suspect the Japanese cars still haven't cracked the code of how to be a driver's car -- no matter how highly contented or carefree they may ultimately be. For instance: The Golf R or GTI seem to be quite the bargains, and the car magazines do shower them with many positive comments and pounds of prose extolling their driving virtues. It seems to be that the same is said less often about cars from the other continents.I do understand, support and agree with everyone's right to choose to drive what Automobile or Car & Driver, et al, magazine would call 'boring cars,' but I do wonder if those who decry my critical comments about said 'boring cars' have actually spent much time behind the wheel of one of the German cars (from Audi, BMW, Mercedes and Porsche) so often fawned over by enthusiast magazine journalists? If I have misread this, I apologize without further ado.You may love your fill-in-the-blank and think my [admittedly] biased perspectives elitist or even ignorant, and that is fine with me -- I leave this post, however, once again urging you to test drive, test drive, test drive and keep test driving as many cars as possible. Makes the weekends very interesting, that much is certain.A friend of mine always ends up buying/leasing KIA's and/or Mazda's all the while waxing darn near poetic on the virtues of Audis, BMWs, Mercedes, Porsches and even a few of VW's offerings. He always wants to ""test"" my cars -- and then ultimately goes for the KIA Optima or the Mazda 3 or 6 citing that he is ""too frugal"" to go for the ""superior sports sedan""-- electing to go for the Optima which he says is better than they used to be in the suspension department and since they poached the car's designer from Audi AG, well, ""the KIA Optima is great looking too.""I can't find fault with him for wanting to be frugal -- I really don't find fault at all with his designation of what to spend his money on, of course. I do find myself confused -- I would think he (or anyone who seems to say one thing and do another) must suffer from chronic cognitive dissonance, however.Life IS too short to buy [admittedly] boring cars.No excuses."

June 2015,"My affection for the MS3 was described by an inverted bell curve from around 20k miles to 80k miles- since then I've liked it more and more(especially after I dialed in the suspension to my liking- FSDs, 50% more rear roll stiffness and a set of PSS tires worked wonders).The Club Sport and Wrangler? Always loved them, always will- never selling them."

June 2015,"Two Audis, the S4 and the S8 significantly outperform their MFGR 0-62MPH times -- but the published specs seem to suggest the S3 is, in comparison, the king of the hill next to the S4. This, my dealer says, will not continue as of the 2017's.How he/they know is beyond my sleuthing abilities.I am, however, looking forward to the B9 when it finally hits our shores in early 2016.I'm at 30K miles on my 2014 S4 -- and I must say, every time I get behind the wheel is better than the time before. Now, this is NOT to suggest that a Volvo or BMW or even a Hyundai wouldn't provide the same joy. My cousin in law just bought his second KIA Optima (is that spelled right) and he thinks it is close to the performance available in the Lexus IS cars.And, that (the Lexus) is the car that Car and Driver crowned king of the hill over the BMW 3.Things are really getting interesting -- wonder how the Millenial's feel?"
June 2015,For some reason I thought Volvo ceased making cars altogether. Good to hear they are still around and I hope the new interior dash actually has less buttons and more style.
June 2015,"Volvo is phasing out the 5 and 6 cyl. engines. the S60 is in transition, but the new XC90 is all 4 cyl. Though variations of turbo, supercharged (or both) and electric assist. so you can get a lot of power out of the little motor!"
June 2015,"Don't they still leave the option for a turbocharged V6? I seemed to see a few a couple weeks ago (T6 Drivetrain; AWD).I've read in at least one if not two car mags that they were getting 0-60 times out of the S-tronic equipped S4's at 4.5 seconds. A nice performance advantage over other cars in the 50K arena if you ask me. Is the S3 really going to outperform the S4, or just maybe keep up?"
June 2015,Volvo has gone to all 4 cyl. based engines now. Even in the new XC90.
June 2015,"""My dealer rep says, too, that ""it just won't do"" for the A6 and the S4 to share the same power rating -- if only for marketing reasons (which is not the case), so the S4 (upcoming) will have more HP and Torque. Of course another reason for the bump in power for the S4 is to make sure that as one aspires to the next Audi up the ladder -- say from S3, to S4, to S6/S7 to S8, etc. -- that the S3 doesn't outgun the S4 (which either it does currently or can, according to the test reports in the big auto magazines). The S6 has to beat the S4, too, in terms of power and measured acceleration times. And so on and so forth. ""Sounds/looks like they are tripping over themselves."
June 2015,"I have been told by my rep at The Audi Connection that HP & Torque of ALL the [US] Audi power-plants will increase. We saw, already, the 2016 A6 3.0T adopt the S4 tuning (raised the A6 to 333 HP, just like my A4), and the S6/S7 cranked up the HP or Torque or both, too.The little engine that could (the 2.0T) has had its power bumped from 200, to 211, to 220 and I believe will be again goosed to 240. Under the four-rings, the torque was always pretty strong at 258 at sub 2,000 RPMs. And, without breaking a sweat, apparently, Audi really goosed the 4-cylinder to just south of 300HP for the S3, even though there is a lame-o 2.0T (at 200HP and 207lb/ft) in the Q3 (this, I am assured, is temporary, the Q3 will soon come with the beefier 2.0T).My dealer rep says, too, that ""it just won't do"" for the A6 and the S4 to share the same power rating -- if only for marketing reasons (which is not the case), so the S4 (upcoming) will have more HP and Torque. Of course another reason for the bump in power for the S4 is to make sure that as one aspires to the next Audi up the ladder -- say from S3, to S4, to S6/S7 to S8, etc. -- that the S3 doesn't outgun the S4 (which either it does currently or can, according to the test reports in the big auto magazines). The S6 has to beat the S4, too, in terms of power and measured acceleration times. And so on and so forth. . . .I would look over a couple year period for the performance envelope to be pushed (upward) by increases, across the lineup, of HP and Torque.Now, of course, we will have engines other than gas and hybrids and so on -- my assumption is that if the diesel SQ5 were to be offered (in the US) even though it's HP would be down, its torque would be up and through tuning and transmission choices, the ""S"" - ness of the vehicle would not be compromised.Probably wishful thinking on my part to imagine Audi of America would actually bring the SQ5 in diesel trim to the US.Look for all of the Europeans, Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Volvo and VW to name just a few, to continue the march upward in HP and Torque achieved using 4, 5 and 6 cylinder engines and dropping or reducing the number of and application of V8s, V10s, V12s and W12s.I have not heard anything about decreasing the power,Of course, you could be thinking of the smaller displacement engines Audi (among others) offers in markets other than the US. There are smaller (than 2.0T) engines offered by Audi in some of its cars in Europe, for example -- both in gas and diesel configurations.My answer assumes you were talking about US bound Audi engine offerings."
June 2015,Mark...asking you this question given how much you love Audi. Am I reading correctly that the new A4s are dropping HP and torque to go to a less powerful 4 cyl motor? That seems to fly in the face of everything the other ELLPS competitors are doing.

My Jetta had its bugs (right speaker issues, thin tires loved potholes) BUT it was a nice driving car, engine revved but in 6th on highwY was very quiet (comp to g35). Quick yes, torque stear you bet but solid feeling that mark talks of. I had the car for its 4 year warrantee and 35k? Miles and was told by a Vw guy to get out and I did. Prob due the same when the s4 is up on warrantee and prob go back to Japanese to spead the love and know after said warrantee I won't get banged with German bills. Can you name the song and artist for the lyrics below?

Of course, then I'd probably complain that it needs the 8-spd, being the kind of guy who is never happy (well, not really, jus' a little bit)."
June 2015,"Beer was indeed cold, and the Grinders were indeed good. Can't ask for much more than that. Sat outside looking at the Audis come and go.

Dealers within a 3-4 mile radius of the Grinder place.Observations...-As big as the new Chevy Tahoe is, it's a looker.-Escalade must be doing well. We saw 4 of them turnaround with dealer tags....big and lit up like Christmas-saw one Mercedes CLS (very sharp), 2 CLAs, and one C Class that hooked like demos pulling in and out of the parking lot-numerous A4s, a6s and whatever the small SUV is that Audi is selling pulling in and out of their dealer"

But, something tells me it will. Darn things look so 1980's aftermarket to me -- I like the integrated look. The Porsche Macan has the dashboard look I would prefer -- but someone, somewhere has decreed the pop-up screens to be coool, I guess."
June 2015,"Hey Mark:Good to hear the Maxima's pictures don't do the car justice, as they aren't flattering, at all. I just came from Nashville for a conference, myself. Nashville is one of those places that are a ""tweener"" for me. It's right between ""do I fly? do I drive?""Given that the conference was being held in the Gaylord (where parking is $25/nt), 1 work day lost driving up and back, which is the real cost of driving. Cheap airfare ($350). I flew. Left at :6:30 a.m., arrived in time for a full dya's work, using the hotel's airport shuttle. That doesn't even count the gas, wear, etc.Chicago is another one that's a tweener, especially if you're staying downtown, where parking can run $50/day.BTW...was next door to your Audi dealer last night meeting some friends at a ""Grinder"" joint. I parked right behind two S4s, one blue, one white. They haven't changed at all since I had mine ('13)."

June 2015,"Business trip is a different story for sure. My (large) company doesn't even allow it. Last time I went to our office in VA I decided to drive, and had to rent a car locally."
June 2015,"This trip was a business trip -- a second demonstration of software my company sells to a large prospect. A very good revenue opportunity. I am one of the owners of the company and the CEO. The CTO of the company and I were going to make a two-hour presentation and move the needle toward ""buy."" When we travel for marketing reasons we figure any flight takes about 4 hours all in. Chicago, drive. Cleveland, drive. New York, fly. Nashville @ 3:45, drive (and besides the cost of 2 round trip tickets was over $2K). We pay $.55 per mile for using ""your"" personal car. The rental plus gas for this trip was about $150, hotel another $240 (we stayed at the ""Maxwell House""). At over 600 miles total, there would have been a significant cost increase in using a personal vehicle.What kind of example would it set if I used a personal car and charged the company @$.55 per mile x 600+ miles? The next trip to, er, Pittsburgh where I am not going would cost what?So, driving it like I live is EXACTLY what I did. Now, were I to return to Nashville for a pleasure trip (and Nashville is worthy of such a trip if you axed me), I would take either the S4 or the SQ5.By the way, the return trip, at 85mph further solidified my opinion that even a bare bones Jetta really is in no danger of being called the enemy of great -- this car IS great. While in Nasville, I saw and looked into a new Maxima -- in some kind of deep red-wine metallic color with sick wheels. Wow -- this is a looker, I'll give it that. And, afterwards I went on-line to ""build"" one -- they can be had fully decked out in sport trim for an MSRP under $40K. Actual prices, I would assume would be less. Of course, looks can be superficial -- but to repeat, this car has the looks.In any case, given the circumstances, would you have said to your colleagues, ""the most expensive way to get to and from Nashville, by car, is the way we're gonna do it?"" Not if you drive it like you live, you wouldn't."

Some of us are less then die-hards, and use our ""fun"" vehicle in day to day driving and tremendous high traffic situations which would make using a manual unpleasant at times. They went from an ancient low efficiency 4-speed automatic to CVT; not exactly progress. Now when I have the garage space and unlimited bank account I'll have the R8 for weekends and the S4 can be grocery hauler. If I needed something really big then a Q7 or Toureg would be nice with the 3.0 diesel unit. Anyone ever see a Golf R on the road or in a dealership yet? It seems to be a unicorn."
June 2015,"Granted, the R/T isn't all that fast(0-60 in 5.1 seconds) but I'd think that demo R/T manual I found would be a good deal at around $33k. H-K sound, heated/cooled seats, heated wheel, Super Track Pack, summer tires- nicely equipped, in other words. And Dodge has a few performance pieces that add about 20 hp without affecting the warranty.I still have the CPO '15 WRX STI to check out. I didn't know that the vanilla WRX got EPS while the STI tiller is still hydraulic. A BIG plus for me(along with the Brembo Brakes, no hole in the roof, and configurable torque split). And I like the 7 yr./100k mile Subaru CPO warranty.It's a great time to be shopping for entertaining cars."

Just the giant doors would grow tiresome real quick I think. I liked the WRX I saw a few weeks back at the Sube dealer. not sure what level, but it had a moonroof, and IIRC was right about at 30K sticker. 6 speed of course. I was afraid to drive it, for obvious reasons."

June 2015,"I don't think the standard R/T would ever be enough for me, personally. Scat Pack or nothing. Honestly, though, I have a really hard time navigating the Dodge build page to figure out the differences in models other than engine. But equipping an R/T with Tech, Premium, and Nav gets $43,595while a Scat Pack is $45,175 with Tech ... but I can't get Nav in that car?? And somehow leather seats are bundled in the Tech pack with the Scat Pack but not the Tech pack in the R/T. SSSOOOO confusing.Oh, wait, found the Nav as a standalone option on the Scat Pack. So total is $45,870. Only $2300 more than a regular old R/T? Seems like a no-brainer to me."

June 2015,"Gotcha. I never thought of that. In your case I can understand. You were able to rent cars you were interested in on the cheap. In your case it also makes sense because the cars in your stable have over 100K miles on them (no disrespect, I'm sure they could handle the road trip the way you maintain them), but you never know. @markcincinnati has 2, newer Audi S cars that are under factory warranty. Quite different from the Jetta he rented."

June 2015,"I do like German cars -- but I also liked my Acura TL, often comparing it favorably to an S4. Assuming you're correct regarding the ""popularity"" of VW for the reasons you cite (and I am taking your assertions as accurate), it is a shame. Since the cars' reliability and/or durability and the dealer experiences apparently suck, I can understand their waning sales. Yet, this Jetta is solid, the transmission is great and the steering is communicative. Now, in the course of 700 miles, assuming I have no reliability issues, my perception of the greatness of the car will probably remain unchanged.VW should be ashamed of itself if the reliability and dealer experience isn't corrected sooner rather than later.Speaking of perspectives, I also enjoyed our Infiniti -- kept it 39 months, and other than a new set of tires, the thing was as close to flawless (in terms of the driving experience, reliability and durability) as one would expect. I did test the Q50S, the Lexus 350 F-Sport (and even ordered one) -- so I can understand and support several non-German cars as great. My specific rant pertaining to Toyotas was just that, remarks pertaining to Toyota, not all non-German cars. I do test drive a lot of cars, and I rent a lot of cars -- the rental experiences typically allow me to drive hundreds of miles in a given example. The Toyotas typically and specifically are a huge disappointment -- which confuses me considering their apparent sales successes. Hondas, to name another Asian brand, on the other hand, do not suffer from this good enough approach. The Hyundai Genesis, and Kia Optoma too are examples of cars that certain seem to not be satisfied with a good enough approach.A few days ago when I started this ""I'm disappointed in"" Toyota thread, I did only mention Toyota and that still stands. The phrase, ""I hate Toyotas"" is simply my way, in this forum of supporting the notion that good is the enemy of great.The good news is, it certainly seems that a lot of folks are participating and voicing their opinions on this and other subjects, which, from my perspective is a good thing, what this ""tool"" (the Edmunds forum) is all about."
June 2015,"As a family that recently bought an Audi and a VW, we are happy with them even though my VW has already had an issue and had to go into the shop. Going in, I knew this could happen so I wasn't too unhappy when they came and let me know they'd be sending me home in a loaner. Today, I tried to charge my cell in the two power plugs and nothing happened, tried multiple chargers and nothing worked so will have to stop over tomorrow and see what's up. Thinking it will be a blown fuse at this point and hope it is...if not, we'll see how they handle it. Must say this kind of issue never happened with our Toyota's, Honda or Hyundai's but again, I knew going in with any VW product that there might be some issues to deal with. And with both the A3 and Golf being first year models, things do happrn!The Sandman"
June 2015,"I've heard nothing but good about their stuff, too!"
June 2015,You mostly thought it was great because it was cheap but still had a great feel to the drive.  Makes sense since you like german cars.  VW sales have not been that good as many people do not consider them great at all because repair records and crappy dealer experiences.  At that price point more cars are bought than rented(leased) and people are looking for low maintenance and repair and longevity.  They look at many of the Asian cars for that reason. You seem to have a hard time looking at things from a different perspective than your own.
June 2015,"Today, to save some miles and money, I rented a car from Enterprise to drive from Cincinnati to Nashville.I asked for a full-size car and was presented with a new gas powered Jetta -- I assume it would be considered the base car. I have only a rough idea of how much this car costs. I have been given Nissan cars, Toyota cars, Jeeps and on and on as rentals. This was my first Jetta rental.Drove the thing at a steady 80MPH stopping south of Bowling Green for a bio break.Car's computer says 39.6MPG.Compared to most of the cars that pass as full size rental fleet offerings, this seems to be the great car I started on about when I was being critical of Toyotas. Now, it has no nav, no power seats, no heated seats and the sound system is strictly AM and FM -- and if it has blu-tooth, well, I can't figure out how to make it work. But the car is competent, no, no, VERY competent at the thing that a car must be competent at -- the driving experience. It is, at its price point, great.I would assume a stroll through the option list could make this car much more expensive and, yes, it would be ""nicer"" -- but how could it be anything else, starting with a great base car like this.This is the salmon I wish dear ol' mom would have introduced me to.My personal vehicles or my personal willingness to dump $X into a car have nothing to do with great vs good -- this Jetta should be purchased by other car companies, disassembled and examined and within reason imitated.If this car can be produced and marketed for what I assume would be considered a ""cheap"" MSRP by ELLPS mfgrs and customers, there ought to be no reason others -- including Toyota -- couldn't do it, too.You don't need to equate great with big bucks.DOH!Homer."

June 2015,"Do you all follow the conventional rule of thumb or wisdom that says make your HT budget, then use 50% on speakers, 25% on power/processing, 15% on media/disk player(s), 10% on Cabling/wiring.That's what I've seen and read in multiple places, and I think it's good advice. The equation isn't so simple when a friend already has pretty good bookshelves, and a lame duck Sony receiver. He's like how can Sony be lame? I just say receivers are not Sony's bread and butter unless you have an ES model. I had him add a good old Energy 8"" sub woofer I sold him for $100 plus $15 for the cable, plus 1/2 of shipping. Then I had him add new 12 ga. Blue Jeans speaker cables most recently, with banana plug ends to replace his 100 ga. wire strands (I use the plural loosely; it was horrible how little wire he was using, but I'm joking about the 100 gauge. Most likely it was 20 ga or so but he had about 20% of the strands connected in the end at best. Night and Day improvements. I think about $200 best spent! In this case, 10 to 15% on wiring was wrong given his existing already installed situation."

June 2015,"Certainly true, and so long as you're the only one who knows, it's irrelevant. However, the ""mine's bigger than yours"" factor also kicks in with a veneance. Witness many of the posts here and elsewhere.Not that that's a bad thing; keeps the economy moving and all that."
June 2015,"I was patient and bought most of my HTS components when they were discounted ahead of newer models being released. My basement gaming system was really put together on the cheap, picking up an Energy 5.1 system for less than 50% of MSRP and using the speaker cables and HTR from my previous 6.1 system that I replaced when I upgraded my main system to 7.1.This is just my opinion, but I think once you spend much over $5,000-$7000(street price) on components-exclusive of installation-the Law of Diminishing Returns kicks in with a vengeance."
June 2015,"15K that is a starter kit for most Audiophiles. When I was hunting for HTS for our current house, I was amazed on what people wanted to sell me, one place told me for the money, Mirage speakers was great, but didn't like how they sounded. I had a very high end business talk to me about Transmission Audio, I'd never heard them before, but once I figured the the guy was playing with me, I had a good laugh, Price for the speakers, well, if you have to ask you can't afford them, but was told a million for each speaker.. So are they great speakers? To someone, yes, not to me they are not."
June 2015,"I find this whole discussion funny, I made a comment a week or so ago that, the people who buy Camry's and Accords do so because they like them and they think they are great cars.. So that is who defines them as being great. I like Mark, but the Camry is beneath he and his wife, he has every right not to call the Camry or Accord not great cars. Some people look at cars are appliances, and those are the people who look at a 20K Camry and call them great, they don't care about handling or acceleration, they are looking for a comfortable car that starts every time they get into and doesn't cost a lot of money to maintain."
June 2015,"Agreed, the same thing is true with home theater equipment, some people are happy as a pig in mud with a 42"" LED and an Insignia HTIB. Others aren't happy unless they have the latest projector, four subs, and $15k worth of amps and processors. Everyone has their own comfort level as I see it. When I install a HTS for someone the first thing I ask is how much money they want to spend- then I try to find the absolute best components to meet that price point."
June 2015,"Exactly. I could tell you all the reasons why my Mini Cooper S is a ""great"" car---compact, fast, great on gas, good-looking, room for a 6-footer, plenty of room for basic luggage & carrying stuff, solidly built, really fun to drive, easy to park, the perfect City car.....and yet, put another person in that same car and you might hear: ""too small...I don't need all that power....I don't like the speedometer in the middle of the dashboard.....rides too hard....expensive to repair...mediocre reliability record....too pricey for such a small car....""And we would both be absolutely correct."
June 2015,"But again, how do you define great? Some people could not care less how it drives. Some people see great as super-reliable, low prices and low cost to operate. That is ""great"" for THEM. Who are you, sir to define what ""great"" means to THEM? BTW, I also think ""great"" should also include how it drives, but others seemingly disagree. I simply don't assume to have authority to know what great means for everybody. I just know what it means to me."
June 2015,"You simply are not going to get a great car, by YOUR definition , for the $20k that a base Camry goes for.  To most of those that buy one I would venture to say they consider it a great car by THEIR definition.  You can feel sorry for them for not recognizing excellence but I doubt they care. Self awareness is a wonderful thing."
June 2015,"It is true, I hope for the stuff we humans produce to be great -- and I would hope everyone would have the opportunity to enjoy everything they experience and have at the highest level possible at a given price point. What or where or when did I suggest that I would compare a Rolls to a Honda. My point has been to start a conversation regarding greatness at a given price point -- any price point. Somehow, however, it seems that we're actually now saying that ""good enough"" is, hmm, good enough. Do we now tell our children, their teachers, our leaders, etc, that it is ""OK"" to not go for great?How could it belittle anyone to urge them to strive for ""the best"" (at every price point) -- I've not suggested that the customer who shops for a Chevy is any less entitled to the best (at that price point) than is the Rolls buyer (at that price point).Everything made and done is not great -- I assume we all would agree to that. I am hoping to spark the conversation to perhaps contemplate that we simply shouldn't settle for good enough no matter how much or little we pay.I just think that good enough or good has begat an erosion of what we'll accept -- hence the term dumbing-down. We, at times, seem complacent -- we accept good enough, we don't ""demand"" great.Again and finally -- I keep saying ""at every, at any . . .price point.""Good enough isn't."
June 2015,"Well, I think it increasingly looks like Mark is belittling others' choices. Seems like it's not enough for him that he wouldn't buy Toyota, he doesn't want you buy one, either - because if you do, the world will be in his words ""dumbed down"". Those who don't care about great handling, but just want an inexpensive, reliable, made well-enough transportation from A to B should get their priorities straightened out, or else. It's a bit like somebody lamenting all those factory-made suits - if everybody just went to a tailor, world would be so much better place, wouldn't it (we wouldn't have to look at cheap suits)? Never mind half of the population wouldn't be able to afford them, but hey, who cares - we would have beautiful suits for probably slightly lower price than today (a few more tailors competing). There is no bread? Then let them eat cake."
June 2015,"My creed has always been ""Don't let great be the enemy of good enough"".  When I worked for a government contractor, we had to continually stress to our design engineers that the customer asked for a Chevy and we shouldn't build a Rolls Royce.  Mainstream cars (in my case Hondas) are good enough for 95% of US drivers.  I have had fresh salmon - two Mercedes bought new - but Honda/Toyota/etc serve my purposes perfectly.  We each should buy what fills our needs, and no one should belittle those choices.  You were not doing that but I have seen others that do so.  I would never buy an Audi because of the stories I have heard about long-term quality issues.  But, I don't hate Audi.  Just don't want one.  Your mileage may vary."
June 2015,I earned a LOL badge today my life is now complete
June 2015,"Counter-counterpoint:With a smile on my face and malice toward none, this seems somewhat of an apology on behalf of Toyota. My point and question is why not build a great car at every price point. I do think the Toyota is probably a good car -- and, as someone says (not just someone but Voltaire, born in 1694) -- ""good is the enemy of great."" I would agree with something here -- ""95% of the buying public has no . . . need for an ELLPS."" Their interest level is harder to ascertain, but, assuming you are correct that 95% have no interest, I would be made both sad and fearful. I assume you assume they -- the 95% -- have no interest because . . .um, they have never been exposed to greatness (at THAT particular price point)?Let me give you an irrelevant comparison -- while growing up, my mother fixed this nasty-tasting ""entree"" she called salmon patties. They looked like a cross between a hamburger and what, today, I think of as a mostly-crab, crab-cake. The taste, after frying was, well, horrible. But, hey, it's Friday so well it was either fried smelt or salmon patties; so after a while I actually ate the salmon patties entirely. I don't think I ever liked them, but I did learn to tolerate them. Eventually, in a sentimental, not logical or rational, moment I was told I actually said (I deny this) ""salmon patties are good."" Perhaps, salmon patties are good compared to, er, hmm, DIRT! Time and tide, time and tide -- and I eat (in college) at a nice restaurant and the special of the day is salmon. First off, when it comes, I barely recognize it, and then when I taste it, I know for sure ""this sure as hell isn't salmon!"" Salmon is great, I love salmon -- I had grown to accept canned salmon [allegedly] as good. How much is an Avalon or a Camry? Don't answer that, the point is not how much it costs it's that for THAT much money, it ought to be possible to build a great car, not just a good one that has a lot of stuff for the money. Now, if the stuff is what actually makes it great -- and NOT the driving experience or its capabilities -- well, then I don't know what we're all talking about here. We COULD add navigation and blu-tooth to a Trabant I would assume, but that wouldn't make it even a good car, it would still be a bad car that just happen to have sat-nav.I don't think everyone needs or wants or should need or want an ELLPS -- I do think we all deserve to know what real salmon tastes like, so to speak. These super popular ['good' car] brands, Toyota being the one I chose to exemplify my point, are just one of the contributors the great dumbing-down we're ""enjoying"" these days."
June 2015,@andres3 I think if it's sub 60 comp equipped then it's ball park- more power and awd seems like a real screamer - plus add in some Amg and boom - you have a real contender to the s4:/5 batman and robin. I'm sure the next 340 will be 350hp plus and I would also assume the next s will be closer to 4 then it is now. Can say this owning one it's amazing with the optional sports diff- best 1k you can buy- car is on rails at insane speeds into turns. One option that's a must - sure we all want the nav and special speakers but in the turns it's the real diff maker- this car with 19* and sports diff kicks [non-permissible content removed].

June 2015,"Cadillac is on the cusp of recovery I think. It takes a car company as long to crawl out of the hole it dug for itself, as it did to dig it in the first place. So if Cadillac went on the skids 1975-1995, then it's about time for a rebirth. But don't count on this company ever reclaiming its former glory from the 1950s. The market has expanded too much and the competition is a lot more fierce. The ATS and Q40 have to go head to head with some pretty nice cars."
June 2015,"Interesting numbers that show the power of brand equity. BMW may have softer steering but their reputation will take decades to unravel even if they don't spiff up their latest 3-series. Audi is arguably nicer but look at their sales. And the ATS has had many raves for handling but Caddy doesn't have a great reputation (earned by decades of junk) and that's not going to change very quickly, either."
June 2015,ATS still getting hammered for some reason. Q40 needs an update.
June 2015,Poor Cadillac.

June 2015,"I have nothing against Camrys but when a friend of mine said they were ""great cars"", I felt compelled to correct him saying, ""good cars yes, but hardly great ones"". I told him there was a reason why the USA was the only major market (including Japan IIRC) where the Camry was at or near the top in sales. Now Toyota is running ads proclaiming the ""Bold, New Camry"". Since doesn't look particularly new and has no outstanding performance characteristics I think they're making a mistake. These claims have little credibilityand even worse, they are aimed at the wrong market since I think Camry shoppers would prefer safe, sturdy and reliable to bold or new."

So I have some free days at National, so when I arrived at Newark Airport at 11:15pm (thank you mother nature for our 2 hours delay) the pickings where mighty slime, The first car I went for was a new Camaro, but when I walked up to the car, someone was sitting it, damn... Then I saw the Arrest me red 2015 Dodge Challenger, first time driving the LH cars with the new 8 spd transmission and updated interior. WOW.. What a fun car, even though it rained the entire time I was in Jersey the car was still fun. Nice thick leather steering wheel, If I was blind folded and felt the wheel, I would have sworn it was the M Sport Wheel from BMW, that is how nice it was. The transmission had a sport mode, which only seemed to change the shift pattern of the transmission to be more aggressive, the seats were very nice, comfortable and supportive. Fit and Finish was first rate, the dash, door panels felt nice.. Even though the LH cars are big, they drive great, I was very surprised on how well they drive...

BUT.... The more I read up on the 535d and after having one for a full weekend, I'm slowly leaning that route. Hard to beat 30+ on the highway and high 20's around town in the F10.

June 2015,"I currently drive a 2013 Volvo S60 T5, but have owned a Camry and 2 Avalons, the last one a 2005. The Toyotas did what I expected of them - Provide good, reliable transportation. The 2005 Avalon was a great highway cruiser. Very solid and comfortable. Fun to drive - Not so much. I get that from the Volvo. I guess it all depends on what you're looking for when you make the purchase. At the time I bought the Toyotas, fun to drive was not high on my list of priorities, as I was building a career and raising a family. I now have the option of indulging my fun to drive craving. I still have a lot of appreciation for what Toyota offers to car buyers."
June 2015,"BTW, that Hilux episode of Top Gear was amazing. They beat the snit of it, subjecting it to all kinds of abuses. starting ""gently"" by numerous fender benders, escalating to more and more serious peril.

June 2015,"Counterpoint.. Camrys and Avalons are great... at doing what they were designed for. I'd posit that they are better at their intended function, than most of the cars in this discussion.As an ELLPS, probably not that great. But, that's not what they are. 95% of the buying public has no interest or need for an ELLPS. They need reliable, comfortable, efficient transportation. The Camry and Avalon are great at that.Don't see how that has an effect on how great your ELLPS might be. Maybe it's the 95% of people that you have a problem with, not the car companies that give them exactly what they want and need."
June 2015,"dino001, excellent points.  Lot of folks out there don't consider driving to be joyful but a chore in need of a tool.  A cheap but dependable tool."
June 2015,"I would not buy Toyota vehicle, although I noticed they improved their styling and interiors considerably. In its own right, Toyotas are actually great cars, they just emphasize things that are not important to you and ignore those that are. If you ever watched Top Gear episode on Hilux (Euro version of Tacoma), you'd absolutely say that Toyota makes great cars - for those who have particular expectations, vastly different from yours. To hate Toyota the way you describe it, is to hold all those people in contempt and declare your life priorities as the only ones worth considering, which I think is too far. Some people simply care about price, fuel economy and durability, cheap maintenance. Toyota absolutely excels in those. Those people buy their vehicles to keep them for 10 years, they'd rather spend the money somewhere else. Those are valid life choices, regardless how hard you find that to fathom. You may still hate them, but to say they don't make great cars is only an opinion, not fact."
June 2015,"It's after 11PM, I'm feeling a bit peckish -- and for some reason I feel the need to post the following:I, for reasons that would take more explanation that worthwhile, hate Toyotas -- and, after today, I have to say, I really hate the Avalon even more than the Camry, if that is possible.I'll, for me, net this out -- good is the enemy of great. Toyota's, especially the two noted above, are the epitome of good cars -- and that is what makes them so, er, hate-worthy.I know these are really very popular cars -- the things are everywhere. Isn't there any way to make great cars at every price point? Really, really -- good is the enemy of great and, therefore, perhaps, good is evil as it makes us dumb down our expectations. While these cars may be incredibly reliable, they suck the joy out of driving and will be, in the end, the reason self-driving cars will be here in an alarmingly short time from now.Not sure, but I can make the case for hating Lexus products (for the most part) too.I need a sandwich."
June 2015,"The Q50 lost to the TLX in a few reviews, not by much, however. After a few months, I really like the lower NVH from the last gen G. (They have dealer-installed kit to enhance the exhaust note that a review thought was very effective.) Also liked the Q style over the TLX. The sport seats are great but I believe BMW is a notch up, IMHO. I could live in the Q for many miles at a time!"
June 2015,Flight- What's your next Bimmer- a 340?
June 2015,"Well I think the idea is to create an atmosphere that the TLX is just as good as your German sedan hence the tagline ""How do you say your lease is up in German?"""
June 2015,"I attended BMW's annual drive event (they do those every late spring in my area) at my dealership. I like those, as you get a car without a salesman. I drove 428i Gran Coupe and souped up 335ix with sport transmission and bunch of other options, all M-Sport related. 335 was fast, but I already knew that before, so it didn't overwhelm me with awesome power. The new LCI steering update is just in time, as even souped up 335 still had that soft feel. The positive surprise was 428 GC. It was Luxury Line. I think they continue working on this engine and it probably improved since the introduction. I pushed it harder this time and it produced a decent low-pitch grunt that I didn't hear before. I also proved fairly quick. I was skeptical for long time, but I'm warming up a little to a possibility of giving up on the six-cylinder for the economy (both price and fuel). The steering in 428 was also a bit better than 335 (there are wider wheeltrack and same wheelbase, also reportedly slight suspension differences between 3- and 4-series). LCI could not have come fast enough, let's hope some of that steering feedback is restored. I anticipate even 4-series will benefit, too, hopefully they'll bring it sooner than full year from now. I suspect that once the LCI dust settles it will be for me between 328 wagon and 428 or 435 Grand Coupe. There is also Gran Turismo, but it's too cow-ish so far. I have time to decide. Seems it works for my benefit - the deals will get better, as the model ages. The reliability should also go up."
June 2015,At least it is a really nice car. I was quite smitten with the one I played around in last week while at the dealer.
June 2015,"We talked here about Acura losing its way, not more precisely never really making it in this category. The latest TLX commercial is a perfect example - lack of its own identity seems not enough for them, they had to invoke that idiotic German (catchy, but meaningless) tune. The visual was actually not bad, but the tune simply idiotic. They should fire those who authorized it. There are many ways I could see TLX advertised, mostly as ""all-included"" luxury with a sporty slant. The last message they want to convey is ""me to"" (as there is enough of existing perception of that), but this stupid German tune does exactly that."
May 2015,"Moreno was an intern at Automobile magazine and then worked for Saturn. Chambers hired in as the manager of his Saturn store and Moreno moved up to VP supervising 9 Chambers' locations. In 2005, MB offered to finance his purchase of a struggling dealership in Cleveland. Since then he has opened up 30 stores - MB, Porsche, Acura, Lotus, Aston, Infiniti.MB only opens a store if they see potential for increased business. They wouldn't saddle a business with a $20 million building if it was a zero sum game. I'm guessing there was a demand for that open point as south of Cincinnati since the next closest store is in Lexington. His store here in my town was considered an open point. It's equidistant from two other MB stores (about 20 miles). It serves the suburbs NW of Boston and also tens of thousands of potential customers who work in the executive parks in town."
May 2015,I've heard of Herb....mostly out East. But. I'd never heard of Moreno until he moved into the Cincinnati area. He's done well in the short time he's been down this way.My guess is he's put a significant dent in the Cincinnati new Mercedes market by takig away business from the established player in Montgomery and West Chester.
May 2015,@robr2 and @graphic_guy - I've driven past the mb dealership and it's amazing - herb decided to shoehorn his mb in Somerville underneath a highway with limited parking and now packaged with a smart car dealership- no ideal for said customers but good for herb because they put a heli pad on the roof so very convenient for big Bruins or celtics games. My used experience with herb was terrible because they tell you what you should pay- had issues with 2 cars Honda and Audi and bot elesewhere.
May 2015,"Moreno openec up the most st recent Mercedes dealer in the Cincinnati area (actually, it's in Northern KY, just across the bridge from Cincinnati, over the Ohio River).The two oldest Mercedes dealers in the Cincinnati area are owned by the same principal. And, he could learn a thing or two from Moreno.If my wife ever decides to buy a Mercedes,which she might, it will be from Moreno's dealership,,which is the furthest from where we live and further away than the other two Mercedes dealers."
May 2015,"It's all relative. In their home world they have more then twice of engine choices, with option numbers just mind-boggling. American price sheet for the 3-series is three or four pages, the one in Europe is a 30 page booklet. So, in fact, American ordering is very simplified when compared with other markets. It's of course reflected in the pricing. I also know they run a system with dealers in full control of the ordering options within allocations, as opposed to many other manufacturers, who often push their choice of options on dealers. This of course means that people like me, who have taste outside of the ""mainstream"" are still at mercy of Joe, the dealer's ordering manager, but at least they allow to order anything that's on the list."
May 2015,"I have been told that Porsche really is flexible when it comes to ordering from them, just because the website does not allow it doesn't mean you can't get it your way. The same with BMW, just have to ask."
May 2015,"I ordered my E46, didn't on my 320i, we are ordering Ricks GT, as well as my next BMW. BMW last year 2014, did 22K European Delivery's at the Welt last year (this includes people from around the world, not just in the US.) that number is up from the previous year. BMW BMW does more European Delivery then MB and Audi. Of course BMW dealers really don't push this, as they too want instead sales, as well as the SA... But it appears more and more people are doing it.
markcincinnati said:In fact, our Audi dealer says that AoA's creation for the US market of Premium, Premium Plus and Prestige was created to ""simplify"" car buying (for who, the dealers? the customers?), by bundling options into groups that mirror what customers want.
Audi's parent company is VW, and VW doesn't have many options on their cars either.. I like the fact that you can order pretty much what you want in a BMW"
May 2015,"I'm all for packaging options, as long as it makes sense. I really don't want to deal with all individual options, especially on the used car market. I actually think Honda has historically done a good job. DX, LX, EX, EX-L. Then just add Nav and/or RES. Of course, that wouldn't work with all the crazy things you can get on a luxo car. What Caddy did with the V Sport is definitely not the right way to go, though. 2 versions: Base or Luxury: $10k difference! But if you are the type of person that insists on a moonroof, then you have to pony up $10k to get it. That's just ridiculous.The thing that REALLY bugs me is when they force you to get certain packages you might not want to get one that you do or lose other things you like. For example, when pricing a Macan, I found if you want the 14-way power seat, you HAVE to pay an additional $525 for the heated seats option (so why not just add that into the price of the 14-way seat to begin with?!) AND you lose the alacantra inserts, which I would very much prefer."
May 2015,"No that is only on the 550i... I sort of laugh at the guys who beat their chest about owning one, then come to find out that the N63 engine has major problems, that can run up to 10K to fix (but BMW has stepped up and covered the cost with a retro fix.) Now the dealer has been replacing the battery in them too at each service.. This is why I believe the 535d is the best choice in the 5 series line up.."
May 2015,"No doubt, Herb has great business. I bought two Hondas from him and felt the pricing was fair. As the biggest dealer in the Boston area, it's natural for him to be the biggest advertiser. At least he's not pretending to be working in the service department like Ernie Boch. I've looked at some used cars from Herb with smart pricing and checked over at Real World Trade In Values and the numbers are pretty much on target. The service at Honda is reasonable for basic things.The MB dealership just up the street from Audi Burlington is an even more amazing place. The manicure bar is complimentary and all the sales associates are trained to properly prepare the Ospina coffee. They jumped through hoops in order to please the town in terms of trucks exiting the property and building design and are hosting town events at the dealership - next week is a high school art exhibit and reception. IIRC, total investment in the building was $15 million and they started up with over 100 MB's on opening day.Bernie Moreno from Cleveland is the owner - he used to work for Chambers before going to Ohio. My understanding is that Chambers is upset about MBUSA for giving Moreno - or anyone else - the location. That's why his lawyer is making noise and veiled threats at the town."
May 2015,"Funny thing...I've heard people complain when they don't have enouhg options to craft a new car with the exact options they want, and others who complain about having too many options. Can't win if you're the manufcturer, it seems.I don't know how BMW justifies all the options, as the cost for having such a laundry list of different possible configurations costs in parts inventory, admistrative overhead, and manufacturing complexity.But, you pay for all of that flexibiity."
May 2015,"I sometimes ordered my new BMWs(and once needed my salesperson to go to the mat with Munich when BMW wanted an ""optional"" sunroof to become mandatory), but the crux oof my complaint is that BMW still bundles some options. It's fine to offer packages that combine popular options at a perceived ""savings,"" but I wish that BMW would take a page out of Mini's playbook and make every option available individually. I suppose it's a moot point for me; after 32 years of continuous ownership(not to mention years of service in BMW CCA at both the chapter and national level) I've almost totally lost interest in the marque- I recently sold one of my BMWs and will likely cull at least one more from the fleet."
May 2015,"Just curious, what with the discussion about BMW's ""endless"" combination of options, etc: How many folks [here] buy/lease cars ""in-stock"" vs ordering and waiting? In my experience, the only person -- besides me -- I know who ""always"" orders her German cars is my wife.In fact, our Audi dealer says that AoA's creation for the US market of Premium, Premium Plus and Prestige was created to ""simplify"" car buying (for who, the dealers? the customers?), by bundling options into groups that mirror what customers want.This argument always confuses me since these option groupings seem to pop up somehow -- who is it that participated in a focus group that allowed the marketing folks to put ""this"" on Premium versions and ""that"" on Prestige, and so forth?In any case, this BMW approach of offering endless combinations and permutations would seem to be car ordering people's dream come true -- but then I recall I really don't know anyone who regularly and frequently orders their new Audi, BMW or Mercedes. Moreover, the dealers' inventories continue to swell, which also would seem to discourage ordereing.The question is posed: do more than 50% of ""us"" who participate in posting here actually order their new ELLPS cars, or do we get ""close enough for jazz"" and buy off the lot?"
May 2015,No word yet on whether the LCI F3x 3ers will need a new battery at every Oil Service...
May 2015,"man, BMW has gone off the rails with this stuff. between having about 20 different models, and these endless (and convoluted) option configurations, it could take a math PhD with a cray all day to figure out what to order!"
May 2015,"There are three types of suspensions: standard, M-sport (704) available on ""i"" models with both ZMP and and ZTR and adaptive M-sport (2VF) available on ""i"" and ""x"" models with same packages. S-line is standard, indeed, but it was changed to not include 704, just like it didn't on ""x"" models. I stand by my statement. The standard suspension will be retuned to be more sporty, but that's not sport suspension."
May 2015,Here is the ordering guide to show you Dino (and I highlighted) that the sport suspension is standard.
May 2015,"Dino you are wrong....The Sport line is now standard with the old sport line suspension as well as seats, in fact for $700 you can get the old DHP (Dynamic Handling Package) but the Variable Steering can be had on the standard Sport package, but can be had with the Track Package. IF people do not want the Sport seats, then they just order the Luxury line which is a no cost options that comes with the old standard seats.
dino001 said:They still had to monkey with option configurations - up to now, whole ""Line"" thing was a mess. Can get this, but not that, etc. It's simplified and more available, BUT now you will be able get black with red stitching (which I love) only with regular suspension. ""Sporty red stitching"", which was the hallmark of the Sport Line is mutually exclusive with sport suspension elements, because it's not available with those M-sport packages. This is nuts.They increased the price for 340, but the equipment offsets are more than sufficient, so overall value is better than current year. Actually, it's much better. However, there are also couple of slight of hands on 328 to make you believe you get more, but you don't. Premium package no longer has leather, but its price for 328 stays close to this year, because they swapped it for LED lights. 340 has all premium pack equipment standard, so that is not an issue. Leather is no a stand alone handsome $1450 option. I predict it will result in much more fake stuff showing in the dealers' inventories than this year. Now you could get leather as stand alone or as premium package, which was a frequent option. Once it's remove, it will probably be going to be first thing to go, for price conscious customers and ordering managers. BMW went essentially Mercedes way. I hate that.So if you want 335, you better wait for 340, because it's going to be a better deal overall (unless you get some awesome discount to offset that difference). However, for 328 I see not much value added, just more shuffling to make you believe you're getting more. Good example is that leather vs. LED in premium package. The former has stable pricing in terms of supply, but they will be paying less and less for the LEDs (rapid development of new products pushes supply prices down in that segment), but keeping the profit for themselves. The whole red stitching thing vs. sport suspension is just my personal disappointment, but not end of the world.
The 340i is the real winner, I agree, you get a car wtih more standard features for less money then the 2015 335i."
May 2015,The Louisville Fiat dealer has an Alfa sign up as well.
May 2015,"@robr2 very interesting take on the dealership 3/4 headed monster. The Audi dealership in Burlington is amazing place - they offer ice cream all year long and charge only 350(?) for an oil change. Herb has done a great job spamming my morning commute with radio and billboard ads. He has ""smart pricing"" on his used cars which is only smart for him and not the said customers. Will say this his service departments are good but you pay for it."
May 2015,"I think the 2011 or 2012 and older Mercedes C-Class had a more Honda-like interior than Acura. Granted, it improved in either 2012 or 2013, but before that, yuck!"
May 2015,"dino001 - I would disagree with ONE of your ""is ahead"" selections, and that would be the Acura. The Acura interior, while probably able to be applauded for its tech still seems to show its Honda-ness too much. In fact, the Acura and Infiniti interiors, today, just seem a lot cheaper looking than those from Audi and Mercedes. The slow-but-steady improvements in BMW's interiors since 2010 or 2011 certainly bears noting; but today the two Germans I noted certainly seem to offer best in class interiors. When my wife and I test drove a Macan recently (to get a sense of just how much Audi SQ5 it retained), we both felt the Porsche interior was somewhat more upscale than the Audi's. I don't know if all Porsche interiors come off feeling that ""high end"" or not -- and it may not even matter since the cars are not typically cross shopped. Friend of our just got a 2016 A6 Prestige -- I'd say its interior does have some WOW factor.I must say, though, I am not a fan of anybody's implementation of the ""pop-up"" screen. Looks after market to me."
May 2015,"Agreed. Not only Mercedes - Audi, Acura, Lexus. Pretty much everybody is ahead. However, to be fair, upgrade different inlays make big differences on the interiors. However, the instrument cluster is still a 1980s."
May 2015,"BMW has to upgrade their interiors, especially the dash, IMHO, as Mercedes interiors are now light-years ahead."
May 2015,"Sport suspension IS NOT standard, read again. 328/335 has standard current Sport Line aesthetic elements and seats. You can get previous standard seats on 328/340 by getting premium package and luxury line (which is no cost) To get M-sport suspension (2VF adaptive or 704 regular), you need M-sport package or track package. However, they did say they have ""newly tuned"" the suspension and steering. If that delivers, it may be OK in standard form.They still had to monkey with option configurations - up to now, whole ""Line"" thing was a mess.

Central got Fiat because it has the other Chrysler brands. If Alfa will reward Fiat dealers with Alfa, then Central should get the store. As for Kelly, he has the north shore Fiat and Herb has the north shore Chrysler/Dodge/Ram. Herb got Fiat in metro west/Worcester because he has the Chrysler/Dodge/Ram there and thus he got Alfa.IMHO, many automakers are leery of Chambers as they feel he has too much power in such a small area. MB brought in a dealer group from Cleveland for the new MB location in my town - about 1/2 mile from the Chambers Audi/Porsche location. Chambers through his attorney has accused the planning board of impropriety in their approval of the MB store and has stated that the planning board is being too hard on Chambers' parking lot expansion at the Audi/Porsche store. The planning board is simply trying to ensure safety at that location. IIRC, that location did not finish the original project as approved. A building that was to be renovated was ""accidentally"" demolished. No U Turn signs have mysteriously disappeared a few times. Asbestos at the expansion was disposed of improperly and the contractor has been fined."

May 2015,"Looking at Alfa websites, they already have dealers there. Those in my area are same as Fiat, which are part of multibrand franchises. So all it will do is add another nameplate and probably a separate showroom (perhaps not immediately)."

Holy crap!He also had many other issues with his '04 that proved the word 'Junk' had true staying power with Chrysler over the years...."
May 2015,"The way I earn my living is by working with distributors of beverage alcohol products. For purposes of our discussions here, think of these distributors as your friendly local auto dealers. I have come to learn that the distributors and suppliers have a love hate relationship. I must assume there is some similarity with auto mfgs and their retailers. Since I have been dealing with German car dealerships for the most part since 1977, my observation does not support this assumption. My Audi dealer seems to have a very positive relationship with Audi of America. My beverage alcohol customers seem to have no love lost relationship with their suppliers, however.So, I do believe that my only matter of recourse, should I have an issue with my German car, is by dealing with my Audi dealer (at least first off). I have no issues with my dealership and we also had no issues with our three BMW's and the local BMW dealership. When something needed attending, the Audi and BMW dealership have always greased the skids, so to speak, to get the issue taken care of.My few dalliances with American cars have, on the other hand, almost always had issues that the dealer wanted to get argumentative with. The same was true with Acura, but not with Infiniti. If someone says they have had issues with a GM or Chrysler car that required ""much"" effort to achieve resolution, well that seems, to me, to be justification for not patronizing American car dealerships. I've had the same experiences way back when I was in college and was trying to become a life-long Chrysler products customer.My somewhat recent experience visiting a Chrysler/Jeep dealership in search of a new car, really did but one thing: I would, at this juncture, NEVER buy a Chrysler/Jeep product, as the experience made me feel the need for a shower -- and that was just going in for a test drive.My preference is to work with what I have come to call ""horizontal"" car dealerships. The salespeople at such dealerships seem hell bent on discussing everything BUT the cars they presumably sell. Talk about zero pressure, zero stress, the German car reps seem, on a scale of 1 to 10 to place selling a car as number 11 on their list of things they want to do. One being the #1 thing they want to do.Of course, the cynic in me assumes this could be part of a well studied act to make me believe they [the German dealership] really do care about what I want, rather than making a sale TODAY. In any case, I do respond to the negative pressure to buy. And, truth be told, I am not really all that concerned if this is all just contrived to manipulate me.The guy I buy cars from is on my ""list"": you know the one that has a doctor, dentist, barber, accountant, lawyer, vet and a few other key individuals on it that we all rely on to keep us safe, sane, legal and well.In my case, I happen to love German cars, Swiss watches, Italian shoes, and mostly Japanese electronics, and so on -- I have come to build relationships with folks who sell and support these products and services.Nothing is perfect -- and I assume every product has lemons -- and because of this, I believe in relationships. If you buy into the notion that the stuff we buy we buy because of the service and support afforded us as consumers by the retailers, you should be shopping for the purveyor with as much care as you shop for the product itself.My experiences -- after 33 Audis all from the same dealership -- have convinced me nothing else even comes close.If you have an experience that you will -- on purpose -- repeat, I would urge you to at least consider doing so.Most of the cars we discuss in this forum are more alike than not, if you find a great BMW or Cadillac dealership, I would urge you enjoy the benefits that you can glean via loyalty.Finally, I'll leave you with this: one in a row is not a trend."

May 2015,"Andres you keep beating a dead horse i.e GM and the Old Days, just like what you are doing with Chrysler. The reason why GM was failing was the bean counter ran the company, it was cheaper to build one platform and have all brands use it, Caddy was dying because the generation who bought them where dying and people who had the money didn't want a front wheel drive Caddy that didn't drive well. That is why GM imported a Opal that could zig. Buick was dying for the same reason Caddy was, in the past 5 yrs both brands are enjoying a come back and I hope they continue, it only makes the competition better.Chrysler (really Dodge) is doing the same thing, when MB bought them people were waiting for good things to come from that marriage, and it finally did the 300, but that was too late for MB, MB wanted Jeep and didn't care about everything else. Out of the that marriage MoPar got the independent suspension from the E class and their 5 spd transmission which made the 300 the success it was/is. Sure the Crossfire was an american version of the SLK.I'm not too sure why you have to harp on GG, he has every right not to like Audi right now, allow him to do that.

Correct me if I""m wrong.

Also that was like 20 yrs ago, it's not the same Caddy company either, just look at their product line.In regards to Audi, it happened 2 yrs ago, very recent. It's not the same regurgitated marketing, if a company turns around and makes products that people want to buy and treat customer like humans, then they will successful.

May 2015,"Promising: 435i ZHP With the inclusion of the LSD, and the promised improvement of the EPS I could possibly see owning one. In other news, I drove a 228i and was totally underwhelmed- and the June Road & Track confirmed my impressions. It contains a comparison test of an FR-S, an EcoBoost Mustang(with the Performance Pkg) and a 228i(with the Track Handling Package). A few relevant quotes:With absolutely no feedback coming through its steering wheel, the 228i is a bear to manage at its limits with stability control off, first understeering considerably, then flinging itself sideways at inopportune moments....more Buick than Bimmer. Every time we stop, the 228i's driver begs to get into something else.The Mustang meanwhile, feels more like a BMW than the BMW.The Scion prevailed, if you couldn't guess- the consensus being that it had the sweetest handling and consistently punched above its weight.It's definitely not an ELLPS car however; Jason Cammisa puts it bluntly:It isn't for insecure show-offs."

May 2015,"""Normally?"" I'd say that the OEM tires may be good for anywhere between 12,000 and 36,000 miles. In the ELLPS class, often the tires are of the low profile, super sticky and stiff sidewall type which ""normally"" translates to relatively short tread wear. If you lease a German car, these days, it often comes with MAX performance summer only tires and those types have even less tread life since they offer very soft tread in the pursuit of high cornering forces.SW Ohio leases are typically 36 to 39 months and 15K per year. No way you could keep the OEM tires on the car, at least if you wanted to enjoy the last 6 to 12 months of ""ownership.""I have leased, now, almost three dozen cars in my life -- I have ONCE kept the OEM tires on for the entire lease -- I leased a 1996 Audi A6 (for one year) while I awaited my 1997 A8 to arrive.Now, my friend on the other hand, turned in his leased car with the original oil still in it. He just added a quart or two every once in a while and changed the filter a couple of times. It was an Acura that he ended up trading in on a BMW. He did, however, replace the tires twice (he commuted between Detroit and Cincinnati).Just to make sure I wasn't smokin' sumthin', I called my dealer and asked how many customers replace the tires on their leased cars -- his answer was ""all of them."" He then said, almost all of those with leases over 12 months."

I had a blowout (when the outside temp was single digit above 0F) and the tread was so far gone I went ahead and bought 4 instead of the two I would have purchased had they not been those summer only MAX Performance tires. I had a 36 month lease on that one and, well, I was into the lease perhaps 9 months at that point. When you gotta go, you gotta go.I am considering keeping this S4 out of lease -- considering. In any case, for the next couple of years, I want the best -- most fun -- rubber I can have on the thing, all things considered. UHP all-seasons seem to be a reasonable compromise -- I'm just hoping someone here has DWS 06's and cares to comment.Thanks!"
May 2015,"The issue is not so much the snow (coefficient of friction) but the things that happen to a ""summer performance"" tire when temps drop below 45F. So, while I could probably use and enjoy a summer tire in the summer (I had them on my 2009 A4), well, in the winter, the ride and handling characteristics of the car reminded me of ""driving on the rims."" The car exhibited what I call ""same day"" turning, and the ride and the sounds from the road were, for lack of a better term, ""brittle.""We have moderate winters here in SW Ohio, moderate in terms of precipitation. But once it gets cold, it stays below 40 -- and, well, summer tires just become hard as a rock."
May 2015,Isn't your car leased?  How many miles do you have on it?  How many months/miles do you have left?
May 2015,"I have had extremely good luck with the Cooper Zeon RS3-A as the year-round tire on the X3 and as the ""winter"" tire on my MS3. That said, I haven't heard anything negative about the Contis. I'd also give the Michelin Pilot Sport A/S 3 a good hard look."
May 2015,"I really REALLY liked the Extreme Contact DW's, which were fine until I tracked them. Then they chunked even with the lightweight A3. Absent track days, they should be killer. Do you really need the S in DWS if only for a few days? I think you should just drive extra EXTRA carefully on those rare snow days, and enjoy the other 360 days a year a notch better!!!Also, the Michelin Pilot Super Sports can't be overlooked if you agree with my logic above."
May 2015,"Experience with this?I'm closing in on new tires for my 2014 S4 (18"" wheels). I live where we have moderate winters -- typically very few snow days, and when we do, they last a day. I have no interest in taking my car to any track event. I am also, typically, not interested in swapping from summer only to winter tires and back.We all think we're great drivers, no doubt. I drive on the Interstate Highway system here in SW OH, which is to say it is full of pot-holes and every spring the new pot hole crop becomes evident. It is like driving a freakin' obstacle course. Having said that, I do drive once weekly between Cincinnati and Columbus (200 miles round trip). Much of the trip the ambient speed is 80+, some of the trip is 90+.I have H rated ""Grand Touring"" tires on the car -- OEM's. They have been OK. My thought is to replace these tires with the Continental ExtremeContact DWS 06's. My wife's 2014 SQ5 has the ""last gen"" DWS's -- and they have been very good. I'm thinking there is some evidence that the DWS 06's are an improved in every way version of the DWS's. There is little info I can find about the tires, although TireRack does seem generally to approve of them.These tires are UHP's and will be W rated. Their lifespan should be quite good, if the DWS (prev model) is any indication.Are the tires quiet? Do they improve turn in? Are they rounder than most? Etc?If you have any personal experience with these on your ELLPS or LPS cars, I would be interested in your comments.Thanks."
May 2015,"Being one of those sportbikers, spent many a sunday going up and down Palomar, there are two side, S7 (East side) which is the longer of the two roads and S6 which is the tight side (also called the south side) S6 dumps onto Hiway 76.When the San Diego BMW car club would go up Palomar we did on Sat, when there are no sportbikes."
May 2015,"Any highway you can find that is designated as a State Route (ie. SR-# or S-#) is fairly easy for thrill seekers to find. Roads..... now that's much harder to find. Mt. Palomar falls into the S-route category, but it is a great one. The tight side is more like the ""west"" side though. Either way, you'll encounter many sport bikes enjoying that road, and unfortunately if you are driving spiritedly, you'll inevitably come up behind a Toyota or other absurdly slow vehicle climbing the very twisty switchback grades."
May 2015,"Highland Valley Rd is a great road, also going out to Bates Nut Farm is a good one too. But the real run is going up Mt. Palomar on the south side (we called it the tight side)"
May 2015,"Here is my recommendation to everyone here.Take the 15 South from Escondido towards San Diego. Exit 15 on the West Bernardo Drive/East Pomerado Rd Exit. Take Pomerado East across the freeway. Both W. Bernardo Drive and Pomerado go in a North/South direction, so you must turn left onto Highland Valley Road to go East/SE.Prepare for one of the most scenic fun drives imaginable with very little traffic, even on a Friday afternoon.My new favorite road, and it's probably just as fast at getting me home in an unimpeded S4 driven with advanced techniques as a traffic clogged 15 South."

May 2015,So here is a video of the new XE with audio of the engine... https://youtu.be/Gw-LleIXJxQ
May 2015,"To some people a car is an appliance, plain and simple. Get's them from point A to point B, they know that they will have to replace said appliance every 7-10 yrs with another appliance these people are happy with what they drive. However, some people in their forum can't wrap their head around this concept, just like on bimmerfest, some guy was very insulting to people who have a 528i and 535i, because in his small mind the only 5 series worth having is the 550i."
May 2015,"Sorry to sidetrack the conversations. To me camry is just a reliable transportation that could have been any of the sort. Not about individual net worth either, as there are people much wealthier and driving lesser cars. Just that I think they are probably not interested in cars to begin with."
May 2015,"Oh, come on now. Back when it was new, the G35 was a competitor. They could do it again. Not sure it will qualify for this category, but that upcoming Infiniti sedan with the GTR running gear could be interesting."
May 2015,Nothing Japan (let alone Korea) ever produces will be worthy.So it is written.
May 2015,"Go on, pull the other one."
May 2015,I think Toyota has plans to install the V8 from the IS-F model into the Camry or ES and will call it the Camry Hellcat.
May 2015,"OK, a Camry that's been through the Medieval Rack treatment ..."
May 2015,"Plus, I heard it's not a Camry anymore, it's Avalon."
May 2015,"Bzzzz ... sorry, the ES doesn't qualify as there is no ""P"" in it. ""ELLS"", sure."
May 2015,It already was. They call it the ES350 and sell it at Lexus.
May 2015,Perhaps a Camry could be modified to fit into the ELLPS category to fit on topic? Be our guest and take the lead on this.
May 2015,"I once saw the rainbow unicorn of cars. A recent model Toyota Corolla ""S"" model being driven like it was an autocross modified Miata on a time trial run, but on a public back road that has plenty of curves. This guy kept up a very healthy fast pace in front of me for a good 7 miles or so, A modified Toyota would be rare, but not newsworthy. The reason I mention this Toyota Corolla is that it was a Toyota being driven at a ""fun"" back road pace (FAST), which is definitely as rare of a sighting as I can think of.Perhaps a Camry could be modified to fit into the ELLPS category to fit on topic?"
May 2015,Touche.....
May 2015,"Good, as I have neither..."
May 2015,Here we talk about ELLPS and not old Camrys or individual net worth.
May 2015,"Instead of jetskis, boats, yachts, snow skis, snowboards, skate boards, snowmobiles, ATV's/buggies, and other toys, I choose to divert my toy fund towards my vehicle. Heck, my last video game console is the GameCube."
May 2015,"Well, in the book ""The Millionaire Next Door"", the basic idea is that an awful lot of people who look rich are not - they are just highly leveraged. Conversely a lot of people who look of very modest means are quite wealthy. They're wealthy partly because they save and invest their money rather than spending it all over the place on high profile items."
May 2015,"Reading about your friend is somewhat of a relief. Our annual family income is 400+K, family net asset 10 times that, but all we drive are two old Camry's... I sometimes wonder if I am normal (wife doesn't care about car), in that even though I don't care much what I drive (this Camry is all I need), have been interested in cars since young (now 48 yr old)."
May 2015,"RV living in NYC isn't that uncommon and it's not illegal. As long as the vehicle is registered and not illegally parked, it's allowed."
May 2015,"ZipCar has made a car 
If one rents a couple of weekends a year, it's not that expensive. Or one joins ZipCar. It's $35 a year for a membership and about $30 a night on top of the regular rate to keep a car overnight. That includes insurance."
May 2015,Anyone in Manhattan living out of their van and parking space? Do they ban camper/trailers?
May 2015,"I suppose it's cheaper to rent if you are only doing it a few weekends a year. You'd have to buy all the extra overpriced insurances, since you have none since you don't have a vehicle. I recall a Seinfeld episode where they drove out of town to get to a State with 10 cents per can/bottle recycling pay, and another episode arguing over a parking spot."
May 2015,"I lived in Manhattan for 8 years (Upper East Side) and parked a car on the street the entire time, doing the Alternate Side Tango the whole time. In retrospect it seems like insanity but then I am CRAZY about cars and I did get good use out of it. Like most Manhattanites I went out of town most summer weekends. I think it was harder on the cars than on me. NYC with it's horrid roads and [non-permissible content removed] drivers is a very unforgiving place. My nephew lives on the Lower East Side and got rid of his car. H/e uses Zip Car or borrows from family and friends when he needs to go out of town, likewise my niece who lives on the Upper East Side."
May 2015,common in the city is renting a car for the weekend when they need to go out of town. Much cheaper than owning and storing one.
May 2015,"The cost of a parking space in Manhattan per square foot is about the same as the cost of an apartment per sq. ft. It's not uncommon for parking spaces attached to condos or co-ops, to sell for $225,000, because only 1% of this type of building has parking. Some people buy parking spaces as real estate investments in Manhattan."
May 2015,You never watched Seinfeld.
May 2015,never said they drove it 8 blks
May 2015,Not everyone goes on road trips.
May 2015,Don't people in NY ever go on road trips???? Rent a car I suppose?
May 2015,"Basically power, performance, & handling are the Q40's major advantages. It's all what you put stock in. I happen to like all that stuff, but didn't exactly have the budget when the lease was up on my 2011 BMW 328xi. I also do a lot more driving than average (over 20K per year), so leasing gets pricey."
May 2015,"I wonder how their muffler looks like. If they drove 8 blocks to work in the middle of winter, there is probably only rusty shell left - you touch it, it's gone into dust."
May 2015,"My understanding of the release is that everything but suspension from Sport Line will be standard on 328 - and I love it. I also have a concern about premium package pricing (and 340 as well, since premium pack features will be standard there). LED prices went down, but I'm sure BMW would like to keep the margins, if only let by the market. Seems like they're going away from HID lights altogether, for obvious reasons - green commies from Europe and America hate those, as they'd rather you poison yourself with mercury from CFL than use couple of kWh more; CFL doesn't work for headlights, so LEDs are next ""best"" thing). I cannot imagine why wouldn't people want those great sport seats. I'm large frame and still find those standard seats simply abhorrent."
May 2015,"The 340i gets the new ""B"" series engine, so hopefully there will be a MPPK for this engine and Exhaust which would give the car roughly 370hp. Regarding living in large cities, I have cousins who live in the Upper East Side (of Manhattan) they have a 2001 BMW 330i, that has 54K miles on it. Like you said GG, their world is about 8 blks from their apt, and the subway line in half a blk away, no need to really drive. They had their car from when they lived on Long Island, they have been in Manhattan now 8 yrs, and have put on about 12K miles on those 8 years. In regards to Jag, I hope the XE is a success for them, this will only make the competitors even better."
May 2015,"In regards to the standard sport package on the 328's, there is talk that the sport seats might now be standard. Of course some people over on BF are splitting hairs on what the press release says. Not everybody wants those sport seats, so to force people to have them, would drive people away from BMW... One thing I'm waiting to see is how much is this new Premium package going to be, since it now comes with LED lights. LED lights on other BMW's is a $1900 option, and currently the price on a 328i is $3100. So $5K is very steep, and some people could careless about the LED's for $1900,,, I would have liked to see Xemon being standard on all BMW's, even the El Cheapo 320i. But until the ordering guide is released (hopefully next week) we wont know for sure of prices."
May 2015,"You say that now, but when you are running late and need to check messages, oh, yeah people on this forum don't do that..."
May 2015,"On paper, agreed. Problem is we all get tired or a level of distraction. Some help countering this could be helpful."
May 2015,The best collision avoidance system (or Eyesight) is a good attentive driver.
May 2015,"The above is the spirit and some of the actual words I wrote. Most of us have to make choices -- a new fill-in-the blank appliance, car, house, sofa, TV and so on. More important than ""things"" are the other choices we make -- perhaps it is children, college funds (for your kids or for your MBA or JD or whatever). The thing is very few of us can ""have it all."" And, even some who literally could have it all, don't want it all. My best friend worked hard at a manufacturing company and eventually became the president of the company -- he never, in his entire life, has owned a new car. He searches -- it seems like all the time, to me -- for the ""cherry"" car. He finds the mythical little old lady or little old man who has a 2005 Cadillac with 15,000 original miles on it and that's what he goes for. He is as passionate about cars -- subscribes to ALL of the magazines -- as I am. This guy knows chapter and verse specs about new cars, yet is always driving a car over 5 years old. His ""settling"" on these rare cream puff cars allows him to spend lots of time on the west coast of Florida on a houseboat, sailing, fishing and sitting in the sun drinking a cold beer.Whenever I get a new car, I take it to him and we go out for a long test drive -- with him behind the wheel. I can tell he loves the car and probably he hopes that when I get rid of it, he can be the next owner.My wife and I work (long hours, typically), enjoy fine dining, wine, European travel and ELLPS cars. We probably could afford (that is the deal could be done) for an Audi RS7 ($120,000 MSRP). We'd have to settle on other things were we to go for the RS. Instead we decided to set our sites on far less expensive cars (mine was $57K, hers $65K), we bought hers and leased mine. The burden for both is $1,400 per month, all in. Our next door neighbor has a new 750 BMW -- and a Camry -- the Bimmer costs as much as both of our cars combined. The guy across the street has a Hyundai and a Yukon but also owns 1/5th of an airplane. We're all settling in our own ways. Cars are, for me, slowly, very slowly, beginning to be less important to me at 63 than they were when I was 50. My wife, oddly, seems to be picking up the slack -- wanting the highest HP she can get (within reason, of course).Priorities, compromises -- settling."
May 2015,"GG, the red XKE roadster of my father's friend is what led me to the lair of the Jaguar! For your next chronic car buying experience, you should check 'em out, not your father's Jag. Man, the XE is getting some great press so far.And, let your sister know, if she really misses Jag, they'll build another one for her."
May 2015,"The Subie's Eyesight seems like a great safety feature.Talking ""minuses', the Q40's 8 yr. run (essentially from the original 2007 G35), it's engine intrusiveness and it's poor gas mileage using premium are it."
May 2015,"The eyesight gadget fans not only hate driving, they also seem to take pride in the fact that their driving skills are abysmal; ""Why adjust my mirrors properly? Why practice situational awareness? Heck, why should I look past the end of my hood? Let the car do all that."""
May 2015,"Remember the old 1980s joke about how Volvos were built for people who hated cars? Well maybe all these Eyesight gadgets are for people who hate driving? (and sometimes when on the road, I wouldn't blame them btw)."
May 2015,"Wow; if I was a totally moronic and incompetent driver the ""Eyesight Package"" would be a must-have!Upon reflection, perhaps it should be called the Helen Keller package..."
May 2015,Thanks a lot. You mentioned extra horsepower is a plus for Q40/G37... To me that is a secondary since I should have to pay more for gas on Q40. Its MPG is low. Is there any other plus in Q40 compared with Legacy that you can imagine ?
May 2015,Eyesight package include:Pre-crash warnignPre-crash break Adaptive Cruise controlBlind spot detection with radarLine Departure Warning
May 2015,"Not sure what the ""Eyesight"" option is on the Legacy. Is it some pre-crash alert system?"
May 2015,"Having driven a Q40 in it's former G37 guise and owning a 2015 Legacy 2.5i Premium, I can tell you that these are 2 completely different vehicles. I can offer you a few pieces of advice. 1st, if you like the way the Legacy drives, then stay away from the Infiniti dealership. Just thinking about the 153 horsepower difference makes me want to head down to my local Infiniti dealer and see if I can trade in and break even on my Subaru (13K miles since 9/27/2015). Power from the Q40's 328hp V6 is plentiful while I'd describe my Legacy's power output adequate. The Legacy will definitely be roomier inside. The interior is very well finished with high quality, soft touch materials everywhere. The legacy will ride smoother. I got my Legacy before the Eyesight was available. I originally wanted it the package is somewhat of a bargain at only $1200 or so, but I couldn't wait. I've also read that depending on your market, eyesight equipped cars are selling closer to sticker than non eyesight equipped cars. I really like the 18"" wheels on the Legacy Limited. I have cloth seats, but have driven a Legacy with leather and it was very nice."
May 2015,When was Cable TV added to the luxury list?
May 2015,How do you guys compare Infiniti Q40 and Subaru Legacy Limited 2.5 with eyesight ? They are both almost cost the same to me. I know that Subaru is not Luxury car but The Legacy comes with all new technologies that other Luxury brands cannot offer in this price range. But Q40 is almost 5 years old technology with crash prevention technology at all. The interior of both are Leather. Of course Q40 is 3.7 and more performance and fuel hungry....
May 2015,"Totally agree. I think their general interiors are not so bad, especially when you go for some of the optional items, such as wood finish with real leather, but their dashboard and instrument cluster feels 30 years old. I have my own insider joke about BMW interior design. They spend 150 hours perfecting exhaust valve, 500 hours working on shifting 100 grams from front to back then two weeks before the deadline they realize they don't have a dashboard. No problem, Hans, just put the old one. It still works. This happened three times already."
May 2015,"I saw the BMW announcement yesterday with regards to the drivetrain bump in the ""new"" models. I always felt that the 6 cyl twin scroll turbo was uner rated to begin with. That said, I had the performance pack upgrade in mine, which according to BMW, upped the HP and torque ratings by about 20 each. So, not sure if they just applied those engine management changes to the current motor, or they did something more ""physical"" to massage the engine..The thing that will haunt the 3/4 series is the continued interiors they design. You look at the ATS, the A4, the C300, and the BMW interior needs some serious rework. I liked mine (2011). But, it could have used a shot of style. Even with the new models, the interior could use more panache, especially considering what the competition is doing.LD....my sister, who traded her 8 year old Jag in for a Mercedes was bemoaning not going back to Jaguar for her new car. She likes her Mercedes. She liked her old Jag more, though.Funny thing is, Jag is doing much better since they've been out from under Ford's thumb. I'm not a ""Jag"" kind of guy (unless it's a vintage XKE Roadster), but I do understand their appeal.."
May 2015,"News: Audi B9 coming -- but not exactly soon . . .2016 A4/S4 will be unchanged from the 2015 model, which was unchanged from the 2014 which was unchanged from the 2013.The A4 as we know it now will enjoy a SHORT model year (sort of).The B9 A4 sales training (US) is scheduled for November with 2017 model cars arriving at dealers approximately in February of 2016.My buddy at the Audi Connection here in Cincinnati showed me the email ""from corporate.""The discounts on the 2016's will be, one would imagine, compelling -- how else will they be able to sell 'em?Having said the above, the A4, even ""long in the tooth"" is a great place to spend miles and miles in. The S4 even more so -- with a bunch of incentives (my guess is the price will include a bunch of 'packages' in the Premium+ versions -- standard Nav, standard B&O, etc -- so for your $45K you may drive off in a $52K S4, which would be a helluva deal.)Or perhaps for your $39K, you'll drive off in an all singing, all dancing loaded A4.There will be those among you, however, that just won't be able to take the leap knowing that in some very few months later, the new and improved model will be for sale, meanwhile you've still got 42 months to go on your lease or note.Decisions, decisions.Everyday I get behind the wheel of my S4 it's like watching The Exorcist for the 128th time -- it just keeps getting better every time."
May 2015,"Can we add the new Volvo S60R T6 that has similar (but falls short) numbers to the S4 to the list. Was at about 45K dollar wise, but I didn't get to drive it as it was indoors."
May 2015,"I bet you many of those millions have a 800 dollar smart phone financed over a 2 year contract. Cable TV, and other luxuries they felt was more important than ""affording"" something more than a Honda or Toyota."
May 2015,"I actually test drove the 2.0T ATS and the 3.6 ATS and both didn't have enough grunt to steer me clear of the S4. There were other things too, but that was one of the main problems. Obviously, I'm sure the ATS-V would solve that, and while the real world selling price might be competitive, last I checked the stickers were ridiculous (I last checked in 2013)."

May 2015,"It's not just that. It seems they are repackaging things. It still depends on the prices, but I actually like some of the moves - 340 (more hp, so they can bump up the number) gets premium package standard, which is how it should be - I just hope the price differential between 328 and 340 won't get prohibitive. They get Sport Line aesthetic features standard into 328 (SEATS!!!!), saddle brown now available across the board. There will also be track package, not really my thing, by I understand why some will go for it. I bet they'll still keep the sport suspension away from x-drive, unless you get the ""adaptive"" option. I like the changes. I have no illusions on pricing, it will go up, but at least so will content. This is a typical mid-cycle refresh that adds value to a model. I'm sure 4-series GC will get it, too at some point, hopefully also in 2016, perhaps just a few months later. It will be between 440 GC and 328 wagon (I'm sure there is no 340 wagon coming). I bought my current as last year of the model, where some optional things were added to increase the appeal. Seems similar thing is happening again. The option schemes and packages was one of things I didn't care for in the new model. Now they gave me a reason to wait."
May 2015,"You find that in many major cities. People don't own a car because they don't have to. Everything you need, including transportation is right outside your door. In NYC, you might consider having one if one lived in Brooklyn, Queens, or Staten Island. The further away from Manhattan, the more likely someone may own a car.Here in Boston, they are encouraging NOT owning a car. The newest residential projects are expected to have limited parking and easy access to T stations, ZipCar locations, and Hubway bike sharing stalls. The newest neighborhood under redevelopment is the Seaport district. What was once a desolate area of piers with a couple of restaurants is now a vibrant area with offices, pharmaceutical labs, restaurants, shopping, apartments, museums, and a convention center. Yes there is parking but it's not easy to find and it's not cheap.I know that might seem crazy to you in Dayton but it's the model that crowded northeastern cities have to take."

He's totally flabbergasted by how I live.....driving everwhere. He said his whole world fits in an 8 square block area.....groceries, restaurants, entertainment, bars, shopping, etc. It's all within walking distance.

May 2015,"Mark.....all good points.I was just having this conversation with my best friend. He has a $70K '15 Corvette, that for the most part, sits in his garage gathering dust. He drives a new Suburban every 2 years....I'll assume those are at least in the $50K range with discounts...probably closer to $65K with the new version. His wife drives an Infiniti M something....assume mid $50s on that. So, in short, he has roughly $185K tied up in vehicles,,,,,,,RIGHT THIS MOMENT.He's in my tax bracket. Not Soros money, nor even failed Silicon Valley start up money. But, enough that we're not too worried about going into a dealership and buying something like a brand new Corvette as an impulse buy. His philosophy? Spend it all while alive and healthy. He has no kids. He was an only child. So, outside of his wife, he really has no other outlet to spend his money (or even save for college tuition, teen insurance rates, etc). In short, the only thing he has to worry about is staying relatively healthy.Some worry and sweat every purchase, whether it's that new leather recliner, or whether to buy a Honda or an Acura. They have kids. They have huge tuition bills staring at them. I get that. I've been there.I'm 10 years before I think about retirement. So, that's something I think about, but certainly doesn't occupy a lot of my time. I think I'm good, but who knows what will happen over the next decade.Would it make a major financial lifestyle change if I bought a Z06 Corvette? Nope. The only question I'd ask myself is ""what else could you do with that money?"" I see my son, who has a good job in IT. He works for a major University, so his job is secure, probably as long as he wants to stay there. He's wanting a new WRX. He's fretting over how it will affect his lifestyle currently. As I told him, budget it up. If it would get in the way of your savings plan as it stands right now (I actually showed him how to budget for just about everything and anything), then don't do it. If you can do all the things you're doing now, put all the eggs in the baskets you've set up. then go for it. Who I feel for are the folks who are busting their tails to make ends meet. Their budget is sliced so thin, that tomorrow is only a hope that they've got enough to feed their family healthily. If their 10 year old Caravan has a major issue, it will mean a large change in a lifestyle that can ill afford any negative changes and is begging for anything positive. They can't afford a new car (although dealers would love to get them in and finance them at their high rates). They're the ones who need a new car the most.On the other end of that spectrum, there's my other colleague, who has a 12 year old TL....250K miles. We both get a healthy car allowance....BUT...only if the car is 3 years old or less and is on their ""list"" of approved vehicles. He bought the TL used a decade ago and is having fits about how much ""cars cost"" today. If he could drive a used Tercel and pocket the car allowance, he'd be happy. And yes, he can afford any car he wanted....including those $100K cars you speak about. I fall in the middle. I like the nicer cars. but have my own definitions on what I'll spend money on. I like nice cars, but not ones that cost $60K (unless that $60K car was an overwhelming value at that price). I'll put a limit set at $55K. I've long given up the notion of any car as something that's anything more than an expense to me. It's a depreciating asset. Truthfully, it's not even an asset in my mind. Plain and simple, it's an expense."
May 2015,"You just don't get it.  I know we all ""settle"" or make compromises, but many people actually buy used cars until they can afford that shiny new Honda which they have wanted for years. And no, they can't afford an Acura.   Saying they can afford an Acura or maybe an Audi but have settled for a Honda makes assumptions that reflect a real disconnect.  Isn't it possible that some have ""settled"" in other areas just so they could buy their new Honda?"
May 2015,"We all settle -- it doesn't mean it is a bad thing. And, most of us make choices -- the person who goes for the Honda is likely to be able to extend themselves to go for an Acura. They settle for the Honda because of priorities more important to them than having a ELLPS or LPS. Things like kids, houses, pets, home appliances compete for limited funds.The family that has $50,000 to live on is little different from the family that has $100K to live on -- if you ask them, they will somehow tell you how they choose to live within their means (or they mortgage everything to the hilt, cars included).I have lived with a relatively small income up to a ""middle class"" to ""upper middle class"" income -- at every way station, I have always felt I had to ""settle"" on something, either the cars or the home appliances or the monthly mortgage.I am not suggesting that settling is somehow a bad thing. If one had a cushion of $10 million in the check book, I would assume it would be possible for that person to see virtually no barriers to a car purchase,Personally, I couldn't see spending even $100K on a car, even with the financial impunity to do so.I'll settle at this point for cars costing no more than a number beginning with a 6. In ten years, I assume the number will be smaller as my needs, like my hairline, continue to recede."

May 2015,"I'm not slamming Hondas-I'm going to give the upcoming 300 hp Civic Type R a good hard look-but if you pick the right car and service facility you can run a ""fancy-schmancy"" German car for little more than it costs to run a Honda- witness my 318ti and my son's X3. That said, a Japanese car is my current favorite for strafing back roads-but then it's a bit of a hooligan sled."
May 2015,"I live near a Mercedes dealer in the county just north of the Greater Cincinnati area. As such, I receive mailings all the time from the dealer, given they captured my contact info when I was helping my sister buy a C class several months ago.Knowing that the ""NEW"" C Class was on its way, I told her to hold on for 6-8 months to look at the ""all new"" 2015 C. But, everyone knew the new C was just around the corner, so the dealers and Mercedes were really aggressive pricewise in selling the '14s.Anyway, got an email from one of the new sales people at the local Mercedes dealer that was obviously culled from my company's database showing what I'm sure is the only person who works for my company within a 250 mile area (probably bigger). They were having some private showing of a GTS. I ended up on the list to attend a ""look see"".Clearly, they didn't have access to my salary info if they thought I was a target customer for the AMG GT-S. But, I had heard about it, read about it, thought it was ""cool"" so yeah....I'll eat free canapes if they let me sit in it. IF they let me drive it....even better.I'll cut to the chase. They didn't let me drive it. Got to sit in it, though. I hate the new ""flat"" paint jobs these cars have. But, I guess the very high end cars are all getting them, Mercedes AMG is no exception.Can't really see paying as much for a car as a starter home costs, but if you have the disposable income to do so, you'd probably be hard pressed to find a nicer car.As I wandered from the hoard who was engulfing shrimp cocktail and pate, I spied a humble C-Class outside. Steel Grey with Red Leather (the real stuff....not the fake stuff Mercedes tries to tell you is ""better than leather"" (it's not). This wasn't the 400, but the lowly 300 with a turbo 4 cyl. Sales guy spots me, asks me what I thought. Told him I liked the color combo better than any I'd seen so far.At the Autu Show this past winter, they were showing one that was black on black without the sport package....pretty dour. This one, was quite different. Very pretty. Sales guy has keys and a dealer tag before I knew he had left. ""Go for a spin?"". ""I'm not in the market"".Sales-""I'd rather take you for a test drive and hope you remember me when you are in the market.""""Fair enough"".It's taken me awhile, but I've finally wrapped my head around sports sedans with 4 cyl. Actually, these turbo motors really do amaze me. They're torquey. More fuel efficient. Lighter. And generally, they may not be faster, but just more fun to drive than the recent 6 cyl cars I've had recently. Truth told, they're pretty damned quick in their own right.This one is no different. I don't know the specs, but it's typical. No turbo lag that I could ascertain. Quick off the line. Pulled hard over a broad RPM range. It was quieter than the growl my CTS gives off (which I like). 7 speed trans that you have to goad a bit to downshift, but steering wheel paddles help with this. It's smoother than my CTS trans, but I've got one less gear and my trans is already pretty smooth already (GM KNOWS how to make a good automatic trans). C Seats I really liked...even better than my ""go to"" sport seats in the TL SH AWD. The Benz felt tailored to me. I think most of that is due to the very soft leather (again, no hard ""pleather"") and the crazy amount of adjustments you can make to them....including power thigh extenders.My CTS seems faster, but again, the C is no slouch. CTS suspension is geared more towards handling. C is geared more towards ride, but certainly could hold its own. At least that's the first impression over what was a 20 minute test drive.Now, my CTS interior is no slouch in the build and materials category. Real wood, leather, suede, aluminum, is well put together, inside and out...probably the best GM has ever done with any car they've built........EVER!C Class is over the top, especially at the price point. Again, real leather, aluminum and the switches were the same as I just had seen in the AMG just 30 minutes earlier. They felt the same, too. Mercedes leather is better than Cadillac leather, which is really good in and of itself. Porous wood, is better than CTS polished wood (which again, is really, really good).I didn't like the new trend of the ""screen as an afterthought"". Cadillac does a much better job. I don't like the trans ""stalk"", but understand that's a Mercedes trade mark (really?). My CTS is bigger, but hte C felt more comfortable.Final thoughts. The C stickered for right around $50K. Their discount, my corporate discount, probably put it somewhere in the $44K-$45K range. At that price? A very compelling car. The interior is what would sell it. It's competitive everywhere else...drive, handling, performance...with the 3, A, etc. ATS is edgier (as is my CTS).Maintenance? Included with Cadillac for 4 years. Way cheaper than Mercedes after warranty period, too.I'd consider one on my next pruchase...probably put it near the top."
May 2015,"Millions buy a Honda or Toyota because it is all they can afford, they are not ""settling"". It's hard for some to understand that it seems.  Some even aspire to same."
May 2015,"I have nothing against Hondas -- I did have an Acura TL SH-AWD for a time and thought it the Japanese S4 alternative.Honda sells an incredible number of units per year -- they offer, apparently, a large number of customers and prospective customers what they want or what they are willing to settle for. That last declaration can be applied to Hondas and Acuras, VW's and Audis and Nissans and Infinitis and Toyotas and Lexus cars.To some extent, we all settle.My opinion, and it is a ""data point"" opinion, is that folks who go for Hondas instead of Acuras, etc, etc, settle more, probably, because they just aren't into cars that much. I work with folks who lease new Corollas every 24 months -- they proclaim in word and deed that their 8 mile per day round trip drive isn't worth getting a Lexus IS350 F-Sport AWD. They see no merit in cars, hoping instead for public transportation that would eliminate their ""need"" for a car altogether/ Across the hall is another ""cars are a necessary evil"" individual who is happy to buy a well worn but reliable mini-van opting instead for a new fridge, dishwasher, range and washer and dryer. We also have an empty nester two high income couple who love Acuras. The last player in our small group loves Minis and is as passionate about the brand as I am about Audis.It takes all kinds.I would not, on purpose, go to Honda for a new car -- I did dip my toe into Honda in 2012. The Accord line is nice -- but personally, I found it bland, uninvolving but well built with a smooth power train.I am 63, at this point in my life I find myself repeating ""life's too short"" whenever I consider any purchase over some at the time appropriate sum.Every appliance we have purchased -- if we settled too much -- fails quickly, either literally or in its utilitarian aspect. We bought three Whirlpool dishwashers (top of the line) and the damn things kept breaking (thankfully in their warranty period), then when they broke again out of warranty, the repair costs were often about 2/3rds the cost of a new dishwasher. Dishwasher number four was a Bosch -- the thing is a tank and is so quiet its damn near impossible to know if it is running or not. The point is settle on the things that are not important to you, settle less and less on things that are important to you. If you are ""into"" (whatever that means to you) cars, you'll probably be compelled toward the ELLPS and LPS models many of us go on about here. If you'd rather have a new Viking range and a new Sub-zero fridge and so on, and aren't made of money, well your choice is much more clear -- go for the great stuff in the kitchen and the good stuff in the garage. I have no quarrel with that.If you want a larger portfolio and are willing to drive something less than an LPS car, go for that.Settle on the things you don't care about and don't settle on the things you do.This is not the entire extent of what I have learned in 63 years, but it did, at the time (way back when) come to feel like an epiphany.That is why I say: Drive it like you live.. So far, I do not have to settle on a Honda or a Toyota -- but it doesn't mean if you do that I don't respect your decision (unless you are ""over-settling"" -- you'll easily recognize this if you constantly complain about your new car or whatever)."
May 2015,"It's a ""wisdom"" often repeated in self-help books and websites, based on math of an individual unit cost (no financing cost), not considering overall inventory management economics and psychology of here and certain vs. future and maybe. It also ignores dealer cash incentives that are tied to inventory and taking a delivery in a specific time frame, usually within a month or less. No dealer would commit to a price reduced by a dealer's cash that expires in fifteen days for a car with 8-10 week lead, not eligible for that cash. The incentive may or may not be extended. This alone can put order in a thousand plus dollar disadvantage."
May 2015,+1. Not everyone worships at the altar of German cars.  Some of us would rather drive Honda's and retire early than drive fancy-schmancy cars.  To each their own.
May 2015,"I'm the one that wrote about VW's long product cycle. I have a B5 Passat. It was available for 1998 to 2005 - 8 model years with only a minor facelift in the 2001 model year. In today's competitive auto market, a car can't stay the same for that long.Honda used to follow the 2 year minor facelift, 4 year major overhaul, 8 year new car. They have now stretched that to 3 and 6.My understanding is that the 2016 Audi A4 B9 will be introduced in Frankfurt this September and will probably hit the US in early 2016.I don't recall anyone saying it's cheaper to buy off the lot versus ordering. For the dealer principal/management, they would prefer you buy off the lot as they have an asset that is costing them money everyday. Just like any inventory intensive business, turning that inventory is key.As for Hondas, your comment makes you seem a bit elitist. True, they aren't soul filled Teutonic machines with such tight tolerances that failure is inevitable  . But they are fine automobiles that must be doing something right as they sell hundreds of thousands every year."
May 2015,"Someone here wrote that the German practice of a new model designation (with Audi it is B, C, D, etc) is to release a new model every 8 years with a ""refresh"" at year 5 or 6. This is a practice that, I assume, comes from the desire to amortize development costs (and, in theory, lower the MSRPs) over a long time horizon.The issue is, car magazines (and the market itself) can latch onto the descriptor: ""Long in the tooth."" I have a 2014 A4 (B8) sub designated S4. I had a 2009 A4 2.0T Prestige that I took delivery of in 2008. A NEW 2015 A4/S4 is essentially the same as a 2008 available A4. There is, far as I know, no new ordering guide for 2016 A4's available yet. But, this is the time of year, typically, that you can order a NEW A4 and what will arrive is the NEXT MY. Far as I know -- the operative phrase -- if you go into an Audi dealer and order up a new S4 Prestige with a bunch of options on it, what will arrive is a 2015 B8 version, not the eagerly anticipated B9 morphed model.At the rate of change that is POSSIBLE, it would seem to me that an 8 year model to model cycle may now be too long. No wonder the A4 is selling poorly -- at this price point, folks want THE NEXT, not THE CURRENT, especially if the CURRENT is, literally, 8 years old, no matter how effective the mid-cycle refresh has been.Now, I have had my 2014 about a year and a half. I have 25K miles on it. I love this car. I am thinking about replacing the tires thus enjoying the car for the next 35K miles with improved shoes.I am hoping on a major evolution in the A4 model line as it goes from B8 to B9, and I guess the thing to do is to get the NEW version within the first 2 or 3 MY's into the -- apparent -- 8 year cycle.I assume my current S4's durability is not in question -- thus far it has been bullet proof. I will be having the car ""rejuvinated"" at a local detail shop next week. I an assuming this process will do what the name suggests. And, I am looking forward to keeping the car beyond the end of its lease term.Subsequently, I plan -- plans are nothing, planning is everything -- to buy the next time out, but who knows, things may change. Yet, I still assume I will have to order the car to my specs, but there's the fun, it's like getting a new car TWICE within 90 days.And, BTW, someone wrote that cars on the lot are less expensive than ordered cars -- I guess there are exceptions to every ""rule"" -- but in my experience an ordered car is typically hundreds less than a car on the lot; and I've never had a dealer or dealer sales rep indicate anything other than a great willingness to take an order. My rep says he would be fine -- financially, I assume -- if everyone ordered and used the dealership for test drives; this way, he says, he could have more variety available for prospects to test drive.I don't know anything about ""ordering"" Hondas, I would no more do that than I would order a new electric can opener, however. I'm partial to Oster's, if you care."
May 2015,Looks like a new addition is coming to the ELLPS family: https://www.yahoo.com/autos/first-drive-2017-jaguar-xe-a-cat-that-purrs-and-118121064842.html
May 2015,Yes the ATS is a great car that is being ignored. It doesn't broadcast the proper image for the wearers and the enthusiasts unjustly write the car off- associating it with the AARP Specials the marque used to crank out.
May 2015,Any numbers for the Q40? I think they should be added to the Q50 numbers.....
May 2015,"Neither would I, but I'd like to see percentage of those sold into fleets vs. retail. Also, the fact that ATS is even less, if baffling. Must be a real dog at the moment - and the car isn't so bad. I think the right people haven't found them yet. Looks people likely to like ATS don't even bother to come and look at it."

May 2015,"I don't think those SM's are dumb. They just have an ""average"" mind for their average customer. At least Audi or BMW lets you order easily, which is a workaround. I can live with that and I'm even willing to pay, as long as the premium is reasonable. Other brands often take act of Congress."
May 2015,
May 2015,"Agreed 100%. How can I choose a color if I haven't seen it in person; paper and monitors often don't come close to replicating actual colors. How can I decide if that 1,100 dollar adaptive S4 suspension is worth the money if there are none to test drive anywhere you go? Also was impossible to find the specs on how much weight, if any, the adaptive suspension adds (I assume it adds some)."
May 2015,"The 2014 S4 Order form I used to customize my order for the 2014 S4 didn't have a ""delete Moon-roof"" option written on it. I suppose I should have thought of ""writing in"" my specifications, but with no credit, I'd of probably hesitated to delete it. If they'd even give me $50 back I'd do it."
May 2015,"I would have no problem paying a somewhat premium for a Teutonic (and it doesn't even have to be made in Germany) driving vehicle with a really nice interior - you know, like the early 2000's Jetta and Passat. What I'm tired of (and I owned a Jetta in the late '80) is the ultra high cost of parts and even more so the poor dealer service network and poor reliability. High parts cost is ok if the experience of the car is good and they are reliable. So I really liked the late '90's/early 2000's VWs and nearly bought a Passat as it was much like my '90 Audi A4 - just a bit bigger but still almost as nice in size - practially an ELLPS. Fast forward to the later 200x's and the Passat is bigger, relatively cheaper, and softer. It's more like an American car but still poor reliability, expensive parts, and VW service network. That IMHO is why VW has missed the boat. And also agree that they are slow to respond."
May 2015,"How about color choice? As I posted if you want a top level Accord, hope black is your favorite color as that is the only color. Anything from EX-L up is limited in color too.. Not too sure what you mean by, "" you can get pretty much what you want."" In the domestic market you can order separate items, but the trick is finding a dealer that is willing to do it. Ricks father only buys buicks, he just bought a Enclave which he ordered and was able to get stand-a-lone items that where part of a package... So it can happen.."
May 2015,"If that were to actually happen, which we all now is highly doubtful, Honda might change - or they might not.Buying cars of the lot goes back to the beginning of the auto industry."
May 2015,"So why not consider building the polo in Mexico?Because it would require a dedicated line to build the Polo. It's on an older platform. In fact, VW sells the Vento in Mexico - a Polo based sedan. They import that from India."
May 2015,"you still can't get anything you want with a domestic. Maybe some more packages or stand alone options. But Honda has been this way for a long time, so not likely to change. Very efficient. And frankly, now that sticks are pretty much out of the mix, about the only issue is regarding the moonroof (mostly wanting leather, etc. without one). Other than that, you can get pretty much what you want."
May 2015,"IT works for them because the buying public allows it to happen. What would happen if Honda's sales would drop say, 13% a year and market research shows that people want to be able to order their cars? Would Honda change?We can order American cars too, but as it was pointed out the dealers don't like that, but it can be done, and use to be done quite often.."
May 2015,"That could be an option, but considering all costs, generally low volume and pricing centraints of US market, small cars are tough. It's not an easy decision to bring such a vehicle to here."
May 2015,So why not consider building the polo in Mexico?
May 2015,You can't make multiyear decisions based on six months of data. It has to work also when dollar is at levels from year ago.
May 2015,"Honda has been well known for that since the 1980's. Honda is well committed to the minimal trim lines within a model and then options are dealer installed model. It seems to work for them just fine and in reality, I find that most people would rather have that than a dizzying array of options to choose from. Further, it makes driving it home today much easier."
May 2015,"""The current US Passat is a fine car."" Yeah, maybe. But the 2008 Passat that I bought new back in 2008 was a much finer car. Much."
May 2015,"The strong dollar does make exporting the Polo cheaper but would it be cheap enough? What happens when the dollar weakens and then VW is losing money on every Polo imported from Spain? Perhaps if the next Polo (MK VII) moves onto the MQB platform, then it can be made in the US or Mexico and be profitable."
May 2015,"I remember, clearly, the first time a dealer sent me home in a new car the very day I signed the papers. It was in the evening, I was financing through my credit union, which of course wasn't open. I was like, ""How can you give me the keys and let me drive it home when you haven't been paid yet?""And then there was the first time a dealer told me to take it home for the weekend, see if I liked it, bring it back on Monday (or sign the papers if I wanted to keep it).""The world has moved on"", as Steven King kept repeating in the Dark Tower series. The older I get, the more I like / appreciate / resemble those words."
May 2015,"Honda is well known for this. 3 years ago, I would have bought an Accord if they would have sold me a V6 without a sunroof. No sale.Last year, I would have bought a CR-V if they would have sold me an EX-L without a sunroof. No sale."
May 2015,"Excellent summation, @robr2 I, for one, would like to see the Polo offered here as an alternative to the Fit, Yaris, Accent, etc.Shouldn't the strong dollar make imports cheaper?"
May 2015,"In ither words, they are too slow. BTW, great description, LOL."
May 2015,"As a VW owner and an active member of a VW forum, I feel that I can speak to some of their issues.Traditional VW buyers want a German made car with a Teutonic feel but they want it at Toyota, Hyundai, Honda prices. They complain about Mexican or US made models and cars targeting at the American market. But they don't get the fact that a German car made in Germany is going to cost more.The enthusiasts are worse. They complain about the lack of MK II Golf type car. They want the Polo to come to the US with a diesel, 5 sp, crank windows and no airbags. And they want it for $10K. They want the Bulli. They want the Amorak. They want the Caddy. Oh, and they will only buy them used.The current US Passat is a fine car. The problem is that VW didn't bother to upgrade it every couple of years like the big Asian companies do. A manufacturer can't sell the same car for 8 years anymore with a minor facelift at year 5.VW also has missed the boat on crossovers. They need a Tiguan replacement and a 7 seat crossover right now. They have talked about the Crossblue (Passat based 7 seat crossover) for 3 years now and they are targeting the 2017 time frame now."
May 2015,"VW has never really understood the US market since the days of the original Rabbit. The one constant has been their ""Throw it at the wall and see if it sticks."" marketing strategy"
May 2015,"VW's problem was they alienated their old customers, but initially gained some ground on their cheaper and dumbed down models, but ran out of steam. My guess is people figured out that if you want a Corolla clone, better get the original. To me VW is a cautionary tale to BMW. You may have an early success, such as a new Jetta and Passat had, but this doesn't guarantee long run. BTW, I read somewhere that new then Jetta and Passat were responses on dealers screaming for a car ""for Americans"". I guess beware what you wish for..."
May 2015,Well they seem to be having a hard time selling what they have out now. Their sales are down and way below targets.
May 2015,"Honda and Acura are at least honest about it: some things simply don't even exist in their catalogs. I can deal with that - if it's not there, it's not there. The problem is, others (Toyota, Ford, Mazda) have myriad of combinations ""available"", but units on dealers' lots are ""what sells"" (understandable) and salespeople are not very receptive to order talk (not understandable). BMW and Benz will usually gladly take an order. It seems VW dealers stay more on the ""popular brand"" side, i.e. it's as Roadburner said, ""cold fusion"" difficult. My other problem is, if not a single lot unit has certain type of option (like suspension) that is essential to the way the vehicle feels, how in the world can know whether or not I want it?"
May 2015,"It's probably both, self-feeding feedback loop. Because dealers have large inventory and expensive infrastructure to support they will always prefer ""bird at hand"" (aka instant gratification), they push more for it. The consumers know it, so they adjust behavior accordingly. Of course then dealers claim ""it's what customers want"". The gratification of actually driving the car the same day and having the interest payment stopped helps, of course."
May 2015,"I was aware of that. Current situation is a result of years of ""streamlining"". I probably should have chosen Toyota as my example, as those guys have much more elaborate option structure, yet the ordering mindset is just like Honda's, not BMW's."
May 2015,"The sales of the current Passt is higher then the last Gen, the previous Gen passt was too expensive, just like the Jetta. I too liked the previous Gen Passt, felt more like an Audi then a VW. I think this is why VW has a hard time selling the CC, it's expensive.."
May 2015,"You haven't been to the Honda Website in a while... BTW there are more then a few theoretical configurations you can't get at honda.. Some are classic color combo's.If you love Black or Grey leather interior then the Accord is your car, They do not have Tan in the sedan, and I doubt they have it in the coupe either. In the lower range Accord, they only offer it in two colors, Grey and Steel., you have to move up to and above the EX=L to get other body colors. Acura is the same, the have a limited selection of color combo's, if you want a MDX with a blue exterior, then you will have to settle for black or grey interior. Didn't we just talk about not having to settle when buying a car?"
May 2015,"I look at the Japaneses car companies at making appliances, you can't option out a washer, just move up to higher model. That is what the Japanese do, want leather in an Accord, then move up to the EX-L, if you are looking at the LX but want sunroof, you need to move up the higher model that might come with equipment you don't want. Lexus and Infiniti does this too. IF you want a 320i, but want leather and sunroof, you can do that and stay in the 320i model, if you want a 320i with sport package and manuel transmission yup, you can stay with the 320i... Sure I can go and purchase a fully loaded Accord EX-V6 for 35K, but it's still an appliance..."

May 2015,"I agree 100%. And the suits at VW should know better- especially after the drubbing they received in the early '80s when US built Rabbits were softened and ""Americanized."""
May 2015,"Taking delivery the same day is more of a dealer-driven phenomemon than a consumer need for instant gratification. It's the whole ""bird in hand"" thing.. They are afraid to let the consumer go home and think about it... either getting cold feet or shopping the deal."
May 2015,"You know, in the early 2000's VW had really made their interiors nice - a Passat I rode in had light yellow leather and seemed to me on an interior level the equal of a BMW interior. It was really luxurious. VW had product that both drove well and was very nice inside. Almost an EELPS!Then the US marketing decided they were going to make the cars bigger and softer and cheaper - just like a Toyota! Except that with Toyota you at least get inexpensive parts, a better service experience (usually) than the horrible and uneven VW experience, and much higher reliability! At the time I said that was a mistake, as why would you buy a Jetta turned Corolla when you could just buy a more reliable Corolla? And while VW was claiming they were going to sell a million cars/year in the US in five years, we see how that all happened. They sold like 390K or something last year and are less than half their targets."
May 2015,"yeah, on a Honda it is just a matter of doing a search for the specific model and color combo. Which is almost always out there someplace.only exception might be if you are holding out for a stick shift. There may be a few theoretical configurations (like a Navi) that don't exist in reality."
May 2015,"Try make an order at a Honda dealer - you get rolling eyes, laugh, dismissal, or even anger. Not to mention that Honda itself simply doesn't build ordered cars - it builds whatever it thinks will sell and then MAYBE you get lucky when one of those cars will be what you ordered. There is some chance, as they generally limit possible combinations. Look at the option list for a 3-series, then for an Accord. Big difference. Really, the only ""options"" are for dealer added accessories. You want leather for your LX? Sure, here's the Katzkin catalog. Can't get it from the factory. At all.But you can option up a 320i to $45K if you tick all the boxes.It's not comparing apples to oranges. More like apples to coffee tables."
May 2015,"Penske has a large auto dealership network and in Scottsdale they have a very large dealership that ranges from Porsche, BMW, Jaguar, Range Rover, and VW, the three times I was in that VW dealer (on the same lot as the Range Rover) the treatment was first class. Just too bad that VW has dummy down....Never impressed with their VW dealer, and haven't as yet been able to do business with them."
May 2015,"Dino, Pemske has a large auto dealership network and in Scottsdale they have a very large dealership that ranges from Porsche, BMW, Jaguar, Range Rover, and VW, the three times I was in that VW dealer (on the same lot as the Range Rover) the treatment was first class. Just too bad that VW has dummy down their line up, to be competitive with the likes of Ford and Chevy."
May 2015,"LOL, Roadburner. I think VW had one of the most inconsistent dealer networks out there. From absolutely horrible to first class and all in between. My observation is that it all depends on the parent corporation. If it belongs to a same place where premium German cars are sold, it's usually a very professional and nice place, not necessarily cheapest, but pleasant. Cross-pollination with fellow BMW or Audi usually helps. However, if it belongs to one of those Hyundai-Kia-Toyota-VW-fill-the-blank stores, the experience is not so great, probably for the same reason. Attitude toward order may be exact result of that - if company culture had already ordering on premium brands, it's no big deal to do that on lower end brand as well. However, if special order has never been on vocabulary of a Kia manager (not picking on them, just an example), when he moves to a VW store, he is not going to change his habits."
May 2015,Back in 2007 I was planning on buying a new GTI for my next HPDE instructor car; the local VW dealers acted like ordering a car was more difficult than achieving cold fusion so I walked and ended up with my MS3. A true blessing in disguise as I've since heard that the local VW dealers have a firm policy of refusing to hire service technicians with opposable thumbs...
May 2015,"It's the same instant gratification. The salesman gets paid when he sells stuff today. The order is in the future. It can be canceled. The owner is paying for bunch of iron on their lot so this future order (that may be canceled) is not paying off any existing unit yet, but if you had bought today one out of those on the lot, the bank gets the check and interest stops. The system is absolutely geared toward here and now and the players adjusted to it. The benefit is lower prices, the drawback - limited selection and reliance on guesses from dealers' and regional reps' what will sell in what proportions. They essentially already decided for us what we want. The German brand salespeople are usually well trained to accept orders and act like they're happy about it (even if they preferred to sell us something from the lot). Moreover, they generally have a system where every car has an order behind it (it usually is a sales manages, sometimes actual customer). They even have some ""special order"" options (like colors) that require actual end customer for production (managers sometimes create a virtual Joe Smith to work the system). Try make an order at a Honda dealer - you get rolling eyes, laugh, dismissal, or even anger. Not to mention that Honda itself simply doesn't build ordered cars - it builds whatever it thinks will sell and then MAYBE you get lucky when one of those cars will be what you ordered. There is some chance, as they generally limit possible combinations. BTW, those who make argument that order should be cheaper because it doesn't cost as much (no financing), it's true only in theory. In aggregate, all cars pay for the financing, including those that did not bear that direct cost. Also, if that logic was correct, a ""lot queen"" sitting there for months should have a premium sticker slapped onto it to cover that interest - but it's quite the opposite, isn't it? Because pricing decisions are only loosely linked to actual cost. The other parts are demand, psychology, planning, volume incentives, etc."

May 2015,"Our home was bought new, and the builder allowed some changes to be made to the interior of the house, Rick is seeing more and more builders allowing these changes to be made. So we did get the house we wanted, without playing the construction loan convert to conventional loan game.. We have a friend who did this in Carmel Calif, a very nice, very upscale seaside town in northern calif. After the house was completed at a cost of 6 million dollars the appraiser did not appraise the house at that price, so no loan.. Now, the house sits on a bluff over looking the pacific ocean, the dinner room, kitchen and family room each have 90 to 120 degree view of the ocean, it's simply breathtaking. So he is paying on a construction loan for now and working with 3 banks to convert this loan... Building a house is not the same as building and waiting 4-6 week for your car to come in. But we all know that American want that ""instant"" gratification, of walking into a dealer test drive, deal, and drive off with said car. Waiting 4-6 weeks is a life time to many Americans. I also do not think the dealers are willing to explain that the buyer can order a car of their choosing. Which I don't understand since the dealer wouldn't be paying interest on these cars and would be off the lot the following day it arrives..."
April 2015,"Over either one, but definitely over the 4 cyl TlX"
April 2015,"Over a TLX 4cyl, right?"
April 2015,I would save a lot of $ and get an ILX instead
April 2015,"Edmunds has a 2015 TLX V6 SH-AWD in their long term fleet. Here is a god write up on how it performs and how it compares to it's 4cyl brother: http://www.edmunds.com/acura/tlx/2015/long-term-road-test/2015-acura-tlx-performance-tested-how-does-the-v6-compare-to-the-four-cylinder.html Performance wise, the only thing it seems to lack is a proper set of shoes (Good Year Eagle LS All Season hardly qualifies as a performance tire) and some stronger brakes (easy upgrade as well)."
April 2015,"My wife and I certainly are regularly and frequently entertained by test driving. But there is actually a legitimate purpose too. Now, remember I said we -- broadly speaking -- don't test drive cars/SUV's that we are pretty certain we would NEVER buy. For instance, much as I might be entertained by driving a Corvette, I know in my heart of hearts I'd never buy one (even with your money). I just don't bother test driving them, therefore.I have test driven an X6 -- and NOW, I know I wouldn't buy one, but at the time, it did seem like it was possible. Also test drove an Acura ZDX, for the money, it was better than the X6, but, for the money, I'd go with an MDX and pocket the $10,000. Likewise, I just CAN'T justify an Audi A7 or S7 when, since I have driven both, there is an A6 and S6 that are as far as I am concerned identical. Now, I do like the looks of an A7, but not $10,000 more than I like an A6, and so on.I tested a couple of Jeeps (even the SRT 8 version) whilst we were shopping for the SQ5.I can't see myself testing a Malibu -- just not interested, nothing against the car, per se, just not for me.Same with a KIA Soul (is that spelled correctly?) -- but I would try (and have) an Optoma and am interested in a Genesis as a possible old-fart's alternative to an A6 for when I am 73, not 63, perhaps. And so forth.I don't want to waste the dealer's time nor my time -- but test driving is both good education and good fun (or at least it can be both).I'll not be testing a VW bug anytime soon, but I have tested the Toureg (and the Cayenne) and the Q7, too -- a VW CC sure is purty and in AWD trim could be #11 on my top 10, so to speak.Within reason -- REASON -- I would think dealers need as many folks of means testing their cars as they can get their hands on. My wife and I test drove an Acadia a number of times -- came moderately close to moving on it, instead went with a 2011 FX35 (Infiniti). If ""y'all"" want to comment with both an informed and entertained perspective on this forum, I would think that, plus your love and passion for cars would make you want to carve out at least one weekend every other month or so for test drive after test drive after test drive. But, on the other hand, kids, in-laws, dogs and cats, broken pipes and blown A/C compressors can sometimes get in the way of the 'serious bidness' of test driving cars [for a living].Drive it like you live."
April 2015,"You don't know my friend. He would never do that. He purely and clearly (by his own admission) ""test-drove"" those cars for entertainment purpose only. ""The story"" was for the external consumption. BTW, this is just part of his behavioral pattern, so the hypocrisy thing is just endemic to him in many other aspects of his life. Not that I'm free of it myself, I just admit it when it's clear (he doesn't)."
April 2015,"I really don't see any ""hypocrisy"" in any of this. I have test driven many cars that I did not expect to buy. And at least twice during my life I have purchased something that I never thought I would purchase, based primarily on that test drive."
April 2015,"Yeah, I'd like to test drive more than I do. But I'm too considerate of the dealer's business. I have a friend with no such limits. He goes and pretends to be interested in a new S-class just so he can ""experience"" it. Too me it's embarrassing, but he doesn't care. He always creates some fake justifications, how this pretending is not in conflict with his proclaimed christian faith (like ""I may be interested in this car in 20 years"", or equally ridiculous notion). Well, he does those things with (justifications) with other things, too - so I'm used to that hypocrisy by now."
April 2015,"I know my next F10 or should I say G30 will be ordered- well lets hope BMW does not carry over the current 3 series front end to the G30. PLEASE BMW, DONT."
April 2015,"dino -- good point, I would, however, say that his observation perhaps at least suggests folks don't test drive as much as they used to (or as much as my wife and I do NOW.) I'd say my wife and I are really oddballs, in that we test-drive new cars as serious hobby-ists. I like to think, however, we don't test drive cars we're pretty sure we'd NEVER buy. Of course there was that one test drive of a new Lincoln crossover, what were we thinking? The thing had a horrible suspension -- reminded me of driving a full-size van (where we live, down by the river.)"
April 2015,"I think that claim of your friend's is based on observation that many of his purchases are based on customer walking in and buying without testing. What he doesn't see, or account for, are customers testing first in any location, then going home, sending emails and setting up transaction with the best offer, which may not be the place they actually test drove."
April 2015,"I did not say a ""million per year"" -- but that technicality was not really the point. The spirit of what I was saying was simply that cars, like houses, are very expensive purchases, yet we seem (to me, and I am only speaking for me) to buy these expensive durable goods with (what I perceive) not much discriminating thought put into the expenditure. But, perhaps the system is set up that way -- folks go to the auto dealership thinking they want a dark blue metallic car with an ecru interior but, for the sake of -- what? -- expediency end up with gloss black paint and a light gray interior. All I am saying (about myself) is I grew up in the 1960's when a brand new Chrysler Newport was under $4,000 -- which, for my parents, was a HUGE purchase. Since it (the 1963 Chrysler Newport) was my parent's first new car ever, they wanted (god knows why) seafoam metallic (a kind of medium green with a shiny tinge to it), automatic transmission, an AM radio with a rear seat speaker, a rear window defroster and power steering and power brakes. My parents thought (I assume) since they were ""spending a young fortune"" they should get exactly what they wanted, not necessarily just what was on the lot. That mode of thinking stuck with me. Me -- not you, not other 'mericans, apparently.My way is not correct for anyone else but me (but it might be, for all I know) -- it is, however, not incorrect.Considering it would be less expensive if we ordered cars and considering that ordering a new car is almost the only way to get exactly the car you want, I simply struggle with the notion of ""test drive and buy today."" Clearly cars are bought in less than logical or even financially advantageous ways. Makes some sense, though, since cars are very emotional ""things"" -- or, better said, ""cars make US, emotional and irrational.""Here's another ""shocking"" data point -- my friend who owns several car dealerships claims that less than 50% of people even bother to test drive a car anymore. I assume (doesn't make it so) this must have something to do with the age of the Internet. I leave you as a product of my time -- which had its formative years in the '60's and '70's, apparently."
April 2015,"Big differences, Rob. I guess Tampa buyers ain't big on leather, or so think the sales managers. C300: 130+ units, FIVE leatherC400: 50+ units, TWO leatherI may be wrong by one or two units."
April 2015,"That is exactly my experience, too. I had to go multiple times just to see how some of those trim colors look like in real life. Another example is dynamic handling package or 3/4-series. Sounds good, especially on X-drive cars that don't get sport suspension with their sport and M-sport lines. NOT A SINGLE unit available with that, across the board - 3-series, 4-series, sedan, coupe, whatever. ZERO. How do I spend, or not spend $1000, if I don't even know what it actually brings? The significance of this one is suspension can completely change ride experience, just like engine, or say type of drive, so it's quite important to know how it will act."
April 2015,"Depends as you said. Local MB dealership has:101 CLA Class in stock - 22 with leather 22%109 C Class in stock - 38 with leather 35%91 E Class in stock - 60 with leather 66%986 Total in stock - 457 with leather 46%Notice as the base price goes up, more leather in stock.Dealers stock what people want. It's a $2300 upcharge for leather in the C300. That's 6%. I would guess that more than half of all C's are leased. The C300 leases at that magical price of $399 a month. Add another $50 a month for leather and it crosses that threshold where some folks start to get nervous."
April 2015,"Agreed on that one. Yes, it would suck, if the car died. However, the arrangements can be made, like buying a cheap car for time being (it is of course much more hassle, but I once almost did just that). I also think there are ways to prevent most of sudden deaths of vehicles, at least maintenance-related. An accident or act of nature with a total would be one that may not be fully preventable. Another reason for European market being the way it is, stems from simple price-to-income relationship. Cost of a new car may be there in similar proportion to our cost of house. People buy and keep them for much longer, they cost more not just in dollars, but even more in relation to their earnings power. When you see that, it's easy to understand why somebody would get exactly what they want. If one trades cars every three years, there is always ""next time"" for the dream car, whatever it actually means."
April 2015,"One, new home construction hasn't been over a million per year in years. It may be that someone actually pays more for cars than housing over a 30 year period but IMO it would be exceedingly rare. I pay more in real estate taxes alone than I pay for my present 3 vehicles per year. Equating a home purchase with a car purchase is apples to oranges at best. Americans can and probably should be ridiculed for many things but the way they buy cars should be way, way down the list."
April 2015,"Dino, isn't the 4 GC by definition a rarity, so easily within the 5% margin? You are likely pretty unique in terms of what you want, so certainly should order. But that doesn't mean the majority of buyers aren't getting what they want by settling.I guess though this is a board about higher end, more expensive cars. So out of the mainstream!It also would suck if your car died, and you had to wait 12 weeks for a replacement."
April 2015,"It's not about Europe being ""Oh so special"". It's just a statement of fact that in the US we pay much less for cars, but in turn we have to accept limited choices provided by the manufacturers (like only 2 gas and 1 diesel engine on 3-series sedan, even less choice on other body styles, no manual transmissions, etc.), which is even more narrowed by dealers due them stocking only what they believe they can sell quickly - and customers wanting to drive away with the car at the day of the transaction, not in six weeks, not even in next day, or two. It's all part of the system, a tradeoff for significantly lower prices. Again, I don't blame them, just stating the fact. The reason of those systems evolving that way are many, some cultural, some geographic, some legal, some economic. In overall, I'll take lower prices for less choice every day of the week - but it doesn't prevent me from wishing there was more choice, at the same price, of course  . But as a realist I know ain't gonna happen."
April 2015,"Good point about ordered cars costing less than on-the-lot cars. My wife ordered a 2005 and a 2008 BMW X3 and the sales rep was quick to inform her that an ordered car gets an immediate MSRP discount of $500 (maybe it was $300, I don't remember exactly) since the dealership won't have to pay ""floorplanning"" (a.k.a., interest) fees.I've not even attempted to order an American car, although when I test drove a new CTS, I got the sense ""it would not be necessary,"" since ""anything"" could be found using the dealer locator software. I didn't pursue this path, so I don't know how accurate that statement was.At my dealership, my salesrep claims he would rather send people out on test drives of the various models and then sign up new customers to order the exact cars they want. He says this is because so many of their cars are ""on allocation."" Apparently, this means you will allocated so many A7's (for instance) and that is it -- be guided accordingly. This excludes ""ordered"" cars. The Audi leasing system devalues Prestige Audis residuals, so the dealers, knowing that the vast majority of the cars they sell will be leased, order in Premium Plus models which have higher residuals, hence lower monthly payments. My wife wanted (hold on) the heated cup holder in her 2014 SQ5 -- guess what? Only comes on the Prestige model (of course). The tracking headlights, too, Prestige only. We got around the lease penalty by buying the car @ 2% APR -- no lease residual hit. I'm assuming, however, that the trade in value will be lower since the car has virtually everything on top of being a Prestige.Here's another issue with the current American Way of buying: there is virtually no opportunity to experience certain options, since the dealer rarely stocks cars with (for example only) Blind Spot Monitoring or Top View Camera, etc. Also it is virtually impossible to find a car with sports seats in stock since ""sport seats"" only come on cars equipped with ""summer only"" tires and here in SW Ohio, no one wants summer tires, and so on.The Munich dealer, on the other hand, seemed to have at least ONE of everything (to test, but not to buy) so that the customer could see it, feel it, hear it, experience it and drive it.I'm not sure what ""oh so special Europe"" suggests, but it seems somewhat of a dis. I'm not saying the [apparent] ""European way"" should be adopted here in the US. Most folks seem happy with buying off the lot -- to each his/her own self be true --and the cars that I want can still be ordered exactly as I want them, so we do have a system that certainly seems like it's working.As a further point of clarification, hundreds of thousands of people -- check that, millions of people -- build new houses (or they hire companies and contractors to do so). I realize that many of these built houses are from ""Home Building"" companies that offer customers ""The Pemberton,"" ""The Gladstone,"" and ""The Barrington"" (or some such names) that are floor-plans that allow some customization (kind of like a car). There are also custom ""Home Builders"" that will build it entirely your way. And, there are local builders who offer highly customizabel houses based on a couple dozen blueprints. Even those who do not build their houses from the dirt up typically shop until they find the facing and floor-plan that satisfies certain criteria. Some folks take months and months of house hunting before they pull the trigger on a $400,000 house, but will turn around and buy a $40,000 car after a 15 minute test drive (and they buy car after car after car the same way). Some folks probably spend more money on cars over a 20 to 30 year real estate mortgage term than they do on the house they call home -- always settling for what's on the lot.What a world."
April 2015,"Depends. It may be true for some brands, where options and packages are limited. Not so much in BMW or Benz (even if their options are limited vs. Europe, they still come with plenty of available combinations). Probability of finding my favorite combination within 300 miles is basically null. I'd like 435i Grand Coupe with sport line (but not M-sport - ripoff, well let's say ""too expensive for value"") with red exterior, black upholstery w/ red stitching, dark burl walnut wood trim, premium package, technology package, driver assistance package, harman kardon sound (negotiable), but no lighting package (ripoff), I'm flexible on wheels. No. of cars within 300 mile - ZERO. There is nothing even close, like one option missing/too many. Even compromising on the color and/or upholstery and/or trim still does me no good. So no, ""pretty much anything"" does not apply. Sport line is rare, there may be one or two units per five local dealerships - of course in a completely wrong configuration. It just so happens that my perception of value seems to be completely different than sales managers of those dealerships. I see Sport line as a highest value, because it gives you seats and suspension without all that other fluff - and you get gorgeous red on black stitching (if you choose that color) to boot. They seem to think that if you want the suspension and seats, you must also want all those other aesthetic additions and accents that BMW charges you extra 2 grand. I disagree, but who am I?Same thing, Benz - there may be 50 or 100 units in C-class on a local major dealer lot (TB Mercedes), yet ZERO (literally) with real leather, all that fake stuff. This is how it were at some point, anyway - perhaps today they have one, who knows. That's what people buy, they say. It may be true. Leather is expensive at Benz and the fake stuff looks ""just as good"" - so they say. I wouldn't know, as there isn't even a single one to inspect."
April 2015,"We do it because we can. Simple as history. If there were megalots of cars sitting on every corner in Euro cities they would be doing the same thing. They order because they have to. In Europe the car dealers probably took over the space where carriages were custom ordered. In the U.S., the car dealers just built facilities on the next 10 acre vacant lot in the suburbs. It's just a different way of doing things and for every anal car addict that posts here(and I don't mean that derogatorily) there are thousands of people who look at cars as transportation.....even those cars costing $70k. They just consider them just more luxurious transportation. I'm pretty sure cars a less expensive in the U.S. and people turn them over a lot quicker than they do in Europe on average. If I knew I was going to keep a new car 10-12 years and it cost me a lot more I may be a tad bit more picky too."
April 2015,"Also without ordering, many people still pick what they want. Just rpthrough dealer swaps or incoming allocations. So you can wait a few days at most and get pretty much anything.I think this discussion is more about the small # of fanatics that obsess about certain things like a moonroof impacting COG. Or a stick shift! Very few people track their cars. Including BMW and audi buyers. So not many folks will wait 10 weeks to get a unit without a moonroof. They just keep the shade closed. So outside of truly custom builds (off the menu). With all the inventory around, you can probably find 95% of anything in a few days."
April 2015,"So even in oh so special Europe, it looks like it's easy to buy off the lot like a plebe.It's all relative. Don't compare Birmingham to Paris  How many dealerships and units are available in all five boroughs of New York City? Europe has quadruple number of versions and options of same models sold in the US. 3-series had something like 4 gas and 4 diesel engines available, many options stand alone, etc. What here is a four-five page option sheet, there is a thirty-fifty page book. It costs over twice as much, of course. But I'm sure there is still plenty of inventories for those wanting one today. There may me more warehouses there, rather than actual dealers lots. It's quite common there to have a showroom downtown and off-site lot in commercial suburbs."
April 2015,"The vast majority of Americans want their new cars TODAY!! Waiting 6-12 weeks isn't the norm.Now I decided to check out an Audi dealer in Birmingham UK. They have 174 Audis in stock and a total of 896 among it's 4 locations. I checked out a couple of Audi dealers in Frankfurt and Berlin. Each has about 100 new Audis in stock but when you do a search, it returns 5,790 new vehicles available - I'm guessing those are all the Audis in stock somewhere in Germany. A dealer in Paris has 37 vehicles in stock.So even in oh so special Europe, it looks like it's easy to buy off the lot like a plebe.My local dealer has 319 Audis in stock. Following is the color breakdown:Gray 104Black 93Blue 49White 34Silver 31Brown 5Red 3"
April 2015,"Bingo. There is something in current American culture that prevents people from waiting for anything. That was not how the country was founded, but it is, how it evolved. Instant gratification is so entrenched that people would rather get a different color, no sunroof, or ugly (in their opinion) wheels rather than wait for what they actually want. One would think that products of such high value would be carefully selected and purchased to the specification of the customer, but the waiting seems almost ""unamerican"". I literally had to deal with blank stares and puzzled looks from all involved, from sales people, to coworkers, when I said I (want to or) ordered my car and it will come in couple of months. ""Why would you wait?"", they asked. I think there is a strong feedback loop in this - people want an instant gratifications, so the dealers and manufacturers adjusted to that world view by taking large inventories of product (nowhere else in the world car dealers have such enormous inventory) - which in turn conditions them to attempt to push for sales of what they already have (financing cost of the inventory) rather some future product that may even get canceled. Sale can be really booked when when the product and funds changes hands, not when order is made and just a small deposit is made. The finality of spot delivery gives a lot of incentives to everybody involved to accept what is there, rather than what may be there. This of course creates sales people with blank stares and puzzled looks when they meet a ""pickey"" cutomer (like me), who wants an exact color, style and options and is willing to wait for it. Customers know that, too and they know their power of instant gratification works the other way, as well as their own. Unit taken off the lot today, is one with no more financing cost. I always read that an ordered car should be less expensive than one from the lot, because it's not financed. This is true in theory, but the psychology works in exactly opposite direction. The sales people act like they're making you a favor by accepting a future order rather than taking the car from the lot (and for reasons stated above, they may even believe that), which means you should pay for that ""favor"". If you were more ""accommodating"" to their immediate needs (take one unit from the lot), they may be more ""accommodating"", too. As a result, some people who would be willing to wait hear they could get extra $1000 off the car on the lot (even if it doesn't make any sense from cost-plus point of view), so they adjust their expectation and take one with a different color or wrong options, just so they can believe they got a better deal. It even works for them long term, as such a customer, who bought a ""deal"" may be more willing to accelerate next purchase, as they may never get over that color, or those wrong options. That's how the feedback loop closes - since people are willing to accept ""imperfect"" product, why change the business model that ""works""?"
April 2015,"Most people buy houses and suits off off the rack too. Like cars, the % of people that design, build and wait is pretty small.Some people also buy because they need a car quickly. Others aren't that picky about ever option, as long as it looks good, and has the important stuff. Or with a Honda, they are all the same!"
April 2015,"Mark - interesting points you make. As a moderator here at Edmunds, I help folks with lease numbers (MF and residual). Often the question comes up about picking a car that is a good deal - I often reply with something along the lines of ""when you're looking at a $30K / $40K / $50K / $60K car, why wouldn't you get exactly what you want rather than what the dealer has on the lot?""When we bought my wife's Outback in February, she wanted a specific color and option group. Fortunately, a local dealer had one coming in equipped exactly that way, so it was a fairly easy transaction. But, should I find myself in the market for a car with that price range, I'd have no problem ordering it to my exact specs."
April 2015,"According to my dealer rep, you can delete the sunroof on ordered vehicles. The thing is, however, the thought is you must pay to play when you order a car either in an unpopular color or with options deleted that will make the car, er, ""unmarketable.""Increasingly, even the German cars are only purchased ""off the lot"" -- as we Americans seem to want immediate gratification -- so cars are ordered that the dealer feels confident will sell within some reasonable time frame, thus not incurring interest charges that are above the planned amount.The off the lot mentality, too, is why so many cars in stock are black, gray, silver with black interiors, etc. We've apparently decided that we want our cars with black paint and black leather -- it is very difficult to find cars with more imaginative color combinations, or without certain packages. I don't fault the dealers, though, car buying is: test drive and buy on Saturday and, if possible, drive it home on Saturday.My wife's friend bought a very nice new car, about $70K before discount. A long Saturday test drive, followed by an offer, followed by a pick up on Monday. Wham bam, thank you m'am.Now, the car in question looked like the Batmobile (well, sort of) and it is a very very nice ride. But, this method of picking out a $70K car seems like settling. I guess it is possible the car was configured EXACTLY as wanted, so ordering it was unnecessary.But, why not take the time to ""build"" the car just like many of us build the houses we live in, the suits we wear, etc; and, then wait for the thing to be fabricated to your specifications?Clearly, there is something wrong with me. I am thinking that I purchased ONE new Audi off the lot and purchased one ""previously owned"" Audi (essentially off the lot, too) out of 32 of them. I kept the new one I bought off the lot for less than 12 months because it wasn't equipped to my liking. See, something's just not right with me.The last time I was in Germany was 2005 -- at that time, the Audi dealer in Munich I spoke with said they keep no inventory other than cars for test drives because ""everyone"" orders their cars. Well, sure, I thought, you're in Munich -- but the same thing is true in Zurich. Folks decide to buy a car, work with a dealer rep to order the car, wait 4-6 weeks and pick it up -- getting EXACTLY the car they wanted. Is this still European practice?Anyway, if you don't want a sunroof, order the damn car without it -- it's your money after all."
April 2015,"On an E36 the sunroof cassette adds 65 pounds to the highest point of the car. As TC Kline told me, ""It's equivalent to strapping your car's battery to the roof..."""
April 2015,"I, for one, would still do it. Delete the sunroof, that is, even if the price did not decline.Sunroofs steal headroom, usually about 2 inches. The only car I have been in with a sunroof that did clear my head was a Genesis."
April 2015,"No credit if you don't want the sunroof,"
April 2015,"I'd prefer a credit, even without one I'm just happy not being forced to take a hole in the roof."
April 2015,"If you delete the sunroof do you get a CREDIT?I've seen some of the ""delete"" options, and while they allow it, they don't change the price.I purchased an Audi 5000CS quattro some time ago (it had 15,000 miles on it). The window sticker was in the glove box -- the car had wool seats (with a delete leather seats, noted on the sticker). I liked the seats, even though I am not a fan of seats that cannot simply be wiped with a damp cloth -- but I bought the car previously owned, after all. I assume wool seats must be the default in Europe, but this was not a gray market car -- it was a regular US spec 5000CS with pearl paint (optional) and delete leather seats (a no cost option).Since sunroofs are only ""standard"" in some markets, I have to assume that the decision to include a sunroof in the US is the fact that we Americans want sunroofs and EXPECT them and perhaps would not like seeing a sunroof (which is a right, after all) with a line item with a charge on it on the window sticker.I wonder if there is an economy of scale making the bundling of options for a particular market a way to both increase profits for the US (for instance) arm of the company and to somehow suggest that the content of the car is actually higher than competing models.Friend of my wife just went test driving Audi and BMW. Configured two cars as close to identical as the web site configurators would allow; the BMW's MSRP rose more quickly than the Audi's, even though they seem to be comparable when ""stripped"" (which is due to the fact that the Audi has more content than the BMW in base form). Then the BMW surges past the Audi when the option boxes are checked off in an attempt to keep the cars as close as possible in terms of their equipment levels. I don't know if anything was actually proven, but her friend ended up with a 2016 A6 3.0T Sline Prestige for about the same price as a 4-cylinder BMW 5 series with a couple fewer options. The BMW seemed to shoot up in price as the attempt to content it like the Prestige package moved forward.But this may be an example that isn't typical -- maybe the BMW is comparable assuming you don't put ventilated seats, heads up display, sport package and LED headlights on it -- I find the configurators take a lot of work to pull together comparable equipment levels (and maybe that's the point.)I tried doing this with a Porsche Macaan vs an Audi SQ5 -- the Porsche dealer said the differences in price for content were very small. My calculations came up with about a $15,000 difference. Maybe that is what Porsche figures is a small difference.Hell, at these price points, price isn't really the main selling factor -- after all, if what we wanted was a lot of bang for our bucks, we'd all buy KIA's, yes?"
April 2015,"BMW has always been one of the worst brands with respect to options and how they are ""packaged.' I do have to give Munich kudos for offering the sunroof delete option on the M235i..."
April 2015,"There are plenty if buyers that would never know they have one, or drive in a way it would make a difference. Heck, plenty probably can't tell ( or really care) what wheels are driving it. Catering to the small % of buyers that really appreciate performance is why the S models exist."
April 2015,"Mark, many people on this forum have said this, regarding the Germans they will nickel and dime you on features that should standard, Bluetooth audio should be standard, it's not... Backup camera, Alarm systems..But in the end the buying public dictates what comes standard..."
April 2015,"flight:Virtually all of the decisions regarding these cars are ultimately made by the buyers -- not the shoppers, not the bloggers, not the professional reviewers. Some of the decisions are made by governmental bodies who do require certain features, mostly or usually for safety concerns. On the other hand, MARKETING, should -- if you ax me -- should market several of these cars, particularly the ""S"" cars with the Sport Diff; and, I think sport diff should be an option on ALL of the other AWD versions.The reason it is not, I'm guessing is to keep the base price as low as possible. The loaner S4 I received the other day didn't have a backup camera -- which I thought was, at the very least, odd. It is in the pipeline of government mandate for the 2017 MY is it not? The High End Germans (and others) should probably be ahead of this in making the camera already standard.One of my early Audis came with electronic stability program, I think back in 2000 -- it became a standard in 2012 as I recall. Same deal with ABS, the high zoot Germans had it long before the more pedestrian offerings, yes?In any case, the statement that the customer makes the decision is one that I totally agree with. Sunroofs must be more ""desirable"" even if they're rarely opened (like mine). I wouldn't miss a sunroof if it didn't come ""standard."" I'd take the sport diff in a heartbeat, instead."
April 2015,
April 2015,"I've long said that the Sport Rear Diff should be standard on all Quattro Audi's, especially S models like the S4. Whoever decided that making moon roofs standard was more important for about the same price as the Rear Diff option should be shot. How can anyone choose navigation or sun roof over the torque vectoring? I'm dumbfounded."
April 2015,"I've long stated and believed that the only mag that doesn't sound like cheerleader marketing was Consumer Reports. It would be hard to pinpoint obvious direct blatant biases with proof, but you get the general impression of bias from advertisers in magazines that derive income from advertisers."
April 2015,"I agree with your review of the S3.They should have used the amazing 7-speed DSG unit from the S4, not the same old 6-speed dating from 2006. That would solve your RPM at high cruising speed dilemma. They should offer an option to forego the sun/moon roof, save a grand, and save the hassles of an improper cover."
April 2015,Yes; the 335d gets the 8HP45- go figure; I remember a BMW engineer saying that the reason that the 335d was only available with an automatic was because they didn't have a manual box that could withstand the torque...
April 2015,Interesting even the 35d's with the 400+ lbs of torque..
April 2015,My mistake- the 550i gets the 8HP70- as do all the BMW V8s.
April 2015,So the F10 550i gets the weaker transmission?
April 2015,"The 8 sp 
The 8 speed ZF(8HPxx) is used in a lot of different brands and depending on the model it can handle anywhere from 332 lb-ft to 665 lb-ft of torque. That said, the F20, F30 and F10 get the 8HP45, which is not as strong as the 8HP70- which sees duty in the F01, E70, and all the Chrysler/Dodge Hemis save the Hellcats(8HP90)."
April 2015,Do you really think so??
April 2015,"This is an excellent question, maybe BMW and Audi have one transmission that is used in all of thier cars, maybe the 8spd in my 320i is the same as used in the 550i, if so then the transmission can handle the extra power and torque.."
April 2015,"If you want a much faster car, buy a much faster car. Not only does it hurt resale value (unless it is easily reversible) to make these mods, but there's always give and take in terms of effects upon the car. You don't get something for nothing. My Mini is now 40 hp faster but it also burns fuel a lot faster."
April 2015,"@markcincinnati ""This (the above) is coming from a been there done that perspective -- my wife was becoming a sitting duck everytime she attempted to merge with high speed traffic. We ended up just getting the high output version of the car -- shoulda gone with that one in the first place.""Driving what? A 3 cylinder Geo Metro Convertible with a 3 speed automatic transmission? My daily driver is a 175 horsepower, 4 cylinder, normally aspirated Subaru Legacy. While it is far from a performance vehicle as far as acceleration goes. I'd categorize the Legacy's get up & go as adequate. We have some old roads with some very short on ramps with stop signs at the end. Now I need to plan ahead, but have no problem getting up to speed eventually."
April 2015,Maybe it's to cover the warranty exposure; who knows?
April 2015,"How is it that a power-plant that outputs, say, 250 pound feet BEFORE chipping and 340 AFTER not putting stress on the transmission originally designed for the original torque output (with some margin built in for durability)? The thing is, such upgrades of blown engines often do produce massive torque improvements (at low RPM's) -- and initially there usually does not appear to be any negative consequences of the added twist. But, over time, won't the transmission almost be expected to have a reduced lifespan?My point would be ""let the buyer beware"" -- go with a factory approved chip provider, if one exists. If Dinan does not risk the warranty, go with them for your BMW upgrad; if APR has no affiliation with Audi, well, be guided accordingly and put about $15,000 in a bank account called ""Just In Case"" -- or just get the uprated model usually offered by the manufacturer in the first place.This (the above) is coming from a been there done that perspective -- my wife was becoming a sitting duck everytime she attempted to merge with high speed traffic. We ended up just getting the high output version of the car -- shoulda gone with that one in the first place.It continues to amaze me as I read the posts on Audiworld.com made by people who haven't even signed the papers for their new fill-in-the-blank Audi model -- usually titled ""Let the mods begin."" Folks are buying A4 SLines and immediately begin spending sometimes governmental sums in an attempt to turn their SLine A4's into S4's. Why not just buy an S4 in the first place -- about the same costs, sometimes less and no warranty risk.Color me confused.Nevertheless, drive it like you live."
April 2015,"I agree they are pricey but I really think they are crazy expensive these days, I had about $8K of Dinan in my 330, which went pretty far.."
April 2015,"Dinan has always been the very high priced option; the Hypertech for my Mazda has a street price of $400. The Ford Racing power kit(tuner, plugs, cold air intake) for the Focus ST boosts torque by 90 lb-ft and preserves the factory warranty when installed by a dealer. It's only $795."
April 2015,"The other issue I have with Dinan is the price, Dinan just came out with a new line of Electronic tunes for the F cars, starting at a low price of $1500... My tune was $357.. The Dinan tune is to make 237hp for the El Cheapo 320i, the claim doesn't whether it is crank HP or RWP."
April 2015,"Dinan and BMW work closely together, and if you have any Dinan work at an authorized Dinan shop, it is covered under the factory BMW warranty. My 330 had many Dinan upgrades to it and never had a problem. My piggy back on my 320 has been flawless, not one problem, no code issues. Now if I had a M5 and was having issues after upgrades, I would take those upgrades off and want my money back... No fun having a car like a M5 sitting in the shop.."
April 2015,That's very odd; I believe that Dinan uses piggyback tuners on those cars. I've run Dinan and Conforti chips in pre-OBDII Bimmers with no issues at all.The Hypertech tune for my MS3(when paired and calibrated for the Mazdaspeed CAI) boosted my power by 46 hp and also added 44 lb-ft of twist- @314 hp and 324 lb-ft of torque. No SES faults and no driveability issues- and fuel economy actually increased a bit. No regrets whatsoever.
April 2015,"There are ""chip"" providers that do provide a warranty -- far as I know, though, most of their products are NOT approved by the MFG's. Volvo has partnered with Polestar and cars chipped (from the factory, of course) by Polestar are covered by the OEM warranty. I don't know if Dinan has any formal relationship with BMW that somehow protects a customer with a Dinan modded BMW from financial ruin. I don't think StaSIS modded Audis carry an official Audi warranty, but cars so outfitted by StaSIS do have a full warranty and there are actual Audi dealers who retail from the ground up StaSIS outfitted versions.I chipped an Audi TT (MTM chip) and sometimes under full throttle, the engine would just shut off, requiring the car to be restarted. It did this intermittently, and it wasn't until we decided to trade the car in on a more powerful TT that MTM came out with the ""software patch"" that cured this issue.Chipping, initially, is an inexpensive way to get gobs of power (mostly torque) from blown engines -- but unless the chip's effects are 100% reliable and predictable, well, I am of the opinion that I will just get a bigger meaner more powerful version of the car in question, rather than trying to patch the OEM's software for engine management. Limp home mode is scary -- worse than that it can be unsafe.I'll live with 333HP and 325 pound feet -- I know the next one will have more of both and get better mileage, too. Poor poor me -- how can I possibly have the power to pass safely on the highway with such a tiny power package?!?"
April 2015,"I know we've spoken at length here about modifying cars via ECU reflashes and such. Certain manufacturers are lobbying to make it illegal to modify your car's computer.I have a friend with a 2012 X5 ///M & a 2013 ///M5. He's had both cars ""DINAN Chipped"" (as well as exhaust & suspension on the ///M5) and literally has nothing but problems with the cars. When they work, he LOVES the cars (and his wife's B7 X-Drive Alpina). But when he mashes the gas pedal trying to merge and gets a warning chime followed by a ""drive train malfunction"" message on his iDrive screen while his car goes into limp mode, he is less than thrilled."
April 2015,"I often reflect nostalgically about cars I've had in the past. The driving dynamics, features, etc. of new cars have improved so drastically in the last decade that if I was to drive one of my old favorites today I bet I would be very disappointed. My current 13 Accord is faster than many V-8s I've owned, gets 30mpg plus and doesn't require frequent maintenance and has been trouble free at 38000mi. It is safer, full of modern tech features, a pleasure to own. A far cry from roll up windows and an AM radio!"
April 2015,"My dealer's service department is one of the primary reason's that I've stayed with BMW as long as I have. My Service Advisor never tries to push unnecessary repairs or service and will tell me up front if a less expensive alternative is available.

April 2015,"Rick had his windshield replaced on his Geneses twice, the first one was so distorted that I was surprised that the installer from safelite even installed, that was replaced the same day, his second one was OEM and didn't have a problem. So I'm not too sure if that makes a difference or not but I wanted OEM glass installed."
April 2015,Not sure I want the sun baking those electronics and leather interior!
April 2015,"I just caught a rock a couple of weeks ago... My BMW dealer actually does windshields, which I didn't know until I called them for a recommendation. But, $1200 estimate vs. $600 for the local specialist... only about $200 of that can be attributed to the cost of the OEM windshield.. Just have a star right now, so I'm waiting to decide what to do.."
April 2015,"Very true. Few dealerships have the ability to change a windshield. They just sub it out and mark up the price.Even getting OEM glass isn't that simple. My understanding is that the OEM parts depots don't stock many windshields because of the time it takes to ship one via truck to the dealer. The aftermarket glass industry does such a good job and does it immediately that it's almost pointless for dealers to try and replace windshields.I've had 3 windshields replaced, all by Safelite and IIRC, all the glass was Carlite who is a huge OEM and aftermarket auto glass company."
April 2015,"So this past week, the windshield cracked on the BMW, When I got home called the dealer to see what they charge, was quoted $635 for the Windshield, and seal, then labor at $172/hr x 3 hours ($516) for a total of $1,151.. Of course the service manager is telling me how important it is to have the window replaces at the BMW because as he put it, he has seen some horrible jobs which cost the owner thousands of dollars to repair.. We have gieco for insurance company, and have zero deductible, but they will only pay $40 an hour for labor.. So I contacted Safelite, my quote complete with a BMW windshield was $634, this they came to the house and replaced it. It was interesting to hear this guy talk, he and another guy only do high end cars and they are the ones who go the dealership and do them.. So the dealer was going to make $500 bucks by having someone else do the work... So let you people know that Safelite can get OEM windshields and save some money and hassle, since they bill the insurance company direct..."
April 2015,"LOL, there are always hazards of driving convertibles..."
April 2015,One thing I don't like about convertibles in metro areas is that you and the car's interior get dirty from junk in the air.
April 2015,"Here in Phoenix I drove my Miatas with the top down ~40% of the time. I had a toneau cover and used the heater when necessary to good advantage. Of course, the issue here is the heat, and the Miatas had decent A/C.I drove an MGB over 100K miles in the '70s, and it had the top down a lot of the time as well -- no need to worry about A/C.Most places are less conducive to roadsters, or the high-dollar equivalents discussed here."
April 2015,"Next up, two more test drives, one in a $56,000 A5 2.0T quattro Cabriolet and one in a $67,000 S5 Cabriolet.Hmm, 365.25 days in a year.Question to self: Would you REALLY drive with the top down even 36 days per year (about 10%), or would the real number be even lower. Maybe a Cabriolet makes sense in LA, Both cars were super smooth, top up or down. The S5 was the champ due to the engine and transmission -- and, if you feel the need for losing your top, either one of these cars certainly scratch the convertible itch. . .but, no thank you.Not feelin' the Audi convertibles -- no matter how nice they are.Not feelin' any convertible, if you axe me."
April 2015,"When you're bored . . .. . . and you're 63 and your wife loves driving -- ""every mile's a smile"" -- and it is a truly beautiful day in SW Ohio (Saturday last), what do you do? Answer: You take cars out and drive them.I must admit, I wasn't all that keen on driving a dealer's car, especially since I know and they know and I know they know I know, that neither of us are currently in the market; but my sales rep, Greg, had a 2015 S5 with the Sport Differential option (and 60 miles on the OD) just sitting there, and, well, he knows my wife doesn't have any experience behind the wheel of an Audi S car with torque vectoring (TV). The rest as they say was inevitable.We went out for a long drive on familiar twisty (and in great condition) secondary roads. I went first at my wife's insistence to somewhat demonstrate what rear torque vectoring added to a rear-biased (60%) AWD car equipped with max performance 35 series summer only tires can do, out of the box.As I am familiar with the road where a sign indicating 15 MPH (right turn corner) is the correct speed, according to the Ohio DOT, to navigate the turn, I know my non-TV equipped S4 can take said curve @ 45 MPH. Therefore I assume that with the summer-only super sticky tires (I do not have these) and the TV option, the TV equipped car ought to be at least good for another 5 - 10 MPH without drama.I was proven correct in that I easily took this ""curve"" at 54 MPH with help from what feels like it could be ""The Hand of God."" Entering the corner ""hot"" (but maintaining, NOT accelerating) was a little unnerving at first, but when I reached the apex of the corner, I dialed in about an inch more lock and a like amount of throttle.The rear end of the car was seemingly grabbed by a giant foam rubber hand and the car ""carved"" right through he corner as if something or some one had gripped the rear quarter panels low to the ground and simply pushed me through the corner, virtually drama free. Speed? Yes? A bit of a rush coming out of the apex of the curve? Oh hell yes!Next up a left hand curve with a bit of a an opposite (from the expected and helpful) bank meaning the car was not helped at all by the highway engineer's decision to have the apex of the curve have a crown rather than a scallop. Once again, almost counter-intuitively I entered the curve hot, waited for the apex where I cut the wheel to the left (a bit) while simultaneously punching the gas ""with feeling.""Again, the invisible hand pushed the car, as if it were on rails, through the horribly under-engineered road.A couple of nice, virtually deserted straight-a-ways where the supercharged engine at full throttle thrilled, rounded out the first half of the ""test.""Up next, my wife -- our idea was this: I drove the outbound route and she would drive the return route, retracing my steps (in the opposite direction). My left curves were her rights, and so on. Once she got the hang of cutting the wheel just a bit more than seemed ""natural"" at the apex and punching the gas, she too was calling TV the hand of god.I guess, other than sharing this with y'all, I would invite you to experience a powerful car with rear biased torque split, aggressive summer tires and a ""sport differential."" Someone once said, ""nothing else even comes close."" I am ""OK"" with not having a car equipped with torque vectoring -- but, given a choice, I will never get another car (on purpose) without it. The Acura's SH-AWD is a great piece of tech; but, the issue is: It is installed on a car with a 90%/10% f/r torque split and the ability to shift a maximum of power to the rear of just 50%.So while I admire and recommend only getting an Acura equipped with SH-AWD, if you're looking at the brand, I can attest that, good as it is, nothing even comes close to the implementation of TV in the S5 I drove this weekend.Too bad I'm not in the market -- for an S4 thusly equipped would be sick.Drive it like you live.Mark, reporting from somewhere in Cincinnati -"
April 2015,"So. . . I guess we should all just take the gas pipe.Driving, or what's left of it, will soon disappear altogether.Maybe for you, but not for me out here where there aren't quite so many people."
April 2015,"CN, it's the first thing I noticed. The noise isolation is far better in the Q. It adds that ingredient of sophistication the G lacked but also the engine sounds better as well, particularly during rev-match when shifting in sport mode."
April 2015,"Completely agree. In fact, MOST drivers, not just the average one's will never even come close to what a lot of cars are actually capable of doing.Mean time, we're heading faster and faster toward more and more of less (that would be autonomous driving).Much as I like most of the new tech -- I must admit I will miss driving (mostly). My morning and evening drives to and from work, would be fine for a car that would drive itself and leave me out of the equation -- to enjoy my dopio."
April 2015,"I think we'll find that as the driving situation on American roads becomes more and more awful, the cars themselves, and their drivers, will continue to adapt to this new environment. The Model T Ford succeeded by paying close attention to the roads it was going to be used on, and I think the modern car is rushing headlong into providing a) safety b) convenience c) comfort, over any ""thrill"" of driving. Your average driver of a new S5 will never push the car to anywhere close to its capabilities."
April 2015,"Please chill -- overall, typically, generally speaking, etc, etc, things are as they are due to the market.For example, if shoppers who become buyers would buy ""whatever"" you can bet the supplier would provide as much ""whatever"" as possible.I live in Cincinnati -- Cincinnati surrounds a city called Norwood. Norwood WAS the city that made Firebirds and Camaros. WAS the city. The folks that built the cars did such insane things as put pop bottles in the doors, assuring the cars would be delivered with rattles. Time and time again GM would give in to the workers demands for ""whatever"""" -- predictably and obviously, but not so to the folks who actually built the cars, GM said, to hell with it, and announced the closing of the plant. Millions of dollars of salary and taxes would come to an end. The response? The workers ""threatened"" productivity.Too little, too late.I bought and/or leased ONLY stick shift cars through 2003. I couldn't even take my car to a full service car wash, no one knew how to drive it -- once the noise and smell of my gears grinding and clutch melting was so terrifying, I decided, ""I'm done -- the basterds (spelled that way on purpose) have won.""YOU are the reason the cars are as they are -- I bought nearly 30 manual transmission cars (from Germany, no less) the rest of you folks were buying auto transmissions. Now, after the plant's closing you threaten productivity? Too little too late.Now, you're being told, I gather, that if you want what ever it is that you want, you can find it in an ""M"" BMW -- well, folks, if you don't buy them, you can be 100% certain whatever it is that you think you want will be discontinued due to a lack of paying customers.The cars are as they are due to the market's acceptance (measured in BUYERS) of whatever it is they sell.If they sell purple, green, red and blue and no one buys a blue one -- figure out what will happen to the availability of future blue ones.You'd think this was some sort of plot against you -- foisted upon you by evil car manufacturers who only want to produce more and more car models and configurations that no one whats?!? Pull the other one.I don't know what is being taught today at US universities that passes for economics, but it must not include the simple explanation of demand and supply.Have you seen some of the car ads on TV? Some of them portray the company's cars being driven by handsome men and pretty women zooming off in the ""fill in the blank"" equipped with a stick shift. Clearly some cars with virtually nil up take on the cars marketed, still market the notion that folks lust for stick shifts (for example) -- where the rubber meets the road (where the cash changes hands) the transmissions are rarely manual.Let's talk about the upcoming reality, more and more driver aids -- less and less driver involvement -- that is where everything is heading. The reason things are heading where ever it is they are heading is MONEY.If you think we should have BMWs like they used to be decades ago, fine -- pony up the money.Not gonna happen, not gonna happen.I took a long test drive of an Audi S5 with the torque vectoring rear differential option and a DSG transmission -- Old School would be run over, chewed up and spit out by this . . . nothing old school, affordable by mere mortals, even comes close to this kind of performance.It's all about the Benjamins."

April 2015,"You can see the trends...BMW getting more ""middle of the road"" as is Infiniti.Audi seems to straddle the line a bit with it's regular A series, and cranks up the performance with the S and RS series.Caddy is moving more towards the good handling/performing, well built sports sedans in addition to handing with the perennial ""cash cow) Escalade.Acura, while I've always liked them, admittedly seemed to have been hit particularly hard by the crisis in Japan over the Tsunami and the subsequent nuclear reactor fall out. I think they're just now really recovering from that, Not sure why it's taken them so long to regroup vs their car manufacturing counter parts, but it has.I've read that Honda is ready to jump back into the fray with Si type products. And, you can see some of that trickling into the Acura space with the NSX, upgraded ILX, and what I'm betting will be a TLX-S not too far out. They're already the ""wagon"" of choice umping the more upscale SUV shoppers.Funny about BMW. I like them as well as any other brand I've owned. However, they do have a tendency to play the ""ready-fire-aim"" game. Take for instance the iDrive. When it first came out, it was terrible. BMW said we didn't understand it. That was part of the problem. They built an interface that no one understood. Now, we see them moving away from their ""core"" values as a car maker. They're getting further and further removed from the attributes that built them as a company. They say we want ""numb"" steering....really? Who told them that? Their market research is WAY flawed. Yet, they carry on, trying to convince us the problem is with their customers, not their engineering. May not hurt them now, but as their competition comes rushing in to fill the vacuum, they'll eventually find that they aren't alone as the ""ultimate driving machine""."
April 2015,Circle....congrats. Are we to assume the S model has hydralic steering?
April 2015,"I broke down and leased a '15 Q50S but it has AWD! Skipped the steer-by-wire which costs more for weird steering gremlins since it's new tech. I'm sure this will improve and they'll figure out the ""simulated steering feel"" settings going forward to satisfy everyone. (Saw one video that shows you can set the car to drive itself for a short period of time when cruising and lane assist engaged.)Love the seats in the sport with the thigh support and they did a great job on NVH reduction from the G. Fast but the Q isn't a weekend track mule, that's for sure. Only picked it up last week so not many miles since I'm traveling at the moment...."
April 2015,"Light at the end of the tunnel? 2016 7 SeriesGranted, the 7er is most certainly NOT an ELLPS, but a key quote from the story provides a bit of hope:There’s less steering feedback than we prefer, but in every other sense this light and lively 7 appears as if it may vault BMW back to its glory days as the world leader in driving dynamics.Unfortunately, it seems that when one refers to the steering of a current BMW as being ""dumbed-down,"" the characterization is-sadly-literally quite accurate:...tuning the electric assist to provide more[feedback] is not that much of a challenge. Unfortunately, luxury buyers whine when too much sense of the road tickles their fingers, so BMW engineers are forced into numb steering by customer demand."
April 2015,"Is this where I get to say ""please stop the drama?""I don't think I want to."
April 2015,"I think that the reason you like your S4 is because the things you liked about your 1995 car are part and parcel of the modern car's driving experience. VW learned the that lesson the hard way; after receiving all sorts of accolades for the Mk I and Mk II GTI, the Mk III and Mk IV were hammered for being soft and uninvolving. VW found the plot again(as the Brits put it) with the Mk V and have not deviated off course with the Mk VI or Mk VII.I know it is an overused concept, but when a successful automaker deviates from their core DNA, bad things will probably happen. In the case of BMW, the prevalent attitude is: ""Want a BMW that drives like a BMW? It's gonna cost you!"" It's akin to Hsu Research or Velodyne announcing, ""From now on, all of our subwoofers priced under $1,500 will sound no better than a Bose Acoustimass- but they will look just like our high quality subs. Fork over another $1,000 if you want the sound to match the nameplate."""
April 2015,"Old School -- not even sure, anymore, what that means exactly. I wouldn't give up ABS, ESP, Blind Spot Warnings, Parktronic, Rear, Front, Top-view cameras, torque vectoring differentials, brake assist, turbo or super charged ""cleaner"" engines, adjustable suspensions, dual clutch ""automatic manual"" transmissions, fuel stratified injection, voice commands, hand and eyes free phoning capabilities, sat navigation and all the apparently ""New School"" tech noted and most of what I didn't note, too.My all time favorite car -- until now -- was a 1995 Audi S6, fully loaded, manual transmission version. I loved that car. As my newer cars came along, I appreciated their improved technology, safety, performance and luxury, but that certain something the 1995 S6 had was always something I looked and hoped for.Finally, my '14 S4 has both that ""certain something"" (old school) coupled with the tech and features available on a modern car (new school).I bet if someone brought me a pristine 1995 S6 to drive, I'd find it, today, underwhelming.Of course, that was then, this is now . . . I've let go of the past, even though I still remember it with great affection. I really doubt there would be much of a market for old school vehicles anyway. . . .I can't wait for ""the next"" new school treat from the planet's best automakers.Signed,Often wrong, never uncertain."

April 2015,Unfortunately...$28K in 1987 is almost $58K in today's dollars.
April 2015,"True - even in the 80's, BMW was becoming a status car for poseurs. They may have been ""driver's cars"" but the vast marketplace wanted the symbol."
April 2015,"It's true, but they were ones who shouted from rooftops how great their product was, worth paying the money. So the crowd came, but BMW decided the services of shouting are no longer required. They may be right, for now. It's more important if in say ten-twenty years, when nobody shouts and people buy because they got a good deal, BMW goes Acura's way. It's easy to imagine that. Acura was also on the rise, until it was not. They basically have two models of consequence - MDX and TLX, and the latter one is still not close in popularity to old TL. I don't know, we will see."
April 2015,"A Physician at work just took delivery of a B6, talk about the right amount of luxury and sport in one car, it also has one of the best mid range torque curve I have driven. But the 150K price tag is big time fat."
April 2015,"Oh please stop the drama... These ""enthusiasts"" don't buy enough cars to keep the company afloat... I guess the M235 isn't good enough..."
April 2015,"""Old school"" cars are gone.... no one makes what they made 25 years ago... (or even 10 years ago).I love my 2006 E46... That's why I keep driving it.... nothing else out there like it.Also.. we had an '87 BMW 325iS.. (just a few years ago). That car was $28K in 1987.. even entry level was pretty unaffordable for BMW, then..."
April 2015,"It's interesting (I spent my luch break reading my most recent Roundel) that BMW is continuing to direct anyone who wants an ""old school"" BMW toward the M cars.I don't want to spend that kind of money. ""In the beginning,"" BMW made such cars at an entry level. They had solid steering, suspensions that made cornering fun, a manual transmission (& dipstick) and not much else.Those days are so gone.I don't want to spend $45K+. I can now, but I won't."
April 2015,"Damn!I actually like Ford products, in principle."
April 2015,"""I assume you mean the M6 Gran Coupe; it is a decent enough cruiser, but I can't saythat I like it all that much better than the B7 press loaner that I took to Motorsport Ranch in 2007""I stand corrected- its indeed M6 Grand Coupe- there is a white one on my dealer's floor with the brown leather- take about DROOLING."
April 2015,"But, Zaino, now there's a winner!A man after my own heart."
April 2015,"I've been reading the May issue of Road & Track and, in addition to a great article by my friend Sam Smith on driving an Alpina 2002ti racer at the Monterey Motorsports Reunion, there is an article on the introduction of the new Miata. Guess what Mazda did? They brought along a pristine 1st generation Miata so that journalists could appreciate how the new Miata remains true to the original concept. Can you imagine BMW even attempting something similar?"
April 2015,Calling cdnpinhead: 2015 Focus ST Diesel WagonNot for North America- of course... :@
April 2015,"RB....I drove both the 3.6 and the 2.0T in the CTS. 3.6L is a nice motor. I preferred the 2.0T. It pulled better in the very lower reaches of the RPM band. If it had been a 3.6L TT, then different story.But, as the review points out, it seems BMW is swapping places with the old Cadillac....getting softer, while the CTS is becoming more of an athlete in the group.In truth, I think performance numbers for the 3.6L and the 2.0L for the CTS are just about equal. Some rags have the 3.6L a few ticks faster, some have the 2.0L a few ticks faster. Pick the one you like best, which is what I did."
April 2015,"You payz your money, you buyz your car. Personally, while in the same league as the wife's F10 535xi, I much prefer driving my XF. While not lighter in weight, it feels so behind the wheel. XF seats better bolstered than the 5s standard chairs, both interiors nice, but the XF a bit more stylized. Both have their quirks, of course, e.g. hockey puck vs. beer tap shifter. Much better feel behind the wheel of the XF, 5 too boosted. Of course, iDrive is a bit better than the Windows Vista infotainment in the Jag! But, Zaino, now there's a winner!"
April 2015,"An M235i sedan, with a version of the 370 TQ 3.0 six cylinder from the 2011 335iS coupe I had [ and the ZF 8 speed automatic ] would interest me.A lot - if priced reasonably .....- RayVERY unlikely, I know..."
April 2015,"An M6 Grand Coupe M Sport? That's news to me. I assume you mean the M6 Gran Coupe; it is a decent enough cruiser, but I can't saythat I like it all that much better than the B7 press loaner that I took to Motorsport Ranch in 2007. The Competition package might make it more acceptable, but I haven't tried a car so equipped. Still, at the end of the day the M235i and M3/4 remain the only new BMWs I'd seriously consider owning."
April 2015,"billy...no harm, no foul. I was not enamored with the 5 Series....especially for the price (low $60s). As far as one being nicer than the other? Can't really make that connection. I think the build and materials might actually be a little better in the CTS vs the 5. You don't see it that way. No problem for me. That's why they make all sorts of different cars, models at all kinds of price points. Plenty of choice for everyone.I do like the 2.0 turbo motors that Cadillac, Audi and BMW use. I like the one in the Caddy a bit better than the other ones, though. INHU, it pulls stronger than the other two. My opinion is the CTS handles better, too. Cadillac really dialed in the suspension on the CTS.Haven't driven the diesel in the E Class. So, I can't comment on it.Now, if you ask me about the straight six twin scroll turbo with the performance package I had in my E92, then I'd be hard pressed to pick any of the other turbo 4s over that motor. But, you put that in a 5 Series and you're closing in on $70K.I'd probably opt for a CTS-V (or even a less expensive CTS-VSport) for that kind of cash.FN....would love to see a pro comparison with 4 cyl luxury sports sedans."
April 2015,"Burner- If you are happy with your Mazda and all the modifications-all hats off to you.I had a Mazda too (a Millennia not the ""S"")- first new car after graduation back in 2000.I loved it and did not want to part with it, but Mazda USA did not want to budge on their buy out price (Residual) after my lease was up.I have got to say, they make very good cars but I am always looking for that upgrade- Can you M6 Grand Coupe M Sport in one breath."
April 2015,My MS3 now peaks at 324 lb-ft at 4050 rpm. In 6th(top) gear that is only 104 mph.
April 2015,"The BMW 335iS I had [ 370 TQ from the factory ] was probably the best turbocharged vehicle I have ever driven. It seemed always to be in the right gear [ DCT ] or willing to pull with authority and immediacy, even if [ manual mode ] in a less than ideal gear for the chore.Part of this was certainly the gearing here.130 MPH [ legal = on the German Autobahn ] in top gear = 7th was 4400 RPM![ And yes, I have a picture - taken by my daughter. ]http://smg.photobucket.com/user/rayainsw/media/BMW Euro Deliv/BMW Euro Deliv Jens Pics/IMG_0968130MPH.jpg.html?sort=3&amp;o=3- RayTQ junkie...."
April 2015,"Displacement is definitely a factor- and a flat torque curve plays to the strengths of the excellent automatic transmissions we have today. In my case, once you are above 40 mph or so any gear from 3rd through 6th will get the job done- the only difference is how fast. 3rd and 4th or the go-to gears if you want to make really rapid progress on a winding two lane road, but really you can just leave it in 6th from 50 mph-up and still have enough acceleration in reserve to humiliate most challengers.I've been looking around for a manual CTS-V and they are certainly thin on the ground- good ones are, at any rate. I also wouldn't mind a G8 GXP with a stick, but most of those were bought and stored away by collectors"
April 2015,"My 135 was definitely fast, especially after I added the tune, downpipes, and intake. But the curve still wasn't as fat and flat as the Caddy's feels. For example, if I was in the wrong gear in the bimmer, it would just fall flat, while that doesn't seem to be the case in the CTS. Of course, an extra 20% of displacement probably has alot to do with that."
April 2015,"Well, certainly. But I can at least admit they are in the ""same league,"" sport pack or no."
April 2015,"I fitted the 2.3 DI turbo in my MS3 with a low restriction MS intake as well as an extremely conservative ECU remap; while the N55 does produce appreciably more torque below 2800 rpm, from 2800 rpm to 6000 rpm the 2.3 cranks out 20 lb-ft to 44 lb-ft more torque. Which motor is ""best"" depends on one's personal preference. In my case, the 2.3 power curve fits both the car and my driving style- and with a 0-100 time in the mid twelves I can refer to the MS3 as ""quick"" with a reasonably straight face."
April 2015,"Brozen-I am not knocking the Caddy, all I am trying to say (and this is just me) the 5 is just a nicer car to own all around. My tv/audio installer has the CTS and quiet frankly it is a nice car but its just not ""me"".Can I have at least have an opinion?-it does not hurt to have one-right?."
April 2015,"So, before I comment, I need to know why you feel the sport pack makes a difference in such a comparison. I mean, the adjustable magnetic ride control on my CTS is generally regarded as superior in any comparison, so you can't be talking about suspension. I'd give the nod to the BMW sport seats, so maybe that is all you are referring to, although I can't imagine calling 2 cars in different leagues based on just that.BTW, my CTS's TT 3.6 has far more power over a far wider band than the TT 3.0 in my 135i did."
April 2015,A stick diesel? Better hope VW offers it in the new golf sport wagon.
April 2015,"BMW has clearly decided that the enthusiasts who built the brand 40 years ago are no longer of any significant value, relative to those who appreciate numb electric steering and soft suspensions -- never mind RFTs and electric oil level sensors that don't always work.I haven't let the door hit me on the way out, and I'm sure the 0.2% of the market who feels the same way hasn't either.The real question is, where do we go from here? I want a diesel-powered station wagon with a manual transmission. BMW makes several which would perfectly meet my desires, but none are sold in North America. Almost no one else cares, so I guess they're doing it correctly."
April 2015,2.62 x .667.Correct.Tires = 245/45x20.
April 2015,Okay.. the GR is final drive X gear ratio.. right? 2.65 X 0.67?Makes sense..
April 2015,"337 * 1.75 * 120 = 70,770/28.68= 2467"
April 2015,"Thanks.. I think ""final drive ratio"" already incorporates the 337 and the tire diameter in there, but I might be wrong.."
April 2015,To find engine RPM:(337 x GR x S)/D = RPMWhere:337 is a conversion factorGR is the gear ratioS is the speed in miles per hourD is the tire diameter
April 2015,Probably going to be chastised to well off ELLPS topic here........Well... not by me.. I wish I could remember the formula.. (Final drive ratio) X (top gear ratio) X 1000 = RPMs at 60 MPH?Someone help me out... lol
April 2015,"kyfdx - In full automatic, you may well be correct.[ I have no intention of attempting verification. ]Locked manually into top \ 8th gear, I am confident of these numbers - and I have seen the 60 - 80 MPH readings.- RayProbably going to be chastised for being off ELLPS topic here........"
April 2015,The way I see it is that the biggest disadvantage of owning the CTS short term is the price. Of course that is mitigated by a good deal . The jury is still out on ownership in the long term.
April 2015,BWTM:Just yesterday I talked to another friend; he used to have an E39 M5 that he used as his HPDE instructor car. It was getting long in the tooth and-after checking out the E60 and F10 M5-he decided to buy a CTS-V.And one more thing; my friend used to be on the staff of Bimmer magazine.
April 2015,"Wow... Now, I'll guess (  ) that once the wind-drag load picks up, the transmission will choose a lower gear, at some point/speed... Seems doubtful that it would actually be in 8th gear at 120 MPH (maybe at the bottom of Pikes Peak?)."
April 2015,"Problem Graphic has a 4 cyl CTS, not a V6.. Also I read that for 2017 the new 5 series will be roughly 250lbs lighter."
April 2015,"I think we need to discuss some of the factors that current buyers look for in an ELLPS, such as:Which car does the best job of attracting envious glances and telegraphing your disposable income to other drivers and pedestrians?Are there any modern waxes or polishes that can enhance the above qualities?How can I make my car understeer even more?Inquiring wearers want to know!!!"
April 2015,"Graphic, I wish the Auto Mag's would do a comparison of 4 cyl Luxury cars, but then again the E class wouldn't be part of that since the only 4 cyl they have is E250 BluTech. But Audi, BMW and Caddy could go head to head for the battle of who has the best 4 cyl luxury car.."

April 2015,"I mentioned the RPM at cruising speeds in the S3.The Edmunds test specs show RPM at 70 = 2500.As one other data point, my Charger would be traveling at approx. 120 MPH at 2500 RPM in 8th gear.- RayJust sayin' ....."
April 2015,How timely of Edmunds to post this. Can't really take issue with any of it.
April 2015,Edmunds' test of an S3:http://www.edmunds.com/audi/s3/2015/road-test.html
April 2015,"In Cadillac's case, perception IS NOT reality. It's going to take some time to shake the grat Uncle image. That said, the one enticement that got me to wtite a check was my car's low $40s selling price.I'll put my CTS up against a $60K+ E series or 5 series any day....and be glad I bought the Caddy.That said....it doesn't ride or drive ANYTHING resembling the Caddy of yesteryear.

April 2015,Cute.  After the fact.
April 2015,
April 2015,"That's more a sign of over production that slow sales. Unfortunately, there often isn't any correlation."
April 2015,"I just looked at a random ATS incentive. They have 750 loyalty, but 1500 conquest cash. Way to go - tell your current customers they aren't as valuable, that you like these BMW owners more."
April 2015,"I'm with you - it's really too easy to throw such an accusation, especially on a board like this. I wonder, if Joe Smith, a poster would say such a thing so quickly and loosely, under their name on camera on national television, so GM and C/D lawyers know where to send a complaint. If so, what would be a length of a legal disclaimer before or after such statement followed of course by another one from the station itself."
April 2015,"I read the same thing this weekend. Quite surprising, even for me - and I'm not a GM fan by any stretch of imagination. Another proof it takes so much more than just make a good product once. You have to do it again and again - and again. I guess if it took them four decades to destroy the company, it may take them twice as long to rebuild it - and only if the product quality remains up. I wonder what kind of deals are out there. Or perhaps, GM reduced the incentives in some major way and buyers, used to them, refused to buy at near the list price. This happens sometimes. Midspring inventory glut is a bad sign - too far away for the ""all new"" model with a new rear spoiler and wheel package, all that metal eating the dealers' financing. Also, GM used to be notorious for overproducing and the doing fire sales. Old habits die hard? I really wonder why is it so bad for a product that ain't that bad at all. Perhaps it all comes down to price. GM and Cadillac have chicken and egg problem, for sure. They want to be considered equal to the Germans, so they list price their cars accordingly. But because that's not the reality for now (at least in minds of the public), they have to concede on incentives - which perpetuates the situation. They could reduce the production, but the have to sell certain minimum volume to stay in business. It's a tough business, for sure. I think they need to overhaul their thinking in terms of not just product, but sales expectations, production, relationships with dealers, etc and model it more like those German guys. For example, BMW has quotas and allotments, but it's dealers, not the region, who decides on actual configurations within those allotments. There are (or at least used to be, when I got mine) reserved features (like some colors), which require a real customer order (in other words, those are special order only). I heard it's common for purchasing managers to fake customers to get those on their lot. I wonder if Cadillac dealers have similar system, or do they have to take whatever Detroit guys send them (I heard that was the case for lower-tier brands)."
April 2015,"I love the way that many people literally accuse these mags of accepting bribes to slant reviews and then turn around and use these same mags as sources.  Count the ads???  If you make the accusation why don't you count the ads and prove your point.  I'm not naive but I tire of the off the cuff indictments without ever citing any actual proof.  The mags might not always be right but ""monthly checked was bumped""?  Please."
April 2015,"Well to be fair the ATS is a very slow seller, so the buying public is still hooked on BMW euphoria apparently. An ATS stays 138 days in dealer inventory."
April 2015,Check the number and placement of BMW ads in that magazine & you'll find your answer.
April 2015,"I like the V8 Charger a lot, thanks. No issues at almost 4,000 miles.There is certainly much to like about the S3, for me. However, the price is quite high when well equipped, to me \ from my point of view.For example: Although the motor is certainly a very good 4 cylinder, it is still a 4 cylinder – and does not really make the sort of sounds I associate with the price point. Ultimate acceleration is certainly acceptable, but I prefer more immediate torque delivery from low RPM. It does pull well, once RPM & boost climb. The DCT & final drive gearing requires much, MUCH higher RPM in top gear at cruising speeds than I prefer.The interior rear view mirror is absurdly small.The sunroof has only a mesh cover \ sunshade – not a solid one. Here in HotLanta, that is really not a good idea. . .Although handling inspired confidence, I agree regarding the ride quality. Part of that may also be the S3’s relatively short wheelbase.The interior materials seemed appropriately high quality, and the seats were comfortable and supportive. With full leather seating, I do appreciate the fact that cooling is available for those seats in the Charger – and it works really well! I liked the fact that the S3’s center armrest adjusts up\down & fore\aft – a nice touch. I do prefer the nav screen being in the dash, instead of popping up above it.Clearly, many of these are just a reflection of my own personal preferences.That’s all I recall – last drove one in December.- RayQuite happy with my current choice . . ."
April 2015,"Ray....would love to hear your thoughts. BTW....how's the Charger doing? Every time I see one on the road, I think of yours."
April 2015,graphicguy - I test drove 2 S3s.Some of my impressions mirror yours.- RayNot currently driving an ELLPS ...
April 2015,"Mark....personally, I think Cadillac has done a great job of integrating the media/GPS/info screen into the dash. No pop ups. Looks like it belongs there.RB...While I never feel I need more power in my CTS, I would love to get my hands on a CTS-V, if only for a day."
April 2015,I'm guessing that BMW's monthly check was bumped up a bit.
April 2015,"That's a devastating statement from somebody who had been a fan and have spent high tens of thousands this often. My thinking is BMW doesn't feel the pinch now, because for one guy they lost, they gained couple of other customers who bought the nameplate and image, had no concept whatsoever what actual car sportiness really meant. The question is whether that sales surge is something permanent to enjoy, or temporary. One big value of enthusiasts is they provide free and most effective marketing. Many of those buying their cars today do so based on reputation built in the past, by guys like your buddy. It's hard to estimate how much that is worth, as some other people may also be turned off as well by the same enthusiast, perceiving them as juvenile snobs. It's clear that BMW has definitely lost the ""ultimate"" side for the sake of appeal to wider audience. We should see the long-term results of the move in ten-twenty years. As I recall, several other brands tried to pull that off and few succeeded.BTW, I recall a car magazine review (don't remember which one) shortly after BMW and ATS came out. It was the 328 vs 2.0T. Reading it was almost Alice in Wonderland experience - they gave ATS higher score in most ""enthusiast"" related categories, from steering, to road feel, to some standard performance tests. Yet, 328 was still a ""overall winner"" and they really didn't explain why. My thought was they simply ""grandfathered"" it into top position and knocked out ATS on some creature comfort items (like that touch screen interface, they said was a four-letter word). In other words, ATS was an ultimate driving machine of the two, but 328 was better to own at the time - which I find plausible, but it was an ""enthusiast"" test."
April 2015,So I guess it's not just me.
April 2015,"Just recently talked to a long time BMW enthusiast; he has always owned the latest and greatest M3 or M5- and even crewed on a BMW LSR attempt. He told me that he now drives a CTS Vsport. I asked him why and his answer was:""The Ultimate Driving Machine has left the building."""
April 2015,"Bradd...you know, I should have looked at the brand and model of tires, but didn't. Sorry!Mark....the tires made a significant difference in ride. I don't think it had the torque vectoring either. It didn't rotate as well as my car, but ithat certainly shouldn't affect ride.I should have played with Drive Select more, but didn't. As you say could/should make a difference in the ride, but don't know. You're going to spend close to $60K to get that equipment level and performance out of a 335i. Not sure about what a C/CLA would cost to get to that level of performance."
April 2015,"Personal preference to be sure: the current Audi (and others) interior theme uses a pop-up screen that comes out of the dash and goes vertical when the car is started. The screen contains information I would consider to be desired at all times, so the screen is always up.Years ago, Pioneer offered an after-market head unit that had a similar pop-up screen. My 2005, 2009 and 2014 Audis all have the screens integrated into a sweeping clean looking dash -- no clutter, no pop up screen that looks like something from a SEMA show.In short, those pop-up screens look, to me, to be aftermarket, not well integrated and, indeed, somewhat fragile.They are ALMOST a deal breaker. The prev gen Cadillac CTS (2012 for instance) had a much better pop-up in terms of integration.My prediction, the pop up screens are going to go away (at least in Audis) within a year or two. Probably just the time I'll be back in the market, hoping that there is a new B9 S4.Dealer noted to me yesterday: ""The A6 now has the S4 engine; and the S3 has equal to or better than acceleration numbers than the S4. . ."" ""Audi will not let this stand, if history is any guide -- the new S4 will bump both HP and Torque to improve performance over the S3 and to show better numbers vs the A6.""Stay tuned.The S3 has a ride that, to me, takes firm into the realm of harsh.Of course one man's harsh is another man's firm -- perhaps that's what Audi Drive Select can address."
April 2015,"@graphicguy - nice write up. I sat in an S3 at the ny auto show last week and definitely liked it a lot. Just those seats & steering wheel (same with the VW Golf R) alone was enough for me to stroke my chin and start thinking... I also like the fact that one can go light on the options & have a car that stickers in the low - mid $40K range. I also like that the screen pops in and out. I can't stand the ""iPad glued to the dashboard look."" I'd also hate to think what that would cost to replace once the car is out of warranty;)Kudos to your dealership for recognizing the problem with the car's ride & switching out the tires. What are the OEM tires anyway?"
April 2015,"So, i actually gave the S3 another test drive. I usually don't go to any dealerships on a Saturday given they're busy and I'm not in the market. But, with the invite, I did.Dealership had a couple of people in it, but not busy by any stretch.Sales Manager I spoke to was there. He came over, shook my hand. Told me he was working a deal but got the keys for the S3 and told me to take it for a spin. He asked if I wanted his used car manager to look at my CTS....NO!!!!!!!!!Onward...pretty car in the metallic white Still a bit cramped but felt a bit aierier than the IS350 I tests drove awhile ago. Ride is much better with the all seasons. Probably give up a little at the edges of handling, but the all season certainly would make the car more liveable on a day-to-day basis.Seats are good, but not as good as the TL's or the CTS's. Not off by much, though. They were actually better looking than the ones I had in my previous S4. But, my S4 seats didn't have soft leather inserts, either.Faster than my CTS by a good meadure, although the motor is still a 2.0 Turbo with more HP but less torque. Weight (less on the S3), gearing and the DSG trans are what I attribute that, too. But, the CTS is roomier. In truth, it felt about as fast as my S4.Nice interior, as expected. Much less in the way of controls, especially on the console vs my S4. Not sure one is better than the other, just different. This one had the handwriting recognition. In my brief time with it, it was hit and miss. LCD Pollping up out of the dash is way cooler than the tacked on screen with Benz or BMW. I'm used to my CTS's interface and have mastered it. I have familiarity with the Audi MMI. Not much has changed from what I remember.Handled well, rear danced a tad over some bumps, but it wasn't too bad. Never felt that in my S4, TL nor my CTS. LIke the CTS, lots of torque low. I like that. Not much is going to blow by you in the S3.Steering was direct. I liked the steering wheel a lot, but I liked the one in the S4 a lot, too.B&O stereo still trails the ELS in the TL and the (believe it or not) uplevel Bose in the CTS.Stickered for nearly $49K. After a nice 30 minute run, I went back to the dealership, with only one customer taking delivery of an A6. SM asked how I liked it. I told him that for the money, I'd choose it over a 335i or C300. First, that kind of sticker will barely touch either of those cars. And, the S3 will outperform both.He said he'd entice me by offering 5% off MSRP. Not in the market, and he knew I had an aversion to Audi.But, if I still liked Audi, and I was in the market, that would be a helluva car for the money."
April 2015,"Mark...if I wasn't known for flipping cars every 2-3 years, I don't know that the CTS would have made it to my garage.That said, the last GM product I owned was a Chevy Tahoe, which was well put together, uber reliable, and aside from fuel efficiency (which was at best, dismal) cheap to own and operate. But now, Tahoes are a $65-$75K step down from $80K Escalades, So, not sure I can say they're in any way shape or form, economical.So, if I keep my CTS long enough, perhaps I can really see if GM and Cadillac have changed.All that said, I mentioned a few months ago that I had tested an S3. Suspension was way too stuff for my tastes (a whole other level stiffer than my previous S4). Ran into one of the guys who originally helped me at the Audi dealership on the east side of town. He recognized me immediately (probably because of all the time spent at his dealership trying to get Audi to fix my car). It took me awhile to place him, but I knew him.Kind of funny because I think at the time he was the Audi sales manager. He said he's doing something with one of the other dealerships in the dealer group. He was the ONLY one who at least tried to get Audi to swap me out of the troublesome S4, which they refused, preferringto irritate me even more and actually having to pay me to buy the car back. Go figure.Anyway, he said he was starting at the dealer group's Porsche store next week. He wasnted to know what I was driving (didn't denegrate his Caddy competition saying he thought the CTS was a good looking car). Last day at Audi is today. Starts at Porsche on Monday.I told him of my test drive of the S3 and that I found it way too stiff. He said he hears that a lot and blamed to high perforamnce summer tires. He said the dealership routinely swaps out the summer tires for high performance all weather tires, which makes a big difference on the ride.He did have pics on his phone of a new S3 they have in stock that was gorgeous.....white metallic with black and grey leather interior. He said they just put all weather shoes on it and I should stop by for a test drive. He said he wanted to leave the Audi store on a bang. Told him I was still stinging from my last go round with Audi. He didn't minimize my feelings stating he totally understood. But, he also said that was highly unusual.Not in the market, but pretty day...might go for a drive."
April 2015,"The thing that ticks me off with the Audis at this point is that the best seats in the house are, for mere mortals (financially) in the S4 with the upgrade option, mine in red! To next experience such chairs, you skip over the A6 and go straight to the S6 -- which, let's get real, usually is tickling the underbelly of $80,000.The S6, by some crazy metrics, is actually a bargain compared to the other guys, but jeeeeze, what if I simply wanted a very nice A6 with the new supercharged V6 engine and SLINE, not ""S""?Fughettaaboutdit.In my case, I love the SIZE of the A4/S4 and am anticipating a nicer package job in the B9 S4 -- so assuming the seats are still offered in that model, I need not coax the missus into the ""logic"" of an S6. BTW, there is NO logic in an S6, it is pure emotion at that point -- the thing is wicked quick, super fast and beyond sublime. I haven't driven a latter day S8 yet, but I just can't imagine ever needing one of those.The S6 is irrational -- which is why we all want one (if we have driven one). But a new gen S4 may be a better performer, more fun and quicker through the twisties (and I am NOT speaking about ever tracking any of these). The fact that a new S4 ""nicely equipped"" can be had for under $60K is just a bonus.My wife and I are ""60"" years old -- we have a Sheltie and we each have a job. We have no kids at home (other than the dog) and life is pretty much low stress, so we have time to indulge one of our hobbies, test driving cars. Having said that, I urge you to go to an Audi dealer and just sit in an S4 (or an S6) and enjoy the seats. I don't mean to persuade you to the Audi brand as much as I am trying to get us all on a level conversation field -- and that is this: good seats are the enemy of great seats. You may think your ""fill-in-th-blank"" prospective ELLPS or LPS car has good seats -- and it may be thus. You may actually find better seats than Audi deems fit to put in its S cars -- and if you do, for god's sake please share. And, I'm already pretty much a fan of Volvo seats and Porsche seats, so those don't need to be discussed.My point is, if you don't have to find a sitter or arrange your schedules to spend your weekends driving cars, take a detour to the showroom noted and try the S4's seats out. Were I able to check a box and make these seats available across the ELLPS and LPS universe, I would. Who knows, were seats this good available from several manufacturers, perhaps I could see myself driving another brand. Of course, if you want, you could even test drive the car to see how great seats make driving all that much more fun.Remember good seats are the enemy of great seats."
April 2015,"Ha!well, put me down for Italian autos, Japanese food, and American women. I need nothing else."
April 2015,"Currently renting a brand spanking new Jetta from Avis. A fairly stripper model, not even a sunroof. The exterior is that loud red with a hint of orange that VW has had for years. It looks sharp in color but the styling is still very bland. The trunk is nicely carpeted and huge.The interior is a sea of hard black plastic with touches of fake chrome. The only soft surfaces in the interior are the seats, the carpet, and the steering wheel. All else is hard as a rock - dash, side panels, center console. When started the engine made a horrendous sound in early idle but seemed much smoother at higher speeds. The steering is tight with good feedback. The freeway ride is ok but nothing outstanding. Compared to previous generation Jettas it is bigger and more chintzy.But even though cloth, the seats are decently bolstered, not couchlike as in the standard seats on new Audis, or (apparently) BMWs. Go figure."
April 2015,"Mark, et. al. When I used the words, ""further humbled,"" my thinking was along the lines of the effect of the Japanese mfgs. moving upmarket and the perceived value propositions of the German marques to the general public. I believe, and certainly more so due to the original Lexus LS after Honda fired the first shot, that the Germans were a bit surprised by the reviews and acceptance of the fancy Hondas, Toyotas and Nissans. I'm a fan of the Euros, my first car memory is of Dad's Borgward and my Mom's Mercedes. My first car was a VW Scirocco. My last two cars have been Jags, likely fueled by memories of my Dad's friend's Jag E-Type convertible (and the fact that they are beautiful, fun and reliable cars!). But, I grew up during the era of fuel economy, hot hatches and the rapid ascent of Japanese cars. My father lusted after the BMW Bavaria, but friends that had them couldn't vouch for their reliability and he grew tired of the expensive repairs to the Mercedes and so they went Japanese (including a Datsun 260Z!). So, I believe that that competitive environment improved the breed. Well, except for GM, of course!"

April 2015,"I think you've hit the nail on the head. If I would have spent somewhere between $10 and $15K less on a TL-SH-AWD from my S4, I would have done so to save the money, get a better sound system, and perhaps enjoy legendary Acura reliability hassle free low cost maintenance ownership. Ultimately I decided on the S4 because it looked better inside and out (style), drove faster, quicker, class leading transmission system, handled better/sharper/faster, the brakes felt better, the Quattro seemed superior to SH-AWD (less of a FWD with AWD on-demand type thing like Acura), and I could get it with contrasting Napa Leather interior (chose the Magma Red; beautiful). Also, I could choose Misano Red exterior whereas with Acura you have to settle with a purple looking red. Lastly, I know the S4 is very easily tune-able, as I'm now driving an S4 that is as fast as an RS4 at 395-to 405 HP with just a simple REVO flash software tune. Your power varies based on the quality of gas and conditions like temperature. Get 93 or 100 octane gas and you can easily get to 410-415 HP. I do feel the difference. It is as if the car is doing what it was always meant to do now, performing the way the engine can perform without restrictions, limiters, & regulations being in its way! Without making concessions to the EPA, emissions, nannies, fuel economy, and insurance company charge rates (I think this is why Audi under rates the power in its cars), the S4 is a BEAST. I think 400 HP is a new magical number. Of course, 300 HP would suffice if the car was 500+ lbs. less. Granted, if you don't have a heavy right foot, you can still keep the EPA happy with your gas mileage. I see no negative effects in daily driving. Just positive effects when you get into it!I'm going to stop typing and try to find a revenue patrol-free road zone right now! Have a great weekend everyone!."
April 2015,"Whatever humbling happened to Audi it certainly was not at Acura's hand if that is what your comment suggests -- Audi was humbled because they were first maligned by a 60 Minutes story that made the preposterous claim that an Audi 5000's 5-cylinder engine could overpower its brakes (which it couldn't); then it was hobbled by its own hand because it was so ARROGANT it its response to the 60 Minutes piece (which Audi knew was false but didn't have the ability to see was the PERCEPTION the Minutes piece left the viewers with) that they said, American drivers are so ham-footed that they can't press the right pedal (or, the lie, that if you pressed both the accelerator and brake pedal of an Audi the engine was sooo powerful it would make the car lurch forward).So, yes, Audi was humbled [perhaps] -- but NOT by Acura, Audi was humbled by Audi. Their reaction to the fake news of the day was what nearly done 'em in. The Lexus LS may have -- in hindsight -- captured the buying public's eye for a ""cheaper"" and ""similar"" [to a Mercedes S, well, sorta] car -- today a top o' the line Lexus attracts shoppers for the reasons I noted, then, well, no one knew they were going to be so durable, but they were cheaper (but the Hyundai Equus is cheaper than an LS is today, too, though). Then, I don't recall that Lexus actually took too much out of Mercedes pockets. The only country Lexus was sold in was the US (OK, North America). Even today, a company like Audi sells 175,000 cars in the US (out of total sales of over 1.2M). So while we're important for the image (which is huge), we're not so much important in revenue -- and then, well, most folks couldn't even spell globalization.I would think the Germans and the Japanese alike are always looking at the market, their direct competition, their indirect competition and what is looming on the horizon that could be trouble. I assume they're all a bit concerned (too strong a word?) by the product coming out of Korea -- and even the American manufacturers are no longer to be ignored.So, my retort is pretty much that Audi, not Acura was the cause of the dark days (with an honorable mention at least to the inaccurate 60 Minutes story Unintended Acceleration) for that brand -- and far as I can tell Audi's behavior could hardly have been more opposite to humble if it tried even harder.Mercedes, even when they were somehow supposedly threatened by Lexus wasn't really put out much by the product, as much as they were put out by the hype -- and even so, the US (at that time) was still a pretty small peanut insofar as sales+image were concerned, compared with the rest of the planet's uptake of Mercs.And, while I pretty much agree about BMW's -- a 1980's era BMW was still a bit of a rarity and were known for being ""breathtakingly expensive"" to maintain and god help you if you needed to repair one or take one to a body shop.The folks I knew who knew or thought they knew about cars (remember I'm old enough to have been alive then) in the early '80's often would equate BMW's and Porsche's -- and some folks even had the gall (or ignorance) to tell me that BMW stood for British Motor Works. I'm still of the mind that if anyone is doing any humbling, it's the Germans who be the ""humble -ers,"" not the ""humble -ees.""Check out the new Car and Driver comparo (spoiler alert, the ""long in the tooth"" S5 kicks butt and takes names AGAIN! -- wonder how the Lexus fares? Hmmm?)This needs to be updated (to include a Japanese stereotype and to relate it to cars):""Heaven is where the cooks are French, the police are British, the mechanics are German, the lovers are Italian and everything is organized by the Swiss.Hell is where the cooks are British, the police are German, the mechanics are French, the lovers are Swiss, and everything is organized by the Italians.""Any takers?"
April 2015,"To me Lexus has been traditionally perfect car for people who don't care about cars (don't get excited about them, don't want to know anything about how throttle or gears work, don't watch any motor sports, etc.), but need a car and want one that is going to be comfortable, well designed, high quality today and five years from now, reliable, low maintenance and yet tell everybody they have both money and taste. BTW, I remember one guy stating repeating couple of times low depreciation as a primary reason he got a Lexus. I have always bought a car for myself, not the next guy, but I understand his thinking - if all he wanted was to minimize the cost and maximize the content, Lexus was just perfect for him. Just like Toyota is perfect for the same kind of people with less money. BTW, this is probably 80% of the population, if not more. I'm not looking down on those people, not at all - they have their busy lives, they don't need or want to know anything about weight distribution, cornering ability. I'm sure they have other passions that I could not care less about. However, over time, Lexus noticed that they left that over 20% of those with means to buy their cars wouldn't even give them time of the day - so they change their product (a little) and advertising (a lot - most of their ads are about ""F"" lines even if they actually sell small fraction of those). BMW did the opposite - they have owned those 20% for decades - the 80% majority would stay away, unless the lease payment was right and even after then they would constantly complain about small back seat and ""harsh"" suspension, or road noise, tire wear, or all those things we know sporty cars do (including higher maintenance). So in order to grow, BMW changed their product (unlike Lexus, they changed it a lot). They don't really miss that 20%, because those guys still have nowhere else to go and all they can do is grumble. And judging from sales figures, BMW is now losing much sleep even if a few of them did go somewhere else."
April 2015,"dino - I guess I should add, too, that I don't actually know that the Japanese LPS brands have previously been humbled, either -- but I think (my opinion) they have, or at least they should be since they so frequently are NOT the winner in comparos in the BIG, IMPORTANT car magazines.I saw MotorWeek on TV this week and the Lexus GS was tested (not compared), things went along nicely as the car was shown on the track and street -- and then WHAM! John Davis pretty much put the car in its place (which was to say, it was NOT at the top of the Premium car heap, based on comments about handling, braking, etc),Yet, ""everyone"" I know who has a Lexus loves them -- of course whenever I ask why, the reason, THE reason, THE #1 REASON, the ONLY reason I can ever get out of them, is either how reliable or durable they are. Odd, methinks, how I can't ever seem to elicit a comment about a Lexus, Infiniti or Acura that praises their performance, style, switchgear -- oh oh oh, I take it back, once, someone told me how good the sound system in his Acura is (and speaking as a previous Acura TL SH-AWD Advance owner, I agree -- Acura has the best sound systems for mere mortals -- the only one that is better is the hyper expensive B&O option Audi offers for $6,000+).Don't get me wrong, a sound system is very important in a car -- but, you know, when someone tells me about their 5 series or their new Mercedes E or C, they tell me about the performance, ergonomics, 8-speed or 7-speed transmission, engine, responsiveness, cornering, etc, etc, etc.My wife thinks that her Infiniti was great -- from a durability (and probably reliability) standpoint. But she ended up with an SQ5 (Audi) because ""Infiniti's ain't got no soul."" She was against my getting a 2014 IS 350 for the same reason -- told me, I'd be underwhelmed by it's appliance-like disposition.I do appreciate, too, that I've read, here, the comments -- positive comments -- about the recent EL and LPS Cadillac offerings. And, well, they are hardly known as durable cars -- and no one I know who has one claims they got it thinking it would be the new world champion of longevity. OK, so here I am at age 63 -- I'm thinking I'm still gonna outlive any car I get, so I might as well get one that comes with passion, performance and pulchritude.Got one more data point for you: when I used to have the Acura, I'd take it to the dealer for service and would talk to other customers about their reasons for being Acura owners. Now, get this -- the BEST answer I ever got was ""because I got a good deal."" Meanwhile, over at the quattro cafe (and the BMW store service area, too) the folks talk about how much fun their cars are to DRIVE.Imagine that.Oh, and, yes, I know, this proves nothing."
April 2015,"Maybe, but I although I can't speak to the ILX (though the interior pics did make things looks less than luxurious), I can speak to the TLX with an extremely similar drive train; which I've test driven twice now.I have to agree with her review for the most part though, and I'm a Honda fan. I think Acura is now overpriced, and/or underwhelming. The car feels slow, but maybe adequate, just not inspiring. The car handles nicely, but again, not inspiring. The interior is fine, but I remember preferring the TSX's interior. I much preferred the TL-SH-AWD models I test drove last year. For closer to $35K than $40K (sticker overpriced, but real deals were to be had), the TL SHAWD made a compelling case. For nearly the same money, the TLX does not IMHO. I would say the car does everything pretty well, but anytime you give the car a compliment, I feel you have to put a qualifier like ""pretty or fairly"" before the words ""good and well"". No significant glaring weaknesses, but no real strengths either. I probably should have insisted on test driving the 3.5 V6 the second time, but I can't get over that you get an even more flawed transmission than the already flawed but improved at least 8 speed in the TLX. I think I'd rather buy an Accord Sport model, and save/invest the money saved to buy a future true performance sedan."
April 2015,"Well acura came out in 1985. Audi was pretty humbled back in those days. I'm still surprised that audi survived the dark era, never mind reinvented itself as a high end brand. And circa 1990 when the Lexus LS arrived, MB was not doing sport. Big tanks and diesels mostly (exception being the SL, a convertible tank!). To me, BMW is the only one that really evolved from the original ELLPS days, since the other euros weren't in it back then. To a large extent the 1st legend and Infiniti were it along with the 3 series."
April 2015,"I don't know if they were better. I liked them more, for reasons you so eloquently stated. I would add the steering feedback as first and foremost reason. Then it will be followed by the usual laundry list, such as said RFTs, lack of manual transmission, or nicer sounding engine (pertains to lower end 3-series) and less expensive (which is true for all cars and brands). Now, that may not be ""better"", but I liked it more. Doesn't preclude me from buying it again for simple reason that others don't make what I like, either."
April 2015,""". . .to further humble the Germans . . ."" The word I honed in on was ""further,"" which would assume they had been previously humbled.It would seem that everyone here appears to have an opinion that, to me, reads something like (speaking of the Germans): The way fill-in-the-blank"" (usually filled in with BMW) cars were during the fill-in-the-blank (usually some year or range of years that is at least 5 years ago, often as much as 15) is better than they are today. The author of said opinion/perspective will usually attribute their reasons for stating the ""fact"" of better then than now, to be the current difficulty in getting today's version with a stick shift or the increase in luxury content at the expense of performance, the selection by the manufacturer of run flat tires or whatever other dislike is currently popular.Far as I can tell, however, the German auto makers Audi, BMW and Mercedes (and probably Porsche, but not as often mentioned) were not humbled THEN and therefore are highly unlikely to have been ""further"" humbled by Acura, Lexus and Infiniti.Current auto review magazine's still typically pick a European over an Asian, and more to the point, typically pick a German over a Japanese. When there is a ""comparo"" report between the Japanese ELLPS or LPS and the offering from Germany (in the same class), the German's usually finish ahead of their Japanese rival (the one glaring example to the contrary is when the Lexus IS bested the BMW 3, and that was over a year ago).Generally, the German examples rule the category -- far as I can tell if there is any humbling, it is the exception rather than the rule.I so wanted to love the Q50 Infiniti (at the time I was in a 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD) and did end up ordering a IS 350 with the F-sport package when I thought I would be forced to ""settle"" for a Lexus to replace the Acura, thinking, at the time, an Audi will be too expensive to be considered, compared to the IS 350. I was mistaken -- an S4 was ""within reach.""The point or better said, question, is, when were the Germans in humble mode and when were they further humbled by Lexus and Infiniti, to quote laurasdada's previous post?Driving it like I live . . ."
April 2015,"""Acura was a way to compete against Toyota’s Lexus marque.""IIRC, Acura preceded Lexus/Infiniti by ~ 4 years. And, conventional wisdom at the time (read: The Europeans) scoffed at the idea that anyone would pay $20k for a Honda! I'm sure Acura's success further emboldened Toyota and Nissan to proceed with their plans to further humble the Germans..."

April 2015,"The best seats I have ever had are in my current 2014 Audi S4; my wife's SQ5 seats are about 99% as good as my S4's, too -- before that, I enjoyed excellent seats in:2009 A4 2.0T w/sport package2005 A6 with optional sport seats2005 X3 with optional sports seats2001 A6 4.2 with optional sport seats2000 A6 4.2 with optional sport seats1997 A8 with sport seats and about a million adjustments1996 S6 with the standard leather sport seats of the day1986 5000S quattro with the optional sport seats (in wool)We also had a 1988 325ix BMW with the optional sport package, which, oddly, did not include sport suspension, but everything else was sported up, including the front chairs (which were great) and the super nice steering wheel -- which could not be heated when you got the sport package?!?Currently, an A6 can be sort of had with sport seats, but, as I noted previously they are called Individual Contour Seats -- they seem to be a cross between the standard A6 seats and my S4 seats, plus massage and ventilation -- but the bolsters are not quite as prominent as in the S4.I'm with those of you who consider the seats a deal breaker if they aren't what I want.Most of the above cars that had sport seats that were optional came with a maximum price of $1,000 and a normal price of $500 -- even adjusted for inflation, I can't figure out why not offer the options that people want -- IF YOU ALREADY market them in other geographies.I wondered for years what the big deal was about NOT offering heated REAR seats -- the cost of the seat warmers is probably quite low and a $250 - $500 up charge seems like a no-brainer. Finally, with respect to Audi at least, heated rear seats are at least offered for an extra charge.I signed onto the Audi Exclusive web page, and there are many optional choices for interior treatments that can be had -- yet, it is clear it is very difficult to order sportier seats via that exclusive program if they are not normally offered in your market. The Audi Exclusive program seems more like a decorating option than a functional one -- not that that is a bad thing.While I am ranting, I really don't get why so many things are bundled together into one mid-four-figure ""package"" -- if all I want is a top-view camera, it appears I have to take automatic cruise control, w/stop and start, lane keeping assistance and pre-sense plus. Now, I'd gladly buy top view and pre-sense plus, but paying for lane assist and cruise control with full-stop, start capabilities does not, today at least, interest me. My belief is that folks do things based on what is marketed to them within certain cost parms. I am not keen on paying for a seat massage function, when all I am after is bolstered chairs in the first place, so, I am likely to pass on the expensive option, and, without that option, I am likely to pass on the car and HOPE that the next gen A4 line will amp up both the L and the P.I hope and pray that the explanation for all this bundling isn't to reduce the cost of certifying the cars for sale in the US -- stranger things, I imagine, though."
April 2015,Agreed!
April 2015,Exactly!
April 2015,I have to ask - was it also shared expenses?
April 2015,"Those 3-series sports seats are not highly bolstered. They ain't Recaros, if you know what I mean, nothing crazy. They are just well-bolstered, as opposed flat ones in the standard version. To me they should be standard, especially in a model that sells itself as ""Ultimate Driving Machine""."
April 2015,This. I don't really want highly bolstered fully adjustable sport seats -- but I also don't want couch seats in my car. Audi is certainly failing here and it sounds like BMW is as well. Funny how years ago it was the high end cars with the good seats and the plebian cars with the flat seats. Seems like it has reversed.
April 2015,"Not worth my time, nor my effort. Irony of ironies, the guy who was running Audi at the time I was having all the problems with the S4, is now the head honcho at Cadillac."
April 2015,"Having spent some time in the sport seats of a E90 car, I liked my M Sport Seats in my 330 (E46) better, I wish BMW would allow the M car seats to be an option, those are true sport seats."
April 2015,"There is no excuse for what Audi has apparently done to you, you should name names to Audi of America's customer service dept. and recommend pink slips for those people."
April 2015,"You obviously never sat in them. Track has nothing to do with it. Good bolstering and correct profile are useful everywhere. I'm not talking about some supersporty Recaros - just decent bottom cushion with extended thigh support (which is probably my most favorite thing about this particular seat) and well-profiled back cushions keeping you in place as you turn the car on signals at any speeds with the back profile having adjustable lumbar support that doesn't kill your back after 200 miles. I have had cars with great seat profiles for over 10 years no - 2003 WRX, 2008 STI and 2012 328 with Sport Package. Bad seat profile is a deal breaker for me, period. BTW - I'm quite heavy, so my bottom and back ""fill"" those seats perfectly. It means I'm just perfect size to take full advantage of the bolstering  . Perhaps that's the reason I like them so much."
April 2015,"I'll take it even further, the Sport seats on the F30 cars are wider and the bolsters aren't as big as on the E90 cars or E46 cars. I think people need to remember is, not everybody tracks their cars, so sport seats aren't needed. Dino, how many times as your wagon seen the track or driven to the point in which those Sport Seats where really needed?"
April 2015,"Mark, BMW allows people to add options that are not normally available on US cars, but this has to get the blessing of BMWNA, example, if you order a 328i Luxury Line, you can get the sport seats for $500. Infact many CA are not aware of this, I just found out that Tanszanite Blue Metallic ( an M car color) can be had on any BMW, for $1950, Rick and I both really like the color, I would assume if we got that color on the 328i GT it would be the only one in the US. What I was getting at, was, contact Audi NA and see if getting sport seats are allowed and if Audi will give you the blessing on this option. Doesn't hurt to ask."
April 2015,"I think that's why I'm anti-Audi right now. If they wouldn't have acted like posteriors, stepped up and taken care of the problems that they admitted to having, instead of jerking me around, they'd be on my shopping list.So far, Cadillac has treated me as well/better as any other brand I've ever owned, that includes BMW, Audi, and Acura.The CTS feels so solid, I can't quite see any parts flying off."
April 2015,"I notice the benefits of AWD every time I stomp on it from a traffic light, or stomp on it making a 90 degree turn from a stop which would cause over steer in RWD and excessive wheel spin in FWD. I especially notice the same things when it's raining or the pavement is wet. At the track I noticed I had developed some bad habits though, as it's possible to under steer and push the S4 around a turn, and still be able to rotate the car with the rear diff at the same time. Essentially you are forcing the car around the turn and pushing the front tires where you want to go even though they are not helping you accelerate. Not the fastest way to drive, and hard on the front tires. You can get away with it though, as the car is very forgiving to a heavy right foot."
April 2015,"I would add more refined sport suspension, possibly better summer tires (not sure on that one; check to see if they are the same size tire too), more quality control which leads to far better reliability, durability, less warranty hassles, far improved interior, improved materials AND fit & finish/build quality, longer warranty? free loaners if you need a warranty trip, more std. equipment (?), better seats, improved looks (subjective), more color selection, more option choices, and different trim level configurations whereas the GLI is pretty much you get what you get.A lot of my knowledge on this is from comparing the vast and varied superiorities of the '06 A3 to the same year GTI. Also back then you got free maintenance for 50K miles. I would say the '15 GTI has caught up to my old A3 in most ways. I'm a classic example of purchasing an entry level luxury car, having a great experience, and moving from $30K for the A3 to nearly $55K (out the door) for the '14 S4. If I was an entry level buyer today, I'm not sure the current A3 would do it for me. I feel the '06 A3 was a better value and car for the time. Essentially, it has been 9 years and the entry level A3 is inferior to my '06 A3 in a lot of ways, plus costing more. The 2.0T A3 Quattro is the right ""entry"" level car, but still, I prefer the '06 interior."
April 2015,"I think the Neon experience was so bad that I have no patience left in this lifetime for an unreliable car. Another unreliable car would quickly vanish from my possession. I am risk averse to unreliable possibilities. Honda and Audi were not perfect experiences for me, but the fact they stood behind their product and either paid for repairs or reimbursed me for repairs (even if technically after warranty period) went a long way towards gaining my trust."
April 2015,"The jury is still out with your Cadillac though. Let's see if your aversion returns by the time you get to say.... 65,000 miles. Again, Edmunds' long term testers just a few years ago from Cadillac had parts flying/falling off, rattling, coming apart, and generally unacceptable problems."
April 2015,"First of all, it was a shared car; meaning it wasn't just my Parents'. It was shared ownership. Second of all, have things more than name changes really changed? Neon = PT Cruiser = Caliber = Dart. Yes, lots of name changes, but have the head gaskets and AC compressors improved? Yes, they have more than 3 automatic gears now, but has reliability increased? They still sit at the bottom of any credible source on reliability."
April 2015,"It's not just the Neon that was a bad model, take a look at Calibers, PT Cruisers, Darts (problems in Edmunds' own long term tester) Stratus', Cirrus', Pacifica's, and more. Hence Chrysler still lives in the basement of CR's reliability rankings (including more recent models/renamed old models); the more you think things have changed, the more they really remain the same."
April 2015,"Case in point, again: The loaner Audi S4 (@$52,200) I have today doesn't have a backup camera, park assist or bluetooth iphone audio integration-- who, in the wide, wide world of sports would spend (or expect to spend) that kind of cheese and not get a backup camera, etc? If my maximum spending ability prevented me from having these ""essentials,"" I assure you I would not look at a German, I'd go Asian or American and probably not be looking at the ELLPS class. Hyundai Genesis anyone?Since when did ""backup camera's"" become essential equipment? I would say just 5 years ago they were still rarely seen. What the heck is park assist? I can park my own car. People did just fine without back up cameras for decades upon decades; it is far from essential. I got a red S4 without the back up cam and overpriced MMI/navigation, but I do have IPhone Bluetooth integration; perhaps the setup is different without MMI and you didn't know?Cars are getting more and more expensive, and I believe it is because of all the non-essential ""so-called essentials."" The essentials are getting from A to B reliably. Being a ELPS category means that the L and P are important. My taste prefers my money go more towards P."
April 2015,I really like that edition of the TSX - in many ways better than my same vintage TL.
April 2015,
April 2015,"Now that is nicely put.As I drive my lowly pre-beak TSX, it's interesting to hear my betters discuss this sort of stuff.Some do it better than others."
April 2015,"Seat update: there is an Audi A6 (not S6, A6) seat option that does, mostly, mitigate my complaints about the flat, slick bucket seats that are standard equipment.The option is called Individual Contour Seating Package. Please sit down.It is $3,450.00.Shut the front door.Now, the seating package includes magic finger massage and full gender specif catheterization so you never have stop for those pesky bathroom breaks on those long 400 mile stints where there are no bathrooms.The seats ARE very very nice -- I was hoping for something in the $1,000 range tho . . .Of course there's always the $20,000 S6 upgrade which comes with the good seats, standard.Decisions, decisions.Oh yea, it also comes with stints. Whatever that means."
April 2015,"Heck...if I can get over my Cadillac aversion, anyone can get over whatever prejudice with any car model/company."
April 2015,I'll just pour more fuel on the fire; my wife liked the seats in the Fiat 500 Pop we rented better than the E90's seats. Ditto for the chairs in my 1999 Wrangler Sahara.
April 2015,"I would rather buy a Mazda 3, fully loaded, for under $30K and have better reliability and a good seat at a reasonable price.I used to have exactly the same impressions of American vs. German car seats. It looks like the Germans are pandering to the mainstream US tastes and then getting a good seat is another way to nickel and dime those already high prices into higher prices. VW tried to pander to the US tastes with their blandmobiles like the current Jetta and the bloated Passat - and they have fully lost my interest on any of their models."
April 2015,The part that bugs me the most is that it wasn't even his car. It was his parents'. I figure his grandkids will be the ones to give up the grudge.
April 2015,"Every single manufacturer has gone through significant changes (for better or worse) since the mid-90's when you owned your Neon. In fact, if things hadn't changed I'd be right there with you. My first car was a 1992 Chevrolet Beretta GT (bought brand new) which had a myriad of problems that concluded with the loeb of the camshaft (2nd from the top) completely wearing down at 61K miles. For years I swore off GM and Domestics in general. I'm sure I even vowed at one point (most likely on these boards) to never set foot in a D3 dealership again. Durability and reliability have increased tremendously across the board. Horsepower numbers are up (and so is weight). Significant weight loss seems to be the next trend. Each manufacturer does make a performance oriented car that given proper modifications will perform very well at the track. There are very few cars out there that are ""no compromise."""
April 2015,"...by putting him into a Hellcat or an SRT 392 for the weekend.Heck, RB, if you can make the switch from BMW to Chrysler, I think everyone could!"
April 2015,"You need to get over your ""I got screwed by a Neon"" complex..."
April 2015,assuming the Dodge doesn't break down before the weekend's out......
April 2015,"I'd for certain argue about safety, as if I'm killed in a Kia Rio rental I'd of likely survived in an Audi S4.I'd leave instructions for my heirs to sue for everything Hertz and the at-fault party were worth (driver and insurance that directly caused the rental in the first place). I'm certainly honestly concerned about safety, as I hope the **** never hits the fan, but you never know. You could argue you take trips to the mountains, maybe go on dirt or snowy roads, so you have to have AWD. You could argue you need the creature comforts of a premium car, the nice sound system, and other features you enjoy. There's a reason someone buys a luxury sport vehicle, and you can't just replace it with an old Chevy Impala rental because it's as big or bigger and has 4-doors. As to being insured for HPDE events, as of about a year ago, Geico specifically has made an effort to exclude it in the policy. However, you wouldn't be suing for insurance coverage while your at the track, you'd be suing for ""loss of use,"" as very few cars are track-suitable, or as fun to drive as an S4. I think it's two entirely different concepts. It's equivalent to if your house burns down and you have (loss of use housing coverage) putting you in a 4,000 SF mansion in El Centro, CA, instead of La Jolla, CA. Equivalent to insurance companies, but not anyone else that lives in the real world."
April 2015,"Buick's reputation for being more reliable than other GM cars may have been severely tarnished by someone actually letting the RPM gauge go past 3K or pushing the throttle past 33%. I'd of been worried about needing a Hertz tow truck. Of course, I've talked about a previous Camaro requiring a new transmission before the weekend was out. They conveniently towed his car off the track and put it next to the adjacent public highway before the ""Hertz"" tow truck got there; to avoid any possible confrontations about why the car broke down. I read all the fine print in Hertz's contract, and it doesn't specifically exclude HPDE's."
April 2015,"The standard seats in the XF are pretty good. While not ""Sport"" seats, I feel they lean in that direction with decent bolstering on the sides and the seat itself. The ""Bonded"" leather can be a bit slippery, but I stay pretty much in place when the road curves. I really wish the seat bottom had thigh support/adjustments though. I find the cushion just a hair short and I'd prefer more support/adjustment. The XK had the multiple adjustable seats, everything was adjustable. Fabulous. I would have had to have sprung for the $4k Portfolio pkg. in the XF to get those seats, the only option my XF does not have.Looking forward to the coming years when y'all are writing about how great your new XEs and XFs are!"
April 2015,"I believe there is an option for all-season non-staggered tires with Sport/M-Sport package. I don't know if dealers order them, but it is possible to order. You can also get a ""normal"" suspension with those, just get x-drive (in this case, Sport/M Sport turns into pure aesthetic package plus seats). To get sport suspension with x-drive, you need to pony up another $1000 for their adaptive M-sport stuff. So there is a way to get good seats without firm suspension."
April 2015,"I always made fun at American manufacturers that they had no clue how to make a decent car seat. It was a clear cultural thing - for too long the mainstream here believed that a car seat should look like a couch: flat, unbolstered bench with supersoft, but short cushions and non-adjustable low head restraints (aka neck breakers) was the ""good seat"". Just a look at an old Chevy, Buick, or Ford (GM was the worst though, hands down) made my back and neck hurt. Seems American public learned since then and so did the manufacturers. However, Germans have always known how to make good car seats. They just don't care enough to give us one in their base price, which is inexcusable, IMHO. As I keep owning my BMW and really like it, I became quite disgruntled with the way they market and price their product. Not so much about the pricing level (because in comparison to Europe and other markets we have it really good here), but the sneaky way they put the content together and sometimes truly embarrassing configurations. Besides the front seats, my other ""favorite"" is fold-down seats, which used to be $500 option on previous generations and still remains one on 320 line (now standard on 328/335). What was worse, majority of dealers appear to be oblivious to that and ordered cars without them, so I am absolutely positive there were plenty of people shocked to learn their ""luxury"" car lacked a feature standard on the cheapest vehicle sold in the country."
April 2015,"I'd go further - the base seats are proof that majority of 3-series and 4-series buyers are there for the badge. I said repeatedly to salesmen that those seats are deal breakers to me. many of them totally agree that those standard seats are true disgrace. I'll admit that F3x standard seats are improved over E9x standard seats, but still way in a different neighborhood of off what a ""sports sedan"" should have as standard. I simply can't believe they have been selling this crap for this long with no signs of change. What's worse - you can't even get their sports seats on ""Luxury"" line, even as a stand-alone option. That is truly pathetic. Now I hear Audi has gone same way? The world is ending, no doubt."
April 2015,"The base seats in my wife's E36, E39, and E83 were fine for all but ""brisk"" driving; the E90 base seats are more like park benches. In Europe the sport seats are a standalone option, but in the US you have to get the Sport/M Sport package. Fine for me, but my wife doesn't want/need the staggered summer rubber or the M Sport suspension(which admittedly feels a bit brittle with RFTs)."
April 2015,"Mark...I echo your sentiments about the A6 with the 3.0T and sport set up. I felt that would be my next purchase if things had turned out better with my S4. Not so, though. I also agree about the seats....nowhere near what I want. But, everything is a compromise. The A6 with the S4 motor is screaming cruiser.My favorite seats were the sport seats in my Acura TL SH AWD. Comfortable with perfect bolstering.../not too much....not too little....just right. Decent padding, too (which I could not say with the S4 seats which were particularly unyielding) 2nd is in the CTS. Thigh extensions, really nice leather. Could use a bit more bolstering. But for overall use and comfort, they acquit themselves quite well."
April 2015,Why would anyone buy a BMW without sport seats? Only those who haven't indulged!
April 2015,"I am so spoiled, and until Saturday I didn't even know it. The S4's seats (and I have the optional red leather upgraded ones) are both comfortable and grippy. For years the sport seat option was a stand alone upgrade and, as I recall, was priced at $550. Even adjusted for inflation and twice the cost, I'd go ahead and pay $1,000-ish for the upgrade -- seems like about $650 would be ""appropriate"" though. The same is true, apparently, across the line -- the only way to get the really good chairs is to opt for the ""S"" or ""RS"" versions. Now, I am a fan, but I loved my 2.0T A4 with sport package when I picked it up in 2008. And, my '05 A6 also had the bolsters on it (a $1,000 option in ""dark burnt orange"").Nothing gold can stay."
April 2015,"The base seats in the newer BMWs are just mediocre, at best. The seats in my wife's E90 are not anywhere near as comfortable as the seats in my MS3- never mind the sport seats in my Club Sport or the E21 Recaros in my '02. My dealer has a CPO 135i stick with every option but the Sport or M Sport package. I'd be sorely tempted were it not for that omission."
April 2015,"I recently visited an Audi dealer after many years away and took a look at the cars. I noticed thath the ""standard"" seat was very flat and uninspiring. The ""sport"" seats were highly bolstered and adjustable.Back in time, my '98 A4 had its standard seats that were somewhere in between these two current extremes. It's unfortunate that the standard seats in current models look like couch seats and that there is no in-between level of bolstering similar to what you might find in a Honda or Mazda today. I thought the standard seats were pretty ugly."
April 2015,"Someone somewhere once said, ""Life is full of disappointments, get used to it."" My wife took her 2014 SQ5 to the dealer service dept for the 35K service interval. This dealer typically aligns the car they offer the customer as their loaner car with the customer's actual car. Well, of course they don't have loaner SQ5's (didn't even think they would); so they offer her an S4. She said, ""Since my husband has an S4, could you put me in something that I don't normally have access to?"" Service adviser -- who knows us well -- says, ""Sure, what would you like?"" My wife says, ""How about an A7 or S7."" ""Well the last A7 just left, but we have a 2015 3.0T A6 with sport package that you might find interesting . . . ""Longer story short: She takes the sported-up A6 and drives it to work, the grocery store and home. Next morning (Saturday) she asks me to return the A6 and pick up the SQ5.The A6 is, hmm, sublime, it is so smooooth and powerful and almost eerily quiet. The thing accelerates with a great deal of urgency but somehow behind the wheel there is virtually no drama. There's a certain tightness to the suspension (better be, it had the sport suspension and upsized wheels and tires) -- I got the sense this (relatively) large car was proving itself to be damn near nimble.And, at $59K, it is about the same MSRP as my S4. I could see myself driving this thing -- it has more comfort, but it appears to give up but little in responsiveness to the wheel and whip.Then I get into a stretch that I know from many years of experience is full of twisties and off-camber turns and those kind of ""liquid potholes"" -- undulations in the pavement that have yet to break through to the substrate. Kind of upside down speed bumps.In any case, I am seriously looking forward to the ride.That is, until I take my first corner at speed -- about triple what the posted ""curve ahead"" yellow sign with the big black arrow ""suggests."" The car has NO issue taking the turn, It seems unflapped by my request for it to turn in sharply -- it does not understeer (that I could tell, anyway) and the tires didn't howl.Damn, damn, damn -- the leather covered driver's seat is a flat as a board and about as slick as a kid's slide. The car takes the turn with great aplomb -- too bad it all but threw me overboard (thankfully I was wearing my lap/shoulder belt and was holding on to the steering wheel with both hands.)Somewhere I heard, or thought I heard, ""WHOA NELLIE!""My 2009 A4 Prestige with sport package and my 2005 A6 -- BOTH of THEM -- had sport seats (optional, yes). I returned the car to the dealer and at that exact moment in time, the sales team was sans customers, so I asked (thankful my opinion pertaining to the horrible ""bucket"" seats would not be overheard by any other customers), ""Can I order sport seats on a new A6 with the sport package?"" And, ""Can I order sport seats through the Audi Exclusive channel?""The S6 (which is another $20,000) can have sport seats, the A6, no matter how optioned cannot.What a world, what a world. I'm melting, melting."
April 2015,Well they could do like they did with the first Lexus--undercut the competition at first by $10K-$15K and then gradually increase it if the model is popular.
April 2015,"Count me as one who is happy to see a Lincoln that, whatever other faults it might have, has a real name, not a hodge-podge of initials. As for the concept car it looks promising, with a Bentley-esque flair to the styling but we'll have to wait and see if the actual car looks good (toning down those silly wheels would be a good start).I doubt a $75K price point would work; that's too high by 1/3."
April 2015,China is a key target market for the Continental and for Lincoln as a brand.
April 2015,Maybe they've got their eyes on a global market for this car. Foreign buyers have no real point of reference regarding the history of the name.
April 2015,I am quite aware that Continental was once a distinct brand tate Ford used. It existed for only two years before being folded into Lincoln in 1957.To bring it back today would be a financial fiasco. It makes more sense to focus on strengthening the Lincoln brand rather than resurrecting a brand that hasn't been used for almost 50 years.
April 2015,"AWD doesn't erode performance-- it actually helps performance, but it's just not related very much to handling and braking--in some cases, detrimental to it. There are Porsche drivers and Porsche drivers, and each chooses his weapon depending on the battle he wishes to fight. Something for everybody---that's good marketing."
April 2015,"By the way, for those who poo-poo AWD and say it ia unnecessary of that it contributes to building a false sense of security, why does Porsche offer 20 different 911 models and market most with AWD? My answer is because the MARKET wants and is willing to pay for it.But the protests about AWD are about as loud, maybe louder, than those howls about the dearth of manual transmissions that can be had in this market segment.I would, however, assume that Porsche would not offer so many, nearly all in fact, of the cars they bring to market with AWD if it actually eroded performance.Ferdinand Piech (hope that is spelled correctly) said he thought all cars would offer AWD someday (and he said that in the '80s) -- those who championed RWD proclaimed ""no way"". BMW lovers said there would never be an AWD BMW; and Mercedes folks said there would never be an FWD Mercedes.Hmm?"
April 2015,"I did say sarcasm was difficult to convey in these posts -- stick shifts are unloved because the MARKET has determined the automatics, NOT the stick shifts are superior. This, however is not said with sarcasm.Perception is reality -- sticks are not perceived to be as VALUABLE by those who actually buy cars. The ""supposed throngs"" longing for stick shift cars are statistically insignificant and practically irrelevant.If there are any stick shifts on dealer lots, they have probably been there for a long time.When I bought my 2014 S4 the dealer did have ONE manual trans version in stock. My wife and I took it for a test drive -- it was a blast. However, my S-tronic (7 speed dual clutch) auto trans beats it by a country mile.The MARKET has spoken. In some respects, I guess I'm just the messenger willing to accept the MARKET's decision."
April 2015,"@flightnurse please spare us the elitistsh1t. ""Having owned a true ..."" Do you consider the current 320 you drive a ""true bmw.""? Prob not but you bot it(or got a good lease deal). Ford doing what Christler / fiat did- and acura should do bring back the past as well. Love the idea of this car- it's got 50 patents on the seats-- must be pretty cool."
April 2015,"Having owned a true Continental, they were cars in which people aspired to own, It wasn't until the mid 60's in which Lincoln and Continental shared the same name. Lincoln has started to turn itself around but to offer a car to start in the 70's it shouldn't have a Lincoln name attached to it."
April 2015,"Continental is not a new Brand for Ford, look at Fords history and you will see it."
April 2015,I read somewhere that Ford was thinking of starting prices in the $75K range for the Continental.
April 2015,Mark...I never would have pegged you as a fan of teen pop songs......(j/k).
April 2015,"Continental has a storied name. Did a little research last night on the Continental (which is a moniker that Bentley also uses). At different times, the Continental was indeed a separate Ford brand. Mostly though, it was a model of Lincoln (usually the top Lincoln model).Again, not sure where Ford is taking Lincoln. Aside from what appears to be a very successful ad campaign for the brand with McConnehey (sp?), I'm not sure how they can sustain the models they have if their only differentiation from the similar Ford models is a little chrome on the grill and some interior differences.I mentioned in another thread that several months ago, I was offered a %75 gift card to test drive a Lincoln. I drove an MKZ and their small SUV (can't recall the model). They were not bad drives at all. And, were nice in most respects. But, they were also about $10K for the exact same drive in a Fusion or Escape, save for a few extra niceties.Nonetheless, they're pretty cars. Scoff if you must, but if the Continental comes out and is anywhere near reasonably priced, it will do well. Maybe not our cup of tea. But, Hyundai has proven that when you bring a nice car to market, that may have only 90% of the capabilities of the stalwarts in the category, the cars will sell."
April 2015,"Perhaps we'll see names like Capri, Mark, Town Car come back? Versailles, probably not. I do miss the days when most car names were not some combination of letters, numbers. There were some great names like Wildcat, Galaxie, DeVille, Starfire, Skylark, Imperial, Fury, etc."
April 2015,"I respectfully disagree. It makes no sense for Ford to create a new ""brand."" The cost would be prohibitive."
March 2015,"""It's the auto vs stick phenom -- everyone knows and agrees that sticks are superior  but they linger on lots unsold and unloved. Go figure. ""So tell me where those lingering stick shifts are. I recently visited a few dealers and even on the models that offer stick, nobody had any."
March 2015,Just as people became over confidence with ABS stopping their car faster...
March 2015,"Let's get the name correct, Ford for some stupid reason is calling it a Lincoln Continental, personally I think the Lincoln name needs to be dropped, make the new Continental something you want as aspire to own.."
March 2015,"I agree with this, the problem I saw with the Caddy wagon was the interior room was on the small side, rear leg room was horrible... I still like the MB wagon, has a nice look to it but then it only comes in AWD.."
March 2015,"I have to assume that the reason these players (and many others) offer AWD options for their F and R drive models is first and foremost a marketing/market penetration decision. We can (and often do) debate the efficacy of AWD or if a given 911 performs better or is easier or harder to drive if equipped as RWD or AWD, etc etc.I have to assume that BMW, to pick one, had managers and engineers who were against AWD making its way into the BMW family. Today it is the rare BMW that cannot be had with AWD.The reason for the proliferation of AWD models is -- wait for it -- because they are popular, they sell well and if you don't offer an LPS or ELLPS with AWD, and all of your competition does, you will lose market share, lose revenue, lose profit, and you will lose your job. It doesn't even matter if it can be proven that AWD is better, the same as or worse than whateverWD. AWD rules the income statement or if it doesn't ""rule"" it certainly is way too large a percentage of sales to be overlooked.Bring out a new high zoot premium vehicle of the species SEDAN and offer it with only two wheels driven, and, well pretty soon the car magazines will be apologizing to the market on behalf of the company justifying their not class leading sales on the oversight -- no AWD = lower sales.It's the auto vs stick phenom -- everyone knows and agrees that sticks are superior  but they linger on lots unsold and unloved. Go figure. Sarcasm is difficult to do in these things sometimes.Because you know It's all about that bass,'Bout that bass, no trebleIt's all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no trebleIt's all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no trebleIt's all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bassWith apologies to Meghan Trainor for slightly changing the lyrics. bass = $$$, of course (signed, Captain Obvious)"
March 2015,"Regarding American cars recapturing the luxury end of the market, I think any new names will have to make sure that affluent 40-50 year olds take notice. ""Continental"" fortunately shares an alliance with Bentley heritage."
March 2015,"And yes, the Continental name is a GO!!Wonder if this will spike a resurgence of names over letters/numbers for models......Fleetwood, Eldorado anyone?"
March 2015,"They'll get over it. IMHO, the Flying Spur has some resemblance to a late 90's A8. The Continental has some last gen 9-5 in the rear as well.Yes, it will be built on the CD4 platform which will be stretched. 3.0L EcoBoost with AWD and an interior resplendent with chrome. Production begins next year as a 2017 model. And yes, the Continental name is a GO!!"
March 2015,"Big, FWD(or FWD biased AWD), expensive for what you get- yawn..."
March 2015,"Bentley has their panties all up in a bunch over this car. Lincoln has given it the go ahead, BTW. Have no idea on pricing. Supposed to be on a stretched Fusion platform. So, see this at your LINCOLN dealer sometime in the near future."
March 2015,"Yes, that's right, AWD does not improve handling...it improves acceleration. Which is where I got the idea of ""over confidence"" from---that you might end up going faster than you can safely stop. I think a car with a good set of snow tires will beat an AWD on all seasons every time in cornering or braking because cornering ability on slick roads or during obstacle avoidance/braking is the job of tires and suspension, not the drivetrain. Here's an interesting VIDEO from the UK that demonstrates this."
March 2015,Absolutely
March 2015,"My guess is the new Continental will be a top of the line model with a starting msrp north of 50k. But, with the likely rebates and discounts you might be able to score a ""base"" model in the low 40s....Guilty pleasure, I guess, but I think it looks pretty good. But kinda wish they'd gone with ""suicide"" doors lol...."
March 2015,"Well the definition is all over the place now so if it starts under $40, it's EL."
March 2015,No EL in that. And those wheels are hideous.
March 2015,"So will the new Continental be an ELLPS? V6, AWD, big 19"" wheels......"
March 2015,"Oh, yeah. And what's cool is that most of the time the XF has a RWD bias, I believe it is 90% of the torque goes to the rear axle. Pushing the snow button changes it to 30/70 with the computer deciding upon when to make it 50/50."
March 2015,"I grew up in the era of FWD and ""Hot Hatches."" My first car was an original VW Scirocco, followed by an arrest-me-red Mitsubishi Mirage Turbo. Being a lifelong resident of New England, and a skier, I never had any real issues with FWD and all-season tires (until my lovely '05 Acura TL). I told folks why add the price, complexity and performance/MPG drain of AWD when FWD and snow/winter tires would likely be more than enough 99% of the time? Even FWD with all-seasons got me where I was going. Of course, ground clearance is another factor...But, my TL was just not as good in the snow as previous FWD'ers. So, I bought snow tires on dedicated alloys (great deal at Tire Rack) and that problem solved. I had plenty of room to store four tires, and the cost of the tires/2x yearly swap was still less $ than AWD options. Of course, then I want nutsy, cuckoo and traded the TL for the V8/RWD Jaguar XK. With Summer tires. My first RWD, a whole new world of no go in snow. I mean, 1/8"" and I couldn't get out of my driveway! Luckily I had the option of an AWD SUV...But, man plans and God laughs. Life changes and I suddenly-ish needed a 52 week car. Or a second car. Logic and maturity took over, hence adios glorious V8 sound, hello sensible pair of shoes Jag XF AWD. Could I have gone RWD XF with snows/rims? Of course, with the traction/stability control, snow mode tranny and good snows, I likely wouldn't have had any issues as, generally, a good job is done in snow plowing around here (even with 10' of snow this winter!). But, with nowhere to store a set of tires/rims (without paying to do so), I chose the path of least resistance and went AWD. No worries about the freak storm before/after snows have been swapped or storage and charges to swap tires.So, I pay for my laziness. Need AWD? No. Glad I have AWD? Yes. XF was a champ in the blizzard I drove through last month on my way to ski Maine. Sad said blizzard was east of the mountains and didn't dump any new snow at the resort!So, understand and choose your poison. No ""wrong"" answer."
March 2015,"Me too. E Class wagons were for those with old, moldy money. They also had a Grand Wagoneer at the shore house."
March 2015,"I always saw it the other way.. the Mercedes wagon people were ""old money"", that just bought a wagon, because they wanted a wagon... The S-class people were the ""nouveau riche""."
March 2015,"Cadillac dropped their wagon, too. It had a lot of good press. Unfortunately, there's still that stigma that goes with wagons.I remember when having a Mercedes Wagon was height of knowing you made it. Had neighbors who had zero need for a wagon, but bought a Mercedes Wagon for the cache it supposedly gave them."
March 2015,I understand why Subaru dropped the wagon. It doesn't mean I have to be happy with that decision
March 2015,
March 2015,Subaru dropped the wagon for a couple of reasons. First it wasn't a great seller. Second was the fact that it's MPG wasn't that great and affected their CAFE number. The Outback is considered an SUV and it's MPG doesn't count against CAFE.
March 2015,"Let me be perfectly clear.  I don't consider AWD  a need but I find it very nice to have many days during the winter and on some rainy days.  It always seems that the people that are so sure it doesn't help get you around more efficiently in the winter are those that live in Florida or Arizona for example.  I have a rwd truck and have had plenty of rear wheel drive cars.  And like I said, equipped the same and driven with common sense the awd will be much easier to get around on slippery, snowpacked roads.  Ground clearance isn't a big deal for me as it is rarely a factor in the Midwest. But slushy or hardpacked snowy roads are very common and awd makes much more secure footing when in traffic and pulling or merging into traffic.I never said anyone has to have awd but you guys make it sound like anyone that has it doesn't know how to drive.   Comes off a little arrogant IMO."
March 2015,"When the wife wanted the Subaru Outback, she wanted something more ""wagon-y"" than the SUV's she'd been driving.Once she got behind the wheel, that myth was shattered - the Subaru has the same height as our old Mazda CX-7. Same or better ground clearance as well.If only Subaru had continued to make the Legacy wagon ... that would have been perfect."
March 2015,"To each his own I guess is the final say. I had the opportunity to drive a RWD vs AWD Porsche back to back and I thought the AWD car pushed a lot in the turns. It's more work. For driving pleasure I would have chosen the RWD. Snow is not an issue where I live, so it's hard to justify the weight and expense of AWD in this zip code. The reason I bought a used 4WD truck was for flooding conditions--i.e., the ground clearance. I guess some AWD like Subaru do lift the car, which is nice--but my friend's Mercedes AWD doesn't seem to have any more ground clearance than normal. He doesn't seem to care or notice the AWD--it just came that way."
March 2015,"Sorry, I should have said ""better handling"" is not dependent on driven wheels. Yes, they will handle differently, but not necessarily better."
March 2015,"Well, the old Integra R dominates the old Impreza RS at the autocross."
March 2015,I agree. They are nice looking. Well finished & drive great. But a risk no less.
March 2015,buying a used on does scare me. Nice cars though. Most likely it would never be something that would end up being my choice (unless I was leasing possibly).

March 2015,Don't forget driver100's clutch failure at 10k miles...
March 2015,"And the main problem with Audis is that I just keep hearing not so good things about long term reliability & customer service. From our own @graphicguy's binding issues with his former S4 to my parents' transmission issues with their leased A6 from 2002 to @roadburner's friend who says that Audi's are 60K mile cars to a statement that has been told to me by 2 industry insiders (1 the GM of a Chevy Dealership & 2 @isellhondas) ""If we take an Audi in on trade that is out of the factory warranty, we immediately wholesale it."""
March 2015,"I disagree. Handling is absolutely affected by driven wheels. Try to enter a corner at excessive speed, then hit brakes or accelerator at different times and see how the car reacts. Depending on the propelled wheels, it will do different things."
March 2015,"So now that we are beating a dead horse again, Jaguar has finally updated their US website with the new XE, they have limited info, but do show the 3 models that will come here, but no pricing at this time. You can build one with limited options."
March 2015,"I couldn't have said it better, but of course, the buying public and even people in this forum have bought the package that if you live in an area that gets snow, then you must have AWD..."
March 2015,AWD instead of FWD. wasn't comparing to RWD here.
March 2015,"I'm sure you just mistyped, stick, but balance and handling are not dependent on the driven wheels. Better acceleration traction in all conditions? Yes. That's it. There is a reason why the Miata, one of the best-handling cars of all time, is NOT AWD."
March 2015,Because it's a Subaru and the purists would have a conniption if it were anything else!!
March 2015,You nailed it!
March 2015,"AWD is not just snow. Vs. FWD, it can also give better handling and balance on wet roads. And dry. The WRX is AWD for a reason!"
March 2015,"Bradd, from reading about the ride on that, you might not enjoy it on the I95 bomb craters very much."
March 2015,That does seem to be a nice price for the S3. Is that price good for all that equip??
March 2015,"""Well that's an argument that isn't as strong as it first sounds because invariably over-confidence in AWD often leads to mishaps.""OMG, really? Never heard that one before. I see yahoos all the time thinking they can drive faster because of AWD. Sorry, but I'm not one of them. Didn't feel I had to put that qualifier in the argument. OK, same vehicle, same tires, same careful driving then. AWD is easier to get around in heavy snow and slippery conditions given the same type of driving. Does it allow one to drive like a maniac. Absolutely not.And invariably means that it will always happen sooner or later right? Don't think you can say that about all drivers."
March 2015,And I'd rather get a Golf R - all of the above (I think) and the practicality of a hatch!
March 2015,"Only if the lady in question is a snob .. she might prefer the VW due to the IQ of the owner, understanding the value..."

March 2015,"Well that's an argument that isn't as strong as it first sounds because invariably over-confidence in AWD often leads to mishaps. If you doubt this, I invite you to talk to any tow truck driver who operates in or near a popular ski area. If nothing else, and it doesn't convince you, you'll get some entertaining stories. No matter how you cut it, your car is kept on the road by four small patches of rubber--if that rubber has no grip, it woudln't matter if you had ten-wheel drive. Same with mud, or sand. So my advice to anyone with AWD is to choose your battles wisely, and if you do, then you'll have the edge--all things being equal."
March 2015,"If given the choice of driving the same exact vehicle with the same exact tires in a winter snowstorm, I would choose the AWD vehicle every time. People always say ""well if you used the right tires and drove like me you would have no issues"". Actually getting tired of hearing that. And there is a big difference between ""need"" and ""nice to have"". Do I need AWD in the winter around Chicago?.....not really. Is it very nice to have in certain situations where you need you need to get out of someone else's way or get going from a light in slippery conditions? Yes, it is very nice to have. Of course, I can get around without AWD as I occasionally drive my RWD v-8 truck in the snow but it isn't a lot of fun."
March 2015,"Yep- the ""wearers."""
March 2015,"So many times I hear someone say: ""my car stinks in the snow or my car drives terribly in the snow."" For the longest time I responded with: ""its probably not your car that drives terribly in the snow, if equipped with a proper set of winter tires you should have no problems."" That usually got the ""deer in the headlights stare"" at which point I would just say: ""You are right. you need AWD or 4WD."""
March 2015,"Any AWD system can be completed neutralized by the wrong tires and the wrong driver. These are, after all, the two things that actually keep a car on the road. Another factor is that many AWD sedans don't offer any greater ground clearance, so deep snow is going to defeat you anyway."
March 2015,Perhaps the young man should reevaluate his date if that's what the measure she uses.......and that brings us back to the reason the vast majority of these ELLPS' are sold - prestige and the look at me factor.
March 2015,"Yeah, well since he said ""besides AWD and a few extra HP"" I didn't address the AWD part. But that would be a large factor in that neck of the woods. As far as people wanting AWD. A lot of people had RWD cars when they were younger and they remember the horrible situations in snow covered streets where they just spun and the rear end kicked out all over the place(I had a 1980 Camaro, loved it but not in the snow) because that was before better all-season tires, ABS, traction control, etc. And after FWD cars took over the availability of RWD mainstream cars is somewhat limited. A lot of people haven't driven a RWD car since then, so the memories are their perception."
March 2015,"I was going to say ""4 rings"". Though in a performance oriented car, the AWD can come in handy (he does live up in a heavy snow area in upstate NY). Something like a GLI where you are getting into low profile performance tires would likely require snow tires, and he has no place to keep those off-season."
March 2015,"Back to AWD, I can understand why you might want one in the mountains or the Northeast; but even in my neck of the woods people spring for AWD.(the reason we have a Jeep and and an X3 truck is because our 1500' gravel driveway rarely sees a plow- but note that my Wrangler made it through over 18"" of snow in 2WD thanks to BFG All Terrain KO tires with the Severe Snow rating). What I find to be incredibly pathetic are the hopelessly inept souls who say that they can't own a RWD car because they need a vehicle that they can drive in the rain.What they really need is their license pulled in exchange for a handful of bus tokens..."
March 2015,"Nicer interior, better warranty, dealer experience and luxury brand. For a young guy, pulling up to pick up your date in an Audi versus a Vdub could be a game changer. LOL."
March 2015,"Other than AWD and a few extra HP, what's the difference between the GLI and the A3?"
March 2015,"My son is a good example. First job, new car, tight finances. He got a Jetta. SE. Wanted a GLI, but got in fold and hooked on German cars. Already planning next one. Drools on an S3. Will probably settle for an A3. After that, will depend on how his budget (and family if one comes along) grows! But he does aspire to move up the ladder."
March 2015,"Q nailed it. These are the models to get the budget challenged into the category/brand. Not the highest performance or most luxurious, but with reasonable quantities of both. Size is not that important. Nor is drivetrain configuration. Badge and price are."
March 2015,"Started off as and still is the ""cheaper version."" However, that doesn't necessarily mean no options. That's why I've been stressing BASE MSRP. I absolutely concede that some luxury options are almost a necessity to make it feel like a luxury car. The only thing the limit on base msrp does is exclude other models that start much higher, such as the M, AMG, S, or V examples. markcincinnati said:The point of all of this is to say, OK, I'll concede the historical meaning of ELLPS meant ""low cost"" -- but what is now ELLPS, then would have to be A3's, but NOT A4's (the B9's will certainly cost more than the B8's, even at base, strippie levels.) Then we need somewhere to put the A4's, 3 series and C class's -- to say nothing of some of the other ""premium"" offerings from Asia and America.
So, like I said earlier, the only reason I'm thinking the cutoff is cost, not size, is to allow BMW and Caddy to play here on equal ground. I mean, I suppose its not unrealistic to compare a 328 to an A3, but then folks would be arguing those two don't directly compete. Then we have to say ""ah, but you can't discuss the A4 because its not the entry-level model."" It just makes things more confusing. markcincinnati said:The reason for the A3 and CLA (for example)? According to the two dealers I spoke with, the reason for these new, less expensive models is that the ELLPS variants typically sell for a number beginning with either a high four number or a low five number -- these new models allow folks who want to be in the Mercedes family to join for $37,500 rather than $57,500 -- and hopefully will trade UP next time. 
BINGO! As m6user pointed out, that's EXACTLY the point of ""entry level."" To get you into the brand and keep you coming back for more. Its a gateway drug."
March 2015,Lots of us open the moonroof all the time. And many people that don't still open the shade to get more light in. Especially important in the typical German black cave interior!
March 2015,"All good points. The starting numbers, for all cars, are now in the high teens. Those prices are populated by the Fiat 500, Kia Soul, Hyundai Accent, Cruise, Fiesta, etc. Most, if not all, sacrifice one or the other portions or power, refinement, quality of materials, material quality, etc. Sometimes sacrificing a lot of everything. That's how they get to those price points.Some manufacutrer have become quite clever. They'll wrap their ""cheap"" cars in innovative styles. Look close enough, and it's hard to mask the underlying cost cutting.When you move up that ladder, into the Civics or Accords, Corollas or Camry, Fusion, Malibu, Mazda 3 or 6, etc., you crack that $25K price, with the best of them hitting the low $30s.From my perception, that's where the A3, CLA, 320i, ILX, probably a 2.5L ATS want to play (I suppose you can throw the Infiniti G in there, but that's pretty old these days). Not the best those brands can do, but it gets you in the door of the brand. 3 year lease is over, You think, I'm making a little more money, and boy was that C Class ever sexy looking when I was last in the showroom and hopefully, if you had a good experience with the previous car, you're driving off in a $45K C Class, or A4, or 328, loaded up TLX, or an ATS with the better drivetrain, with more options.All of a sudden, all those promises of having a good portfolio and compound interest are starting to bear fruit. Now, you're in the $50K-$60K bracket. Now, you're looking at E Class, A6, CTS. You wouldn't dream of sullying your driveway with an Impala (even though it's every bit as good as an XTS).Mark, you're right. That's what Sloan started, and the hope for all these brands, how they want to ""hook"" you from the start.Where Mercedes and BMW seem to have an advantage, they've positioned themselves as aspirational brands. Cadillac used to be there. I think some of that is still there. Their missteps have cost them some of that, though. I've not driven an A3. But, I have driven an S3. Fun car. To live with it everyday? Probably wouldn't be my choice. Test drove a CLA. That is not a good car. An Accord is better in every way. But, you have a Mercedes, an aspirational brand. And, you're in it for about the price of a loaded Accord. I'll accept that the 320i is a good car based in FN's reports. But, I've only driven one when my sister was shopping them (she ended up with a C Class.......BECAUSE IT WAS A MERCEDES...320i was the better car, IMHO). Audi wasn't on her radar based on my experience with them.Audi and Acura are FWD architectures. Today, these platforms are SO GOOD, it really doesn't matter to me. I know for many of you, it does. The Mercedes, Cadillac (ATS/CTS) are RWD platforms. But, Mercedes is bringing their FWD platform here, too.What does any of this have to do with ELLPS? Probably not diddly....except everyone in here will be in the Audi, Acura, Cadillac, BMW, Mercedes showrooms sometime in the next 24 months....guaranteed."
March 2015,"""these new models allow folks who want to be in the Mercedes family to join for $37,500 rather than $57,500 -- and hopefully will trade UP next time.""That's exactly what an ""entry"" level car is. ELLPS is the lowest price performance sedan of a given maker. If a car qualifies all the alphas then it should be included. I don't personally see the CLA, ILX and 320 for examples as performance sedans even though they are entry level luxury."
March 2015,"Yeah but the magazines don't buy cars. My wife will not have a car without AWD here in Colorado even though we really only ""need"" it about 10-15 days per year. Here's ""a"" thing -- not the thing, a thing: The list of BRANDs we discuss here (and elsewhere) that do not offer AWD versions of their models has diminished to an incredibly small number. Perception is reality is the phrase we live by, even if we don't always agree. The perception is that the higher performing models from Audi, BMW and Mercedes (just to name the Germans for an example) now offer AWD virtually if not literally and I think we're closing in on literally, across their entire lines. Porsche, clearly not an LPS generally speaking, has 20 different cars for sale all called 911's -- I believe they are all offered with AWD. And, often the ones (of any ilk, brand or type) that achieve the most ""wins"" are the AWD models.But, even if that were not true -- what really matters is what people buy. Pull into a parking lot of a high zoot country club and look at the trunk emblems on the carefully parked high buck LPS (or, of you ike ELLPS) cars -- the majority of them will be xdrive, CTS or ATS4's, or quattros or four-matics or AWD badged in some way.Let's assume that my wife and your wife, knowing that they can only actually REQUIRE AWD for about 2-5 days per year (for go power in snow); and that they could probably go if they would use winter tires with FWD or RWD, just fine, were asked if they would give up AWD. I am positive the answer from my wife would be, ""don't take away my AWD.""The perception and the sales have been pointing to AWD, automatic transmissions, not naturally aspirated engines, more than 6 speeds in the transmission (or at the very least, nothing less than 6 speeds) and more and more electronic driving aids.Entry level may have started off as meaning ""cheaper versions"" of higher line cars from a given mfg. And, as a practical matter, at base, no options, that is, MSRP, that is still true. But I am today convinced (by virtue of what the dealer folks tell me) that the only reason for a given BASE MSRP is the tv commercial and the lease price. And, even that is changing -- now the tv ads tout the car that is being advertised for $X pre month is ""nicely equipped"" -- if you hit the pause button and read the fine print, the cars being advertised are more and more likely to no longer be base models. Unless mandated to do so, you would be hard pressed to even find a base price model at a dealership.The reason is no one will buy one of this class of car NEW at least without the ""premium"" package on it, so dealers stock their lots -- since most Americans won't orders cars, cause they have to have it today -- with cars that are popularly equipped. This translates to a lot, but not all, of the options on the check sheet.I spoke to a German dealer rep who thought we (Americans) were crazy for ""always"" putting sunroofs in our cars since those of us who have them rarely, if ever, open them. Big bucks for a vestigial options. It is virtually impossible to get a German car sans sunroof -- and if you try, well you for sure throw yourself into a class of car that the leasing organizations will not sub-vent, because they have the experience with a market that won't buy a car that doesn't have a sunroof, even if no one ever opens them.The point of all of this is to say, OK, I'll concede the historical meaning of ELLPS meant ""low cost"" -- but what is now ELLPS, then would have to be A3's, but NOT A4's (the B9's will certainly cost more than the B8's, even at base, strippie levels.) Then we need somewhere to put the A4's, 3 series and C class's -- to say nothing of some of the other ""premium"" offerings from Asia and America.If you agree about the use of the term Entry Level as not necessarily being about $, the M3, for instance is the Entry Level M car -- and, at this point in time, there is no Entry Level RS car, unless you accept that Audi has chosen for whatever reason to only offer an RS4 as a ""station wagon"" -- and one, even at that, that cannot be had in the US.We can go on about our business, and as long as we do not violate the terms of use of the Edmunds organization, who cares if we agree or disagree or agree to disagree about size or base MSRP. I'm interested in speaking with, in print, folks who love (or at least like) luxury performance sedans -- and, here, luxury performance sedans that are compacts -- thus ruling out their big brothers and sisters, the 5's, E's, etc.Even then, if someone is shopping for a 5 and goes with a 3 or a 7, I would find their thoughts and comments of interest. If LPS is supposed to include ""I wish I was an LPS car"" type of vehicle, I'm not interested so much. I think the VW CC or Passat are good cars -- interesting cars, perhaps even desirable cars, but today I don't think they are members of the LPS club. But they certainly are priced lower, for the most part. It's just they aren't LPS class cars. If we're looking to discuss them, we all know where to go.The reason for the A3 and CLA (for example)? According to the two dealers I spoke with, the reason for these new, less expensive models is that the ELLPS variants typically sell for a number beginning with either a high four number or a low five number -- these new models allow folks who want to be in the Mercedes family to join for $37,500 rather than $57,500 -- and hopefully will trade UP next time. I believe Mercedes is just following the Alfred P Sloan model -- start them out with a Chevy and hopefully they'll eventually buy a Cadillac. Start them out with a CLA and maybe someday they'll be back for an S Class.It could work.I think entry level is a name that needs some rethinking. The lower cost of the ELLPS vs the LPS is, apparently, a function of the wheelbase, length overall and width of the model -- back to the EPA classification, if you will."
March 2015,"Yeah but the magazines don't buy cars. My wife will not have a car without AWD here in Colorado even though we really only ""need"" it about 10-15 days per year."
March 2015,"Mark every car magazine has disproved this whole ""If you live in snow country, you need AWD"" Car's today and the electronic nannies have helped so much that AWD isn't really needed, plus these same magazines have shown how people have a false sense of security with these cars."
March 2015,"I'm not sure of everything you are trying to say, but it comes down to the same thing some of us have been saying over and over again: ENTRY LEVEL is price-dependent. Something with a base price starting with a 6 is not entry level, no matter what it shares its underpinnings with. And, yes, of course a car can be optioned up with a ridiculous amount of gee-gaws, but that's largely irrelevant to the discussion. You can take a $16k Honda and put $20k of electronics, custom paint, and custom interior on it, but that doesn't change its class. Lipstick on a pig, in other words. Base MSRP provides a consistent basis of comparison."
March 2015,"Mark, I think it seems there is a vantage point gap between you and some other guys here. You seem to be getting mostly top of the line, or at least well into the options, whereas a lot if other guys seem to be fishing in much less equipped ponds and get freaked out by anything more than 50 on the sticker. They said so repeatedly. It may be because they live by their memories (what it used to cost), or perhaps by simply how much they could afford. For myself, I don't look at cars at their base. If I can't afford its mid-to-high option version, the car is not for me. I see no point is a stripper, but I understand why somebody may actually go for it. But that vantage point difference is very real. I generally agree with inclusion of 335 in this class, but it barely squeaks into. S4 used to be IMHO above 335, but that was before they eliminated V6 version of A4 and S4 took its place, giving space to RS4/5. I totally disagree on M or RS. There is absolutely NOTHING entry level about it, from pricing, to chassis, to engineering. ZERO. Other than superficial likeness, those are different cars than their lower cousins, essentially from ground up. Small size? Porsches are even smaller, so what? That's not enough."
March 2015,I think the 320i is going to be a tremendous value once they start coming off lease ans selling as CPO BMWs for the low to mid $20K.
March 2015,"What is the issue with the base price? The class of car which means ""who knows"" what the base price will be is what this is all about. The A3 is a sub compact, the A4 is a compact. If this is to be about sub-compacts, well I guess that is OK, but then we would need yet another cubby hole to poke the B8 Audis and the entire lineup of 3's. These are LPS cars -- but a bit smaller. In some instances it is easily possible to have the 3 series priced at more than the 5 series.Is there a debate about the ""maximum"" MSRP (base) for the full sized LPS's? It may well be true that a 335 would fit a $45K ceiling (for an RWD only version), but -- according to the BMW dealership here in River City -- over 40%, of all 3 series sold are AWD. And, here in our climate, I was told the number now favors the x - drive versions as the majority sold. The 3 series -- from bottom to top -- are in the compact class. MSRP ranges from a number beginning with a $3 to a number beginning with a $6.There are NO 335's with a window sticker under $50K, unless someone has deliberately ordered one totally stripped. There are no S4's under $50K either -- but I have seen S4 manual transmission versions with but one option that squeak by at a hair over $50K.Likewise, I shopped the IS350 Fsports and they were ALL over $50K (if they were AWD).We need to talk about either sub-compacts or compacts here. Since the MSRP's (from a practical standpoint) are all over the board, we need to think, for example, 3 series, not 3 series until they exceed $40 or $45K.Those who lease (apparently the majority) shop mo pay, not MSRP. And those who do buy, well, of course they're welcome too. I am simply arguing to be inclusive.Spend some time on the Mercedes build your own board and see how quickly the C class heads up up and away. Even the ATS when well equipped goes ballistic with aplomb and ease."
March 2015,"I could be talked into $45k, which allows the 335i, but not the 335ix. I could go either way, frankly. I think $40k would make more sense after BMW releases a smaller class here in the US to compete with the CLA/A3"
March 2015,"BMW is all about the lease payment. I was not a typical customer for them, since I don't lease. When I bought my first one, a fair amount of time ago, my sales guy was a little taken aback by me negotiating based on a purchase. He said they always negotiated payment. He's a good guy. Whenever I walk into the dealership, he knows I'm seriously looking and not just kicking tires. We go straight to the ""dealer sheet"", allegedly with his cost and MSRP on it.Point of all this, you guys are right. The only consistent price point you can depend on is the MSRP. We don't pay that. But, it's the only consistent number you can reliably use, that has no bearing on geography, lease vs buy, demand (or not), etc.I still say the ""base"" price can't exceed $45K for EL. That means the A3/4 gets in, but the S4 doesn't, for example."
March 2015,"I like the idea of a bmw that's sporty for under 40k....but el cheapo with auto (which some herd have ) is not it. Talk about sport all you want- and I like the MS3 becaus in many ways it's a better car then the 320. The Manual 320 (never driven) Prob a nice rig,328 manual even better I guess. Talk lease leader ad deals- guys who get 10-15k of cts - but real world when you need a car you take msrp and subtract an amount- usually 10-% or less depending on car. I love cars- I love cars with passion more. Do you feel the love (tonight?)"
March 2015,"QB: wouldn't that mean that the Audi S4 (not RS) and the BMW 335 (not M) would be ineligible? I know we can (and do) discuss pretty much whatever we want here (within certain parameters) but we would really narrow the category and the forum(s) down quite a bit if we put a cap of $39,999 as a starting point; unless of course you meant the 335 would be allowed in because there are 3 series cars that do fit this criteria.Thus: a 320 ""invites"" all ""3"" class cars along with it. I do not have access to ""unlimited"" funds (as a practical matter, few of us do, even the 2%-ers) -- but my search and the folks I know and ""fraternize"" with (middle and upper-middle class earners) typically buy/lease within a 2 class range. Example: my neighbor says he's looking at BMWs. I say ""what model?"" He says, ""probably a 5 series, the 3 is too small, maybe a 7 series, I'll have to see what kind of deal I can get.""One day, I see what I presume is a new 535ix with dealer plates in his driveway. As I pass, I roll down my window and stop to ask, ""is that the new ride?"" He says, ""they gave it to me for the weekend, I have to take it back Monday, I dunno."" I say, ""you'll really appreciate the X-drive if we have another winter like this one.""He says, ""no poop?!?"" (not really).Next time I drive by -- a few days later, I see a new 7 series in the driveway with temp tags on it. When I see him next, I ask him about it. He tells me, ""the lease payment on this car wasn't much more than the payment on the 5 and this thing is loaded -- I couldn't turn it down.""Now, for all I know he was set on a 7 series all along -- he is a tall drink of water. But I think he was assuming the 5 series would be fine and fit the financial parms he and his wife had set. Well, when for a ""little more"" he could have a 7 series, well it was probably NOT an agonizing decision. The thing that cracks me up is what ""always"" happens (and if you don't believe me, spend some time on Audiworld's forums): the new fill-in-the-blank is acquired (purchased, financed or leased) and about 15 minutes later, the proud new owner is browsing Tire Rack, APR, (fill in the blank for your brand of LPS car) etc for ""all the stuff"" that this brand new owner will buy to modify his (or her) new ride.I have seen -- again, over on Audi World -- folks announce the new A4 they've just ordered, then announce that the car is at the dealer, then post picture of the new car (while it is still at the dealership) with the title of the post ""Let the Mods Begin."" Folks (broad generalization) buy/lease any of these cars that can genuinely and without qualification be in the ""something"" LPS class and then dump another dump-truck of money on aftermarket tires and wheels, engine management chips, pullies, exhaust systems, brakes, lights, spoilers, coil-overs, audio systems, nav systems, headlights, tail-lights, interior treatments, and . . . (the list goes on and on and on -- thank you SEMA).It seems to me if you have ""graduated"" to the luxury performance sedans (etc), that you can, practically speaking, pretty much afford anything you damn well please. The wheels and tires alone ""y'all"" spring for on an otherwise very well equipped 335 or Q50 or S4 cost a young fortune -- yet ""y'all"" go ahead and plunk down the forty-nine, eleventy-twelve thousand dollars on the car and then just for grins put on a $2,400 set of rims with $1,200 worth of rubber on them without batting a freakin' eye. What really cracks me up is the folks who acquire an A4 and then spend thousands on engine, suspension and tire and wheel mods so that they can create what they designate as an AS4 -- when for another $50 a month they could've had an S4 and be done with it (and the warranty would still be in full force, too).One A4 buyer purchased one without navigation and then worked and worked until he found all of the parts required to retro-fit the Audi OEM nav system into the thing -- talk about costing a fortune. I often wonder, why not buy an A4 and see how much money and sweat it will take to fit the DSG transmission in place of the 8-speed tiptronic.It ain't the money that compels ""our"" actions in this class of car -- at least as far as the fan site participants are concerned. Some of the aftermarket audio systems, too, cost more than a new 4K 79"" UHDTV. AMEX - don't leave home without it.These are LPS cars we're talking about -- within middle and upper middle class lunacy and normalcy you're just gonna have to get rid of the notion of $40K -- it jus' isn't a thing anymore (if it ever was)."
March 2015,"exactly. And deals vary throughout the year. MSRP is the only way that makes consistent sense.By the way, @markcincinnati, I still think pricing is part of the equation. I'd like a combination of size class and pricing. B-class cars with starting MSRP under $40k, for example."
March 2015,Nobody is missing the point. Everyone realizes what you're saying but some deals are better than others for a variety of reasons. That's why people use MSRP for reference. It's like using the EPA MPG numbers. Everyone knows that peoples mpg varies some but for comparison purposes the EPA numbers are best to use. There is always somebody that got $10k off or pays close to MSRP for some oddball reason or gets 40mpg in a car rated for 32. Better to deal with verifiable numbers for comparison sake.
March 2015,"I think people are missing the point on price, the prices people are quoting is MSRP, who pays MSRP? So a 320i with premium package, Leather, Sport Package and Lighting Package $41,400. Can be had easily for $38,400 and right now BMW has $1,500 debate on cars on the dealers lot, $36,900. I'm sure you can get said 320i for even less then this. So for under$40K you can have a ELPS this is with manual transmission... Lease Payments for said BMW with mim down of about $1,100 for tax's and fee's would be roughly $350/m. Now a 328i with Sport package, Premium package (includes Leather) and lighting package is $45,500 (MSRP) Could be has easily for $40,800 this includes $1,500 rebate BMW has, and I'm sure you could get this price down even more.. With mim down, lease payments would be roughly $375/m So when you guys are throwing around prices, lets be realistic, who on this board pays MSRP for their cars? No one... Real world data is showing that people are paying a lot less for their cars."
March 2015,"Agreed; that's what I like about my MS3 it's relatively quick(especially since I boosted the horsepower and removed the ludicrous top speed limiter), handling is very good(if you don't mind the slow in-fast out point and shoot driving style), and it's still a comfortable cruiser. I also like the fact that it is a true sleeper. Right now I'm trying to decide my next car will be a focused track toy or a more luxurious Grand Tourer. In either case it will almost certainly be a RWD coupe with at least 350 bhp and three pedals."
March 2015,"This was a few years ago, but I was doing a little stoplight wars with my (then) relatively new Mustang GT. Not a slow car by any stretch. Until, I got into a little friendly throttle blip war with an F150 in the next lane. Lite goes green. Throttle mashed, good shift from 1st to 2nd, an even better one from 2nd to 3rd until we both backed off. But, he was 100 feet ahead of me when we did. Ended up he had debadged and chipped what ended up being an F150 Lightning.From that p;point forward, as long as my vehicles were quick, I was happy.Loved my time with the Mustang, the S4 and my 335i. Emphasis for me these days is the whole package. If it doesn't go well, if it doesn't handle well, if it's not put together well, if it isn't relatively pain free from a maintenance and reliability standpoint, it's not on my radar."
March 2015,"Coming SoonPicked up the S4 after the 25K service interval where it received an oil and filter change plus a brake fluid flush and refill. New battery for the smart key and a hand wash and front mat vacuum rounded out the ""no charge"" service. I had a new RED S4 as my loaner for the day. Things are going well, the brakes are said to be at 80% of new.My rep tells me the new S4 will ""certainly"" have a horsepower and torque jump. The reason? The S4 is ALWAYS more powerful than the top of the line A6 (not S6, 3.0T supercharged A6). The new 2016 A6's on the floor have the same 333HP as my 2014 S4. In my mind, however, it just won't do for the S3 to outgun the S4, just like the S6 ""must"" outgun the S4 and so forth.So, I'm thinking the new S4 will simply adopt the same motor as is in my wife's SQ5 -- 354HP. Apparently that is a no go -- it won't fit under the hood of the S4. So we're looking at what? 10%; would bump the S4 to 366 HP -- and with a bump in torque to 350, or so, wouldn't that be ""sufficient"" to out gun the S3, be bigger than the A6, but still be outgunned by the S6 and S8, etc.Well, if my sales rep knows some bump is a certainty, don't you think BMW does too? The 335 is due for what a 15% bump? And so forth?The horsepower (and torque) ""wars"" continue and continue and continue. How many speeding tickets does it take before your insurance company dumps you or you end up in jail? Making a lighter A4 line and bumping the power by ""only"" 10% is certainly a recipe for ""license and registration please . . . Mark."" God I hate it when the traffic cop knows you by name.Can't wait for the new uprated power -- coming soon to a [German] car near you."
March 2015,I agree with goldie-
March 2015,"My head hurts less, now that we can go back to what I presume was actually intended from the get go:ELLPS - Compact Sized Premium Sedans with Performance capabilities that are not an afterthought or based on trim, badges, decals and chromeLPS - Mid Sized Premium Sedans with . . . .Let's keep the Sub-compacts together but differentiate the ""LPS"" Sub-compacts by virtue of pedigree or genuine Luxury and Performance content. If the A3, despite it pedigree, for instance, can't muster anything else than its name to differentiate itself from a Jetta (or whatever), well it would be left out. I think we're all trying to allow, again for example, the ILX to be in a given class but simultaneously exclude the Civic despite the family resemblance. SCLPS, EL or C LPS and LPS in short.I would suspect the 3 series and A4 and C class and ATS buyers are more ""birds of a feather"" as would others of the Sub-compact size be birds of a feather. The price range, for example, of the ELLPS is so very wide, but the ""class"" as noted by the original post still seems to my old-fart's brain to be the one that's ""just right."" We've come full-circle.Thank you.Signed,Goldilocks."
March 2015,It seems like the luxury makers have new entry level cars that are not up to the same level of luxury nor performance of the cars that preceded them. So an argument could be made that they are not ELLPS because they don't have the luxury or performance level expected of the brand. I wasn't impressed with either the CLA or the ILX at the auto show from a luxury viewpoint.
March 2015,"Let's not forget that size impressions change over time. The Accord was a compact that went to a midsized and then a borderline-large car. The current Civic is larger than earlier Accords. And so Honda has introduced the Fit, which is larger than the first Civics. You can use the same analogy for the Corolla and then Yaris, or the A4 and then the A3, or the C-class and now the CLA.The vehicles we used to think of as ""entry-level"" have gotten larger and new smaller models have been slotted in below them. In a lot of cases those new models are made more cheaply than the original grown models, so that adds a bit of additional complexity. For example my new '98 A4 was a similar size to the current A3 sedan, but I've sat in the A3 and I would say that the old A4 was a much more luxurious vehicle than the current A3, and it also performed better."
March 2015,"""You will often hear the phrase ""Best whatever in it's class."" That typically refers to the EPA category.""I think they use whatever ""class"" they can construe to fit their advertising. I recall a discussion about the Ford Taurus which everyone knows is a large family sedan. I believe the EPA had it as a midsize based on interior volume but Ford markets it as a large family sedan. As it should IMO."
March 2015,"Agree, now that I know how its done, EPA classes are useless.Do the euro classifications work? Not sure I have time to sift through them all, but specifically dividing C-segment from D-segment. At first glance, it appears to be CLA/A3 in the C-segment and C-class/3-series/A4 in the D-segment. They don't list Acura since it doesn't exist there, but Civic is C-segment and Accord is D-segment."
March 2015,"I'm sure that not consulting the EPA class is true for the vast majority of car shoppers. But it is something that is common across all vehicles that can be measured. The fuel economy listed on the Munroney sticker uses it as a guide.As for manufacturers seldom marketing using the EPA categories, I disagree. You will often hear the phrase ""Best whatever in it's class."" That typically refers to the EPA category."
March 2015,"I really don't know anyone, myself included, that consults with or cares what class the EPA designates a car. Manufacturers seldom market their cars using the EPA categories."
March 2015,"Well the EPA is fueleconomy.gov so it is a reliable source. Here is the link:http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/byclass/byEPAclassNF.shtmlThe EPA measure cubic footage of the seating areas. Based on that criteria, the Rapide is a subcompact. Aston designed the Rapide with 4 tight seats with a huge console running through the middle of the car. Don't blame the EPA for Aston's poor space utilization.Many people look at a car, see a big exterior, and expect the interior to be large. Hence, interior volume is what is measured by the EPA."
March 2015,"They are? Huh. Where do I look that info up? Because I tried fueleconomy.gov and they list the Aston Rapide S as subcompact, so methinks that's not a reliable source.EDIT: So it took quite a bit of searching, but it seems the CLA has 101 total cubic feet of interior volume, while the C-class sedan has 100. Go figure. Oh, and the Rapide has 97?? I give up trying to figure this out. Seems to be pretty apparent that interior volume means a whole lotta nothing."
March 2015,Except that the ILX and CLA are both considered compacts by the EPA. So are we now going to identify by barely a compact and almost a mid-size?
March 2015,"I like the above take from @stickguy and @qbrozen. Looking at these by class, and including the emerging sub-compact class, makes sense to me. So, does that mean we rename the acronyms? Sub-compact Luxury And Performance (SLAP)Compact Luxury and Performance (CLAP)I don't know - just doesn't sound good to be aspiring to get the CLAP."
March 2015,"Actually, the ILX/A3/CLA/1-series are subcompacts. Then you have your compacts (A4, C-class, 3-series, ATS), your midsize (5-series, etc), and your full-size (7-series, etc). There is the microcar class below all of that, but the luxo players haven't ventured there yet.So, yes, I agree with where I think you are going ... boards that divide by class and forget this whole pesky ""entry level"" tag, since that obviously varies by manufacturer for the time being."
March 2015,"I don't pay any attention to what category the EPA puts a car in. Heck, they classify the Bentley 12 cyl as a compact car. Don't think too many people look at one of those and say ""boy, that's a sharp compact car""."
March 2015,Some more than others.
March 2015,Well let's go back to my list and note the sizes based on EPA standards:Acura TLX CompactAudi A3 SubcompactBMW 320i CompactBuick Regal MidsizeCadillac ATS CompactInfinti Q40 CompactLexus IS250 CompactLincoln MKZ MidsizeMB CLA CompactVolvo S60 CompactThe others mentioned:Acura ILX CompactAudi A4 CompactMB C Class CompactSo differentiating by size isn't going to clear the water any....
March 2015,"I go away for awhile and look what happens....we're debating the definition of an acronym. LOL!Interesting to read, however!"
March 2015,"so split out compact entry level and mid-size entry level. still within the EL family, but recognizes different size, mission and competitiors.ILX/A3/CLA/BMW 1 class (when it arrives) would be compacts. Heck, could maybe slot in a top line Jetta! Oh wait, that is an A3... The ATS goes here too.the ""mid size"" (probably a bad term) are the A4, 3 series (320/328), Volvo, TLX, Infiniti, MB C class, etc. To further mess with your head, I don't count the HiPo models as entry level. Call them HP compact/mid-size entry level. that would be the S3/S4, M3, etc. seems logical to me. And I don't see a problem having a couple of groupings in the entry level category. The all fit the basic criteria: A premium model, with sporting pretenses and reasonable performance to back it up, and a decent level of luxury features. Basically a step up from your basic family sedans or small cars. and yes, just like with compact to midsize family sedans, there is cross-over in content, performance and price. You can load up an A3 to be fancier and more expensive than an A4, and absolutely people can cross-shop them. same with ILX to TLX,. Still within the ELLPS family.I put the CTS. E class, 5 series, etc. in the next class up. I think you called them LPS (sans EL) which seems quite reasonable.Hey, this makes sense to me."
March 2015,"I guess I'm coming 'round to the notion that -- and this is only for example purposes -- both the A3 and A4 could be called ELLPS vehicles (but if I am doing so it is kicking and screaming). This whole thing is so darned subjective though, since I still harbor the notion that (pre A3), the A4 was ELLPS (even though you can crank the S4 to close to $70K) as [because?] the A6 was an LPS.The ATS is ELLPS as the CTS is [now] LPS; as 3 series is ELLPS as 5 series is LPS.Now, when the CLA and the A3 came along (and to a certain extent the ILX) we dropped from ""regular fit,"" to ""slim,"" and then finally to ""petite"" (sort of).To some here EL is an indication of price -- but even those who go to the trouble can find the $ range for a 3 series to be from $32K to $87K. I have -- historically -- thought of the ELLPS to be mostly a smaller version of the LPS family. Meaning size seems to (in MY mind) still be a better trait than cost. Hell, for the price of my S4, I could have had a Premium+ A6, but the size would clearly differentiate them.I had not (and mostly still don't) considered the possibility of an A3 or CLA or ILX ever being considered for entry into the ELLPS class -- because of my [possibly wrongheaded] assertion that as nice (or expensive) as the [top o' the line] A3 family (which is called an S3) is, well, it is smaller than the already EL entrant, the A4.Just as we bumped the CTS to the LPS class and replaced the then ELLPS CTS with the ATS, we may -- soon -- find ourselves needing to do the same thing with the ILX and A3.Today, however, knowing only what is out there, it doesn't seem [to me] right to have both the ILX and the TLX called ELLPS cars -- just like it doesn't seem right to bracket the CLA and C Class Mercedes as ELLPS cars.It seems that base price is the hang up -- not actual price -- for we don't seem to argue that a 5 series is an ELLPS anymore than we would argue an A6 or E class is an ELLPS -- we don't because there are model designations downstream (in both size and price).We have (or the manufacturers have) blurred the lines somewhat -- and it will be another cycle before the cars are again (maybe) rationalized. An ILX is an Acura. An ILX is a tarted up HondaA TLX has much more L + P than the ILXThere is a car model, not just a badge, below the TLX -- and that is the ILX.Currently the same breakdown is applicable to the A3 and A4 -- but the new A4 will what? Blur the lines further or sharpen the focus, make the two more readily differentiated? Does anyone think the CTS and ATS are the same class of car -- even though the MSRP of the ATS can be made to significantly overlap the MSRP of the CTS.And so on.I'll settle -- internally -- for the TLX to be in the same class as the A4, 3 series and C class. I'll accept the A3 and ILX and CLA as similar classified cars. I just find it difficult to have both the A3 and A4 designated as ELLPS cars if the 3 series is in the mix -- the 3 series is marketed against the A4 and C class, not the A3 and ILX class.I'm more willing to overlook driven wheels -- but my own money would only go for an AWD vehicle knowing what I know and living in the climate I live in. This rules the ILX out -- but keeps the TLX SH-AWD firmly in the fold. This is getting difficult for me to keep straight. I love these forums, and I do not want to exclude anyone from them -- but for the sake of birds of a feather, so to speak, when I want to get into one of the forums, I'm not going to venture into the full-sized pickup truck forum since my interests are probably not going to be well served there (and vice versa).I want to hear (read) your thoughts pertaining to similar vehicles -- I'm going to gravitate toward forums where the participants are interested in and experienced with 3 series, C class, B8 Audis (A4's), TLX's Q50's, etc, etc. I don't have interest in Malibus (not that there is anything wrong with them or those who write about them) or LaCrosses or 300's or 911's or Stingrays (same). Yes a fully tarted up S3 may give rise to a legitimate question about S3's vs A4's or S4's, but generally speaking these are meant to be separate models within the Audi family.Besides, Audi will soon be rolling out the B9 A4's which will, probably, crank up both the L and the P (and the price) further differentiating the A3 and A4 lines. Mercedes, BMW, Acura, Lexus and Infiniti will almost certainly do the same thing. Well, I think Mercedes already has with the new C class compared to the new CLA class.In any case, there needs to be a place to go to discuss the cars that would appear to be competitive with each other. Yes, I guess it is possible for someone to shop for an ILX and drive out with a TLX SH-AWD Advance, just as it is possible to look at a 328 and drive out with a 335ix -- but, using the auto magazine comparison test reports as guides, it would be more typical for the A4 to be tested against the 3 series or the C class not the A3 tested against the C class and 3 series, etc.My head hurts."
March 2015,"The ""directional"" wheels on the ILX seem a little odd to me, and maybe out of place for an aspiring ELLS. I don't dislike them, exactly, but they wouldn't be my first choice. I think they're supposed to appeal to younger buyers, but for those of us old enough to remember the 80s, they seem almost nostalgic. And I wonder if the car would sell better if they just called it the Integra. In my mind, that's what I imagine the I in ILX stands for anyway...."
March 2015,The Ilx counts IMO for 2016 with the bigger engine and new trans. Plenty quick enough for the class.
March 2015,"I say the ILX counts, as well.. (though, I wouldn't choose it..).I might be a purist when it comes to driven wheels, but that doesn't mean everyone has to be..."
March 2015,"It's true that the A3 looks nothing at all like the Golf, while as much as the ILX is restyled and upgraded from the Civic, it has more trouble escaping its sibling. More than that, Audi seems to signify ""premium"" and ""prestige,"" even if a base A3 1.8 falls behind an ILX on some things while costing thousands more....No doubt about it, Acura has an image problem. I think their better products are going to slowly lure more people back into the brand, but it's going to be a slow process."
March 2015,"It's not that it's BUILT on a shared platform - as I said, most are. It's how it is perceived compared to other makes. Perhaps it's because Honda Canada commissioned a few generations of particularly awful Acura variations of the Civic that were little more than a different grille and some extra trim. Up here they are known as the Acura Civic regardless of how they're badged."
March 2015,"The Mondeo was delayed by 3 years to allow Ford to focus on ""balancing the supply and demand of its industrial footprint."" Which means they needed time to consolidate their European factories to stop the flow of red ink.I also think that it wasn't vital to launch a new Mondeo in 2012. The Mondeo then on sale was only 6 years old and the sales of executive saloons were dropping as CUV's started replacing them."
March 2015,"Sort of. As I understand it, they were engineered together as you said, but the Modeo was delayed being introduced so the Fusion/MKZ were released first.Why was the Mondeo delayed? Many opinions, but I don't know if anyone other than Ford really knows. The old version of the Mondeo was still selling well in Europe for one thing. Fitting of the 3 cylinder engines and diesel engines all seem to be possibilities. Plus they get the Estate wagon in Europe."
March 2015,"ILX is still part of a luxo brand, so I say it counts regardless of driven wheels. I mean, put it this way... So a FWD A4 is not luxo, but an AWD version that is optioned exactly the same other than the driven wheels is now luxo? Doesn't make sense to me. They will both look and feel exactly the same when cruising down the highway, which is what luxo is all about.And, as for the ILX being a tarted up Civic... if we use that as criteria, then we'd have to exclude many vehicles from this list. I think about half the luxo market is just tarted up versions of lower-ranking cousins."
March 2015,The ILX also suffers from the stigma of being perceived by many as a tarted-up Civic. Even though the competing models are also built on existing mainstream platforms. the ILX tends to suffer from that more than most.
March 2015,"Well based on my criteria of EL - base model that gets you into the brand - and get then be optioned out to give it the L and P, then the CLA is it for MB.As for the ILX, many would say the inability to have AWD as option precludes it from being an ELLPS. If it were offered with SH-AWD, then it would be the starting point.Lastly, someone noted that the Fusion and MKZ are based on the European Mondeo. That is incorrect. The current Mondeo was introduced after the Fusion and MKZ. The Mondeo is the exact same car as the Fusion and all 3 were engineered at the same time on a brand new platform."
March 2015,"The Acura ILX is about 6 inches longer than the Audi A3, and gets to 60 faster than the A3 1.8. At a little after 14 minutes in this long video Alex on Autos measures the acceleration of the ILX at 6.25 0-60, which seems to be about half a second faster than the A3 1.8. At 12:20 he talks about how Acura's 8-speed dual clutch is in some ways superior to that offered in the Audi A3. The Audi obviously has a lot more prestige, and arguably a nicer interior, but the Acura has more standard equipment—like moonroof, heated power seat, rearview camera, pushbutton start, LED headlights, etc. The A3 does have standard leather, while the base ILX has pleather. The A3 also has a better standard stereo. Overall, a comparably equipped A3 1.8 costs maybe about $4-5k more than an ILX, and yet the A3 is slower and gets lower mpg. I may be the only one, but I think if you're including the A3 1.8 then there's a case to be made for the ILX. But if you're starting with the A3 2.0 quattro, I guess that's a different story....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo9DiqFvAcU"
March 2015,"I think there is a difference between sportyish mainstream sedan, like Fusion or its plush cousin (more like stepbrother) and 328, A4, or TLX. They may not be world apart, but the separation is distinct."
March 2015,"How about C-class? Too big now, or too expensive? A4? I see, there are lower models, so they no longer need to apply. I think it is possible to have two models in same category, if they're not differentiated ad much. It does look like C-class is intended to move up, just as CTS. I think A4 is still in the class, both in size and price."

March 2015,"So adding to the fun, I'd argue that the driven wheels shouldn't matter. If the vehicle performs well and has luxury, the wheels driven are a design issue. It is the performance that counts and there are quite a few vehicles that are fwd that still have good performance - some of them even have better steering feel than the current BMW 3 series which to me is a more important indicator of a sporty vehicle. I'm not usually cornering at .9gs or doing donuts in parking lots, so the driven wheels don't matter to me so much.As far as entry level, I'd agree with previous posts - it should not be the brand, or the size, it should be *luxury* and *performance*, regardless of those other factors. You could argue that the ILX doesn't have enough luxury and/or performance, and if that is the case (not necessarily agreeing with that; only for argument), then it is the TLX which is the ""ELLPS"" for Acura since it's got a low enough price with the requisite amount of luxury and performance. And I'd also argue that some vehicle from MB or BMW, etc., might not qualify, in spite of the marquee, if the performance and/or luxury are lacking.JMHO."

March 2015,"I haven't driven a Lincoln MKZ but I understand it is has similar underpinnings to the Fusion which is based on the Euro Mondeo. Reviews of the Fusion usually put it near the top in handling for mainstream midsize cars.But you guys have answered my question......nobody can really give a good answer other than ""I don't think they handle very good"". Nobody seems to have driven one based on perception. But with 300hp, AWD and supposed decent road handling it still begs the question IMO."
March 2015,"Ah the Lincoln LS ... ""I drove Lincolns before anyone paid me to drive lincolns"" now I finally understand whats Specolis best friend ways saying. The Lincoln should be added - it's sudo lux, looks pretty cool and is under 40k- no idea how it drives but seems similar to the others -and if you add a Buick then this should be fair game."
March 2015,Of course - brain fart there. I meant the ATS will be pushed out by a subcompact Cadillac. I edited my post to reflect that.
March 2015,"Is the common thought that, for example, the A3 is an ELLPS but the A4 is not?Based on ""history,"" I would keep the A3 and A4 in separate classes of automobiles. And, how is it that both the ATS and CTS can be ELLPS, does that mean the XTS is now the model called LPS?One point of clarification, my inclusion of cars in this class that can be optioned to numbers deep into the $60K range is NOT the base price. It is the potential price if optioned.Just like the 320 can have over $15,000 of options added cranking it to just south of $48K, I was suggesting the RANGE from low to high. Most folks won't go for either end, I would assume.And, each of us brings experience to the buying of cars -- and also to our expectations of features. I cannot see a car without a backup camera, and frankly, I would think top-view is better still. It is a situation where, due to incrementalism, we get a car with, say, back up camera, and then you miss it when it is not there.Of course, it will be made mandatory by the insurance institute due to the reduction in claims, so you'd better get one sooner rather than later. Who knows: what once were vices will soon become necessities."
March 2015,"I think ATS, bigger size and increased pricing did that already."
March 2015,"I think, I agree. Never heard of anybody trying to toss it into a corner. Mr. McConaughey is shown strolling down the boulevard at quite pedestrian pace, so the intended use is quite clear. It's not wrong, but it's not sports, or performance, even withh 300 horses."
March 2015,"IMHO, it doesn't meet the criteria of being able to corner without inducing intestinal distress or the puckering of one's sphincter."
March 2015,"The ILX doesn't have the option to power the other wheels nor the upgrade the power plant.When the new 1 series sedan comes to market next year, then it will replace the 320i as the base model. Soon there will be a subcompact Caddy and that will push the ATS out of the ELLPS.IMHO, Audi and MB didn't decide Americans were ready for smaller cars. They decided that they couldn't keep the A4 and C Class that cheap."
March 2015,Good catch- that would DEFINITELY be an ELLPS- it slipped what's left of my mind...

March 2015,"I agree, but I was trying to be diplomatic and give a little leeway.BUUUTTT... what about the Acura ILX? And then there's that pesky issue of the lowest current bimmer and caddy being a class size above Audi and MB. Kind of puts those smaller ones at a disadvantage just because their manufacturers decided Americans were ready for smaller cars."

March 2015,I would certainly say so.
March 2015,Not enough P in the Lincoln?
March 2015,How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?What if 32.891% of them have an artificial leg?
March 2015,I too like that list. I would support adding the Turbo regal. Not the Lincoln though.
March 2015,"rob, i think your logic makes perfect sense and endorse your list of vehicles completely.Could we include the Buick Regal in this list? Lincoln MK-whatever the entry level model is?Though I suspect there will be dissenters; makes for a lively discussion!"
March 2015,"I'll add to the fire:ELLPS:Entry Level - what is the most basic model that will get you into the brand?Luxury - in the eye of the beholder, but can the EL be upgraded to an ELL?Performance Sedan - will it accelerate briskly, stop safely and take a corner without inducing intestinal distress?So here is my list:Acura TLX $31,445Audi A3 $29,900BMW 320i $32,950Cadillac ATS $34,210Infinti Q40 $33,950Lexus IS250 $36,550MB CLA $31,500Volvo S60 $33,950These all fit the characteristics I listed above. They all get you into the brand. They all can be upgraded with luxury goodies. They all can have their primary driven wheels upgraded to AWD and offer more potent power plants."
March 2015,"I agree. I think it's again in eye of the beholder. Those making middle six-digits (not millionaires, but elite professionals) have a completely different view on entry level luxury than those making $80K-$120K, looking for a premium ride that won't break their finances. Something nice, well above average, with this sporty slant, but within reasonable means. Mark says he can't even imagine lack of backup camera - I don't have it, I do have audible warning system with a colored map picture. I like leather on mine, but wouldn't dismiss those who like that fake stuff - apparently local Mercedes Benz dealers stock only those on their CLA, C, GLA class and even some of E-class. If people buy it, so be it. I know if I were making twice the money I do today, I'd still be buying compact/midsize, but M4/3 or RS would likely make my list. And in that parallel universe, I'd probably think it's still ""entry level""."
March 2015,"""$69,999""No way anything with a 6 in front of it should qualify as ""entry level."""
March 2015,"It will be $50K soon. 335i has now starting price of just squeaking below $45K cap, guess what it will be next year. 435 is already above $45K, both coupe and grand coupe. So, unless we disregard naming convention and not recognize 4-series as a separate model, we would have to be prepared for another price escalation. Also C400 is already above $45K. Based on a quick look, it seems the top versions of those Germans are pricing themselves out of this segment: S4 starts at $48K, S5 is $52K, C400 sedan is $48K, I'm sure the next generation coupe will me more. It's almost like there is forming a separate segment of ""entry level plus luxury sports sedans"", however oxymoronic it sounds, slotting itself in high 40s/low 50s base pricing, with options running up to $70K. One could add R-Design trim of Volvo S60 and ATS 3.6. One could easily make an argument for adding IS350 F and some may want to add top TLX, but I don't know about that. This segment would be distinguished by elevated performance bolted on essentially the same frame of their basic versions. Some additional differentiations by unique colors, interior versions, or other aesthetic treatments will separate those trims further. Then M3/4 and RS4/5 with (future C AMG) could be called ""high performance compact luxury sports sedans"". ATS-V, if finally released, will surely be aspiring to that club. This segment will mean not only separate special engines, but special solutions related to suspension, weight reduction, chassis design modifications made specifically to support the performance. They'll usually have their own colors, increased comfort features, special interior touches, on much higher level of differentiation then models above. They are in fact, their own models. Call them ""poor man's supercars""."
March 2015,"Once again, an M3 is not entry-level by any stretch of the imagination. Nobody is spending $60k thinking ""yeah, this is entry-level.""And, if it does count, then so do the 5-series, E-class, and even XF."
March 2015,"I stand corrected ANY 3XX denomination or derivative that keeps the L+P (and the 320 qualifies) does belong.Of course, that being said, the range ($) is now slightly broader.E.G,320i Sedan320i xDrive Sedan328i Sedan328i xDrive Sedan328d Sedan328d xDrive Sedan335i Sedan335i xDrive SedanEven:328i xDrive Sports Wagon328d xDrive Sports WagonAnd:ActiveHybrid 3Finally @ the top o' the BMW ELLPS pyramid, the :M3 SedanAnd we now have rounded out the range of BMW's ELLPS offerings. I suspect we would exclude the X3, since it is technically in the Premium-SUV (or in BMW-speak SAV) class of vehicles, even though it is based on the 3.The range, then (in base MSRP) is:$32,950 - $62,000, not that you could with much certainty even find a ""base"" version (without special ordering it).Just for grins: With most options/packages selected, BUT with zero (no) performance options selected, and keeping the car as a 320i RWD Sedan (not ix as more than half of them are configured) a 320i, optioned thusly has an MSRP of $47,325.My suspicion is that ""no one"" will option a 320i to $47,325 (and if they do and select ZERO performance options from the order-sheet, that would be even harder to imagine); at that point on the food chain they will, see what could be had with the ""28"" option added and a few of the ""L"" options subtracted; and hey, we're at the dealership anyway, ""ya got any 335's we could test drive?""Remember -- assuming a Cincinnati BMW dealer speaks for the US dealer body, generally -- most of these cars are leased and when sub-venting comes into play and ""fill-in-the-blank"" luxury and/or performance option or package or both are offered up for another $30 a month, well frugal shoppers turn into fanciful buyers. I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but my data point would be to note: ""most"" ELLPS shoppers don't go from whatever they used to drive to an ELLPS to give up such things as Bluetooth phone and audio integration, a backup camera and parking sensors and many other ""we take them for granted"" features they had in their nicely equipped Accords, Camrys, Nissans, and Passats just for the snob appeal (if there is any) of driving an Audi, BMW, Lexus or Mercedes.Case in point, again: The loaner Audi S4 (@$52,200) I have today doesn't have a backup camera, park assist or bluetooth iphone audio integration-- who, in the wide, wide world of sports would spend (or expect to spend) that kind of cheese and not get a backup camera, etc? If my maximum spending ability prevented me from having these ""essentials,"" I assure you I would not look at a German, I'd go Asian or American and probably not be looking at the ELLPS class. Hyundai Genesis anyone?"
March 2015,"As for the criteria for what belongs in this segment (and the fact that there is no hard and fast answer is what makes this a fun discussion), how about the manufacturers' intention? They make it pretty clear what vehicles are the intended competition, or which ones were used as benchmarks. If those include the 3-series, A4 and/or C-class, I'd say it's in the segment. Whether or not they compete well in the segment is a separate argument."
March 2015,Makes sense - particularly to the extent AWD or RWD is considered a requirement for the segment.
March 2015,"Eh, I really gotta argue for a max on base price, as you said in the first paragraph above, not range of max pricing, be the deciding factor. Otherwise, you open the door to comparison of a CTS Vsport to a base 320i, for example, as 2 ELLPS cars. Whatever it maxes out to should be largely irrelevant since different people want different options. I'm thinking either $40k or $45k as the max base price. The $45k would allow for the 335i and V6 ATS, but it would allow in the S3. The $40k would exclude the S3 but also limit the group to the 4-cyl models of the aforementioned compacts. Either pricepoint excludes the mid-sizers. I could argue either way, honestly."
March 2015,"You forgot about 320i, Mark - even more ""pauper"" version, but according to some here, still spunky enough for their taste. I don't think less than 200 hp is such a problem, if the car is still dynamic enough, so I'd add it. In fact, I'd say that one would be something like ""entry level of entry level"""
March 2015,"If pricepoint, not size + L+P, is the determining factor for inclusion in this class or nomenclature, can we safely assume that the base price of the base model is ""whatever it is"" and that all modifications to that price based on ""options and packages"" are included in the mix? This, then, means we still have to have some way to account for the ""L"" and ""P"" of the cars (and of course the L+P add both content and cost, even to the base). Perhaps we can then say that a base 3 series and a fully-optioned 335 are both ELLPS cars because they both start out at a price point of $X.My car, today, is at the Audi dealer for its 25,000 service interval. Since the dealer has a policy of ""trying"" to match the loaner they provide with the car in for service, I was provided with an S4 for the day. The thing has 1,800 miles on it and is Misano Red Pearl in color (this color is a $500 option); the car also has the B&O sound system upgrade and blind spot monitoring. As a loaner, it also happens to be one equipped with the S-tronic (dual clutch) automatic transmission.I consider this car below what I would think almost anyone, today, would go for -- but the dealer general manager says no, this car is EXACTLY the base model from a practical perspective, because ""they can't sell"" a version without some level of equipment above ""book"" entry level (what I would call a true stippie).Indeed, since the car does not have MMI, it will probably only sell because it will -- eventually -- come out of the loaner fleet and be subject to very heavy off MSRP discounting. The ""on the lot"" cars virtually all have MMI+, those that don't were probably ordered specifically without nav with the dealer knowing they would end up in the loaner fleet. You may or may not chafe at the nearly $3,500 price tag for the MMI+ system, but the take up of that option is, apparently, nearly universal, as is S-Tronic. Yet, sitting on the showroom floor there are a couple of A4's (and one of them, too, is nav-less); I would argue that the base price of these Junior-LPS cars is rarely seen by the actual buyers, since most folks do, typically, go for the ""popular"" option group. I must note, too, that one reason for the majority going with the popular option groups and/or packages is that the lease calculations FAVOR the high-content variants over the maxed out variants and the strippie variants. Some car-actuary has figured out what will retain the highest residual -- and that, these days, is medium to medium high loaded.So, if price, not size, is to be the rule of the day, I would have to submit that the price range of cars that fit the bill of ELLPS must be on the order of $39,999 to $69,999; after all it is possible to start out with a BMW 328 ""Walmart"" (or TJ Max) version and max out at a 335ix ""Bespoke"" (so to speak) and spend tens of thousands crossing the chasm from pauper to prince."
March 2015,"I used to say that the cheapest model of a brand is all that counted, but I'm thinking differently on that now. I think as long as it hits the pricepoint, it counts. So if that includes more than 1 model from a manufacturer, so be it. Reason being that not all manufacturers have more than 1 model. So just because Volvo doesn't have something smaller than the S60 at the moment, that shouldn't put the others at a disadvantage because they can only put their subcompacts up against it. I also think the price, if positioned properly, excludes the true mid-sizers such as the CTS, 5-series, E-class, and A6."
March 2015,"Just my suggestions of course. I feel like Acura's big V6 & slick AWD system do transform the car into a true competitor in the segment.I agree with you about the CTS, but some of our own have scored these cars for many thousands off sticker which brings them firmly into the price class."
March 2015,"So Bradd - only the upper model of the TLX makes the cut? Just curious. And I don't know about the CTS - it's always straddled the line between the entry-level (however we may define it) and the ""next level"" - earning comparisons to both a 3-series and the 5. With the intro of the ATS, I'd propose the CTS has been placed firmly into the 5, A6, E-class category."
March 2015,Done
March 2015,"Bradd, definitely include the Volvo S60 too."
March 2015,"I agree that entry level definitely has to meet a price point. Problem is that there is way too much over lapping within the respective companies. The ""entry level"" price points vary as well. Yes there is a big difference between the meat of this market of $35K - $50K on paper. You have to factor in the fact that the majority of these cars are leased. So many times people don't see the difference of a few thousand dollars by looking at the total cost of the lease , but rather as an extra $30, $40, $50 etc per month.The category is bigger and better than ever.Acura TLX V6 SH-AWDAudi A3, S3, A4Buick Regal GS AWDBMW 3 seriesCadillac ATSCadillac CTSInfiniti Q40Infiniti Q50Lexus ISMercedes-Benz CLAMercedes-Benz C-ClassVolvo S60"

March 2015,I know of at least one Bavaria with an S38 motor from an E28 M5 under the hood...
March 2015,"Perhaps these cars that we talk about that are in this broad broad category should be called Compact LPS, but also it might make sense to call them mid-size? Entry level and the LP designation if price is the current meaning of EL would seem to be an oxymoron -- and, if price is the meaning of EL, today, where do A3's, to name one, go? Do we ""rationalize"" the naming according to price? The Audi lineup (to name the one I am most familiar with) is A3 (and Q3), A4/A5 (and Q5), A6/A7 (and Q7). The characteristics of these that stands out first is size -- and as the cars get larger, in the progression the price does indeed escalate. But, prior to the current A3, the Audi A4/A5/S4/S5/RS5 were the ""entry level"" cars in the line. They were of a common, more or less, wheelbase length and the other notable characteristics that shared the theme were length and width -- size. The part that conveys the cost factor is the amount of the content of Land P and a ""certain something"" that somehow we all understand, but like the word ""quality"" is a bit more difficult to define. A Chevy with a 110"" wheelbase is not a member of the ELLPS club. A BMW 3 series, no matter how tarted up or down, however, is.If the bothersome two letters are EL, well that is beyond our capabilities to modify. These are smaller LPS cars, and generally they cost less than their LPS counter parts. That, I think, is why a strippie 3 and a fully loaded 335 are both ELLPS cars."
March 2015,"I second that. Entry level has a money-related conotation in every single product, job, title, service I know. The only exception I can think of would be in hobby or leisure activity, where it would mean novice, or begginer. In vehicles, M3 or S4 is not entry level in anything. It is compact, or not large, but certainly not entry level. Perhaps in some rich exclusive country club, it could, when they would need somebody else vouch for me in my lowly 328, but a M3 owner may be let in without an usher escort watching the silverware..."
March 2015,"'My first BMW was a 1973 Bavaria 3.0' - roadburner.The first 'real' sport sedan I ever drove was a BMW 2800.[ Precursor to the Bavaria. ]Straight 6, 4-speed manual trans.For many years thereafter, this defined 'Sport Sedan' for me.I would love to have a Bavaria - with the drivetrain from a BMW M235i.- RayNot likely - even if I win the lottery . . ."
March 2015,"I am with Q on this. To me, the EL is absolutely cost-dependent."
March 2015,"I wholeheartedly disagree. An entry-level job is salary-dependent, as is an entry-level house. Why should an entry-level vehicle not follow suit? If the grouping were dependent on size, the title would use car size classification and it would be called ""Compact Luxury Performance Sedans."""
March 2015,"My buddy has a very nice, well equipped BMW 5 series (circa 2003). It is probably equal to or maybe even a tiny bit smaller than a current 3 series.Where do the ""more expensive"" versions of a model go if not here -- a 335 or an S4 are certainly very very similar, dimension wise to the 3XX and A4 variant from whose loins they sprung, eh?EL is, today, a size or internal designation (not price); LPS indicates Luxury (which adds cost and sometimes great cost) and Performance (which adds costs and sometimes ooober cost). I cross shopped an A4 Prestige with most options with an S4 Premium+ with three options, because they were ""within reach"" of each other financially. I did not cross shop a maxed out A4 Sline with an RS5 (sorry there is no RS4), but had there been one to choose from, I presume I would still have considered the RS4 as an ELLPS since there is no way someone would confuse it with an A6, S6 or RS6 (or RS7 in the case of this line, since the RS6 isn't imported to the US).The sales rep I deal with told me he had ""quite a lot"" of S4's coming off lease (that would be the ones prior to the V6 supercharged version, i.e, V8's) and that a number of these customers just couldn't fathom getting an A5 class without a V8, so they went with an RS5 rather than sticking with an S5.In this class of cars, I think folks look at the size of the vehicle and determine if ""this is the size car I see myself driving"", then they begin with packages, options and accessories until they have the car customized to their liking.A fully optioned A4 2.0T Prestige with optional features is very close in price to a somewhat less decked out S4, hence my consideration of both. I assume BMW shoppers do the same thing -- they go in for the 328 and trick one out with the option sheet and then test drive a 335 with a few less options and say, ""I'm going to stick with the EL (size) but forego a bit of L for a dose of P in my 3 series Sedan. Happens all the time.My wife -- set on a Q5 3.0T Premium Plus with about 4 additional options -- test drove an SQ5. Katie, bar the door -- the 3.0T was super nice -- but the Performance of the SQ was intoxicating. She did not, however, cross shop with a Q7 or a Q3 -- she wanted the size first, performance second and luxury third. Some folks probably switch second and third -- but there is a cost regardless.Know too, that some folks (my wife included) checked out the Q5 2.0T first and was ""this close"" to the buy, until she test drove the 3.0T and was ""this close"" until she test drove the SQ, and so it goes.We choose not to afford a Macaan Turbo (which was close to $90K comparably equipped), but within the family, the choice was Q5 2.0T all the way to the SQ5 with the OMG engine."
March 2015,"Good to know. I knew it did creep up, but did not realize it was that much.same thing in the normal sedan class. A Civic today is the size of an Accord from a few generations ago."
March 2015,"Oh yes, they did. Quite a bit. Current 3-series is much bigger than mine, which in turn was much bigger then previous one. 15 years ago the 5-series was EPA classified as ""compact"". Today, it would be hard to classify the 3 series as such."
March 2015,"Dino, I think that as some of the old time models ""grew up"" (outgrew the segment?) the smaller models came in underneath to replace them. Pretty sure that an A3 is roughly the size (and mission) of the A4 from a couple of generations ago. And would not be surprised if the ILX is close to the original TSX. BMW though has not (as far as I recall) grown the 3 as much, but they are sliding the 2 in that slot, just not a 4 door."
March 2015,"i really think you gotta have that base price exclude any variants. An m3 does not belong here, IMHO. It is far from ""entry level."" So, for example, you could include both the 320 and 328 because, per my own made up criteria above, they both fall under the $40k base price cap. And by that same reasoning, you can exclude smaller top-spec cars such as the CLA AMG and S3. I mean, we aren't talking option packages here. These are different models with their own base prices."
March 2015,"$45K UPPER limit for ELLPS? I would think that the number $45 is closer to the lower limit. If we're going to say that the car should have a STARTING price of $X, well there are a lot of cars that virtually no one buys that do indeed start at $38,995, but typically go out the door at least at $5K-$8K more.I would think we're talking about a particular family of vehicles and that if we really mean LPS (as part of the acronym ELLPS), well you are indeed speaking of the entire family of 3 series from the lowest MSRP version (totally stripped, but, virtually never sold that way) all the way to the fully loaded M3. Where else would you put the M3 if not ELLPS? And, for that matter where would you put the ""typical"" 335 if not ELLPS, it certainly isn't going to fit in with the LPS cars (where the 5 series family inhabits).$45K - $65K does cover about the widest range for all the cars that are generally considered in the ELLPS family. The thing that seems likely to make the number beginning with the ""$4"" as the bottom line number is the inclusion of the L & P, there are plenty of ""S"" (sedans) out there that can be had for $45K at the upper limit, but they are generally not going to be invited into the ""LP"" club. I would assume that Cadillac actually would begrudge a Regal (a Regal GS) the key to the ELLPS washroom, if the comparison is between the Regal and the ATS. Cadillac probably wants the ATS (all variants) in the ELLPS class and the CTS in the LPS class these days. Buick, based on the test reports of the LSS (Luxury Sport Sedan) Regal GS (starting at $40,195), I would think the Regal ""family"" can probably qualify. Where it becomes a bit dicey is that the bottom of the line model probably would be considered to be quite a bit less full of the ""P"" and the ""S"" of the bottom of the line ATS. And the middle child ATS can easily swim upstream to an MSRP of $55K+ without breaking a sweat.The point, to repeat, is that the EL apparently seems, more than anything else, to represent the size of the vehicle; but the LP seems to classify the vehicle based on both luxury content and performance abilities. The range, I would think doesn't top out at $45K, frankly it probably starts north of $40K and keeps on going well into the $60's and as long as they are utilizing the same underwear (thinking of the base 3 series BMW at the bottom and the M3 at the top), going all the way into the $70s certainly isn't that much of a stretch.This is the best range of cars, features and costs there is, methinks.I'm just not interested in an Impala or a Malibu, no matter how tarted up it gets (but I think they are styled pretty nicely these days.)"
March 2015,"I've always considered ELLPS to mean a luxury automaker's entry level car in the performance category, not what is entry level dollarwise for someone's pocketbook. How could anyone possibly define that?"
March 2015,"Since the weather has improved I've been driving the 2002 and 318ti on a more regular basis. For me it is interesting and fun to experience the entry level Bimmers of 40 and 20 years ago.My first BMW was a 1973 Bavaria 3.0 that my girlfriend-now wife of 29 years-found for me back in 1983, so when I bought the '02 by accident(long story) on eBay in 2008 it really was like going home again. The 2002 is lightweight yet feels solid; all the controls are reasonably direct and the 2 liter four does it's best- but with only 100 bhp it can only do so much. Aside from an Alpine AM/FM/CD?Sirius XM head unit all the modifications on my car are period correct-E21 Recaros, Weber 32/36, Delta CD ignition, Bosch Red Coil, Bilstein HDs-so the original character of the car shines through. Even with a direct top gear it easily cruises at 80+. Grip is good but body roll can be unsettling to those used to modern levels of roll stiffness. Still, I could easily see myself using a 1973 tii(with a five speed retrofit, rotary A/C compressor, and a decent head unit/speakers) as a daily driver. No, an E10 is most definitely not for everyone, but for those it speaks to, it is a revelation.I consider the E36/5 ti to be ""The Last '02"" since it was the final BMW four seat coupe fitted with a semi-trailing arm suspension and a naturally aspirated four cylinder. Unlike the 2002, the ti is much more suitable to use as an entertaining(and economical) daily driver. It has a great HVAC system, adequate power(with a Turner/Conforti chip, at any rate), ABS, and front airbags. The only things I really miss(besides 100 extra bhp) are heated seats and wheel mounted audio controls. It weighs in some 550 pounds less than a 228i- and is 10 inches shorter. When BMW Individual was building my Club Sports they tried to make me take the ""optional"" sunroof but my salesperson stepped up and thus my car was built without a hole in the roof. For me, the car is just about perfect; light, nimble, and a ball to drive. The M42 engine does not suffer lazy driving; if you don't like keeping an engine ""on the boil"" than this definitely isn't your car. And on a winding road what shines through is the car's lack of mass. I've been reading how Mazda's new Miata will weigh close to what a 1994 Miata weighed. It would be nice if BMW started making weight reduction more of a priority. Speaking of vehicle weight, did you know that US safety standards require that the front airbags, side curtain airbags, and interior be designed to protect an unbelted 160 pound male? That's ridiculous, every state has a mandatory seat belt law, so safety systems should be engineered to protect properly restrained occupants. I'd think that would allow a significant reduction in weight and complexity. And anyway, at some point we need to let the Law of Natural Selection take its course."
March 2015,"personally, I would say its an ""either/or"" kind of statement. Its the least expensive sedan on a luxo makers shelf AS LONG AS the base price doesn't exceed $40k. I'm just throwing a number out there for starters, but the idea is that, for example, Jag's XF was previously their lowest car, and with a starting point of $50k, it doesn't qualify as ""entry level."""
March 2015,"So the question remains - did the segment move with the car models, or did the segment stayed where it is, and the models ""moved out"" of it. The former means ELLPS is now $45-$60K on the sticker, bigger in size, softer, less raw, more luxury. The latter means the ""founders"" don't qualify today by either being too expensive, too big, too soft, or all of the above. I'm sure there will be plenty of arguments both ways."
March 2015,"""Entry Level Luxury"" in this forum and others usually implied not in a lineup of the maker, but versus wallets of the potential buyers. Those ""ELL"" basically meant ""premium brand plus some, but not all latest premium features"". Something, midlevel professional with decent job could afford, as long as they didn't buy too big house, or didn't have too many other obligations. They also limited the size of the vehicle. The old X-type from Jag was in that category, but they withdrew from that market completely and now cater to what I would call ""full premium to upscale"" segment with a performance skew into it. Those sometimes were called LPS, or ""Luxury Performance Sedans""."
March 2015,"Well, 10 years ago it was probably the 328i and g35 as the definitive examples. So extrapolate that and see what you get!"
March 2015,"Tough to define this sector, definition could be quite broad. I imagine one would have to parse each manufacturer to determine which model is their ""entry level."" And, then is it luxury and performance DNA? For example, in my distant outpost in the universe known as ""Jaguar,"" I drive the current entry level Jag, the XF. Is it entry level by definition here? Well, if E, 5, and A6 variants are, then yes. IMHO, it certainly has luxury and performance, but is never mentioned here. And, a few years ago, would a BMW 3 really be ""luxury?"" Mercedes Benz was luxury, BMW covered performance and perhaps Audi was the only marque that could be included here, combining luxury and sport.Blurred lines, but from the C&D review, the answer is Jaguar XE. Beam me up, Sir William..."

March 2015,"Funny thing about BMWs move upscale; my dealer has a 2011 335i manual SP that I''m considering. I pulled up the Car and Driver test of that car and compared it to their test of an M235i manual. The E90 sedan is three inches longer and weighs only 24 pounds more. The E90 also has a bit better F/R weight distribution- 51/49 as opposed to 52/48 for the F22. Standing start and in-gear acceleration times are virtually identical(and adequately quick). The M235i holds a slight edge in steady state cornering and braking, which I'm virtually certain is due to the E90 wearing Bridgestone Potenza RE050A I RFTs and the F22 being fitted with ""go flat"" Michelin Pilot Super Sports- I can vouch for the Michelins; I run 225/45-18 PSS on my Mazdaspeed 3 as my summer/track tire and I always run out of courage before I run out of grip.It's interesting how much difference a few years makes with respect to perception..."
March 2015,You have 4 hours .. use the gear icon.
March 2015,"How do you remove a mistaken post completely? I had this one posted on a wrong forum, didn't know how to take it out, so I edited it into this question."
March 2015,"Now I see my mistake, at last. It was supposed to be G35/37, not G50. Sorry for the mixup. So, I meant to say G35 in its first and second generation were closest to ELLPS in their nature in last 10-15 years. BTW, I new about the rebadging to Q40, but formally G37 it is no longer with us."
March 2015,The G35/37 have been rebadged as the Q40. Still available at your local Infiniti dealer.
March 2015,Not anymore. Hence the past tense.
March 2015,"""Infiniti G50""Do they sell this in the here- USA?"
March 2015,"And it always is the same - majority of voices have ""fantasy land"" assumptions, from wrong pricing to features, mostly due to lack of recognition in market changes. So from one side saying that $70K+ M3 is an ""Entry Level"" , to another being completely in denial on how much prices rose in last 20 years ($40K ""all in"" won't even buy you sport suspension on some of those ""performance sedans""). Then somebody else says A3 is not ""good enough"" for the luxury part of the definition. Classic eat the cake and have it, too. As I wrote before, to me ELLPS doesn't exists anymore. Its original purveyors (3-series, A4, C-class) moved on to chase higher sales volumes from people with thicker wallets, their imitators moved into those leftover niches, but with their own philosophies and the category was stretched and fragmented. Basically, any given version of those original brand cars has to lose one of the letters. Their true sports luxury versions are no longer entry level, as they cost easily over $50K, sometimes even $60K, their ""entry sports"" versions lack some features found in $15K Kia or Hyundai, which makes one wonder about the luxury part. The market fragmented into too many sections and subsections for that category to be distinct. Anything that size now can fit. The closest model to true ELLPS in last 10 years, IMHO, was probably Infiniti G50, especially in its first couple of generations. The engine and suspension made it ""performance"", pricing made it ""entry level"", standard leather and other stuff made it luxury. I'm not saying it was the best car for the money, but I think it was closest to the definition of that category."
March 2015,funny how we have this discussion seemingly every 6 mos or so.
March 2015,"$45 now? Damned, I got left behind by entry level now? I would have gone with $35K base (before the crazy options). Maybe 40k ""all in""My list? A3 2.0/A4 base, Volvo S60, Acura TLX, BMW 320i/328, Infiniti (Q50? they lost me with their model names), maybe a VW GLI loaded up, lexus IS, Benz CLA (C class still qualify with the new model?), Caddy ATS, Buick regal turbo."
March 2015,Acura?
March 2015,none.
March 2015,I gotta ask - which Porsche model retails for under $45K and is a sedan?
March 2015,"OK...if we're setting rules...$45K MSRP upper limit? Audi, BMW, Buick, Cadillac, Infiniti, Lincoln, Mercedes, Porsche, Volvo are the brands?"
March 2015,"I agree the 335 could not be included becSue it's not entry level same with s4.. Ie cheaper . The ""el cheapo"" (not my term), a3, buicks whatever, ilx, maybe the 328 and lower a4, the infini g37, Volvo s (or whatever it's called, weird dash) - I think price has to be included. The Lexus IS ""el cheapo"" 250 should only be included if you want a passionless car. Performance and Price right- ???"
March 2015,"This is why the definition of what a ELLPS really is, each one of us has out own criteria, we have beat this topic to death... But I do think there is a blurring line between ELLS and ELLPS at times."
March 2015,"I still can't grasp a $50K car (or more) qualifying for the EL piece (entry level). Which is why an S4 to me is not in the class. An A3 (or A4) could be. a 320i, yes, a loaded 335? no."
March 2015,"One response: concerning the IS but not the ES. The P in ELLPS (and LPS) stands for? Performance. There is nothing about the ES that could even remotely be called ""performance"" if the assumption includes the ability to (quoting my wife) ""go like a snake in a rat hole."" The ES can't even go like the rat in the metaphor if you axe me.The possible reason for [my] not including some of the cars in the fold is that they don't offer much ""L"" or ""P"" or not enough to notice. The Buick Regal, was an oversight on my part -- since it can be somewhat low on the P side, but so can an A4 or a 3 series -- I do think the ATS is a better GM example of something that can be included as a full on ELLPS, but I think I will give the Regal at least the designation as a Near-ELLPS.The action, today, does seem to be in the realm of things that can be called ELLPS or NELLPS -- sure there are better Luxury cars and better Performance cars than those that fit into the universe of ELLPS offerings; but if you have a $45K-$65K car-buying budget, your choices are both deep and wide in the ELLPS designation.Since LPS cars, these days, seem to have a plus size requirement, I am less and less tempted by the LPS models out there. I do wish my S4 was a bit bigger, but the A6 occupies just way too much real estate these days. I am hopeful the next gen B's from Audi (B9) figure out how to be about 10% bigger overall.But, I wouldn't kick an S6 outta bed for eatin' crackers -- hell, I'd even bring the crackers."
March 2015,"If the ELPps is supposed to be entry level you can exclude most mentioned above. The said above companies are using lower letters /numbers for a reason. A3,ats, ILX- sure others I think need to be adjusted - price should matter along with what the manufacturer is telling you."
March 2015,Agree 100%.
March 2015,"There's a confluence of car brands that are starting to blur the lines of ELLS.Where previously, it was defined by a 3 series, BMW has been attacked on all sides with worthy (and sometimes better) competitors. Throw in the C Class and A4 for good measure.Can you really say that a Dodge Charger with a honkin' Hemi with probably the best GPS in the biz, real leather, all the safety gizmos on the planet can't really be considered a compettor to an M3? Just because the Dodge is less expensive, does that mean it isn't built as well, using as good or better materials than the German rivals? It seems Mercedes is trying to convince everyone that their vinyl is somehow superior to leather. Nice try, but I've felt it, smelled it, sat on/in it. It's not as good as leather, regardless of what the marketers say.I think it's expanded. Buick could sneak in there. Acura TLX? Sure. ILX? Debateable. Q50? Yep. Q40? Well, that's just a renamed G, which is well past its expiration date.Lexus IS? Why not? ES? Sure. NX? CT? Not so sure about those last two.ATS? That's the ELLPS darline right now, so that's definitely in.A4\S4...Yep!A6/CTS/E Class/5 Series? Probably slotted above any of those that have already been mentioned.I don't even know anyone....even a remote someone...who owns an Infiniti M. So, not so sure that should be included.Again, blurred lines."
March 2015,"Buick Regal GS and Lincoln MKZ?  Buick is more a premium brand as it stands below Cadillac but Lincoln is surely recognized as the luxury division of FoMoCo.  Dodge is certainly not a luxury brand but Chrysler could be considered, like Buick, a premium brand but wouldn't be considered a luxury brand.  Just because a car has a bunch of electronic bells and whistles and stitching on cheap leather doesn't make it a luxury brand.  Many cars are luxurious to a degree but it doesn't make the brand a luxury brand.  Most people don't perceive Hyundai and Kia to be equal to Chevy or Ford let alone be considered a luxury brand.  Granted, they may be equal to Chevy and Ford at this point but the majority perception IMO doesn't put them there.  Perception is reality in the world we live in.  What are not ELLPS?  2dr hardtops(Mustangs, etc) and SUVs/CUVs(Q5s, etc.)."
March 2015,"Could I ask the question: what (now, today) is an ELLPS?I assume the following are likely / usual suspects, eh?Acura TLX (and the TL from X number of years backwards); ILX, not yet, TSX was a mistake to include previously, so no.Audi A4/S4, allroad, and possibly the Q/SQ 5 derivatives and this includes anything under the heading B8 (and soon to be B9 designation); can't figure out if the A3/S3 has any halo effect, yet, that would allow it to be included.BMW 3's of all flavors and iterations (which would, by definition include M's), and the X3, not sure about the X1Cadillac ATS -- all variations; CTS excluding the current generation/iteration (or is that wrong?)Infiniti Q50's all variants; previous gen, too.Lexus IS (all variants)Mercedes CLA's and C class (all variants) -- not sure about the CLA'sVolvo ""X"" 60's -- all of them, S60, XC60, etc.My buddy thinks KIA and Hyundai also offer viable entrants into this group -- at this point, I do disagree, We may have such an active board due to the fact that we continue to have such a wide, er, tolerance of brands.Eh?"
March 2015,"Back when Erik Wensberg was BMW M Brand Manager he told me a story about a 5 speed E36 M3 that had been flat bedded into a dealership. The owner-whose previous car was an Oldsmobile-said he was simply ""driving down the interstate at 65 mph when the car just died"". Unfortunately for the owner(and his wallet), the DME was interrogated and it revealed a final engine speed in excess of 9000 rpm. Missing a shift is seldom cheap..."
March 2015,"He told me there are at least 3 levels of information stored in the car's computer. The first level that you can basically read through the car's OBC, the second that requires the dealer's proprietary equipment, and a 3rd that only regional reps can access. Even with what they could read, the car had been logging all instances of boost going beyond stock limits. He was pretty sure the regional rep could get much more detailed info than that. After they read the car, he came right back and said ""OK, so you obviously have a tune. Which one?"" D'oh!! But, like I said, he was cool about it."
March 2015,"Well, that's cool. I'd get it in writing, though. It is one thing to have a factory-authorized tune installed by the dealer, and another to do it yourself at home, regardless of the programming parameters. Upping the boost is but a portion of the big picture."
March 2015,"Aaah! With such a slow couple days on the Chronic Car Buyers forum, I found everyone was over here! I used to frequent this forum ages ago, but just haven't found my way over here for awhile.Nice discussion on BMWs - old and new.As many of you know from the CCBA forum, I've had 3 5-series (and 5 3-series - isn't that funny?  ) - an E39, an E60 and most recently, an F30. The E39 and E60 were manual transmissions - a 2002 530i sport and a 2007 530xi. Loved both - still miss and regret a bit giving up the E39. I don't have the experience or knowledge to speak intelligently about what makes such a car feel the way it does (like @roadburner and others here), but I do ""get it."" I went into the F10 knowing what it was, and what it wasn't. I certainly wasn't expecting anything like the E39. I loved the styling (particularly with the M-sport package), the pull of the engine (535i) and the comfortable and luxurious ride. In the relatively short time I had it, I appreciated those attributes for my long commute. But, alas, my yearning for something with more feel to it (not to mention the manual transmission), won out and I bought my Mazda3 a couple weeks ago. The look on my friends and co-workers' faces when I say I traded in my BMW for the Mazda is priceless. They're used to me trading out cars on a regular basis, but this switch just has them speechless. I kind of have my response down pat at this point - ""I appreciate all kinds of cars, and was missing a sportier feel, manual...etc. etc."" They feel better when I say I already have my next BMW picked out, but need to wait a couple years for it to come down in price."
March 2015,"You are probably right. I drive a little more than 20K per year. Once you start figuring out leases with that kind of mileage, they start to not look so cheap anymore. I'm not completely opposed to leasing either given the right circumstances. I know my wife for instance DOES NOT like driving her Pilot. She does maybe 12K per year. I'm sure once her truck is paid for in a few years and the principle is paid down on my Legacy, she's going to want something. So I could always lease her something nice (like an E-Class, BMW 5er, or Lexus GS) and then buy it out for myself once the Legacy starts to get up there in mileage."
March 2015,"HA! You are 100% right my friend! Between the lease question board, the Incentives & Rebates menu under the Car research tab this is a very dangerous place for me to be hanging out! I also qualify for USAA rebates now too so that adds fuel to the fire. As long as I stay away from the dealership, then I'm OK."

March 2015,"Precisely.I've said this in the past more than once, but wanting a lighter and more nimble car that communicates what is going on at the contact patches does not make one a Luddite(as an aside, I design, install, and calibrate 7.1 Home Theater Systems for fun-Dolby Atmos next-and I also repair my own PC or laptop 99% of the time,). If there wasn't a market for those cars the Miata, the Boxster/Cayman, the CTS V/V Sport, the GTI, the 2 Series, and the M3/4- to name just a few-would be dying on the vine. I do think BMW knows exactly what it is doing- forcing the enthusiasts to move up the food chain to get cars that actually feel like a BMW from just five years ago. A few months ago I discussed this same issue with Jamie Kitman of Automobile And Sam Smith of Road and Track, and both agreed that it is more than a bit cynical to make customers pay extra in order to get a BMW that drives like a BMW should.I suppose the question should be, ""What makes a BMW a BMW? If the roundel and the Hofmeister kink become the only things that distinguish a BMW from other cars, Munich will eventually pay the price."
March 2015,Ray I have had many Chargers and Challengers as rental and ever since the 8 spd was installed and some of then newer tweeks they have become good cars.. Enjoy
March 2015,"I'm glad you like the X1, which you could have gotten for about the same price as your current care, but the X1 is just WAY too small for me, being 6 ft there is no back seat room."
March 2015,"Having spoke to my SA about this and the coding the SA informed me that BMW is aware of BMS, and the 3+ lbs of boost, it is within the limits that BMW has built into the car, Dinan now offers something for the N26/20 engine which add's 4+ lbs of boost, so I guess that is within the limits of the engine too. When it comes to undetectable codes I can only go by what I have read by many on bimmerfest,"
March 2015,"I'm a bit confused. You agree but disagree?? Unless you meant to say it does NOT void the warranty, in which case I'd like to know how you determined that. I mean, technically it does not automatically void the warranty .... but if you have any engine issues, they can deny claims based on the modification. And the folks who claim the tune can be turned off an undetectable are misinformed. Been there, done that. Luckily I had a service advisor who was willing to keep that bit of info off his report to the manufacturer when my 135i needed work."
March 2015,"This is true. I don't have any first hand knowledge. Don't get me wrong, I do think it is cool that you modified your 320i. I'm still sticking with my position that I'd take an X1 for basically the same money with the 240 hp (from the factory) version of the N20."
March 2015,"Since I decided against an S3 a while back, I have rarely been to this forum. As usual, I find Markcincinnati’s posts thought-provoking. He mentions BMW [ I had one ] ‘the good old days’ [ I was there ] and steering feel, among other things. I decided this time around to select a 2015 Dodge Charger R/T with Premium package. I will waste no time trying to fit this vehicle into whatever y’all have decided is the current definition of the ELLPS category. [ It certainly has a level of Luxury and Performance – and it is a Sedan. ]I did look at & drive BMWs [ M235i ] and the S3 [ really nice ] but decided not to go that way, this time.The focus and the execution of the Dodge is quite different than those models typically discussed here. It DOES, however, have good steering feel [ IMHO - electric assist, but well done ] and with the 5.7L V8, it has a very ‘good old days’ feel to the acceleration. I will leave it there, for now – and check in periodically.Perhaps next time, I will be in the market for an ELLPS.- RaySeduced by the Hemi’s TQ this time around . . ."
March 2015,It's called the lowest common denominator -- mass appeal.Include me out.
March 2015,"Brad, it does void the warranty, and when you write info like that without having first hand knowledge only adds more issues."
March 2015,"The fact that I -- to this day -- love manual transmissions and that you ""and others on the more enthusiastic side"" like the ""quality"" that the car under discussion possesses (an older model BMW) makes us, perhaps, nothing more than sentimental, not necessarily correct in our critiques. ""It used to be better when -- fill in the blank -- was the rule of the day,"" is a perspective. It is, apparently, a perspective that is no longer a prudent point of view, however. The reason is, of course, that BMW and all the other successful brands are doing everything, perhaps anything they can to retain and gain market share. I do believe that today's buyers are actually as enthusiastic, perhaps more so than those of yesteryear. Actually saying that and seeing it in ""print"" is very difficult, but I do believe it is true.If, on the other hand, the companies that progressively and steadily abandon manual transmissions, steering feel and all the other things we unintentional (and unaware and in denial) Luddites rail on about (when we speak about the good old days from a position on high) somehow all fail, well then we can say ""I told you so.""Look at the income statements (where and when they are available) of these companies -- if revenue goes up after some period of time after the manual transmission is more or less abandoned, etc, well there is at the very least a strong correlation that those of us who decry the current in favor of the past, are wrong.As I recognize (and usually don't much care for) about myself: I am often wrong, but never uncertain.We need to embrace the changes -- I would venture to guess that many, probably most of the changes we complain about are for the better.Of course, I am certain.Of course."
March 2015,@flightnurse - add the BMS Stage 1 which gets you 3 psi more boost & a voided warranty. Advantage 328i
March 2015,Back to renta car talk above....I think I would of went with the Buick - imagine being the guy with the Buick.....helmet in hand ..Sirius 50's station blasting
March 2015,The 320i has been dynoed and it was putting 180 to RW... This was done by Terry at BMS. Then add the BMS Stage1 which add's 3 lbs of boost you are talking about 220 RW. Right about where the 328i is at.
March 2015,"""but to me base BMW 320i with the 6 speed manual and few or no options seems somewhat appealing""I agree, but if you are going to go that route, you might as well go for a 328i with the extra hp/torque so at least your car is fast. You'll also have to special order something like that and wait 12 weeks for it. Or you could do European delivery..."
March 2015,"It's not as simple. Generally, ""like"" vehicle does exactly mean size and arguably some comfort feature content, one could also argue for safety, but that's about it. The other party liability should do reasonable effort to allow you maintaining your lifestyle without much disruption, so if your lifestyle includes some leisure activities requiring driving, then they should in theory compensate for that, but I doubt any jury or court would be too sympathetic for weekend going 100+ mph somewhere. Moreover, are you really insured for going on track in your own contract? I'd check that, if I were you - if you hit something or somebody during such an event, you may be unpleasantly surprised by exclusion on your own insurance contract. So, if you are not even insured for that under your own contract, I can see the liable party easily weasel out of their obligation, at least their insurance. Perhaps you could sue the actual party, but good luck with that, too. It would surely do for an interesting legal precedent."
March 2015,"Now insurance covers a rental vehicle for usually a set amount $30/ day or $50/ day. That is going to pretty much get you whatever car they want to give you. Now I know for a fact, as others have said here that most rental car companies have some sort of premium collection or dream collection that would have allowed you to rent a BMW, MB, Porsche, Corvette for a premium over the $30 or $50 per day. I don't think it is reasonable to expect an insurance company to provide you with a car to be raced on a track. I also don't think it is reasonable to expect a V6 powered Camaro with an Automatic transmission (from a rental fleet no less) to perform at any level other than a pace car on the track. I could be wrong (it happens a lot) and truth be told, I've never taken any of my cars to the track. Although I did recently have all the necessary fluids (oil, brake, trans, differential) fluid along with new front pads and rotors changed on my wife's 2011 Pilot. Maybe I should bring it up to LR and see what it can do:)I don't carry rental insurance given the limitations and lack of use it would receive from me. This was a 3rd party claim, and the 3rd party insurance is obligated (legally arguable, but I think I'd win in court) a ""like"" vehicle. A like Vehicle to the S4 would be an M3, C63 AMG, 335is, ATS-V, cTS-V. Usually those vehicles command $$$$$ to rent.Given the guy was underinsured, I was warned to mitigate my costs, and so I settled on a ""premium"" rental at $38/day. Given it was Hertz's insurance side, there's like an electric fence between insurance rentals and the exotic sport or whatever they want to call them rentals. Apparently, insurance companies don't believe you should be given a ""like"" vehicle unless ""like"" just means in size. Either that, or they don't believe premium sports cars are ever involved in accidents I was willing to pay lots MORE for an upgrade for the 3 days I needed it for the track weekend. I even agreed to pay $75 extra per day (of my own money in addition to the base agreement) over 3 weeks before the event, and still, they couldn't come up with anything worthy. They claimed the C250 was $75/day, but when I needed it, it wasn't available. Hertz is incompetent. Next time I'll just make another contract with another company and let the $38/day car sit idle for 3 days."
March 2015,Have you ever dealt with Oxmoor Hyundai? They probably have a $9000 Mop 'n Glow ADM sticker to spring on the hapless customer...
March 2015,Ditto for my Mazdaspeed 3.
March 2015,"As we all know, Hyundai not surprisingly has had some trouble selling its luxury models. An extreme example is found at my local dealer, which still has one last 2013 (!) Genesis, which I think is a demo. Not surprisingly, they are offering a huge discount on it of almost $11,000. They are also offering $8k off msrp on some 2014s. The 2013 is a fully loaded Genesis 5.0 V-8 ""R-spec"" model with all the options, and it can be yours for just $37k. I guess it's lot of car for the money....(maybe too much?):http://oxmoorhyundai.com/New-2013-Hyundai-Genesis-50-R-Spec-Louisville-KY/vd/16737294The other Hyundai dealer in town has a new 2014 Genesis with the 3.8 for $8.5k off of list, giving an internet price of $27,634. There are some Sonatas on the lot that cost more than that....http://hyundaioflouisville.com/New-2014-Hyundai-Genesis-38-Louisville-KY/vd/19882870"
March 2015,"Gotcha. I remember your S4 getting hit, fixed, fixed again, & fixed some more. You fought hard (as you should have) to have your car rebuilt back to Ingolstat factory specs as was the right thing to do given that it was 4 months old and still brand new.Now insurance covers a rental vehicle for usually a set amount $30/ day or $50/ day. That is going to pretty much get you whatever car they want to give you.

March 2015,"When I test drove the IS350 F sport, I've mentioned that I liked it quite a bit. But, like my previous TL, you have to spur it a bit into the upper revs to get any torque.The Turbos/SC motors alleviate that. Plus, with twin turbos and twin scroll turbos, you don't have any noticeable turbo spool up lag.They've come a long way.BTW....got a note from my BMW dealer stating they want my 2011 335ix in trade, stating they'll make me an unbelievable offer for it.They're a little slow when it comes dealing with me. That car was gone two cars ago."
March 2015,"Now that's funny . It is also sad  That (lack of) steering feel is one of reasons I'm not in a big hurry to get a new one. I probably will, eventually, maybe even sooner than later, as my car is going out of warranty in six months and I also like some of the aspects of this new 435i GC, but I'm just not nearly as enthusiastic, as I should be - and the one chief reason is that steering. Every time I get into it and back into my car, I just can't believe how much they messed it up. BTW, it's not about the car not going, where it needs to - it actually does, quite well. Probably all the electronics help it correct when you turn the wheel too much. But it's like a video game, not a real car. Some may actually like it, cornering with one finger on the wheel, I don't."
March 2015,"The BMW 320i has 180 hp, while the 328i has 240 hp. I wondered what differences in the engine could account for that 60hp, but according to this article probably the biggest difference between the two models is in the engine software:http://www.bimmerfest.com/news/670647/f30-320i-vs-328i-engines--part-number-comparison/I know it's completely against where the market is going, but to me base BMW 320i with the 6 speed manual and few or no options seems somewhat appealing. It's closest, anyway, to what a BMW 5 series was 30 years ago, except it's a lot safer and has less steering feel.. MSRP in white with Sensatec comes to $33.9k."
March 2015,"I recently rented a BMW 328, admittedly a low end model, and I was very unimpressed by the steering feel. Frankly (and seriously), our 2007 Mazda 5 microvan has much better steering feel than that BMW did."
March 2015,So what you are saying is that the Camaro (at least that model) isn't really a sports car but a poser car. I concur.
March 2015,".

Hertz rents the Hertz Mustang GT as well as C7 or the Camero SS, I know they have them at the airport location, so if you really want a fun for that weekend, I would have taken one of them. I know when I flew into San Diego, I was always temped to just one for the few days I was going to be in town."
March 2015,"Why on God's Green Earth? I'll tell you why Some idiot in a Lexus RX 350 sidelined my 4-month old S4 by darting out of a parking lot (in an apparent left turn at exactly the wrong moment when I was going straight; colliding his front left with my front right).He sidelined my S4 with less than a month to go for a track weekend, a track weekend I didn't want to miss being that I had missed the previous one with the club for other reasons. Hertz (insurance rental) didn't do me any favors, in fact, they pretty much sabotaged my plans, and nearly (after over 3 weeks advance warning and notice) put me in a Buick Lacrosse. Given the choice between a Camaro RS V6 and the Buick, well, it was no choice at all. Really, they should have saved the C250 Benz for me. Most people at the track said a Focus would have been more fun to drive. I didn't end up having much fun, as the Camaro is too heavy. Next time I'll specify a Focus."
March 2015,"2.0t rut ro ????? Drama killing me. (As mentioned) I would alos like to add the turbo and ""super"" chargers have made engines more lovable- the audi I drive gets 28/29 on long hugh way runs and can stay with any American standard V8. It's also quiet when not pushed and luxo like on runs to the grocer. Cars are Better now - [non-permissible content removed] load more money too"
March 2015,"To shift gears a bit(no pun intended), I hope to do a bit more instructing this year. I find it helpful to read/re-read some of the classic books on track driving. I decided to start with Piero Taruffi's The Technique of Motor Racing. It was first published in 1959, but the basics of high performance driving(and the laws of physics) remain constant. It's not for everyone- Taruffi uses lots of equations and diagrams to illustrate basic and advanced driving principles. On the lighter side, the vintage pictures of F1 and sports car races at various tracks are entertaining as well. And as far as driver safety goes, things have moved on a bit, as there is some discussion of leather helmets as well as the pros and cons of wearing seat belts in an open car. All in all, I still find it to be a valuable read.Recommended."
March 2015,"I've never said it's an awful car, but it does lacks a quality that used to be standard issue across the entire BMW model line. And it's a capability that I-and others on the more enthusiastic side of the automotive spectrum-think is an important facet of the driving experience. You don't, and you like your F30. That's understandable, but don't get yourself in a lather when some of us are less than enamored with the platform's driving dynamics- especially when it is fitted with the base suspension.."
March 2015,"After 25K miles no issues with steering, I guess myself and the other 500K people who have a F30 are just lucky we haven't gotten into an accident.."
March 2015,No.....!
March 2015,"Exactly!What, exactly, befell the new 535i? Steering feel. Rather, lack of steering feel. The new electric power assist has not only rendered the steering uncommunicative—particularly on-center—but, for some reason, it has also become heavier. When you can’t determine road textures and slip angles and how hard those 19-inch Goodyear run-flats are working, you lose confidence if the roads are damp and as kinked as week-old spaghetti. Car and Driver July 2011There are actually more than a few drivers who want to know what the front wheels are doing; if that's not a priority then the F30 is an excellent choice."
March 2015,Thats right the steering in the current BMW is so bad that no one can tell what is happening with the front wheels with the whole lack of feedback.
March 2015,"Wrong, I actually like the 2 Series, the M3/4, and the B6- as well as the X1. And yes, I do like my son's truck; when I drive it I can actually tell what is going on at the contact patches."
March 2015,"When it comes to non turbo charged cars, I agree, but when you have a force feed engine, displacement doesn't always mean weak.."
March 2015,Is that a misprint? 2.0T??
March 2015,"I think people like to stir the pot... We have car's that are faster, safer, and get better MPG then we had 10,20,30 years ago, but to call a car that can do 0-60 in 5 sec's, the 1/4 in high 14's and still get 30 on the highway is incredible. As I wrote people use to drool over my 302, but show up in a 2015 Mustang GT and those same people would walk away from the 2015 and stand next to the 1970 302 and say, this is a real muscle car... Roadburner is the same thing, anything new BMW is junk, he loves his son's X3 because it is older.."
March 2015,"I disagree. My 3.6L TT CTS has quite a bit more torque than the 5.0L Mustang does, and over a wider RPM band, too. While that Coyote V8 sounds great, runs smooth, revs nicely, etc, I always felt it was a bit weak in the low RPM range.Check out Edmunds dyno of the CTS Vsport"
March 2015,"It does indeed. But, when a motor with displacement of only 2.0L and offers nearly 300 ft/lb of torque, have to admit, that's impressive. Actually, the torque figures are better than those found in the 3.6L V6 motor they also use."
March 2015,"Well torque relates to cylinder displacement, not the number of cylinders, so you could in fact have a very torquey 4 cylinder motor, but building one over 3.0L is not advisable."
March 2015,Why on Gd's Green Earth would you rent a V6 Camaro with an Automatic Transmission and take it to the track? The auto enthusiasts that track their cars are so few and far between that they barely register on manufacturers' radar. You want a Camaro suited for the track? You local Chevrolet dealer will gladly sell you a Z/28 Camaro.
March 2015,"I concur....I think the prevalence of all these blown motors excel once you get them rolling. Even from a dead stop, they have come to the point where there is no turbo lag because of twin turbos and twin scroll turbos. S/Cs are even better.All of these high technology motors with DI, OHC/DOHC, turbo/SC, etc have come ot the point where they're all pretty impressive given the power AND efficeincy they offer.I know the 2.0T in my current CTS can hold court with the ;05 Mustang GT I had some years ago. By my seat of the pants, they certainly felt similar in the thrust dept. Handling, comfort, fuel efficiency, features, build quality and materials....no contest. Caddy wins....as it should. In real world $$$$$ it was $15K more than the Mustang (maybe a little less than that, given the differences in today's dollars vs dollars 10 years ago.On the other end of that spectrum, the old adage ""there's no repacement for displacement"" still rings true....especially in the torque dept. I wouldn't mind some seat time in a new Mustang GT or a Challenger Scat Pack!"
March 2015,"As I said, the goalposts have moved, 13 second quarters can now be achieved in many cases with a mildly modified hot hatch."
March 2015,"As I said, under 10 was impressive. I'm thinking more pedestrian vehicles."
March 2015,"I think if GM wants to be treated seriously by most buyers they are going to have to make cars that don't go into limp mode at a weekend HPDE (track event) when they are extremely low miles and unmodified such as the V6 Camaro I rented. The weather was mildly warm, never got above 85 degrees the whole weekend. Granted, you might say the V6 Camaro with an automatic transmission isn't GM's front running ""track car,"" but neither is the '06 A3 for Audi, and it NEVER went into limp mode at low miles or being left unmodified. Even modified and higher miles it usually only happened at temps above 90 degrees. Now why would GM make cars that so easily are put into ""limp"" mode? The answer lies in previous model year rental Camaros likely BLOWING brand new transmissions and spewing fluid on the track. Solution to most car companies would be to build a better more reliable durable car with a better transmission. Solution for GM (post BK by the way) was to apparently create and/or lower threshold of going into limp mode. FAIL."
March 2015,"Back in the day, no one ever talked about 0-60 times. It was always quarter mile times. I had a 69 Charger 440, which could get in the 13's with street tires, and in the 12's with slicks. That was pretty d___ quick for a daily driver in those days. I remember when Car and Driver did a road test of the AC Cobra 427 (1966?). They did 0 to 100 back to 0 in 10 seconds. (I think I'm remembering that correctly.) I thought that was the epitome of performance."
March 2015,"That is a good point, since flexibility-as you note-is also an important performance parameter. It's one place my MS3 really does shine; stock it did 50 to 70 mph in sixth gear in 6.7 seconds, and the minor tweaks to my car have dropped that time to 5.9 seconds- a fairly low number that not many cars can match.Contrast that with my Club Sport; which needs to be kept above 4,000 rpm to make reasonably rapid progress. The Bimmer actually made me a better driver as there's not enough horsepower to cover up mistakes such as over-braking or blowing a corner. Horsepower can cover up a multitude of sins; it's harder for a student to ""get it"" when his first HPDE car has a lot of power and grip. I once had a B student who-driving a mildly modified E46 325i shod with R-comps-lapped an E46 M3, E92 M3, EVO VIII, and 993 in her run group. More than once. Talk about a humbling experience."
March 2015,"Like in my Prelude. Loafing along at 70 in 5th & need to pass? Drop down to 3rd & up shift back up to 4th at 80;)The Legacy gets the job done. It's far from the fastest car on the road, but it doesn't complain when I floor it at 70 to pass a slow roller and it has to hit 90 to get by:)"
March 2015,"European magazines have additional additional tests, not known here, such as equivalent of going from 40 to 60 mph, or 50 to 75 mph on on highest, or second highest gear to assess flexibility of the engine, as well as its performance. This was especially important for manual transmission cars, to get you feel how much you need to operate that stick."
March 2015,Would say this 0-6O just a measure - real world passing is where its at on the highway - being able to just blast the gas at 45 and loook down and see 65/70 in a blink is where its at. Did it today just to get around slower traffic: gonzo - pretty good 2/3/5/7 seconds (dk.)
March 2015,"I kinda doubt one would even feel the difference between a 4.5 car and a 5.0 car. To me, radical speed is something like the Ariel Atom, which is under 3 seconds and probably feels completely different from a 4.5 car."
March 2015,"Agree with your assessment. I've driven a friend's F10 ///M5. The car was insanely fast, yet utterly uninspiring. I've told him a few times that the ///M5 wasn't ""the car"" to buy at the $130K price point. He couldn't swing (or should I say, his wife's trust fund woudn't allow) the $150K plus for a Panamera Turbo and wouldn't drive a ""regular"" Panamera 4S because it wasn't the fastest ""top of the line"" model."
March 2015,"I'd say that was true in the '70s, but not in the '80s or '90s. My 1988 M6 could do 0-60 in the high 5 second range with a Dinan or Conforti chip. The 325i and 535i were 7 second cars, easy. The Mustang GT and Z28 were also 6 second cars by the late '80s."
March 2015,"You know, we've got it pretty good. In the 80's and early 90's, a 0-60 of under 10 seconds was IMPRESSIVE."
March 2015,"Same here; it really feels different from the newer cars. Contrast that with the X6 I drove at the press intro a few months ago- it was pretty quick but dull as dishwater to drive; a totally uninvolving steer, as the Brits would say."
March 2015,The ilx at 6.2 is a dog.
March 2015,"To each his own, my tweaked MS3 is only a tick faster; I can't say it's slow, but it's not a rocketship by current standards."
March 2015,5.2 seconds is definitely mid-pack these days. A dead stock 1st. Generation MS3 can do it in 5.4 seconds. Any of the V8 ponycars with at least 400 hp can do 0-60 in 4.5 seconds or less. To be considered very fast these days I'd think that a car has to go 0-60 in under 4 seconds- and 0-100 in under 11 seconds. The goalposts have moved quite a bit.
March 2015,"Most people would consider 0-60 in 5.2 seconds to definitely be a ""ball of fire"". Complete with flames."
March 2015,You don't think 5.2 sec is fast? A 2015 Camaro with over 400 hp is sitting at about 5 secs.
March 2015,"Q....that's not far off from what I'm getting on my 2.0T. Admittedly, I keep my foot in it, but that mileage is exemplary.I'm getting 22-23 around town. Hit 30 MPG on one all highway trip from Columbus and back from Cincinnati....mostly with cruise on 70 MPH given the amount of bubble tops on the highway that day.Good job."
March 2015,I've driven an X1 as a loaner for a few days and really liked it. I'd take it over a 320xi.
March 2015,"RB....While I was having my issues with my previous Audi, I looked pretty closely at those X1s. I thought in 35i guise, it was a nice little vehicle. Very liveable with a little bit of spunk added to a daily hauler. Plus, I think all loaded up, it came in at somewhere around the mid $40s, all shiny and new."
March 2015,No MT (this is BMW we are talking about after all). It is a 2.0L 4cyl Turbo Diesel. 180 hp - 280 lb ft torque.
March 2015,"I bet I know the answer, but I'll ask anyway. Is that X3 available with a manual transmission? Which diesel is it?"
March 2015,That would be a nice sled as well- especially if Alpina had their way with it...
March 2015,@roadburner - how about an X3 with the diesel motor?
March 2015,"I took my son's 2004 X3 2.5i(171k and going strong) to my dealer for an inspection and was given an X1 xDrive2.8i. This is the second time the dealer has given me an X1, and I really do like those little trucks. The steering and brake feel is spot on and the size is just about right- although it is a extremely porky at over 3800 lbs. 0-60 in 6 seconds is nothing to write home about, but adequate for its intended purpose. I could actually see owning an M Sport X1 xDrive 35i. While still no ball of fire(0-60 in 5.2 seconds) the truck would be a lot of fun for a second car or work hack."
March 2015,"As this article says, it's very difficult these days to compete with the ""big 3"" of luxury: BMW, Lexus, and MB....http://www.autonews.com/article/20150316/RETAIL01/303169995/tier-2-luxury-brands-struggle-to-compete-with-elite-germans-lexus""....The big three brands enjoy an enviable combination of advantages -- deep product lineups, global reach, strong residual values and rock-solid brand images -- that aspiring brands cannot match.Cross-shopping data show that customers of the aspiring brands are more likely to defect to one of the big three or Audi than the other way around.Not since 1998 has any brand other than BMW, Mercedes and Lexus topped the U.S. luxury market in sales. That year, Lincoln led the field. Before 1998, Cadillac held an unbroken grip on the top spot going back to before 1970.Since Mercedes grabbed the top prize in 1999, imports have dominated the playing field. Lexus ruled 11 straight years from 2000-10. These days, the top three remain locked in a bitter struggle for the luxury title. BMW has taken the crown three of the last four years but is third so far this year, trailing Mercedes and Lexus.Ambitious Lexus is breathing down the neck of Mercedes-Benz in a bid to regain the top spot it hasn't held since 2010. Through February, Lexus sales have jumped 26 percent, passing BMW to move into second place behind Mercedes. Like its rivals, Lexus is basing its growth on an aggressive product offensive....Acura finished sixth in the U.S. behind Cadillac in 2014 but has jumped past Audi and Cadillac into fourth place for the first two months of 2015, demonstrating just how hot the competition is among the aspiring brands...."""
March 2015,"Its been about 21 through the arctic weather we've had the past couple of months. Last tank improved to 22mpg with the slightly milder temps. This is all using the remote start ALOT, by the way. I'm guessing the warmer weather will see upwards of 23. Cruising all highway gets me about 26. So its pretty darned close to the mustang. Not surprising given their similar HP and not-so-dissimilar weight. (the extra 2 gears in the CTS is probably what offsets the extra 200 lbs and thirst of the extra torque.) I'm itching to get the summer tires back on there."
March 2015,Hey sween- I am in twin scroll (F10) land now and loving every moment of it.Sport Plus mode is a beast on the highway.
March 2015,"I would come up with a resurrected restyled G. It's a nice idea to have a good naming convention but not IMHO if you tarnish the goodwill and brand recognition of an existing car (G35/37). They could upgrade the current car, restyle as a newer G, and rename to the G39 or something like that. Those original taillights were very distinctive and I could see them replicating something that is similar enough to suggest the old car. And then also address whatever it is about the new car that causes CU and reviewers to not like the new one not so much.Also, small SUV - they have those but don't seem to sell many. Kind of cute but not an Audi Q5 or even an RDX. They should get something more competitive out there."
March 2015,"@tlong you nailed it huge fail by Infiniti - would also call the killing of an bmw m3 fighter q a fail as well. They have lost way- bad thing for Infiniti as they can't sit tight like acura did for years and relied on SUVs and the big brother brand (Honda) carry the weight. Need a quality sedan, a premium (wanted) Suv and some sort of sports car. As of now they have nada."
March 2015,"It was a marketing decision by Johan de Nysschen to bring Infiniti more in line with Audi (where he came from). A for cars, Q for SUVs vis a vis Q for cars, QX for SUVs. Now he is at Cadillac and we are getting CT for cars and who knows what for SUVs.Seems kind of stupid to me. It's like a lobbed a bomb at Infiniti and then left for greener pastures..."

March 2015,Thanks sween - it just seems that when the G35 and then G37 came out I saw them everywhere. Now either the new version isn't selling well or it is so nondescript that I don't notice it. And why did they change their lettering on that model? I makes no sense to me - I don't have the impression Infiniti is on the upswing...
March 2015,Just double checked CR- the old g37 now q40 still on the recommended list - the new q50 is not and first year buyers have trashed it a bit.
March 2015,"Q....I know it's not something you buy your car for, but what kind of MPG are you getting on your V-Sport?"
March 2015,"I liked most aspects of my '04 G35X. But it ""felt"" very heavy and got horrible mileage for a 260hp V6 (averaged 21mpg). I always had more of a soft spot for the circa '06 M45."
March 2015,"I've put the G3x/Q50 on my shopping list more than once. I didn't dislike the cars, matter of fact, I liked them.....the G more than the Q. Seems I always found something I liked better.Wife is 5'9"" tall. She looked at the ILX before buying her Accord. She said it felt cramped. She looked at the Q50, too. She liked it. At the time, it was selling for high $40s equipeed the way she wanted. I think the Q is selling about $5K less today.ILX with a better motor and trans would be appealing to anyone who doesn't need a lot of room.Actually, the TLX would be the perfect size for my wife. Price is right, too."
March 2015,Yeah I wouldn't do that again either. We have the Q50 Hybrid so it has the venerable 3.5 engine to supplement the hybrid powertrain. If only they could sort out the electronics.
March 2015,"I almost forgot... have a neighbor up the street who had a G35. The first one with the new body style that became the G37 a year later.. so, 2008 or 2009, maybe? Don't know how many miles, but in 2014 it blew the engine... He said he took a $10K hit trading it in.. On a new Q50!! Now, that's just one instance, but if it happened to me, I would have a hard time buying a new car with basically the same engine. But, he really loved that G35... so..."
March 2015,"Ditto on the G37x, flawless and crazy power, at the price of mpg. The Q50 we replaced it with has had it's share of hiccups, a quirky car to say the least. The new ILX interests me as well but I'm thinking the S60 will be in the driveway next week."
March 2015,@tlong CR always backed the g37 and it's still on the list for good used cars. Think you got thr q50 mixed up with the q40 which is the g37 which was the g35--confused yet? For the money and what it brings its a lower end player despite its age. My car got a Yukon like 17 mpg for its life - never got over 25 on the highway. The s4 recently did a 500 round tripper mostly highway and avg'd 28 and 29 on the 2 legs. Amazing what an extra gear or 2 & a half liter less under the hood can do - let's not for get about the supercharger- oh billy.
March 2015,"We had a G37 sedan (same car as the Q40) for 3 years.. Not a hiccup. Stupid amounts of power. Comparably poor gas mileage. Numb handling (but adequate). Nice interior, though a little cramped. It's a huge amount of car for the money, especially on a lease.I wouldn't mind driving the new ILX, just to see how it compares in handling to the old TSX. It's certainly faster, it seems.On the A3, moving up to the 2.0T gets you Quattro, instead of FWD."
March 2015,According to Consumer Reports the new Infiniti Q is really poor reliability and not rated very well.
March 2015,I knew there was a reason I liked the ILX. the only thing really wrong with the original was a bit of a weak engine. that seems to have been cured.
March 2015,"Thanks Ben - interesting review- given discounts and power wonder if the old Infiniti g35/37 or q40 as its weirdly called now would be a better deal. I've seen locals with redic low leases and pricing under 35k, 330 hp strong v6 and premium gas being under 4 bux- I would seriously consider as a major comp to both above. Sure you are driving basically a 10 year old bmw 3 comp but no weird stearing like current infinitis and bmws."
March 2015,Alex also really likes the Audi A3. The 2.0 AWD model he tests has an msrp of c. $40k.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81DM8aie4Zw
March 2015,"Alex on Autos tests the Acura ILX as going 0-60 in 6.25 seconds, which is faster than all the other base competitors except for the MB CLA. He seems to say the Acura 8 speed dual clutch transmission with exclusive torque converter is his favorite transmission in the segment. Comparably equipped he says that it's less than the competition by anywhere from c. $1k to c. $12k. He admits it doesn't have the prestige of the other brands, but likely has better reliability and lower insurance costs. Overall, he says Acura has got its ""mojo back.""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo9DiqFvAcU"
March 2015,"You will possibly not be surprised to learn that I haven't checked baggage for over 20 years, save the within-Europe flights that are very stringent about ONE ONLY carry-on bag.Simplicity rules in my world and makes it, well, simpler.

March 2015,"I did not mean to suggest or imply that I thought Audi had a 50/50 weight balanced RWD vehicle. I was specifically responding to/about the availability of a BMW or an Audi (my S4 for instance) with a manual transmission. The original discussion/question posed mentioned RWD and manual transmissions. As far as I know there are still a few -- not many any more -- RWD and manual transmission cars that can be sourced from an ever shrinking number of manufacturers. Fewer still are the number of cars that can lay claim to having nearly or exactly 50/50 weight distribution with RWD and manual transmissions. Again, I must regrettably say it is, as each day passes, just a little bit more irrelevant as we all know, since robots started stealing my luggage.""Damn your eyes [Igor]!"""
March 2015,"Mark, Audi does not built a RWD drive car that has a 50/50 weight distribution, neither does MB, Infiniti or Lexus. I agree that the automatics of today are just as good if not better. The 8 spd in my 320i with the coded Sport Transmission is a great unit, I can cruise in comfort and not feel it shift, or if I want to be sporty and hold the rev's longer, I push the toggle switch to Sport, and if I want to push it harder, I'll push the toggle switch again and the transmission goes into Sport+. Then the transmission shifts quicker, and will hold to redline until I move the shift down for a higher gear (320i's do not have paddle shifters from the factor, but can be added via the aftermarket for about $500.) When people talk about the car in the past being better, this reminds me of when my EX and I had a couple of classic cars, he had a 57 Continental Mark II (Please do not call it a Lincoln Continental) and I had a 70 Olds 442 Convertible W30 and a 70 Mustang 302. The Olds was the classic A body car. Yes, it was fast but not really THAT fast, the Mustang was quick, faster then the Olds, but not as fast or quick or quick as cars in the late 90's, and lets talk comfort, the Olds was an Auto, the Mustang was a stick, the clutch on the stang was SOOOO stiff it was rough to drive it around town or smooth. The Continental rode like it was on clouds, smooth and elegant, but trying to stop 2.5 tons of car with drum brakes, was a feat... Even the Olds and stang had disk brakes up front they still didn't stop all that well. So when I hear people talk about the good ole days of cars and how good they are, I just laugh.. Give me a 335i with sport package, a car that is faster, smooth, handles better and is suited for the long haul over the older muscle cars. Even the 2015 Stang GT is faster, and is a lot more comfortable to drive and handles so much better..But there is something to be said about putting the top down in a big block muscle car and cruising the beach."
March 2015,"This is true, but when you have over 3.9 million FF miles and a million hotel points, the cost is very low."
March 2015,"Apparently Acura, like BMW and Audi, is going to go all-turbo in the next few years. I feel mixed about that. But in terms of having power at the low end..."
March 2015,"""I think Acuras and Hondas do have souls. Their engines are beautiful examples of engineering that purr and like to run fast. These engines imho almost sing as you drive them. I've never owned an Audi or BMW, but I've ridden in them. And they are certainly wonderful cars too. They just have different souls. ""A little more low end grunt and it will have an immortal one- ""soul"" that is."
March 2015,"My wife calls the differences between her last car, an Infiniti and my last car, an Acura, a lack of soul. I understand that she probably means something that is there but very difficult to quantify -- it can't be measured and written down, that is.I did, mostly, enjoy my 2012 TL (most especially the audio system -- I still have the DVD-Audio discs), were I to even attempt to characterize what I could articulate differentiated the TL vs the S4, it would start with a sense that the Acura seemed ""flimsy,"" most notable when closing the doors. The Audi closes with a muted, solid whomph! sound, no clicking or other mechanical noises, the door closing almost seems hydraulic it is so smooth so ""of a billet of solid steel"" invoking. The Acura on the other hand, sounded a bit like an empty tin can being dropped from about 5 feet onto asphalt. The very comfortable, heated and ventilated seats, in the Acura also had a bit of ""play"" or give in them somewhat like a table at a bar that needs a folded pack of matches put under one of the legs to keep it from wobbling. I don't know if I would call the Acura's feel something as negative as ""OK fit and finish,"" perhaps I would simply call it ""less solid"" feeling than the Audis (or BMWs) we've had.If that equates to soul (my wife's term, remember), well there you have it. Please remember I am not saying I think the Acura is not a good car, a very high value car, a fully-featured car with lots of impressive technology. I also thought the SH-AWD with the 19"" wheel tire package made the TL elicit a sense of deja vu -- like it was, somehow, related or at least relate-able to an S4.I, at age 63, now think life's too short (for me, at least) to drive an Acura TL or TLX when there are cars like the S4 on the market.But, if you read my previous post, in probably doesn't matter since most cars will be nearly autonomous before the note on your new car is paid off."
March 2015,"markcincinnati wrote:""Now, having said that, I will prove myself a walking and driving contradiction. I do, to this very day, believe that the Acura TLX SH-AWD with the Advance package (and ONLY that configuration) is Acura's S4. And, it is really damn near impossible to find one that rings up a $50,000 tab. Yet, if you drive the two cars, back to back, well there is that certain something (that my wife calls soul) that the Acura doesn't even seem to attempt to imitate.

Soichiro Honda was a very talented engineer, and I think his ""soul,"" if you want to talk in those terms, is still part of Honda/Acura. It's a company whose CEOs are still always engineers, unlike Toyota/Lexus, or some other companies, where the CEOs often come from the financial side. We'll just need to agree to disagree, which is fine."
March 2015,"In·ev·i·ta·ble: unable to be avoided, evaded, or escaped; certain; sure to happen.Our sometimes heated discussions about the merits of manual transmissions vs. automatics or about RWD, FWD, AWD, etc. are – or will pretty soon be – irrelevant. These discussions may be entertaining, they may even be cathartic, but there is plenty of evidence of the inevitability of semi-autonomous and ultimately autonomous cars. With google, Apple and many others you’ve never even heard of working on technologies whose purpose it is to remove you from the driving equation, it is a matter of years – perhaps so few we could discuss the time frame in months (you know like a 60 month car-loan term) – before we essentially have “individual” mass transportation. By that I mean we’ll have individual containers (cars) that, as far as you’re concerned, provide you with about the same experience you have as when riding a bus, limo or train. You’ll have the flexibility that a private car offers and you’ll be, for the most part, nothing more than a passenger.It probably doesn’t even matter if you want this technology or not, it’s coming. It’s coming pretty quickly too. Insurance and many other private companies, federal, state and local governments want it. You’ve (or perhaps, better said, “we’ve”) proven we’re not capable, or perhaps it is just that we’re not willing to prevent the inevitable. Just this morning, coming into work, I passed a driver of a late model Mercedes S class – the driver was on the phone! There is no way this Mercedes doesn’t come standard with hands-free, eyes-free, voice activated Bluetooth connectivity and control; yet, there was this bozo with one hand on the road, in rush-hour traffic, with the phone held up to his ear. Now, how does that make me make the leap to autonomous cars?Well, as I am willing to say, I am often wrong, but never uncertain, we might simply mandate built in jammers that prevent cell phone usage in a moving car. But, think about it, what we really want is for the driver to not use a hand-held phone while driving. We probably don’t want to prohibit passengers from using a cell phone. Even my Audi offers in-car Wi-Fi, so it seems that we’re moving in the direction of greater, not restricted, connectivity. So what do “we” do? Rather than taking away the ability for the driver to use a hand-held phone, we’ll just go ahead and take away the ability to drive the car altogether because we have demonstrated that distracted driving is sometimes actually worse than drunk driving – and if you bother to look, you’ll find there are a lot of drivers using hand-held phones. This is all the more frustrating (for me at least) since I know that an ever increasing number of cars have Bluetooth as standard equipment.Inevitable? Yes. While growing up, my parent’s cars never had seatbelts – in 1963 my dad bought a brand new Chrysler Newport. It did not come with seatbelts. The dealer, however, did put them in the car (2 in the front seat only). I never knew if this was in response to a government mandate or if it was part of a promotion. As time passed we graduated to cars that came with 3 seatbelts in the front (unless you had bucket seats), then rear seatbelts, then shoulder belts then seatbelt interlocks that essentially attempted to force seatbelt use as the cars would not start unless the seatbelts were fastened (leading to folks fastening their seatbelts, then sitting on them, therefore defeating the purpose.) We can, in the name of safety, list all of the inevitable features that have been added since 1963 – actually, we could have another list of all of the features added in the name of safety before 1963. These two lists, with descriptions, would fill volumes.These days, any manufacturer who wants to, can crank out a 300HP motor and put it in a lightweight body. And they can do so for what is (for someone my age) an almost unbelievably low price. Even 350HP, 400HP or 500HP are pretty much within the engineering talents of just about any name brand auto manufacturer. Likewise, 6,7,8,9 and 10 speed automatics, some with dual clutches and torque converters (in the same transmission) further multiply many car’s accelerative capabilities sometimes stretching the limits of the short-attention span humans we’ve seen increasing on the planet at an alarming rate. When 0-60MPH can happen in less than 6 seconds and when, at 60MPH, you’re overtaking anything not moving at a rate of 88 feet per second, it’s no wonder untrained and distracted drivers crash and burn.The response? Intervention. Police intervention? Sure, but often that is after it is too late. What is, apparently, better is for the car to intervene on the driver’s behalf. First came four-wheel brakes, eventually disc brakes, then anti-locking brakes, then electronic stability programs, then radar/sonar pre-sense systems, cameras and more cameras, lane warning systems, lane keeping systems, systems meant to keep you awake, systems that can bring a car to a full-stop and maintain assured clear distances at highway speeds approaching triple digits. Then there are the slow speed crash avoidance systems, pedestrian safe-keeping systems, night vision systems, automatic mirrors and automatically deployed headlight beams that dim whenever approaching traffic is detected. Infiniti, despite much negative press, even disconnected the steering wheel from the steered wheels altogether as they designed – perhaps intentionally, who knows – a semi-autonomous car, the Q50. Google has demonstrated their autonomous driving handiwork, too, in a Mercedes S-class; and recently an Audi A7 (or so it appeared to be) navigated, at speed, the Nürburgring. Look ma, no hands!Recently, I have, with humorous intent, invoked the quote from Pogo, “We’ve met the enemy and he is us.” Now, without mirth, I re-invoke the saying and once again, I blame you (all of us, really) for not learning how to drive, not learning safety and performance driving. I blame us, as a culture, as a species, for not making the requirements for getting an automobile driving license perhaps nearly as rigorous as the requirements to get a private airplane pilot’s license.If we all had to know how to drive defensively – and prove it – we could, perhaps, forestall the inevitable autonomous automobiles currently picking up speed in the pipeline to a retailer near you. Yes, forestall, not prevent, because eventually, even great education won’t be enough, great engineering will prove inadequate and “traffic law” enforcement will always remain mostly an after-the-fact activity rather than robust preventative measures.I – alone at my house, anyway – pretty much welcome autonomous cars, because driving on our I-275 with the apparently ignorant [great] majority of the population (and I include myself) is just too much Sturm und Drang (Storm and Stress). I have this wonderful 333HP sporty sedan and I drive it mostly in stop and go traffic, bumper-to-bumper (no matter how hard I try to maintain one car length for every 10MPH) and at about 47MPH (or less, truth be told). The hell of it is, I live in Cincinnati – have you ever been here? This place is barely a city for pity’s sake; it is so small, so relatively sparsely populated. I can only imagine the frustration of having an S4 in Chicago or Boston or Dallas. Hell yes, gimmie a car that I can program to my destination, push or say “engage,” meanwhile I work on my iPad mini catching up on my [State Department] emails and other mi·nu·ti·ae: The small, precise, or trivial details of something.At least if I’m in my car, not having fun driving it, I can be in my car not having fun but at least being somewhat productive.“Oh, what a world!

March 2015,"Thanks, but I did know that it is possible to get the BMW you mention (as well as several Audis, etc.) with a manual. The point that I was making is they represent what 1%, 2%, or maybe 3% of sales? They are becoming a ""why bother"" to manufacture feature. WE'VE killed manual transmissions. We're about to kill driving altogether. See my next post."
March 2015,"WE have been down this road before regarding manual transmissions. Yeah, they are fun. But, today's automatics are SO GOOD, I don't know of anyone who can actually putperform one with a manual. Tough to find any manual transmission cars, anywhere, regardless of price. Yes, you can special order them. But, dealers know if they stock them, it's a long road ahead trying to find a customer who knows how to drive one, let alone, finding someone who wants one. They're out there. They're a acarcity, though.Even something like a Mustang GT or Camaro SS are tough to find in a manual trans. They're a bit more plentiful, but you have to search some to locale them.I think most of the trade rags give the nod to the Cadillac ATS when it comes to 3 Series, A4 etc comparisons. I've driven an ATS, several times. They are a very fun car to drive that can rock and roll with anything in its price range. Good looking and built well with great materials, too.I agree with Mark....on the upper end of the ELLPS range, probably the S4 could arguably be preferred over the others. Audi, at least in my exeperience (and some others here at Edmunds) aren't exactly the poster children for reliability, nor are they reasonably budget friendly to keep and operate. Still, can't argue its performance.Acura TL SH AWD Advance? Boy....I would have a hard time justifying $50K-$60K for a 3xx ix or A/S4, C300/400 4 Matic if I were looking for a level of performance, comfort, build quality, cheap to own and operate for what I paid for mine ($38K and change). I don't have enough seat time in the TLX SH AWD to really render a judgement. But, for $45K list for the advance package, the same applies to it.If it weren't just a wee bit tight for my tastes, I would have had a Lexus is350 F sport gracing the GG estate right now. It's a lot like the Acura TL. It doesn't lead in one category, but is really good in ALL categories. At the time, I could have plucked one up, fairly loaded for $46-$47K, too. It's design could be polarizing, too. But again, being the ""odd ball"" I am, likeing the TL's previous design, I liked the Lexus' design, too.I understand people being polarized by the styling. But, no one can deny their trouble free nature, longevity, sport sedan handling and frugality when it comes to operation and maintenance. They are a LOT of car for that kind of money.So, are their better cars out there than the 3 Series? From my perspective, yes....lots of them. My reasons may be different than yours, though. You start loading one up to knock on the $60K+ door, and that list grows dramatically."
March 2015,Don't forget to add the cost of the European vacation....
March 2015,"Mark, BMW builds the 3 series with a manual, IF people do not want all the bells and dodad's, you can order yourself a 328i w/ sport package, and manual, and be able to get about $36K if one does a European Delivery. Ora 320i w/ Sport Package and Manual, can be had for about 32K. Each are RWD and Manual."
March 2015,"@markcincinnati‌ It is funny. You and I are on opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to options. I think cars are really expensive to begin with. So I choose my options carefully. If I'm going for a BMW, then its going to have the lighting package, backup camera, heated seats, AWD, & a slush box. That's it. My former E90 328xi was loaded up with options that didn't really add that much to the driving experience. Sure the leather seats were really nice & the sunroof let light into its black interior. The Navigation got me 95% of the way to my destination. Now I definitely like the way sport package equipped cars drive and look. Nowadays they are really expensive option packages that come with low profile, run flat tires that can get expensive, especially around here."
March 2015,"At the risk of getting myself in hot water: NONE, since we now have numerous examples regarding performance -- stating that overall, the automatic transmission especially one with dual clutches is generally speaking (for those of us mere mortal consumers) superior AND preferred by a huge number of regular consumers. Only if enough folks spend the money and actually buy a manual transmission car, will they even be available too much longer. Automatic transmissions today improve the performance (or at least the perception of performance) of many, if not most, of the cars they are marketed with.And, in terms of the utilization and circumstances of use by the majority of consumers (again for mere mortals), AWD no longer needs to have any apologies made for it or by it, other than to say, ""excuse me"" as the AWD version passes the RWD or FWD version. Ask Porsche, to name one, what cars they market are AWD -- the low performance or high performance variants?I can appreciate RWD and manual transmissions -- but they're not, for the buyers that keep these ELLPS car mfgs alive and well, where the ""performance"" buyers gravitate towards.The reasons are well documented and even if I did think RWD and manual transmissions were any more than an entry in the bibliography of a glitzy brochure (if brochures actually had bibliographies), the shoppers, buyers and actual consumers believe and behave differently (based on their spending, at least); that is auto trans cars rule and AWD is in very widespread use, often in the cars touted as THE highest performance versions.The sooner we start recognizing that these companies that build the machines we covet probably don't care one way or another what wheels are driven and how the thing is shifted, the better, because they care overwhelmingly what will facilitate the goals of corporate survival, growth and prosperity. I would assume if BMW thought it could overwhelm Audi by building and selling FWD cars exclusively with manual transmissions, I would assume they would do so. A dead purist is still dead, after all. Companies are no different -- the auto transmission has or is close to defeating stick shifts; turbo or super or both engines of 4 or 6 cylinders are replacing displacement based engines as each day passes and AWD cars or at least the option to add AWD is well on its way toward total market dominance.I like being alive -- but, in my case at least, I actually think auto trans AWD vehicles are the best most of us mere mortals can get today. So I think I am a purist, just one who thinks RWD (or FWD) and stick shifts are so 1980."
March 2015,How many of them are RWD and come with a manual transmission?
March 2015,"The problem I have with the statement would entirely go away if the words between the parenthesis had not been part of the declaration.Furthermore, my issue with most of these cars -- but the Germans top the list of offenders -- rears its head because I typically select the top option package and then add individual options on top of that.A base (good luck finding one) Audi S4 is hard to beat -- but I wouldn't have one unless it had, navigation, B&O sound system, blind spot monitoring . . . and the list goes on. There is no way the technology we (or I) love, voice-activated navigation + bluetooth, etc, is worth $3,500. Hell, I can buy a 75"" Samsung HDTV for about $500 less than that, and that price is dropping 2% per month.So, yeah, there are very good cars at attractive price points -- we can argue if this or that is BETTER than a BMW or an Audi or a Mercedes, etc, but there are a lot of comparable cars IF POPULARLY equipped. My car has almost $10,000 worth of options on it, and I didn't even get a Prestige model.The base fill in the blank German fill in the blank is likely to drive, perform and ride better than the ""other guy"" -- but the heck of it is, the German car will be a strippie and the other guy will come chock full of features that just seem out of touch with even a generous gross margin.Now, having said that, I will prove myself a walking and driving contradiction. I do, to this very day, believe that the Acura TLX SH-AWD with the Advance package (and ONLY that configuration) is Acura's S4. And, it is really damn near impossible to find one that rings up a $50,000 tab. Yet, if you drive the two cars, back to back, well there is that certain something (that my wife calls soul) that the Acura doesn't even seem to attempt to imitate. But the TLX's numbers are, for the bucks, impressive.So, I complain about the price of the S4 vs the TLX (which makes a good case for itself as being in the same league), but I still put down the extra $6K-$12K for the Audi BECAUSE I test drove it.We have met the enemy . . you know the rest."
March 2015,"""There are a lot of really good cars (as good or better than BMWs) at price points that are much less""Which???"
March 2015,"My sentiments exactly; I've owned 10 BMWs-from an E24 M6 to an E83 truck-over the past 32 years and I completely agree that upwards of 99% of the new Bimmers don't offer nearly enough performance to justify their premium price- particularly when you have to pay for ""options"" that come standard on many much less expensive cars(See: HIDs, enhanced Bluetooth and USB connectivity, decent ICE, EHP summer tires, heated seats, etc., etc.)."
March 2015,"I don't have many complaints about BMW, but option cost tops the list. Said it before, will again. They're ""this close"" to pricing themselves right out of the ""it's not worth what I paid"" category. Given no clear advantage for performance, quality, reliability, that's a dangerous place to be. Not sure if they're still offering leases that are heavily subsidized or not. But, GM learned that lesson long ago. You can't subsidize forever.Don't get me wrong. I like BMWs. But, when a 335ix tipped the $60K+ scale equipped the way I like, and the 235i came in close behind, I could see that the threshold had been exceeded.There are a lot of really good cars (as good or better than BMWs) at price points that are much less."
March 2015,"Both are 2014 and been on the lots for well over 9 months, I think the GM made a mistake by not ordering the lighting package, I mean, $900 isn't going to break anyone's bank but really transforms the car with the angle eyes. IF it had the lighting back, I could take Rick into taking one of them, but as he say's, I'm spending 50K for a car, I want what I want.. Can't argue with that... I'm kinda surprised they haven't sold at least one of them. For the discount they are giving, someone can make money down the road..."
March 2015,"Mark our CA does well for himself in selling cars, he just delivered his 6th 750iL, that was speical ordered, in the color combo we want our GT, Midnight Blue with Oyster Interior, it's very stunning, but his GM wont pre-order one that color combo.. BMW has what is called, ""Individual"" where basically you custom build your BMW 5,6 ot 7 series cars. If you have a favorite color and send to Munich a sample, for 5K your new BMW will be painted that color. bmwusa.com/standard/content/innovations/bmwindividual/default.aspx There are only area's in which you can customer build build your BMW, it is a process in which I would love to do just once, my 5 series would be the old Porsche Guards Red. MB has the Designo mbusa.com/mercedes/benz/design/designo it's basically the same thing..Mark you are correct, they do it because they can and there is a market for it if there wasn't they the manufactures wouldn't be offering it."

March 2015,One thing I like about the DHP on the X SAV's is they are more rear wheel bias when having fun and once slip is detected then more power goes to the front wheels. Not too sure if this is true on all X-Drive cars...
March 2015,"Back in the summer of 2010, my Mom factory ordered a 2011 V6 Cayenne. When my Dad came to work the next day, I asked him about all the details (this was exciting. First Porsche in the family). I was a little confused when he told me they ordered the Cayenne in Sand White. Me: ""Since when does Mom like White cars?""Dad: ""Since Porsche charges $800 for anything else that's not black or white. And she didn't want black.""Me: ""You are kidding me? She does realize this is a $60K truck and that the $800 is really nothing.""Dad: ""You want me to argue with your Mother?""Me: ""Good call. White is very pretty."""
March 2015,"What premium does M-B charge over ""basic"" for their expresso designo option, $4-6K? Or is that reserved just for interior special orders? (gulp)I've never had it on any of the five I've owned."
March 2015,@roadburner - I think the lsd in the audi was 1k - funny few people ticked the box on that one when I was looking used.
March 2015,"The BMW optioning/pricing has always been a bit ridiculous- charging for HIDs? $3k for a locking diff? Both were standard on my MS3 in Grand Touring trim back in 2007. Somehow Chevrolet, Dodge, and Ford manage to make the LSD standard on their properly equipped(three pedal) V8 ponycars that they are able to crank out for $35k or under. Don't tell me Munich couldn't fit a suitable LSD at the factory for $1000- the 25% unit on my Club Sport was priced at only $500($767 in today's currency). I guess it's just another way to bump enthusiasts further up the Bavarian food chain..."
March 2015,Cadillac doesn't even offer a no-charge basic gloss white. The only white is a tricoat that is extra-cost. They do offer a no-charge basic gloss black. But some metallic paints are also no-charge. Go figure.
March 2015,"White is the new black. According to our BMW store white is the most popular color. Black and silver are also popular.White and gloss black are often the only two ""free"" paint colors offered by European mfgrs. My wife pulled the trigger on a $1,075 paint color called Panther Black -- yes it is purty, but that just seems like way too much for what appears BLACK from a distance of over 10 feet.I used to special order Pearl White on all my Audis. Then, one year, the price jumped from $500 to $2,500 and Pearl White became a member of the Special Order collection that Audi offers to anyone who will pony up the money. It is called Audi exclusive -- hell yes it is exclusive, because anything you order -- ANYTHING -- starts at $2,500 -- why? Because they can. In 2009, I wanted the Ecru (Cardamom) interior color and it only came with blonde wood -- I thought the contrast wasn't there, I wanted the burl walnut wood inlays. At that time, $2,000. Despite the fact that I had custom ordered the A4 Pretige with most every option listed, I just couldn't bring myself to pay $2K for something that was no charge had I not wanted the Cardamom leather. Next year blonde was dropped in favor of the dark walnut. Much as I favor an almost the sky's the limit, I just can't see something like I have just described as anything other than an option from our ""shameless profit collection.""BMW seems to charge breathtaking prices for wheels that aren't part of the two or three ""normal"" choices offered -- I know there are certainly differences that justify higher costs, but there was an X6 on the showroom floor with a $5,000 wheel package (tires were another upcharge). I know a lot of options are outrageously priced, but at least it would seem they kind of bury the charge so that the price gouging isn't obvious.Now I'll show my ignorance -- the last time I priced an Infiniti, their color palate was ""included"" in the MSRP base. This included both pearl and just clearcoat colors. I'm the guy who would probably pay MORE for the basic car if all the paint choices were ""included"" -- it just galls me to see $1,075 for an admittedly pretty black color. It is good that I actually prefer white, cause were they to start charging extra for gloss white, I'm sure I'd scream ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore!""Sheesh!"
March 2015,"I had a similar conversation at my dealer when I got the ATS. Their response was almost identical. All they tend to bring in are black, white and silver cars with black interiors. Very rarely will they bring in a vehicle without a black interior regardless of exterior color. It is bizarre."
March 2015,"I've mentioned that to my sales guy and he said he prefers more interesting colors as well- but bland colors are what the buyers want. Boring.Oh, horse feathers! If it is true it's because most buyers don't want to take the time and effort to order, and they'll settle for what's in stock. They want immediate gratification. At least, in the case of our A4, although it's a pearlescent white, the interior being beige came with the rare dark brown carpeting matching the dark wood in the car, a nice combo."
March 2015,"Why BMW chose NOT to offer a sport suspension on their X-drive cars is a mystery to me -- they surely must have the technical know how to engineer it, one would think.They do - it's called M-Sport Adaptive suspension, sold together with variable sport steering as Dynamic Handling Package priced at $1000 for 3- and 4- series. On X3, they're selling same name package with somewhat different content."
March 2015,"When we ordered my wife's two X3's we did order the sport seats, the sport steering wheel, etc -- we also got sport wheels with +1"" wheel size and wide and lower profile tires.Two things struck me:#1 if you get the package with the sport steering wheel, you can't have the wheel heated.#2 no matter what ""sport"" option you selected, there was nothing that changed the calibration or ride height -- i.e., there was no sport suspension. The best you could do to sport the thing up was the bigger wheels and tires, which do help somewhat -- but the overall suspension is the same with or without the sport options.Audi has a package they call ""SLine"" that is or was available -- and it did (on the A4 at least) offer sport seats, +size wheels and tires and lower ride height, stiffer springs, struts and thicker anti-roll bars (front and reat). Sometimes they even included a special steering wheel but they did include paddle shifters too when one ticked off the ""SLine"" option.I see the A6, too, can be had with an all season or summer only sport package which does alter the suspension to ""sport"" calibration.According to the special brochure, Audi's S cars have ""special S tuned"" suspensions which I believe our friends over on AudiWorld.com say is different from the sport package offered on the A4 and A6.Why BMW chose NOT to offer a sport suspension on their X-drive cars is a mystery to me -- they surely must have the technical know how to engineer it, one would think.Tires contribute to the cars handling, doh!, you already knew that. So, here is something you can do that you may find has value to you. When you order a new Audi S4 with the all-season tire option, it comes with 18"" wheels and 40 series tires. The optional tire package comes with 19"" wheels and 35 series tires.The all-season tires are H rated grand touring Continentals or other Name Brand all-season tires. When you graduate to the 19"" wheels, the tires are Z rated (at least) and could be Continentals -- but they are MaxPerformance tires.The difference, here in America, at least is that the Continental tires are ""good,"" but unless kept inflated to at least 42 pounds, they are built for comfort, not for performance. Why Audi chose H rated tires is beyond me.When ordering the 19"", the tires are summer only rubber that helps the car go like a snake in a rat hole when compared with the H rated grand touring rubber.So, what you can do, if you are an American who doesn't need or won't swap out tires twice per year, is go ahead and get the all seasons that come with the thing and upgrade (it is called +Zero) to a wider, lower profile Ultra high performance tire that will fit on the 18"" wheels -- or you can keep the same size tires but get UHP all-seasons. The difference is not subtle -- the car's willingness to turn in is cranked up to 11, it then really does go like a snake in a rat hole, and you won't be obliged to swap out your tires semi-annually.Here's the deal, I THINK: European manufacturers, attempting to cater to American tastes, try to err on the side of comfort, quietness and durability beyond 25,000 miles. In doing so, I think they go too far. Why would Audi (for example) put H rated Grand-Touring tires on an ""S"" (not SLine) vehicle? I replaced ours with W rated UHP DWS Continentials (all season, Dry Wet, Snow), inflated the fronts to 43 and the rears to 41 -- transformation!With virtual mass customization the norm these days, why not offer Grand Touring, All-Season Ultra High Performance and Summer only Maximun Performance tire options on the order form and be done with it?Or at least think: BMW ""M"" is supposed to be more than an emblem or decal, more than trim and bling; likewise ""S"" (for Audi) is supposed to be a special version of a given Audi model, that includes sport: seats, exhaust, suspension, steering wheel and pedal covers, AND (one would think) TIRES. Somehow both Audi and BMW have an incomplete circuit somewhere that seems to prevent the inclusion of all of the required ingredients that go along with the notion of a ""sport model"" designation.Let's see what Volvo and Mercedes offer . . . . hmm?"
March 2015,I've mentioned that to my sales guy and he said he prefers more interesting colors as well- but bland colors are what the buyers want. Boring.
March 2015,"It's amazing how many black, white and silver Bimmers with black, occasional beige with light beige carpet interiors they have in stock, same with Audis. To me, bland."
March 2015,a $52K 3er without Xenon Headlights? Hmmm. How cheap are they willing to lease the car?
March 2015,"I was talking to our CA yesterday he was informing me that BMW has not released their ED allocation yet for the 2016 MY (something I already knew.) Chapman BMW has 2 2014 328i GT, both with M sport package, both equipped the same way. chapmanbmw.com/Phoenix-BMW-3-Series-2014-BMW-328i+xDrive+Gran+Turismo-440868.htm Our CA was telling me that we can get the car for 9K off MSRP plus the additional $1500 for in stock unit, then add the $1K rebate from BMWNA for being a BMWCCA member, Its a nice offer, but the car has black interior, the exterior is the Estoril Blue Metallic. Rick does not want Black interior living here in the SW that is the last color one wants to have.What I find interesting is, the CA say's, the GM orders the cars based on what people buy, this makes sense, however, I told him if the GM only orders cars with black interior and people purchase what is in stock does that really mean that black interior is what they want? Most of the 3 series they have in stock has, black interior, I would beat that many who purchase 2 and 3 series do not know they can order their cars and of course the CA's are going to say anything about as they do not make money until the car is delivered.Now on a side note, my CA informed that BMW has raised the residual on the 5 series from 60% to 64% on all 5 series excluding M5's, So this means you can get into a 5 series for less then $500/m on a 36 month lease."
March 2015,"I think that's the price we pay for much lower price point on those cars. As you may know, Europeans pay often more than double for the same vehicles. I checked it - literally my $46K MSRP wagon in 2013 would have been around $100K over there. At that level, volumes must be significantly lower, but the choices are much bigger. Rather than three engines, you get something like eight. Interior comes both bundled and unbundled, same thing with convenience and performance options. Our option sheet for a model is three-four pages, theirs are fifty-page books. We enjoy lower price at expense of choices, limited even further by dealers catering to our own instant culture. They can be very particular, what to buy, but they pay for that privilege. To each their own, I guess. BTW, there are similar market differences in electronics. When I was first buying some audio equipment (long time ago), I was struck how little choice was there in a big box store, despite all that square footage in comparison with a typical European store, especially in ""above entry level, below upscale"" category."
March 2015,"Why pay that much for a car that you wouldn't ever special order, but you'll take it because you can pick it up on Monday?That's what I say. I think same principle applies even to much cheaper cars. Considering that they are often even bigger portion of buyer's income (i.e. price of Ford Focus is most likely higher percentage of their buyer's income than those buying new 3- or 5-series; not always, but more often than not). I never understood American ""have to have it today"" culture. Ironically, the need for instant gratification, today considered a ""core American value"", is a far departure from thrift and patience were virtues preached by the first settlers, but that's another story. As I was saying many times before, part of my attraction of German brands to me is the real ability to get something that's in the catalogue. The salesmen never complain, never roll their eyes, or repeatedly attempt to sell you what's there here and now. I consider a single proposal acceptable, what I hate is a hard push against clearly expressed customer's wish. Many other brands have ""phantom"" configurations, options and packages that can be specified together as ""available"", but not really available - not just not in stock, but simply not possible to get, even with waiting. When ask, you get this blank stare, like you just arrived from another planet. Some dealers would pretend to take an order and then try to fit what they have in the pipeline. Two months later, you get a phone call: there is one coming, just your color and option X, but it has a sunroof that you didn't ask for, is that OK? I've seen that too many times.My only beef with German brand dealers, is that there are some options that truly change the car's characteristics, but not available in stock. Case in point - BMW 3 and 4 series have this adaptive M-sport suspension, which may or may not be a good thing. It is the only way to get a sport suspension on their AWD models, where Sport and M-Sport lines are only decorative aesthetic options (as opposed to RWD models, where sport suspension is added). I'm still yet to see any car in stock with that option. So should I want an X-drive car (e.g. wagon or GT models comes only with that that), I'd like to know how that adaptive M-sport suspension would work, if it's worth that extra thousand bucks, or not. I can't. Well, I'll live, I guess. Most likely I'll get RWD 4-series with Sport Line, anyway."
March 2015,"I had exactly the same experience when I visited a BMW store in Scottsdale in 1999, back when BMWs were BMWs. Haven't darkened the door of a BMW dealership since."
March 2015,"Mark....like you. many times I've bemoaned the fact that the BMW dealers just seem to carry the ""middle of the road"" colors and options on their cars. My BMW dealer (Sweeney) is a little bit better than the other place as far as having stock that meets my wants closer. But still, it's a struggle to find exactly what I want. As you noted, the two Audi stores are even worse. Mercedes dealers seem to be a bit better, but I'm not really a fan of their cars. So, outside of helping my sister buy one, and the cursory looks I give them when I'm shopping, I can't mention whether their stock situation is good or not.I know whenever I've become frustrated with the selection when buying a BMW, my long time sales associate is more than willing to order something. I never have. But, depending on their cycle of ordering, he's said it takes between 4 to 6 weeks from ordering until I'd be picking it up.I can see the allure for the dealership. No floor plan to pay. It's pretty much a guaranteed sale, getting exactly the car YOU want. And, price is agreed up front (or at least it should be).I've been to one of the Porsche dealers. Like their cars, but the dealership acted like I was invisible. I passed by two sales offices where the sales person looked up to see me, and ignored me. I passed two in the showroom who wouldn't even make eye contact.No Porsches for me."
March 2015,"When I was new to trips to Germany, I would take every opportunity my wife would permit to go into Audi dealerships. I did the same thing on one trip to Zurich. I kept noticing no inventory -- but sometimes quite a showroom. One trip, I went to the new Audi dealership that is at the Munich airport -- I asked the rep why no inventory? He told me that almost all of the cars they sell are ordered. Almost every Audi (and BMW) that we've had since 1978 have been special order cars. I always thought if you're going to spend ($50K+ in today's $s) and will settle for your third color option and not getting the options you wanted, etc, there must be something wrong with your sense of money. Why pay that much for a car that you wouldn't ever special order, but you'll take it because you can pick it up on Monday?The 10th (so they say) largest BMW dealer is here in Cincinnait. We have two Audi dealerships, two BMW, three Mercedes, two Porsche, etc etc, stores in our Big Town (almost a small city). I have, many times, attempted to find THE car I wanted in stock -- ""can't be done!"" My most recent Audi was $57+K and my wife's SQ5 was $65+K. At what level of income does one have to achieve in order to settle for a $60K car that is ""sitting on the lot?"" I wanted blind spot monitoring and red leather. I also wanted all-season OEM tires. My wife also wanted blind spot and red leather -- but she wanted metallic black, while I wanted white. I would've probably taken the metallic white Audi offers, but I was very specific in what I wanted as was she.What I can't imagine is being willing to settle on in-stock inventory, unless the exact vehicle was available or unless the price was hugely discounted. I took my 2012 Acura TL with a black leather interior -- a color I said I would never have (it makes the inside of the car feel small, to me at least, plus it is hotter than hell in the summer and the black seats often fade and look cheap) -- because the price was steeply discounted. What was I thinking? That fugly interior may have contributed to my relatively short time with the thing.So, here is the other ""benefit"" of ordering your car: it kind of feels like you get ""the new car joy"" twice, once when you order it and once a couple of months later when it comes in.Ordered cars, too, generally cost less than ones from inventory. The reason? The dealer doesn't have to pay the interest on the cars while they sit in inventory -- the dealer has a customer the moment the car comes in. Floorplan costs for your ordered car are likely to be very low.When I see one of those mega dealerships with a 150 car showroom and a huge (acres) lot -- one so big you have to be shuttled to the location of the car you're going to look at -- I assume someone has to pay for that, and I assume it will be the customers.The tiny dealer can order the same car as the big guy -- so if you're looking for the best deal, well the dealer that is so big the TV commercials have to be shot from a helicopter, is the one to avoid. Sometimes, Small really is Beautiful."
March 2015,Now THAT is ironic.
March 2015,"Dino, our CA (Client Adviser) told me that 50% of the their 5, 6 and 7 series buyers order their cars, and less then a 1/3 of them do the ED. When it comes to the 3 and 4 series about 30% order their cars and over half of them do the ED. But that is a small # of 3 series buyers, you might be right that when it comes to the 3 series people want it now..."

March 2015,WEBN = We Eliminate Banal Noise.Those were the days . . .
March 2015,"Mark....I graduated in the early '80s from Miami (Computer Science). Thought about grad school, but that's as far as I got. I remember WMUB (university's station) and WOXY. But remember listening to WOXR and WEBN growing up.Loved my years there and actually thought about living in Oxford after graduation. I stayed for a little while, bartending at Mac and Joes. Not much in the way if gainful employment around there, though.Made a stint out west for awhile but ended up in and around Cincinnati for the last 20+ years.Small world!"
March 2015,"Yes I am a Miami Alum, too and actually a Miami Merger -- got my undergrad and grad degrees from MU, worked at WOXR (not OXY) as the program director, commercial producer and had an on-air show 5 nights per week. We WERE for about 6 years the only prog rock station in SW Ohio. Those were the days. OXford Radio (OXR). I have no idea why the name was changed to OXY. When I went to Miami, no cars were allowed unless you were married or until you were in grad school, so car commentaries weren't even on my radar. Actually did my Master's work (which used to be called a thesis, but by the time I was there it was called ""independent reading"" which was, so it seems, about 10x the amount of work as just taking a class would have been -- I mean I felt like I read the entire freaking library for pity's sake) on how mass-media (when there was no Internet) helped win World War II financially by getting people to buy the bonds that funded the thing. And, in 1976, your final act before getting your Master's was what was then called Master's Orals. As far as I know these days if you take and pass the courses you get the degree. Back then (1976, before you were born probably), you had to sit in front of three PhD's and the Dean and answer their questions and spar with them for about 90 minutes or so, so they could determine if you knew your subject matter. Probably helped that I was a DJ since talking was how I made my living (such as it was) at the time.Too bad I don't get paid by the word, I'd be rich!"

March 2015,"I didn't know you could option up a Mazda3 all the way to 30k. But I went to their site and you're right--it can be done. Since the Acura ILX starts at 28k msrp, depending on the options you want you could have an ILX for less than a fully tricked out 3. In terms of size, the two are very close. In fact, the ILX and the 3 are within about an inch of each other in length and width.The Mazda 3 with the 2.5 is rated by the epa at 32 mpg combined, which is a big jump from the 21 of your 2005 TL. But the ILX does pretty well at 29.In terms of acceleration, at least according to Car and Driver, the ILX is about a second faster going to 60 than the Mazda3 2.5. ILX: 6.3 ; Mazda3 2.5: 7.3. To me it seems like a possible case for the ILX, but since I haven't driven either one I don't know about driving enjoyment.The 2016 ILX is no longer available with a manual. The standard transmission is an 8 speed DC with an exclusive torque converter. It does come with paddle shifters..."
March 2015,"Actually have not driven either yet. If I were to buy Acura again I would get the ILX as I've had the TL for 10 years and am tired of a car of this size - I want it a bit smaller. So no TLX, plus I'm not in the mood to spend that much. I certainly could afford it but just want to maximize my enjoyment and luxury for the $$.- I looked at the specs - I would pay probably $5K more for a ILX than a fully loaded Mazda 3 sedan. The Mazda has things like HUD, blind spot warning, even radar cruise control, all around $30K tops. It is a small bit larger than the ILX. It is widely praised as being like a baby BMW in handling. I know that in our '07 Mazda 5 which is of course a microvan, in pure maneuverability it outshines my current TL by quite a bit - tighter turning circle, better steering feel as an example. I would expect the current Mazda 3 to do quite a bit better than that.The ILX on paper is a little smaller. Given my TL experienc, I'm sure it would be reliable and might be more refined than the Mazda, which is a consideration. The ILX has more HP but less torque, so not sure how they will both feel. And am still considering getting a manual if I could find either of them in that tranny, since they are both still offered with manual transmissions.The other alternative is just hanging onto my '05 TL a few more years. It stays reliable at 150K, still looks good and drives well, I put a few $$ into it occasionally for battery/tires/brakes/fluids/etc. I did get the engine mounts and some suspension bushings changed at about 137K and spent about a grand. I figure that is ok given the mileage and it was my most expensive repair on the car."
March 2015,"The wide net they have cast allows them to sell more cars & SUVs. At the same time, the brain trust in Munich is driving away it's core customers (or are we clients now?). There was a time in my life when I had a major part of my automotive life mapped out in my head. It was filled with 3s, 5s, X3s, M3s, X5s, and Z4s. The current crop of 3ers are just normal cars to me. They aren't super heroes anymore (except for the brakes, they are tremendous).If I'm shopping in this class right now, I'd look at an IS350 AWD, TLX V6 w/ Tech AWD, Q50S AWD, & a Buick Regal GS AWD."
March 2015,I checked out leases on a q50 but the sport model like the $28k '13 G37s goes into $500/month and up.Looks good for the G instead.There is only a few within 100 miles of my zip on cars.com. Tons of the x and a few more sport coupes but I want the sedan although the coupe is the looker of the two.
March 2015,"Have you seen the pictures of the cockpits of the new mega class passenger jets? There aren't any windows!My '14 Audi doesn't have a cassette player!I can, however shift my DSG with greater precision than I could ever shift a stick shift, and I was (and hopefully still might be) good at shifting.But, it still doesn't matter -- ""no one"" buys them. I did test drive both an S4 6-speed manual and the DSG I ended up getting -- the DSG (shhh don't let this out) was better at it than I and, at high RPM's, the DSG never made a misstep and didn't require me to drive with one hand on the wheel.I drank the Kool-aid apparently.And, although I could have gotten my S4 with a stick, the S3, perhaps foreshadowing other coming attractions, can only be had with a 6-speed DSG.Even my wife's 8-speed tiptronic has been programmed by folks so skilled, it seems like it MUST be a DSG, too.I don't know about durability, but I imagine I might find out this time, since I plan to keep the thing beyond the factory warranty (but I have been thinking I would buy an extended warranty, cover myself with butter and carry lemons just in case.)Yet, another argument that ""they're"" hoping ""we'll"" make is that we'll want to keep our vehicles as up to date as possible; and since most cars can't be updated to adopt the latest and greatest technologies, the notion of replacing cars about every 3-4 years does have some merit."
March 2015,Exactly!
March 2015,"Well, to argue the other side, when talking about the good autos out there, they can do all of that. Its just as matter of pushing a button enough times. Drop down 3 gears? Click-click-click. Done. I drive with the Caddy in manual mode all the time, by the way. I prefer putting it in the correct gear before telling it what I want with the gas pedal."
March 2015,"""They don't make music like THAT anymore, eh?""I was rolling through southern New Mexico about that time (Dec '69) at 70 mph or so in an MGB at 1 a.m. when it was about 15 degrees outside listening to the same music, turned WAY up.Good times."
March 2015,"Where is it written that shift speed is the key factor? What about shifting when you want, how you want, skipping as many gears as you want, and changing your mind in the middle of it all, if traffic or other conditions warrant?Then there's the robustness (or lack thereof) of the transmission if one keeps the vehicle beyond the warranty period (I know, I know, who would be so stupid?). Even if the thing is under warranty, there's the PITA factor of bringing it to the dealer and picking it up. Then there's the how much does it cost to fix and how long does it take, once the thing packs up?Those who trade every 2-3 years look at many of these things differently than those of us who don't."
March 2015,"It's all good. I totally get what you say. Companies make what sells at prices they deem appropriate for return on their capital. If just a few lunatics want what I want and they still are not willing to fork over the money, there is no point. They make what will make them money, not what I, you, or three other people think they should make."
March 2015,"I know you were and it did, dino001 -- we're having a snow day here at the office, so I'm pretty much alone, no emails, no phone calls, just white death out my window. I could hardly be in a better mood and in no way didn't get the ""wink"".Sorry if I conveyed anything other than passion in my prose. Eccentric few is OK, I just happen to like the sound and fury of ""Lunatic Fringe (I know you're out there). See you on the other side."" -- Red Rider.I am a child of the late '60's and '70's (and so on), and a whole bunch of song lyrics just keep coming to the surface -- which I must attribute to the ""flashbacks"" (no not THAT kind) I have frequently since I spent over 6 years of my life as a Rock 'n' Roll DJ in lil' ol' Oxford, Ohio."
March 2015,"BTW, I disagree with all this mess being MY fault. Don't look at me, I did my part - all my cars, but one had manual transmission. I got a manual, I got sport suspension, I insisted on a factory order with everything I wanted, not the sales manager thought I wanted. So I did my part, yet they still changed that because others didn't. In other word, IT IS SOMEBODY ELSE at fault, namely all other self-described ""enthusiasts"", who couldn't wait six weeks for their car, or had thousand other excuses (my wife won't let me), so they took what was on the lot. So yeah, I will [non-permissible content removed] a little...BTW, I can't get 335 in a wagon. I can get it in a 435 Gran Coupe and that one is likely going to be my next car, unless I decide I can trade the price. I also can get 335 Gran Turismo, there is even a nice demo available today, but the steering is just awful. Can't bear it. NOT MY FAULT, NOT MY FAULT"
March 2015,"I was joking with the ""impolite"" comment. I guess the wink wasn't enough to convey the message... I can be a lunatic, why not. Will wear it as a badge of honor."
March 2015,"OMG -- I am not in any way, shape, manner, form or regard suggesting (for REAL) that we shouldn't express our opinions. For pity's sake, I was ranting -- sometimes I just get worn out reading posts about how things were better then than they are now.Sure it is possible that a product (and a car is a product) from 2000 or 1996 or even 2012 is superior in some way or many ways to a 2015 model. Overall, it is my belief that as time passes the products generally improve either by being more effective or more efficient or both.The thing is, somebody writes (while obviously wringing their hands) how they're so very very disappointed in the (speaking of automobiles) fill-in-the-blank's appearance, engine, transmission, seats, sound system, nav system, fuel economy, wheels, tires, brakes, headlights, tail-lights, side-lights, and on and on and on until I could just scream.If, for instance, you don't care for the Audi A4 2.0T (insert trim level and options here) because it has a 4-cylinder engine and a tinny sounding audio system and flat, non-supportive seats, well I would counter with either: Don't buy one or Option the thing up the way you want it including getting an S (and in some cases RS) model. Audi and BMW (again, to name just two) provide customers with extensive optional (or ""available"") configurations. ""The 'old' 3-series was better?"" Better than what? I would argue you can option the 3-series to provide the looks (within reason), performance, handling, creature comforts, etc, that will allow you to have it your way.Miss the i6 engine of yesteryear? Can't see yourself driving anything less than a vehicle with 6-cylinders? Get a 335. Better yet, get an M3 and stop being such a cry-baby. Me? I had to settle for an S4 with a 7-speed DSG transmission with a very nice B&O sound system and blind spot monitoring to say nothing of beautiful red leather seats. You'd think I'd gone daft were I to tell you my 1996 5-cylinder S6 was seriously a ""better"" car (even though it is a sentimental favorite).Have to have a stick shift? -- well maybe you can maybe you can't get one in the particular fill-in-the-blank you want; but, as has been correctly noted above, today's dual clutch automatics and even torque converter equipped 8-speeds can and will out-shift Walter Röhrl on his best day -- do you think you can do better? (and besides the reason there are no stick shifts has already been explained and it is still YOUR fault).The car you want in this era of virtual mass-customization probably does still exist. If you have to have analog steering with hydraulic assist, well, you'll probably have to buy a used car that may not have as many improvements as the 2015 or 2016 that you can buy off the lot, or better still order direct from BMW (or whoever).Yes, yes, we should and hopefully will be permitted to continue, letting of steam: Wishin' and Hopin' for the good ol' days.Gawd, some of us (and you know who you are) sound like my parents when I wanted to listen to the Beatles or Led Zep (or, heaven forbid, Pink Floyd): ""That's not music, its a bunch of barbarians, barbarians I tell you. Now Lawrence Welk, THAT's music Mark!""If you (and you know who you are) just can't take the direction BMW is going, find something else and buy it. What I am concerned about (and often representative of) is our becoming a bunch of curmudgeons or maybe even Luddites. Buying a 2005 fill-in-the-blank because that was the last year the arbitrary capillary was still used to keep the pressure evenly applied to the crank-knuckle, doesn't do anything for the advancement of the art and science of the automobile business (and we mustn't forget it is first and foremost a business).All I am asking is that you (we) don't adopt my dad's approach to rock music in your descriptions of your disappointments with BMW or Audi or even Acura for abandoning us, the faithful -- dear old dad used to say this about rock music: ""Noise, Bohemian tripe, bang and twang over-loud, barbarians at the gates of hell!"" It gave me such great pleasure when I came home (from my first quarter of college) for Thanksgiving having gone without a haircut for nearly 5 months and blasting (I turned it up to 11):""You need coolingBaby, I'm not foolingI'm gonna send, yeahYou back to schoolingWay down insideHoney, you need itI'm gonna give you my loveI'm gonna give you my loveWanna whole lotta loveWanna whole lotta loveWanna whole lotta loveWanna whole lotta love""They don't make music like THAT anymore, eh?Nothing Gold Can StayP.S. Lunatic fringe is preferable to eccentric few if you axe me.I remain: Often wrong, NEVER uncertain!"
March 2015,"I generally agree with you, Mark. I AM paying up (of course within limits of my abilities), I WILL NOT buy a car from a lot, just because it is a ""better deal"", if it doesn't hit my minimum requirements. There is no deal, if one gets not what they want. I also totally understand BMW's move. Calling me a part of ""lunatic fringe"" is a bit harsh  - perhaps ""eccentric few"" would be more polite . Unfortunately, both average Joe Sixpack and Joseph Broker want a car ""today"". They can't fathom waiting for one a few weeks. So dealers and manufacturers run their business for those guys' pleasure, not mine. I already feel lucky, when I mention a special order, I get a quick nod from a salesman saying ""no problem, all we need is XYZ"", rather than more typical deer in headlights looks. While I acknowledge BMW's right to do what they think is best for them, I also reserve myself a right to [non-permissible content removed] a little, if their choices differ from my preferences - just like with any other product we buy. There is no law saying we have to be ecstatic every time we buy something. Sometimes we buy a compromise - I venture to say most of the time. Ultimately, I know I have to adjust and get something closest to my ""ideal"" product. Doesn't mean I can't express in places like this, what I would like to see, or why I think that product is not available."
March 2015,"Mark....bravo.I have a little bit of a different view on a couple of points. Manual transmissions......frankly, I doubt there's anyone on this board that can shift faster than the current crop of autos. That's why we've been seeing performance numbers that are higher for autos than they are for automatics. Same goes for MPG (which isn't a ""nice to have""....gov't is making big MPG numbers a necuessity). Personally, I'd rather have a 4 on the floor big block to carry me around. Efficient? Not hardly. Heavy and unwieldy? Yep...pretty much. But, that's what I'd like.Point being, to gather market share, the BMWs, the Mecedes, the Infinitis, etc are all moving towards the middle. ""Let me have my 3-pointed star or my roundel, so I can get noticed. The rest? Performance? Handling? Who cares? That's not why I bought this car."" Those are the customers in this segment, now."
March 2015,"""We have met the enemy and he is us."" -- Pogo.I agree with the following statement made here by one of our fellow posters:""The more you want to sell, the more you have to appeal to average Joe, even if Joe has more than average income.""What I sense here, however, is that ""average Joe"" is meant to imply someone who, due to their lack of sophistication, and due to their sheer numbers has been at least partially responsible for the degradation of the ""essence"" of BMW automobiles (at least the 3 series apparently) ride and handling characteristics. Somehow I get the feeling here that I (we) am (are) meant to hold ""average Joe"" accountable and to blame for the sorry state of current BMWs steering and ride/handling characteristics.What BMW did was realize, apparently, that it is better to be popular with respect to your target market rather than attempt to appeal to what some have called the lunatic fringe. If you are the CEO, what is your charge? I would argue it is to first retain market share then to gain market share. If your loudmouth customers won't put their money where their mouths are, do whatever it takes to find the customers and prospective customers who will.Why is it so difficult, virtually impossible, these days, to find manual transmission cars? If you read what I read, you would think manuals are the best way to go if you want the best performance possible. Were I an auto manufacturer's CEO, and I read these posts and virtually all of the automotive enthusiasts magazines, I would start making stick shifts available all across my car lines. I would spend time and treasure to make certain my brand would offer stick shifts and that my dealers would be required to keep stick models in stock.My company would suffer, because as Pogo says, ""the enemy is us"" [sic]. All of us loudmouths who want stick shifts (based on our bellyaching) were all yak and no shak! Stick shifts aren't popular, they don't sell and if I listened to the lunatic fringe, my car company would die on the vine.Stiff suspensions and steering that offers road feel don't increase sales, in fact they must actually decrease sales or they would dominate.It is possible to order an Audi A6 with a sport suspension, ultra low profile tires and 20"" wheels -- and those tires would be max performance designation and be made of short tread life summer only compounds. You would think the benefits of the lower stiffer suspension calibration thicker anti-roll bars and the above mentioned tires and wheels would be so obvious that dealers couldn't keep A6's so built in stock. The reality is, the very few sport suspension equipped models are the slowest sellers. Pogo strikes again.I say we all need to go out and BUY the 3 series all tarted up with every performance enhancing option possible, ditto the Audi, Cadillac and Mercedes (and other brands) models.We need to shut up, grow up and pay up -- the cars you're (me too) bitchin' about are the way they are because of YOU. If you had forced the issue and actually put your money where your mouth is, well we'd have great performing BMWs (and the others, too) instead of the cars so many of us decry as ""not what they used to be.""The way they used to be is not responsive to the market.Qwit yur bitchin'"
March 2015,"BEing a staunch Acura and BMW lover, I was as shocked as anyone when I found the CTS to be more engaging to drive than either.My 3rd gen TL was good, but a bit darty on the road. Fun to drive, though. The 4th gen TL (Acura Shield grill) added to the previous gen in big doses. It was more sophosticated, suspension was much better, it was faster, smoother....just all around better.The current TLX I need more seat time in. But, it seemed to regress a bit over the previous version. Yes, it had all the tech....LED lights, shift buttons, 9 speed trans, quieter, plus it hit a price point with the 4 cyl that will appeal to many. But,, I came away thinking I enjoyed my 4th gen TL drive better.I do think RB is right. There are driving enthusiasts who do know what their car can do and the specs of just about every important function of the car. Then, there are those who just don't care. They just want a BMW or a Mercedes. They know what they're buying before they get behind the wheel of the test drive. They wouldn't know the difference between understeer or torque steer if you held a fire to their feet.Not saying any of that is bad. Just think the majority of sales by the likes of the German brands have little to do with how engaging their cars are to drive. It has more to do with the perception of themselves by owning one of those brands.Benjamin....the thing with a TLX, you'll not find a car with more tech in it on the road. It handles well (4 cyl and SH AWD versions). It's relatively quick. And, once you drive it off the dealer's lot, the only things you'll be back for is oil changes and tire rotations for most of its life. And if you do need something out of warranty fixed, you won't have to take a 2nd mortgage out. They get good MPG to boot. So, there's a lot to like.TLONG....have you driven the new TLX yet? Might be worth it if you're actually starting to look. Although, I can't knock you for looking at something like the Mazdaspeed 3, however."
March 2015,@benjaminh‌ - Benny interesting data thanks- good to see acura on the list. Amazing how many bmw 3/4series they sell(lease) and how audi doesn't make the list at all- wow - up here in newengland can't go a block without seeing an a3/4/5/6
March 2015,"Acura has been weak when it comes to cars. But maybe, just maybe, they are coming back?Here are the bestselling luxury cars for Feb:1. BMW 3/4 series 87482. MB C-class 70723. Lexus EX 41925. Infiniti Q 50 36496. BMW 5 series 36067. Acura TLX 3419http://www.goodcarbadcar.net/2015/03/usa-best-selling-luxury-autos-february-2015-sales-figures.html#moreNot very impressive, but the new TLX is in the top 11. I think there's a chance the new ILX might join it in the next 6 months or so. Time will tell...."
March 2015,"I drove ""bare bones"" 328i multiple times, as loaners, each time it was for a couple of days (they always kept my car for service overnight), so I got about a week's worth of standard F30 328. Still don't care for the steering. Yes, the car actually goes where I want it to go (suspension seems to be responsive and compliant enough), but lack of the feedback is pretty significant for anybody who ever owned cars like Subaru WRX, or previous 3-series, especially like mine, with sport suspension. Every time after those couple of days, or a test-drive of other 3-series derivatives in the market, including 335 or 435 (those were with MSport lines), I'm glad I can get back behind the wheel of my 328 wagon. It's not as fast, or fuel efficient, may be even a bit noisier, but the steering feedback feel is far superior. Why BMW changed it? Two reasons - fuel and market demand. The second one came from their desire to sell more and more units. The more you want to sell, the more you have to appeal to average Joe, even if Joe has more than average income. Americans like things soft, I cru through tears every time I read those comments about ""such harsh"" suspension on sport package, they clearly never drove Audi, whose ""sport suspensions"" generally consist of stones in places of springs  . But the steering was reporteadly ""too rigid"" for people - so BMW changed it. In America bigger and softer is still ""better""."
March 2015,Acura still makes cars.... @benjaminh - ? come on dude they only build SUVs - unless this is 2001 again
March 2015,"The least expensive A3 2.0 at my local dealer has a list of $38 k:http://audi.bluegrassauto.com/new/Audi/2015-Audi-A3-7f8b7d2d0a0a0002230841a6a420a379.htm?model=A3It looks very nicely equipped at that price, including a power passenger seat, Bang and Olufsen Sound system, push button start, etc. It's not clear to me if this one has a back up camera at that price, but it doesn't list it. Nice car! For less money than that, however, I'd probably consider an Acura TLX with the Tech Package for about $3k less in msrp. For that you'd get navi, memory seats, a hard drive for music, LED headlights, more room, etc. , although of course your don't get the Audi 4wd, acceleration, or prestige. Both are good choices, but serve different kinds of customers....."
March 2015,"The SQ5 with the supercharged V6 is much quicker and the S treatment just can't be replicated from the option list.The German SQ5 is a TDI -- now THAT would be the one. The US spec Q5 TDI is just not aimed at the customer who puts the performance Audi builds into its S cars first.The only thing that she thought was a worthy competitor to the SQ5 was the Macan S (we didn't drive the Turbo -- and yes I know they're both turbocharged -- since it was way more money than we had planned to spend); yet similarly equipped the Porsche was some $10K more and it didn't even have pushbutton start and the design of the Macan made is have less utility.An SQ5 TDI with an adjustable suspension and sport diff, now that would be something!"
March 2015,??
March 2015,Maybe I should join the BMW CCA and find out what this BMW enthusiasm is all about...
March 2015,"Honestly the ILX isn't that appealing to me, and the TLX when I sat in it is surprisingly similar to my current car which still is really nice. So I'm holding out a bit more. Believe it or not, I'm thinking of possibly a fully loaded Mazda 3 sedan as a poor man's BMW at a much lower price. I rented a 328 recently (I'm sure it was a stripper model) and I wasn't very impressed."
March 2015,"Mark, why didn't your wife choose the Q5 TDI? better MPG and more torque then the SQ5, and a lower price point too. If I was going to get a SUV, it would be either the Q5 or X5d. Hard to bed 400lbs of torque and mid 30's MPG..."
March 2015,"I'm lost on ""find a way to get this car, NOW!"". For 2016 BMW has ""supposed"" to have fixed the ""numbness"" in the steering, it wouldn't be like the E46 or E90 but better then what the F3x cars have currently. I drive the 320 the way BMW has intended it to be driven, as a daily driver, and the car does this well. I love hearing people tear apart BMW's, these are generally are people who have no real seat time in them, as I posted driving one for a day or two isn't really real seat time."
March 2015,"Exactly. I remember driving a pre-production E36 325i; I wanted one yesterday. It ticked all the boxes, as the Brits say. In contrast, yesterday I took my wife's 3er to my dealer for an Oil Service, brake fluid change, and front brakes. I strolled through the new car showroom and I saw absolutely nothing that gave me that ""gotta have it!"" vibe. The cars were not bad, just not engaging."
March 2015,I read that as well; Jaguar is joining Cadillac and Lexus in taking over some of the turf BMW has abandoned. I'll definitely give the XE a look.
March 2015,"@flightnurse‌ I think it is fantastic that you really enjoy your 320i. I don't think it is a bad car at all. I'm not disputing that it gets fantastic mileage or eats up hours of western US highways without a hint of driver fatigue. The car is comfortable and quiet. It is more spacious than the E90 I had. I just don't get that euphoric feeling inside that screams at me: ""find a way to get this car, NOW!"""
March 2015,"Jag needs to prove themselves, being a viable BMW alternative. So will Jag be giving away the XE for the first 6 months or so or will they play by the rules and gouge people on the leases? Time will tell."
March 2015,"This is simple, because we can. Some of the new tech stuff is cool, what is really nice is cars today are rolling computers in which one could code a car to have these new techie stuff without paying for them. The downside is, when you take your car into the dealer they will update your firmware if an update is out. How to side step this is, to tell your service managers NOT to update the firmware."
March 2015,"I don't know how it happened, but my wife's interest in cars these days seems to focus on horsepower and torque, all-wheel-drive, safety, handling capability (even if hardly ever tapped), some bells and whistles (but she thinks cruise control is the devil's own feature, refuses to use it) -- like blind spot monitoring, sat nav and voice commands for the phone and nav -- and, big wheels and tires (she has to have 20"" wheels and very wide, low profile Ultra High Performance All-Seasons).Sure, she wants good gas mileage and a reliable and durable car -- all wrapped up in a vehicle that meets her definition of ""soul."" Her SQ5 (and, truth be told, probably a Porsche Macan) dots all the ""i's"" etc. Her Infiniti FX35 -- a car that I thought was very capable, even though it lacked a 354HP supercharged engine -- was very well built, was reliable for nearly 60,000 miles (so I can't speak to its durability) and despite its thrashy engine note, was pretty much fun to drive (if you could stand 16MPGs). Yet, her Infiniti and my Acura TL pretty much made her run, not walk to the Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Mercedes, Porsche, Volvo and VW dealers to find a CUV -- a high performance CUV. The 300HP X3 was good, the Volvo XC60 Type-R was good, too, the Mercedes M class, VW Toureg and Cadillac SRX all had merit. We even tried the top o' the line Jeep Grand both with and without the Hemi. The MDX and RDX were also tested and quickly rejected.When we got to the 3,0T Audi Q5 there was a glimmer of hope -- and there we were torn between the Q5 and X3 -- until we test drove the SQ5. I've never seen $21,000 (the down payment on the $65K MSRP) exit the checking account more quickly -- I think the second test drive of the SQ5 sealed the deal.Yet, some here have spouses (or significant others) who are all about gas mileage or roominess for kids, dogs -- and all the stuff that goes along with kids and dogs. And, the good news is, we're all right -- the SQ5 is the best car, just as the MDX or the TLX or the 535 or the ATS or A4 quattro or even the lowly Accord -- all of these vehicles are the best for ""your"" circumstances and situations.When we get to the ELLPS and LPS class of cars, we are well beyond the basics -- we're into vehicles that are helping us in their own ways to self-actualize. That is what it is about -- finding the car that today will help you self-actualize. I'd add, if your spending on a new car doesn't help you even in some tiny way to self-actualize, you've NOT chosen wisely.One of the car magazines (Automobile perhaps, hell, I dunno, I subscribe to all of them for pity's sake), has a phrase they use ""No Boring Cars."" I think as we enter one of the later decades of life, we do actually start to believe ""now is the time to eschew 'boring' cars"" (and other things, but this is the place for cars, NOT for other things); we decide we can differentiate between an Impala and a CTS, we can appreciate a Panamera (even if we decide not to spend that much on a car).I've really enjoyed reading all the posts here (well mostly), for example the ones about the upcoming trip to Germany to pick up the new BMW, the good the bad and the ugly S4 issues, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat, so to speak. I do enjoy the many perspectives y'all bring to the party here. I love it when this forum is active -- even when time doesn't permit my participation.We are, if you axe me, in the golden age of cars -- almost limitless choice and hardly a klinker in the bunch.I now have 23,000+ miles on my '14 S4 -- today I lust for an S6, tomorrow I'll instead hope for a new, slightly larger S4 to be unveiled. All the while, I am impressed every time I get behind the wheel of my current car. Reading your posts about your adventures in car shopping (and some mis-adventures) is great fun, often informative and from time to time frustrating.Sorry to get so sentimental, but this forum is really a terrific outlet for those of us car enthusiasts whose appetite is larger than our bank accounts. It also has been, for me at least, a fantastic catharsis. As you were."
March 2015,"Just received my latest issue of C & D, brief test of the new Jag XE. Skimmed the article, sounds like those that pine for the 3 series of old may want to check out the XE! Not a lightweight, but per the review, drives like one. With steering/road feel!"
March 2015,"I think a 2.0 A3 can be had for about $33-34K, and that's with Quattro AWD standard. Why must one ""trick out"" a vehicle?"
March 2015,"As you say, by the time you fully trick out an A3 2.0 it's c. $42k. It's no doubt better than an ILX premium in many ways, but then again it should be at that price. For $42k msrp you can get an Acura TLX 3.5 V-6 with SH-AWD and the Advance Package, which has some features not found on the A3, plus quite a bit more room for passengers and cargo. Not everybody wants to pay $10-$15k more for a comparable ca, but Audis are no doubt great cars these days—in looks, performance, design, and features...."
March 2015,"markcincinnati- Mmy opinions pretty much align with this article, which essentially anoints the M235i as the true successor to the E46 M3- although I'm more than ""slightly annoyed that it’s not used on a broader range of the company’s products."" It's shrewd but cynical marketing on Munich's part, forcing enthusiasts to pay considerably more to get a car with traditional BMW driving characteristics. Even European drivers are unsure of which end their 1er is driven, so I suppose BMW figures why bother offering a better driving experience.Another problem is that the competition has become much more intense as the playing field has leveled. It used to be that great handling, supportive seats, decent brakes, and an engaging powertrain were the exclusive province of the Europeans, but not any more.For example, If I wanted an AWD performance car a BMW wouldn't be on my radar- a Golf R would be my likely choice, at least until the Focus RS arrives or Mazda offers their rumored AWD 300 hp MS3. While the M235i would be my choice if I wanted a great two door coupe, It's hard to ignore the S5, Mustang GT or 370Z NISMO which bracket the 2er at both ends of its price range. To each his own, but after 35 years of continuous BMW ownership I no longer many vehicles in their product line to be even remotely desirable..."
March 2015,"Imagine if you had access to a great relatively lower cost Audi mechanic or two, that could have properly diagnosed the issues with your old A4 on the first attempt only replacing the parts that actually needed replacing! I have access to such a mechanic and it's part of the reason I love Audi so much. Incompetent, or worse, dishonest mechanics can end up costing you a lot of money."
March 2015,
March 2015,"I think the 1.8 A3 is the lease special fleet queen badge buyer edition. Any car person in their right mind would pony up the extra $3K for a better, stronger engine that actually has better fuel economy to boot. In other words, the 2.0T is better than the 1.8T in every measurable way except weight. I know that makes the price gap larger, but that would be the more realistic comparison in my mind. Hey, I compared a TL-AWD to an S4 and opted to pay nearly $15K more for the S4."
March 2015,"The S4 has been guzzling gas in the city/freeway traffic I drive in lately. I take short trips, lots of traffic lights, and I can see less than 20 MPG with my lead foot in the S4. I'm not happy about that, but I know it is possible to get 30 MPG in the thing if you maintain a constant high velocity over large distances, and I'm very happy about that. Different driver, different results, but what kind of spectacular MPG did you get in your TL - SH AWD? To be fair, since the S4 is more powerful, it does tend to make a driver use that power more often IMO. More power = less fuel economy."
March 2015,"My wife is all about MPG. IF she doesn't get a TLX, it will probably be another Accord, but a Hybrid.Ditto for Mrs. Carnaught. We got 51.7 mpg with the last tankful, actual calculated mpg's. This is in all no-econ mode, and about 30% highway. Granted, we can expect a decrease this summer when the a/c is going, but for this size car with all its (Touring model) luxury features, is quite impressive. While hardly a performance machine, it is surprisingly fun and not a slug to drive as we found was the case with the Fusion Hybrid.Sorry for the digression from this forum."
March 2015,"tlong....for a long time, it looked like the two of us were carrying the Acura banner. It's up to you now. Actually, I may end up with another TLX sometime, but probably for my wife. Aside from the fact that I do believe they offer great value in the ELLPS space, they just don't break. And, they don't cost an arm and a leg to maintain. I do like the looks of the new TLX, but I also liked the previous version, too.Driving my wife's Accord, and driving (albeit breifly) a new TLX, I can tell the differences immediately between the two. Most of it is underneath, though. SH AWD and some obvious thought given to the suspension in the TLX and sound deadening, it's a different and better drive in the TLX.Not everyone will see it that way, though. They'll look a the dual screens on the dash and the motor similarities between the Accord and the TLX and declare the Accord to be the better value.Accords are nice, sporty, mainstream cars that are cheap to own and fix. The Acura is all those things too. But, it handles better, rides better, steers better, has better materials inside and out. And, if you want, a torque vectoring rear in their SH AWD version. Can't get those things in an Accord.Playing devil's advocate for a moment, a neighbor bouight an Accord Hybrid a few weeks ago. LOVES IT. Drives and handles like a regular Accord while getting 40 MPG. Impressive.My wife is all about MPG. IF she doesn't get a TLX, it will probably be another Accord, but a Hybrid."
March 2015,"Sorry. What is it, a 328xd? My brain was semi fried from last night's 2 hour & 23 minute commute home (32 miles)."
March 2015,"""....So I finally and grudgingly sold it and bought my current ride, an '05 Acura TL (now at 150K miles). The Acura has given me almost no trouble and it's a great car (and one of the good looking TLs rather than the later disasters), but it is still big and heavy and sloppy next to my A4. I really still do miss that Audi. But I really do like the reliability of my Acura.""10 years and 150k miles of almost trouble-free driving is quite impressive. Have you considered a new ILX or TLX as a successor?"
March 2015,"I'm gone for 2 days and this forum lights up...First I laugh at people who criticize cars and brand after a short drive. Second, I pity the fool (in my best Mr. T voice) for criticizing cars without really driving longer then 1,2 or 8 days. Lets look at the Geneses, Rick's Geneses has 65K miles on it, has only been in the shop for routine service. So basically flawless so far. So some of you say that people buy BMW's, MB's and Audi's because they want to prove something.. The Geneses is a very nice E class, for 2/3 the cost of a E class. I don't think anyone would say that the E class is a true sport sedan, and I wouldn't say the Geneses is one too, but after owning one for 3 yrs, I can say with fact that the Geneses is just as good as a MB E class or a BMW 528i (non line car.) Base price for those car's are 50K, a fully loaded Geneses can he had slight under 50K. The """"jittery"" suspension of the first Gen Geneses isn't a major issue, it's not a sport sedan and again it was never marketed as one. But if you were looking for a e class car, and price gave you a nose bleed, the Geneses was a great alternative. Again on the comments about F3x, it's great people write reviews on these cars with limited real seat time, this doesn't make them ""experts."" Having 25K miles on mine, I have to say, this car has exceeded my expectation. This is why I'm looking at the F33 4 series Grand Coupe, I wish BMW would import the 435d, this would blend power and efficiency to a whole new level. But I'll take the 435i, however, when I'm ready to order my car it will be the 440i. Are the new F3x cars softer then the E series, yes, the ""true"" enthusiast can not keep BMW and Porsche in business so they had to do something to get a larger pool of people. I mean, for the people who buy the CPO cars, how does this keep the manufactures open? They don't, they keep the dealers open, it's the people who purchase new cars are the one who keep the manufactures open. I had always said, the E39 5 series was the perfect size car, and the F30 is slightly smaller then the E39. So BMW has been working on the EPS (elec power steering) to get the feel back, this would shut up some people. I just got back from a trip, slightly over 400 miles, I averaged 36 mpg, no one complained about cramp rear seats, and the ""numb"" steering wasn't an issue in which I couldn't control the car going up and down the mountain roads of southern AZ. This is why Rick is getting a F34 328i GT, the car still has a very German ride to it, much more then his Geneses, the rear seats have more room then his Geneses and or a 5 series. Not everybody want a ride that is so stiff that there is a risk of losing their fillings. Since all GT's are xDrive, we are getting the Dynamic Handling Package this allows to have greater control in the x Drive cars when either the Sportline or M Sport lines are ordered (Rick is getting a Sportline GT.)"
March 2015,"Dude, you got to drive a 320xd? The only one imported into the US..."
March 2015,"I had a '98 Audi A4 and loved that car - V6 with a 5 speed manual. It was without a doubt the best driving car I have ever owned - smooth, sharp, and shifted like butter. But I got rid of it earlier than any other car I have ever owned - at 88K miles. It was already nickel and diming me with semi-expensive repairs - primarily a cooling system issue that the dealer couldn't seem to resolve but at $750-$1000 per visit while they kept replacing parts - thermostat, fan clutch, etc. So I finally and grudgingly sold it and bought my current ride, an '05 Acura TL (now at 150K miles). The Acura has given me almost no trouble and it's a great car (and one of the good looking TLs rather than the later disasters), but it is still big and heavy and sloppy next to my A4. I really still do miss that Audi. But I really do like the reliability of my Acura."
March 2015,"As to your first question, I will either seek out an older version or go to another brand; I like the M235i but I balk at paying around $3000 to get a true mechanical limited slip in a car that already costs north of $40,000- especially when such an ""exotic"" technology is either optional or standard on the GTI, Miata, not to mention every V8 ponycar. The vanilla F10 and F30 leave me cold, regardless of their horsepower, and my opinion is shared by much of the US enthusiast press(remember when Automobile and Car and Driver were constantly accused of being biased towards BMWs? When is the last time a non-M model won a comparison test?). Now you are absolutely right; the wearers don't care, and Munich apparently no longer does either.Fortunately BMW M is still cranking out decent cars. I think the new M3/4 is a return to form; I liked the E9x V8 but it drove like the true successor to my bitterly missed E24 M6- more a fast GT than a true sports car like the E46 M3. Ditto for the M5; the E60 V10 iteration was just a mess- the new car feels like it has a little E39 DNA spliced in.I have no problem maintaining my 2 older BMWs- one thing BMW still does right is provide for older models; thanks to BMW Classic I can get virtually any part I need for my 1975 and 1995 BMWs at my dealer's parts counter. If it isn't in stock I rarely have to wait more than 2-3 days. And when I bring my 1995 Club Sport in for service I still get a loaner."
March 2015,"@markcincinnati‌ Sorry for the confusion in my post. I wanted to write a little more, but got called away from my desk while eating lunch (happens A LOT since my name's on the door). While the time I spent with the E90 328xi was brief, it was nothing short of amazing. I had wanted a 3 series ever since I drove a friend's 1995 E36 328is 5MT through the streets of Buffalo late one night into early one morning. The car was just perfect. It fit me like a glove. At the time I didn't have too much stick shift seat time, but by the end of the night I was rotating the car car around corners.I liked my Acura TSX that I inherited from my wife when we bought a Pilot to accommodate our upcoming 3rd child (she's 3 now), but didn't LOVE it. I saw an ad for leftover 2011 328xi BMWs, crunched some numbers, test drove the car, & fell in love. An inflated residual, $2000 in trunk money, 2 additional $500 payment credits, plus a $500 BMWCCA rebate gave me enough ammo to convince my wife that I want it & it makes sense (and cents).My experience with the current crop of F30 3ers came when I brought my brilliantly balanced 328xi in for service. I drove a 328xi, a 320xi, & a 320xd. Nice cars. Very smooth riding. I'll even go as far as saying the 328 was MUCH faster than my inline 6's 230 horsepower. The chassis seemed to be stiffer. As an enthusiast, I just had little idea of what was going on. The car felt very disconnected.Since BMW has moved into making their cars softer, they lost the edge they had over competitors like Lexus.The scene at your BMW dealership on Saturday AMs is how things should be. Waxing poetically about their respective BMW. The truth is that inflated residuals, free maintenance, & low lease payments are what fuels the BMW brand."
March 2015,"Luxury market for Feb:1. BMW 25,2012. MB 23,6163. Lexus 22,9954. Acura 12,9925. Cadillac 11,7396. Infiniti 11,6597. Audi 11,4558. Lincoln 6164"
March 2015,"I would assume you were not the target buyer of the car you bought/leased. I know the Audi brand better so hopefully this is a reasonable parallel:The new Audi A3 -- even the S3 -- is not at all attractive to me. The new Q3, likewise, doesn't do it for either my wife or me. I'd bet even the eventual RS Q3 will not be attractive to us. Maybe it is the size of the A3, maybe it is that it seems a class lower in terms of the materials used throughout the interior. I would, therefore, assume if I were to acquire an A3, even the Prestige quattro version with the most potent turbo-4, I would be working hard to figure out how to ditch it at the first opportunity.Come to think of it, it probably isn't the size of the A3 or Q3, it is just that it seems too much like it is an Audi-light vehicle (and I'm not speaking of it's curb weight.) The CLA Mercedes and the BMW 1 series, likewise just don't do it for me. My wife was loaned a 1 series (and it had the turbo i-6) BMW -- I drove it, very powerful, but it seemed, somehow, ""cheaper"" in the materials it was made out of. The Q3, which we had for a day and a half earlier this year, didn't have the cheapness issue I noted in the A3, but it was way, way underpowered -- it felt like a Tiguan (doh! it is a fancy Tiguan, after all).All of our Audis have felt at least adequately powered, so the current Q3 seems like it was pulled out of the oven before it was done. Maybe I'll change that opinion once the regular Audi 2.0T engine is in place. The $50,000 S3 was twitchy, like a go cart is twitchy, it was noisy at speed on interstate 275, where I drive every day in my quiet S4. The vast expanse of black plastic on the dash looked like something out of the rental fleet at Budget, not something that the sales person has to say with a straight face: ""we can sell this one for $47,900!""So, you leased a left over BMW that was probably meant for a younger, earlier in their earnings arc, customer. You paid too little, got too little and were underwhelmed.On the other end of the scale, you may have been equally unhappy with an Audi A8 -- or BMW 7 series. These cars are developed with input from design, engineering, marketing, production/manufacturing and of course, finance. When deciding what to do, I would imagine those in charge decide ""there is a target market for an X5, an X3 and now an X1."" There's also a market, a narrow market I would imagine, for the X6. Those $70,$80 and $90,000+ 4-door German coupes from Audi and Mercedes are not marketed, I would assume, to a 23-year old with a freshly minted MBA from Ohio State or a 25-year old who just completed his/her JD from the University of Cincinnati College of Law. Is the wider net a good thing to do? I probably would have said no a couple or three years ago, but maybe now, the market is such that these premium makers want to get them (the customers) early (aka ""young"") and make certain there are upmarket models ""within the family"" to aspire to. My sales rep at the Audi Connection told me his wife wanted a new Audi Q3 -- he had to carefully market and sell his wife first AGAINST the Q3 and then move her thinking to the Q5 or Q7, stopping along the way at the A4 based allroad. Why? Well, the Q3 was ""not enough car"" for her as a Fortune 500 executive with three children aged from 12 to 15, a big dog (her husband) and a border collie. The Q3 would have been a fine choice about 14 years ago.And this guy sells cars for a living -- no longer are car sales people ""order takers"" (if they ever were).Hopefully you get my drift -- your expectations and your ""situation"" were not a good match for the leftover BMW you leased -- and it was a disservice to you to not shepherd you through the buying process. I think you weren't given what you needed to make an informed decision."
March 2015,"Hard for even me to believe, but on the strength of SUVs Acura slightly outsold Cadillac and Audi for Feb:Acura: 12,992 up 12.5% Cadillac: 11,739 down 12.6% Audi: 11,445 up 5.3% Perhaps re: Acura it's time to cue up Monty Python: ""I'm not dead yet!"""
March 2015,"I think a big part of what BMW has lost is that it has cast such a ""large net."" The current crop of 3 series cars just doesn't do it for me the way its predecessor did. 3 years ago I made a financially dumb move and traded in my 2010 Acura TSX for a leftover 2011 BMW 328xi. I drove the car once and figured out a way to make it work by leasing the 328xi for 2 1/2 years. Fast forward to today. If I still had my Acura (yes I'm a card carrying member of Chronic Car Buyers Anonymous) and said to myself just as I did 3 years ago: ""You know what, the incentives on this 320xi or 328xd are really strong, I've always wanted a 3er, so let me take a test drive..."" I would have left the dealership with a cold feeling. 175 hp 4cyl engine is ok for me in my $25K Legacy, but 140 hp turbo 4 cyl wouldn't cut the mustard in a $40K BMW 320xi."
March 2015,"RB - No, The one I recall compared a new M3 to an old M3 (old being a relative term). I do have a question - let's just say that the consensus of expert opinions favors the old over the new; what are consumers to do (assuming they want the car brand and model that has ""slipped"" during the transition from old to new)? If a 2009 BMW (or Mercedes, Porsche, etc) is superior to a 2015, many (perhaps most) consumers would still opt for the 2015 for reasons of reliability and durability (and factory warranty).And, in the tests that I recall, the real performance differences between the old and the new are often only most noticeable above 8/10ths -- a place where few ever drive their daily drivers. So, even those who long for an E vs an F BMW or an Audi B7 vs a B8, etc, can't really go out and get a ""new"" E or B7; and, probably most of them want a 2015 not a 2008, 2009 or 2010.I never had a V8 S4 -- and I'm told some were PO'd at Audi for changing to a super-charged V6. But I have nothing to compare my V6 T to in that regard, and hunting for a used S4 V8 is simply something I wouldn't even be interested in doing.So the question is/stands: What can or will ""you"" (or the consumer) do? Seek out the ""better"" older version? Go to another brand? Take public transportation?And, if newer models are actually better than the older versions and you just don't like the new ones, what will you do, boycott the company or fix and repair the old one until parts can no longer be found? Is moving to Cuba an option?"
March 2015,"Are you referring to this article?It concludes: the most significant change from the E90 to the F30 results from the switch to electric power-steering assist, which diminishes feel. Body roll in the two cars is identical, but the use of rear-suspension understeer instead of  larger tires in back may be why the new 328i feels less agile turning into corners. All of  it adds up to a softer, tamer 3-series that’s more about luxury than fun."
March 2015,"Recently one (or more) of the ""big"" auto magazines (I think it was C&D) tested an old vs a new BMW. I assume the genesis of such a test was the ever growing brouhaha -- ostensibly from the faithful -- claiming the newer BMW's have lost some of their BMW-ness as BMW goes on the ""soich for more money!""It seems, if memory serves, that the test reports demonstrated that the new BMW could better the old one in every significant (measurable) performance number.Once again, since I am not, at this instant, in possession of the test report article, I could be mistaken. What I think I recall, however, is that despite the cries that BMW has forsaken the true believers, the numbers say otherwise.I had been a die-hard manual transmission guy. Our Audis -- with the exception of my brand new 1997 A8 -- had always been manuals. My maxed out allroad (2003) had to be special ordered -- not that I probably wouldn't have anyway -- since the dealer simply did not stock stick shifts even back then. I couldn't believe Audi would simply no longer offer its cars with sticks (for the most part). The 2001 or 2002 A6 2.7T could be had with a stick but the same model with a 4.2 V8 was only offered with an automatic.My wife's 2005 X3 had to be ordered, too, since there were virtually no X3's on the dealer's lot so equipped. As I recall we couldn't even test drive a stick BMW period.When I got my 2005 A6, I knew I had probably enjoyed my last stick (the 2003 allroad 2.7T.) Going on the hunt, I found that BMW did offer at least some stick shifts but there was little chance of finding one unless it was special ordered.I now have a 7-speed DSG in my '14 S4. I, for the first time since 2003, don't miss the stick anymore.Most people -- that I know, excluding my wife -- don't even know how to drive a stick, so I don't see much value in complaining about that, and, besides, the DSG is so much better at shifting than I ever was and the shifts don't feel like they're robbing power from the engine.What we have today, if you believe Car & Driver (which I usually do), are better performing cars that have their performance characteristics available when you want them but invisible (for the most part) when you don't. Yes, even Consumer Reports notes that an Audi [A6] is able to be sporty -- which I assume is somewhat of a statement that other brands (that they list) are not sporty.I'm buying that today's fill in the blank (Audi, BMW, Mercedes & Porsche) automobiles are ""the best representations of sport sedans and CUV's ever on the market."" I'm, therefore, rejecting the notion that the old ones were better performers than the new ones. The fact that the brands have become more accessible to folks who don't think like I thought -- up until 2005 -- simply means the brands have the power to sustain themselves in the marketplace. Even if I really thought a 10 or 12 year old M3 was somehow better than a new one, I am pleased that BMW has ""cast a wider net,"" for I fear had they not, they would be going or already have gone the way of the dodo.The disdain so many have for sentimentality never ceases to amaze me -- my sentimental favorite car ever is my 1995 Audi S6 in pearl teal with a brilliant white leather interior. God I loved that car -- still have fond memories for it. It was, despite its being my favorite, no where near the car my 2014 S4 is -- the older S6 was, in perhaps every measurable way -- ""inferior"" to the new (or almost new) S4. My current S4 is the best car I have ever had, by a wide margin. I assume it would, in every measurable way, be crowned winna and champeen were it compared to the old S6 or even a last gen S4 (the one with the V8).These cars that we talk about here and have strong opinions about are the best they have ever been (in every significant and measurable way). The fact that BMW or Audi now attracts folks who don't know that there isn't a V6 under the hood of their BMW is sad (for me at least); but, I would argue that the ignorant owner is just as desirable (as a customer) to BMW as the one who knows there is a turbo-charged inline-6 under the hood. In the end, car companies must put the soich for more money ahead of the soich for informed, appreciative and passionate customers. The way they go about selling more cars, however, is to build better cars that can be appreciated both by the true and pure disciples as well as the bourgeoisie.Although I don't think the Koreans are TODAY too much of a threat to the world-order, I don't think we should dismiss them out of hand. They are making very rapid advances -- pretty soon they may find entry into the Premium Class (and by pretty soon I think we should be very watchful of the evolution of their products for the next 5 or so years.) I remember the first Toyotas that were imported (back in the 60's) -- made in Japan was, then, not much of a threat. It didn't take long until they were nibbling at US made market share, then they just started taking ever bigger bites until names like Toyota, Honda and Datsun were forces to be reckoned with.I got into a new Genesis sedan -- it wasn't a Mercedes -- but honestly, I do think it was a very interesting attempt to convince ""you"" that it was worth a second look. Whenever the 3rd gen comes out, I would look for some serious suspension evolution which could go a long way toward making us take them more seriously."
March 2015,"RB....I look at the Korean manufacturers more as a curiosity than anything else. I would like to get some butt time in a new Genesis, given that they've supposed to have fixed the ""jittery"" suspension issues of the previous gen. There seems to be this rush by BMW, Infiniti (with the Q), Mercedes to move closer to the middle, or to cast a bigger net, as you aptly put it. Audi has stayed pretty true to the luxury sports sedan mantra. And, a brand like Cadillac seems intent on taking care of the space that was vacated. In all frankness, I probably would have gone back to BMW after all the foibles with my S4. But, they transitioned into the F3x by then, and the drive to me was much less engaging with them. Plus, to get what I wanted, the prices really have sky rocketed on them to approx a $7K-$8K delta between my 335ix coupe and the just released 435ix equipped about the same way. Thanks but no thanks.I really have become smitten with the ride/handling engineering of the ATS/CTS. The Mag Ride Control is the real deal. Never thought I'd say soemthing the size of my CTS as ""flingable"", but it is. It's just one of those cars that I look forward to driving every day....even love the looks of it....the quality of it...the build of it.Still, I would like to get some seat time in the new Mustang GT or the Challenger with the Scat Pack. Not sure when, or even if I'd buy either. But can't say never. Never is a long, long time. It would be a 2nd (3rd?) car if I did."
March 2015,roadburner: Amen.
March 2015,"I have to say that I really did like Acuras up until the ""Beak"" design theme emerged- the RSX in particular.As for the Koreans usurping the German throne, I'd think that won't be a possibility for some time. Having said that, I recall a column I wrote several years ago where I noted that the Optima Turbo was a very nice car- and while it definitely was not a sports sedan, neither was an F10 528i.I also draw a distinction between ""enthusiasts"" and those who are merely ""enthusiastic.""The enthusiastic owner is like the person who gets behind a basketball team once they go deep in the NCAA Tournament- but is unable to name any of the starting five, never mind what position they play. There automotive counterparts are the owners with V6 Beamers; they think a port installed LSD is an intravenous hallucinogen and absolutely adore the electronic oil level sensor- that way they don't have to remember how to open the hood.. In contrast, an enthusiast at the very least knows the engine configuration of his/her car as well as which wheels are driven- and hopefully understands a few rudimentary handling terms. Sad to say, I have noticed that several more ""mundane"" marques are attracting an increasing number of true enthusiasts- if not rabid gearheads. BMW seems intent on casting a larger net while using ""bait"" that is becoming more and more bland."
March 2015,Business is good in Mark land.Years passed with little or no input. Now we have quite a bit. The economy is definitely improving in certain sectors.
March 2015,"My track days are over. But, I still like a good handling car. I'm not nearly as critical between FWD/RWD/AWD as the current enthusiasts are. There was a time it made a difference (like running at mid-Ohio years ago). Just not so much any more.These suspensions have become quite sophisticated. I do like the trick torque sensing rears of the Caddy, Audi, Acura. They truly allow rotation around any corner that really defies description.I also like the current trend of tubo/supercharging smaller motors to get more power out of less displacement. I had a Saab turbo in the '80s. That one was ""hit the gas....wait for it....wait for it....BAM....steering wheel jerked out of my hand if I wan't holding on, and in the weeds you could go. Fun.....for about a week."
March 2015,"It amazes me how quickly KIA (and specifically the Genesis ""brand"" on the other side of the house) has (or is it have?) started to make the case that they, someday, may give the current Premium Class members a rude awakening. As you might imagine, being an Audi loudmouth for so many years, I do participate in my share of (apparently) Audi sponsored surveys.I was surprised to see the number of questions some of these surveys contain that clearly indicate the Germans (or maybe it is just Audi, I dunno) are concerned that some Korean mfgrs are ""breathing down their necks.""Now, I said that last bit for emphasis, but there has been at least a seed planted in the German mfgrs minds that says, ""The Koreans are Coming, The Koreans are Coming"" (and of course I immediately add -- mentally -- ""Cover yourself with butter and carry lemons just in case. . .!"")But seriously, I saw some TV show on Velocity (I think) where a new Genesis (V8) was compared to a Mercedes E-Class and a Volvo S60. Now, at the time, before the video rolled, I thought, ""Whose dumbass idea was it to compare these three; they're not even close, no one would ever cross shop them?!""Turns out I was wrong -- the Genesis, although not exactly a great handling car, has had its suspension tuned by Lotus (sorta) and the thing had a very powerful and smooooooth V8 hooked up to an 8-speed transmission (plus it had all of the latest and greatest electronic safety aids and toys the Germans keep loading their cars with.) Considering that this 2nd gen Genesis was in its first model year, I had to marvel at how far they've come and how fast they've done it.I did think, too, Lexus was literally a trim-piece brand (and where are they now? First Place? or at least close to it) -- there weren't even any Lexi in Japan, they were all just called Toyotas. Now, look at Lexus -- a legitimate force to be reckoned with even if generally speaking some (OK most, OK, all) enthusiasts never have taken to them or seen them as anything more than sofas on wheels. Few, even the haters, laugh at Lexus now. And they actually brought that spunky little dude, the IS 350 F Sport to market and pantsed a BMW 335 (look it up, if you don't believe me.)It would be hard to argue that both the top of the line Genesis, Equus and KIA cars aren't making ""don't look back, those headlights gaining on you are Korean"" type sounds.So why isn't it possible for Acura to, likewise, kick butt and -- eventually -- regain some of its premium-ness? Of course, I don't KNOW, know, but I think, it is because they have found a niche where they have been and are successful, they make reliable and durable cars, their cars are in some pretty cool Marvel movies and the halo car has sex appeal. Have a cigar (and by the way, which one's Pink?)By the way, I do think the NSX will be a great ambassador for the Acura brand, I just am not sure I see someone rushing in and buying an RLX based on the fact that the NSX wears an Acura badge. The gap between the NSX and the TLX or even RLX is unlikely to be narrowed by an oooober expensive sports car -- if you axe me.Mean time, Genesis and KIA cars are quietly gaining ground and buzzing around the Premium Club members -- and you know what? Pretty soon one of them will sneak its way in and, then, well, there goes the neighborhood.  Human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together... mass hysteria! What next? Chrysler resurrects the Imperial? We're headed for a disaster of biblical proportions.Oh gawd."
March 2015,"markcincinnati: Your thoughts on the different cultures surrounding each make seem to me to be perceptive, funny, and mostly on target. Acura does have its own subculture of nerds and devotees, I think, but they tend to be more subdued and, as you suggest, more ""practical."" Acura is in the midst of a renaissance, I believe, as their products are now more performance-oriented and more innovative. Its seems doubtful that they'll ever catch up to the enthusiasm and popularity of the top makes, but I think there's a chance they could get closer. Just like for every other make, there are fan sites for Acura too, and some of the people there seem quite knowledgeable:http://acurazine.com/Even though Leonard Nimoy famously participated in an advertisement for Audi along with Zachary Quinto, which I imagine everyone here knows, in my mind Acura is the more ""logical and rational"" luxury brand. Perhaps for some Acura lacks passion at times, but as a long time Star Trek fan I somehow imagine that Mr. Spock might approve of some of their cars, as well as of their legendary reliability and longevity. And for passionate design I think there are few supercars more exciting at the moment than the new Acura NSX:http://www.acura.com/FutureVehiclesNSX.aspx"
March 2015,"roadburner: You are, of course, correct -- for the most part those who attend driving events are enthusiasts and often well informed ones at that.Earlier I had perhaps inartfully attempted to say that I noted the folks (customers) at BMW dealers did behave enthusiastically about BMWs and often cars in general and that I could not say the same was true at an Acura dealer (for instance). Even those ""dweebs"" who may incorrectly talk (gush perhaps?) about their BMW's V6 engines do continue somewhat to make the point -- the ""tone and tenor"" of the shoppers and buyers of BMWs and Audis is -- even when factually incorrect -- very much upbeat, excited and passionate. The only thing I have ever seen, however, that even approaches the dweeby-ness you suggest is when someone at the Audi store asks me if my S4 (with the V6 T badge on it) has noticeable turbo-lag or some remark indicating they are unaware that Audis V6s are super, not turbo charged. I correct them, of course and they then ask me why Audi puts the ""T"" on both the super and turbo charged cars.I give them the party line that is somewhat difficult to say with a straight face, we both shrug and I then tell them my S4 is both incredibly quick off the line and very fast thanks to the instantaneous response only a supercharged (or, granted, a naturally aspirated) engine can offer.Even the dweebs are excited at the Audi and BMW store is the point -- the folks [shoppers] at Infiniti of Cincinnati and Columbia Acura, well, they're more concerned with things like ""can I run it on regular?""Maybe I need to seek out a better class of dweebs."
March 2015,"I have to admit that Audis and BMWs are beautiful cars, at least to me. They call out to me in a way few other cars do. MB, however, has lost me with their, to me, ""mean"" looking styling of late. But looking at the reviews of the local Audi dealer just now I came across this:""Currently have my Audi A4 in for repairs. It has 57,000 miles on it, and I will be walking out with a $5000+ repair bill. This is on top of $1500+ I spent on repairs in the last 7 months....""Yikes! Acura stirs my emotions too, and part of that is the desire for reliability, durability, and low cost of ownership. If I want drama in my life I'll watch television or a movie. I don't need my car to give it to me lol!"
March 2015,"It's painfully obvious that you'd encounter enthusiasts at a driving event. You aren't going to meet the dweebs who talk about the ""powerful V6"" in their ""Beamer"" at the Performance Center or at a CCA HPDE."
March 2015,"I'm not sure folks buy BMW's so they can appear to be an enthusiast -- I'm pretty certain a lot of BMW shoppers (and ultimately buyers) aren't really all that aware, even, of BMW's reputation in that regard.I would suggest that for some BMW's have the reputation as being ""the best"" -- so someone lusts for a BMW for a few years and then when that first ""big jump"" in comp or first ""big hit"" in an investment banking transaction that they were part of gives them that high five figure or six figure bonus comes along, well they go for ""the best"" which they think is a BMW.My suspicion is that someone buys (or leases) a Porsche because it will make them appear to be an enthusiast, or, perhaps even more likely, they really ARE an enthusiast. Or, and I hope this isn't really the case, someone buys that RS7 or 911 to suggest a certain size attribute of a body part. Or, the car is acquired simply to demonstrate the size of your check-book balance.I read an article about people who seek speeding tickets so they can brag -- obtusely -- about their income, as in ""I can afford that [speeding ticket]."" That's inane -- maybe even insane.Yesterday we were out and about in snowy Cincinnati -- only 4-wheel drive vehicles seemed to be venturing out -- I saw an A8L and my comment was, ""I don't care how much money we have, how big the bonus is, etc, don't ever get an A8 for me."" Sure the car suggests something about the owner's income -- but were I to think about spending inordinate sums of money to haul my skinny (or fat, as the case may be) butt around (mostly with no one else in the car with me), my choice would be an S6 -- pretty much the ultimate sleeper car if you axe me. Probably only a very few would even know of its somewhat lofty price tag, as a matter of fact. But that's just me. My friend buys A8's and never has any passengers in them -- I am so tempted to inquire if he has more money than sense. I just keep my mouth shut.The folks I [superficially] socialize with at either the BMW Store or the Audi Connection here in River City, actually seem to be very much into Audis and BMWs and cars in general. They know, sometimes, as much as the sales personnel, about all of the cars ""in the BMW or Audi family."" My wife and I attended a 2-day driving school in Spartanburg SC with a group of folks from all over the US and most of them owned both BMWs and non-BMWs and were very much car aficionados of the highest order.I'm thinking folks buy these cars because the cars have earned the reputations as being the best -- some folks may think that means the best performing, some may think most luxurious. I've never met anyone who bought one to ""look like they were a 'brand-name-here' enthusiast"" though.But, I could be wrong."
March 2015,"While I do love a debate even a non-mean-spirited argument, I perhaps should perhaps attempt to clarify at least some of my previous comments in response to: "". . . for those who don't need the prestige of the German makes, or to have their cars talked about . . . .""I am certain there are indeed car buyers who buy a brand for ""prestige."" There are perhaps business people who believe they must wear Armani suits, Prada shoes and sport Rolex watches on their wrists, and drive ""appropriate to their station"" autos for at least the reason that their clientele expect it of them. We may have become more shallow as a group of people overall (those of us in much of the world, not just the US); that is a debate for another place and time. The thing is, the folks [executives, C-level folks and VPs on up the chain] who hire corporate lawyers, CPAs, brokers, investment bankers, architects, interior designers, consultants and so forth would probably have different perceptions of the professional they were about to engage or the senior manager they were about to hire based on some of the candidates accoutrements.Perception is reality so the saying goes.You may be correct that a top o' the line KIA or Equus is virtually every bit as competent and luxurious as an S class, 7 series or A8L, but the market perception isn't there yet.The point is not that someone may buy the car for the prestige -- although they may -- the point is that some force (""may the force be with you"") has imbued your Rolex watch with certain ""characteristics"" that set it apart from my beautiful, equally functional and competent-as-a-timepiece Tissot.Given a choice, better yet, we've [all] learned that given a choice of being gifted with a new Impala LTZ or a somewhat like-sized BMW 5 series, we ""should"" pick the BMW. In the same vein, given a choice of an Acura RLX or a Mercedes E class, well, the Mercedes will be chosen over and over.These assignments of prestige were earned somehow (weren't they?)-- is it possible it is because the E class or BMW or whatever has earned a reputation for inherent goodness and/or desirability and value that the RLX just can't compete with? I don't know why an individual thinks they ""need or don't need"" prestige in their attire, car they drive, club they belong to or college they attend. I don't even care, really. What I am on about is how the thing -- that objet d'art -- perhaps got to be that way. BMW's for example, may -- today -- no longer be the performance machines worshiped by some from an historical perspective. Perhaps BMW and the other [snooty?] Germans [and the people who buy them?] are simply resting on their laurels. Perhaps they are the naked emperors now. I wouldn't bet against them quite yet, however.Perhaps Acura, Infiniti and Lexus (soon to be displaced by KIA, don't you know) will be dubbed the new Premium players by the cognoscenti of cars at Automobile, Car & Driver, Motor Trend, Road & Track and yes, even Consumer Reports. Look at the new CR magazine (best and worst car issue) and see where the Audi A6 comes in, just for the fun of it.Most of us don't need our cars to be talked about. None of us wants our cars to be talked about as a negative reflection of us, however. But, we certainly don't mind if our cars (and the other stuff I mentioned above) paints us in a light that is positive. The real estate sales person who takes you around looking at houses in her new Q7 or Escalade may -- for good reason, who knows? -- make you feel like a winner compared to the sales person who drives you around in his obviously not new Chrysler 300. The lawyer who -- well you get the picture -- gives you confidence is probably the one who appears by some societal/cultural measure to be successful.People need what they perceive they need -- and part of that perception of a given product comes from something the product has done to earn a certain reputation (prestige, some measure of prestige or lack of prestige altogether).Cars are where they are due to many factors -- Acuras, not to pick on them, do not ""suggest"" the same thing as BMW's, for instance. You may or may not call that prestige, performance, price or even presence. Today, it is very, very likely that given a choice of a new Acura or BMW, ""most people"" will choose BMW.The names Acura, Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Porsche, Cadillac, Lexus, Toyota, etc, etc, etc could have been used as substitutes in some of the preceding. It is not my intention to savage Acura or inordinately praise BMWs. Personally I am an Audi fan of the highest order. Between my wife and myself, we have owned American, German and Japanese cars since 1969 (mostly German, full disclosure). My experience with Acrua was, overall, positive -- and my TL was, in my estimation, Acura's somewhat successful imitation (bargain) Audi S4. I have no axe to grind with Acura, that is.However, therefore, notwithstanding: I do notice that I am accorded certain societal, er ""perks"" when I wear my Breitling watch vs my Swiss Army and when I wear a certain designer sport coat vs Jos A Banks and when I arrive in an Audi vs an Acura or Infiniti. It's also better to be sporting a Mont Blanc pen instead of a Cross. It's better to be using an iPad than an Acer, And, it is better to order Ornellaia than E. & J. Gallo.It just seems that we have arrived at a point in time where the Germans -- for whatever reason -- rule. Cadillac is on the rise, Acura is on the wane and both Infiniti and Lexus need to further rationalize their offerings, although Lexus seems to be doing just fine, thank you very much. Just remember, good is the enemy of great.Acura makes good cars.More's the pity."
March 2015,"Enthusiasts used to buy BMWs because they were great cars. Now many new buyers select a BMWs so that they appear to be an enthusiast- like the clown I met at my dealer's F30 intro; he informed me that ""I like automatics- I want to get in the car and not have to do anything."" (And I'm not slamming automatics- I'm slamming that pathetic reason for owning one)I'm seeing more and more friends in the CCA(many of whom are long-time members) moving to 911s, Caymans, and CTS-Vs or V Sports- not to mention Boss 302s or Z06s."
March 2015,"I don't know that I'd go so far as to say there's something special about German cars. I think after you own cars for awhile, and you've owned lots of brands/models, you see the differences in materials, engineering, build to be differentm, but not necessaily better, from one marque to the next.Granted, BMW and Mercedes seem to do things differently than say Acura, or Infiniti (and certainly different than Cadillac). For example, try using the shifter in the BMW 5 Series or the column dhifter in most Mercedes. You kind of go....""who thoguht that was a good idea?"".Audis better in that regard. But still, there seems to be a level of complexity in the German makers that isn't really necessary. Never owned a Mercedes, but in my Audi and BMWs, I attribute that to why maintenance and repairs are so high compared to an ATS, or CTS, or TL, etc. Does it make a BMW, Audi or Mercedes better? I've yet to see any evidence of that.All that said, I do understand the appeal of BMW. I liked the ones I had, quite a bit. The dealerships are top notch. Their cars, while moving away from what I want in an ELLPS, are still top dogs in the category.Lots of competition in the space, though. Plenty for everyone to choose from. And, they're all good entries in the space."
March 2015,Of that I am certain.
March 2015,"markcincinnati: You make some good points. But for those who don't need the prestige of the German makes, or to have their cars talked about, Acura might be a choice again now. Maybe a small part of the lack of buzz for Acuras in your area is that they are actually made right in Ohio lol? Once the Acura NSX is launched later this year, might it inject a small amount of buzz into the brand?"
March 2015,"Few A3's (at least in our climate in SW Ohio) will not be quattros. Also, I would think there won't be that much cross shopping of these two cars -- and I admit there is a good chance I am wrong. There is something special about German cars -- eloquently described elsewhere by both the pro-writers and us amateurs -- that makes me think most ""Audi"" shoppers will first cross shop the other Germans, then perhaps another European brand, then, maybe, a Japanese brand. I asked the Audi dealer who (the brand) they compete with. The answers depended on the car, of course, but the A3 and ILX were never mentioned in the same sentence. Now, granted, this is a data point; and this is perhaps indicative only of Cincinnati shopper's habits. The names (brands) brought up included BMW (doh!), Mercedes and Porsche -- the Macan vs the Q5/SQ5 for instance. Acura's today inhabit that unenviable position where Audi used to live: Acuras are Hondas when spoken of; Audis used to be Volkswagens as recently as 20 years ago. It wasn't until Audi moved farther and farther away from being a VW that knows somebody, that they were able to break into the Premium class. Acuras, so I thought, had made some pretty good inroads into no longer being ""fancy"" Hondas -- remember the RLX from the not too distant past? Now, they've slipped -- and for all I know the slippage is deliberate -- and gotten closer to their Honda roots. Simultaneously, Honda has kept moving forward and upward at a pace that Acura has apparently not been willing or able to keep pace with.Don't get me wrong, I can't pinpoint something with respect to my 2012 TL SH-AWD Advance that I can blast other than its ugly beak. Yet, just the reaction to the car itself was underwhelming. No one ever seemed to have any curiosity about my TL. The day I drove my new S4 into the office, however, folks were all over the thing, asking questions and showering it with praise.The point is folks here in Cincinnati at least will fawn over a BMW, Mercedes, Porsche or Audi and will hardly give an Acura or Infiniti the time of day. The Lexus IS 350 F sport, however, will attract car buffs and elicit questions -- as will a Cadillac ATS.Maybe it's just that Cincinnati is a German town -- sister city to Munich, after all -- but at this point in time, Acura's just can't get no respect. I think were I somehow in a Bizarro world shopping for an ILX, I'd probably run, not walk, to the nearest VW dealer and look at a new VW CC R-line instead."
March 2015,"Well, time will tell. The outgoing model consistently lost every comparison test to the Buick Verano, much less the A3. Once the usual car magazine introductory hype dies down it will be a better time to assess."
March 2015,"The 2016 Acura ILX has a new engine and transmission, as well as several other improvements. Previously it wasn't very competitive at the entry level, but now I think it is. The most direct competitor is the 2015 Audi A3 1.8. Both are good cars, but here are few comparison points....2016 ILX base $27,900 msrp0-60: 6.2 (according to C & D)hp 201 trunk: 12.3 8 speed DSG 29 mpg comb 2015 Audi A3 1.8$29,900 msrp0-60: 6.5 (C & D)hp 170trunk 106 speed DSG27 mpgEach one has advantages and disadvantages when it comes to standard equipment. The A3 has standard leather, standard XM in a better standard stereo, and split folding rear seats, none of which comes standard on the ILX.But the ILX has standard the following things that I think are lacking on the base A3: moonroof, heated seats, LED headlights, rearview camera, smart entry/putshbutton start, USB port, 2 years longer power train warranty, Siri Eyes Free, etc.Obviously somewhat difficult to compare, but I'd say that the ILX standard things are ""worth"" substantially more to me than the standards on the A3.If you add a moonroof, pushbutton start, heated seats, back up camera, etc. to the A3 then the price seems to inflate to c. $36k or so. But the Acura model that would compete with that would be the ILX premium which is c. $30k msrp. That is a significant price difference.The Audi has a lot more prestige than the Acura, but the ILX is likely to be more reliable and have a lower cost of ownership than the A3.Yes, the ILX is based on the Civic, but then the A3 is based on the Golf, and so I don't see much of a difference there. Both are good cars, but I do think that Acura is back in the game with the 2016 ILX."
February 2015,Mark I'll take you up on that offer and the Neuschwanstein Castle is mandatory when during a BMW ED..
February 2015,"Good GT=V6's are out there just got to pay for them, just like the NSX's..."
February 2015,"Have you ever been to Munich? If not, I can offer up a couple of restaurant recommendations that are equal to or better than restaurants in New York, Paris, London, Prague and Warsaw. If you're going to stay in country for more than a few days, I can also suggest a couple of relatively close destinations that are breathtakingly beautiful.If you want to spend some time in your new BMW on the autobahn while heading toward one of the best little towns on the planet, I urge you to drive about 45-60 minutes south of Munich to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, spend the night in the magnificent Hotel Reindl Partenkirchner Hof -- make absolutely sure you make dinner reservations at the hotel's restaurant, or risk being turned away -- the meal at this restaurant is worth planning, scheming and dreaming for. The next day you can take the ski-lift up (and in July the view will be spectacular) where the 1936 winter Olympics were held. Then you can take another even more breathtaking cable car ride up the Zugspitze where you can have lunch and walk from Germany to Austria as the border cuts through the mountain. If you have time -- and I would urge you to make time -- you can drive your new BMW to Füssen and visit Neuschwanstein Castle. After that day you can either drive back to Garmisch or motor on into Innsbruck, Austria or back to Munich.If you want some restaurant recommendations in Munich, let me know.Have fun -- that's another thing Germans know how to do so well."
February 2015,"Nice! I'm a bit of an Alfa guy and that is one I've always admired, but I was too late to the party and finding a nice one is damned near impossible. I've run across a couple in the past decade, but never at a time I could do anything about it."
February 2015,"Mark, when it comes to cars, for me, my all time favorite care was my Alfa GT-V6, it was a poor mans Ferrari.. Talk about soul!!Rick and I were at the BMW dealer this week, we are starting the European Delivery (ED) of his 3289 GT, while we were there a gentlemen was there taking a redeliver of his M6 Grand Coupe which he did the ED, it was great listening to his stories. Mark, you are right you don't hear that at the Acura or Infiniti Dealers. BTW, Rick's 328 GT will be a 2016 and we are shooting for a July 16th delivery at the Welt."
February 2015,"Some may recall that when I wanted to go ahead and get a 2014 Lexus IS350F with every option box ticked off (in metallic white with red leather), my wife said, ""we tried the Infiniti and the Acura, it just seems that they ain't got no soul . . . "" We test drive cars and seek out new restaurants as damn near professions as any hobbies could ever be -- so when it came time to drop the Acura and Infiniti, we seriously went into test driving as THE weekend event for a few months. Here is what we noticed: Audi, BMW, Porsche and (to a lesser extent) Mercedes owners participate in ""clubs,"" attend driving schools, take road trips en masse, make trips to Germany to visit the Holy Land (the factories where their cars are made) and spend a fair amount of their disposable incomes on logo'd shirts, coats, key-fobs, ball caps, wrist watches, wine glasses, beer mugs and other branded memorabillia. Acura, Infiniti and Lexus owners? Not so much.So, maybe my wife was onto something -- data points suggest the above mentioned Germans attract buyers and have owners who are passionate (they have soul perhaps?) about their favorite car brands. Other than some key fobs and a narrow selection of ball caps, only the local Infiniti dealer even had a Branded Boutique of items touting their owners love of their brand's cars. The BMW store, in Cincinnati, offers free car washes -- so what you say? Well, arrive at the BMW store bright and early on a Saturday morning and you will see a line of BMW's, perhaps 20 cars deep, waiting to be hand washed -- sometimes the wait is hours. The customers park their cars, take a claim ticket from the attendant and gladly walk up to the service center's lounge where there is free Starbuck's coffee, all kinds of beverages and snacks and even portable DVD players and headphones with a choice of movies. Often the folks chat about their adventures in their X5's or the pleasure they had picking up their cars in Spartanburg and driving back to Cincinnait. Some folks regale others about their European delivery pick up in Munich and the fun they had driving on the autobahn.Sitting in the Acura waiting area didn't even come close -- and there was no waiting room at the Infiniti dealer.Somehow, the Germans seemed to have cracked the marketing code to imbue their cars, dealerships and, most importantly, their customers with passion -- soul -- for their fantastic creations.As the sign at the BMW dealer reminds: ""Don't Forget to Breathe!"" Me? I'm heading over to the quattro cafe to check out what's in the fridge and what's playing on the big screen TV. God, I'm such a geek."
February 2015,"I did like my TL SH-AWD Advance. I thought it was ugly, and the interior looked like a Honda that knew somebody. The air conditioned seats were great. The power was good, nothing to scare an S4. The brakes were very weak. The doors sounded tinny when closed. It was a beer to the Audi's champagne. Yet, much as most folks would never cross shop these two, it was Honda's bargain basement S4.I have to assume the new TL is an improvement. Mine, a 2012, had way too much FWD feel (torque steer), something the S4 doesn't have.I don't have the S's sport diff (torque vectoring rear diff), wish I did, but I would assume if I did, I'd love this thing even more. This car and my wife's SQ5 have become our favorite Audis and our favorite cars -- and we've had dozens -- of all time. I want to say nothing even comes close -- but our BMW's have been close (and even a couple VW's were a blast to drive, but still none are the performers of these S's.) I used to think they (Audi S cars) were too expensive, but compared to 3-series, well it seems these Audis are ""within reach"" of most folks who shop and buy the cars discussed on this forum.If you ""can't see"" or ""don't share"" our (my wife's and mine, i.e.) passion for the Audi S's, I would say the TL or TLX SH-AWD with anything that increases the performance/handling ticked off on the option list, is not a bad alternative (if you can get past the styling and the Honda content.) But, for the money, the Acura may be attractive to you because it will almost certainly stay south of $50K..If you can't stomach the TLX's looks and the Audi leaves you wondering what I see in them, well, the C class Mercedes, too, looks like it is worth a second look -- and I've always had a soft spot for the Volvo S60 type R.An observation: many who write here about their cars make remarks like ""my TL gave me 6 trouble free years."" My irreverent side almost always reads, ""my TL gave me 6 [bland, boring, unremarkable, invisible] trouble free years."" If I remarked to my wife that she has given me 20 plus years of trouble free cohabitation,"" she'd have every right to punch me in the nose.I want 6 trouble free years, too, but I think I'd take 3 spectacular driving experience years instead.That's why I always say: Drive it like YOU live. Life's too short to not have at least some trouble!"
February 2015,"Me too- gone but not forgotten TL SH (diamond white pearl), six trouble free years."
February 2015,Count me in as a TL-SH AWD fan. I like the pre & post face lifted versions too.
February 2015,"I get people not liking the styling of the TL. Personally, I did like it. I thought it was bold and unique, which suited me fine. I've owned both the S4 and the TL SH AWD. TL SH AWD is mighty close to the Audi. No, the TL wasn't as fast as the S4, but it was every bit as adept in the handling dept and was very confidence inspiring to drive. It matched the S4 in the feature category. Service costs on the TL vs the S4 were miniscule in comparison. MPG was certainly better on the TL vs the S4, too. And, for the money I paid (under $40K) for the TL SH AWD Advance it offered huge value.Don't get me wrong, I liked my S4. Didn't like the reliability (lack thereof) of the S4 and didn't like the MPG, nor the maintenance costs, either."
February 2015,"Sweenydog, I am going to price out the lease on the Q next week. I'd have to add the mileage hit up front since the cheap lease is for 10K miles/yr and I drive 15K."
February 2015,Consumer Reports said it best about the TL. Looks like it got it with the big ugly stick
February 2015,I would say the best reason to get rid of the TL was its awful looks- people can talk about how close it was to the s4 but in actuality it wasn't - ugly fat and boring - no way to go thu life.
February 2015,"I did notice a better feel from the S4's 60/40 RWD emphasis with the AWD system, that does make it feel better and more RWD-like. On the TL-SH-AWD it felt FWD and when you gassed it, you could feel, AND see even graphically on the screen how it shifted some torque rearward, but most of it always started out in front. Just one more reason why I felt the S4 was worth the extra dough."
February 2015,My case and done
February 2015,Best car for money
February 2015,I love the anti acura stuff
February 2015,I think AWD is only available with the slushbox.
February 2015,Yes the Regal they recommend is FWD. You can get it with AWD and stick if you want.
February 2015,"Is the Buick FWD?If not, maybe there's something there. If so, I guess it's best among the available appliances.Need I ask if it's available with a manual transmission? Didn't think so."
February 2015,"I haven't driven a GS, but to say it's a more engaging drive than an F30 328i is kind of damning with faint praise..."
February 2015,Aside from the NSX I never gave Acura the slightest bit of consideration; when I'm spending $35k or more FWD cars and FWD biased AWD cars simply aren't on my radar.
February 2015,I could never drive an IS AWD with that giant hump where my ankle gives. I can't believe anyone will buy one with that. Absolute deal breaker for me!
February 2015,"I just saw a blurb last night that I think came from CR. Now, aside from appliances and lawn mowers, for which I seek out their ratings, for cars I don't use them all that much.That said, they made a point that they liked the Buick Regal GS as a better luxury sports sedan than they do a BMW 328i. Pretty big leap there. But it does show how the American brands are roaring back into the Luxury/Sport arena.I mentioned in another thread that the IS350 F Sport would have been on my radar before I pulled the trigger on the CTS. I was at the auto show locally last weekend and found the Lexus to feel a bit claustrophobic. The GS350 F Sport was much more to my liking.So, I guess I'm moving away from the ELLPS vertical onto the next step."
February 2015,"I remember late '90s/early '00s, I thought of Acura as an aspirational brand, out of my price range at the time but something I might consider later on when I could afford one. Now they are not on my radar nor are they in any way appealing."
February 2015,"I just saw that the Honda President was either fired or resigned recently due to the airbag recalls, under reporting crash data, and a couple of other things. The article I read said he had navigated Honda/Acura through the Global recession, the tsunami in Japan (where a lot of vehicles were lost and manufacturing facilities were destroyed) as well as some other catastrophies.I guess this means they don't really care what monumental obstacles you face, deliver to the bottom line or your gone.Personally, I think Honda got away from what they did best with Acura. That is, be a leader in engineering, performance, design, technology and value in the luxury vertical. RLX (and the RL before that) hasn't been relevant for over a decade. As good as the TL is/was, it was not the most handsome car on the road. The new one is better. Acura really didn't have an answer for the Integra's demise. By default, they became a luxury SUV company. It seems past those who view an Escalade as having ""made it"", the MDX is the lux SUV of choice with the upper middle class. I still like their products. Whether it was because they never did recover from the tsunami, they felt their brand would be better served by moving more towards the middle of the market, or whether they lost their desire to lead, they seem to just be missing the mark with their cars. I hope they continue to fire products at the segment because it's hard to find cars that are as well built, drive so nicely, are as bulletproof reliable, and are good values as my Acuras were. Unfortunately, that's not enough these days."
February 2015,Acura sold 2900 TLX's in January compared to 1400 TL's and 900 TSX's in January 2014 - so about a 25% jump compared to the old models it replaces.
February 2015,"We drove a MDX and Jeep GC the same day, I liked the ride in the Jeep over the MDX, talk about uninspiring to drive, and the MDX is their best seller... Your right the RDX was new in 2013, but the refresh will make it more competitive then the MDX.."
February 2015,I saw some promo pricing on the TLX advertised on the weekend. First time I have seen them with trunk money.
February 2015,"No disagreements with you or Mark. Test driving the Q50, it was like they couldn't make up their mind whether they wanted it to be a sports sedan or a luxury sedan and ended up with neither.Acura is moving to the soft side like it seems every other alleged ELLSS (with the exception of Audi and Cadillac) is heading....soft. Still, Acura TLX is going to sell 45,000 TLXs in '15. Is there enough of a delta between an Accord and the TLX? Not sure. Drove a TLX. It drives differently from my wife's Accord. Enough to justify the price difference? I still like them. $45K at the tippy top end for a technologically rich, 6 cyl with AWD and torque vectoring rear seems pretty compelling."
February 2015,"the MDX was just fully redesigned for 2015 (or was it 2014?). How did that get long in the tooth already? Plus I thought it was selling quite well. The RDX came out for 2013, so this is the normal time for it's mid-cycle refresh.I wonder what the sales are on the TLX? I don't recall seeing any #s. It is a nice car, and certainly a good value. And $$ speak. I also think the refreshed 2016 ILX is going to help that model immensely. The RLX, however, is a lost cause."
February 2015,"I think Acura still have problems, their two best sellers are the MDX and RDX, the MDX is long in the tooth and really isn't competitive in the market (but the lease payments are lower then the competition) and the RDX just got another refresh.. I liked Acura better when they had the Legend and Integra."
February 2015,"A sub-vented lease can be a better deal than buying for many folks.Years back, Jaguars leased for STUPID numbers (very very low per month) -- the cars were discounted, but not enough to justify NOT leasing. The odd thing is the leases were closed ended which meant there was no risk for the person who leased with respect to residual value.Here's how they did it (or at least how it was done by some mfgrs):The lease price of the car is the cost of the use of the car for X months (lets say 24 or 36). To determine the lease, the financial arm went ahead and jacked up the residual value of the car to something IMPOSSIBLE let's say 70% of MSRP. Then they took the 30% of MSRP and divided it by 36 or whatever to come up with a crazy, artificially low (sub-vented) lease price per month. In some cases what they did was purchase an insurance policy to guarantee the 70% or at least some part of the 70%. Then they made the lease have a get out early penalty that pretty much meant you had little choice but to keep the car the full 36 months or you would pay through the nose. In some cases you actually had to keep the car -- you could NOT simply make the remaining payments to get off the hook.Yet, for those that wanted an $80,000 (pick a car) for $399 per month with no money down, there was simply no way a purchase made any sense.Now, Infiniti certainly does sub-vent, but not crazy crazy like the above mostly true example. The payment for the use of the car is indeed artificially low, but remember you are paying for the sub-vented cost of use of the car (which is less than you would pay had you purchased the car up front).Then at the conclusion of the lease there is MAYBE the possibility of getting the car for its real, honest, market value -- not the bloated, made up residual. If the car is good and you can get it at real true market value in month 25 or 37 or whatever, you actually did get a good deal since all you paid for was the rental amount for the past 24 months anyway and it was, er, ""rent controlled.""Infiniti's can be a bargain when they are helped along via the finance arm via a sub-venting process. As far as Acura's are concerned, their financial arm hasn't always been a flexible in that regard -- but perhaps it is because they didn't need to with the MDX being the lion's share of their business.It seems to me the TLX (and I come from a TL and actually liked it) was/is a missed opportunity to de-Honda-ize the brand. At this point, however nice they are, they are, underneath, Prime Hondas. That is not a bad thing, but the thing that I always thought about Infiniti was that they really did attempt to build a car that could rival a BMW. Acuras are still sold as FWD vehicles (a big mistake if you axe me), the Infiniti in question here is, actually, really and truly, a rear wheel drive vehicle that can be had with AWD (very BMW-ish, there).Moreover, don't go thinking Lexi are much more of an engineering tour de force vis a vis Toyota as Acuras are compared to Hondas.But, so it seems, the market has spoken and the Infiniti cars are not the leaders of the pack, more like the laggards of the pack -- hence super-sub-venting to the rescue which may move more of them off the lots until a new and improved version can be screwed together for your inspection.We bought our first car last year a $65,000+ Audi SQ5 -- we put $22,000 down, have a 2.25% APR note on it and it is now showing at being worth about $48K. We still owe $33K on it. We've lost, in my estimation, $7K -- had the thing been offered with a sub-venting finance package on a lease, well, that would have been a no-brainer. We're hoping the plummeting cash value of the car will, in year two, hit the brakes and that maybe we'll have a point in time where the car ""feels"" like it was a better decision to buy than to lease.We'll see how it goes. Meantime who cares what the car's MSRP is? Not most Americans. They, er, WE, only really care about the monthly payment. When a $50K+ car can be had for $399 per month for the life of its warranty and then simply dropped off with no muss, no fuss, well that hardly seems like a BAD thing. Speaking of sub-venting, Cadillac is doing the same thing with their CTS and ATS and XTS vehicles as we speak."
February 2015,"It's too bad that Infiniti has had troubles in the sales arena. They used to make some fairly appealing sport-luxury vehicles. Now? Not so much.Acura went through this 4 years ago. It seems they've righted the ship with the new TLX. But still, it's a tough row to hoe when you swing and miss with a product redesign.The fact that they're still selling the previous G series speaks volumes about how the Q 50 is doing. I test drove a Q50 a couple of times. Not sure the objective they were trying to meet, but whatever it was, they missed badly."
February 2015,"Yes.. I am saying that they are a great value to lease at $350 compared to the purchase price. So cheap, that you'll be many thousands worse off by buying the car, then selling it after three years. Infinitis often have great lease programs that aren't in line with their actual resale value. It's the manufacturer's method of heaping big incentives on the car. It's not a general lease vs. buy argument. It's specific to the situation."
February 2015,"This is pretty sad for a car company that once was nipping at the heals of BMW, Carlos Ghosn has his work cut out for him.. Also in the March Issue of Motortrend Angus MacKenzie wrote a great article about the change in the Big 3 (Ford,GM and Chrysler) MacKinzie talks about how Infiniti needs to do something quick if it want to survive."
February 2015,I see lots of big discounts on the infinities. I would say the average transaction price is in the low 40s
February 2015,I still love my Q50 Hybrid but they aren't selling well for sure.
February 2015,@circlew why get a '13 G when they are apparently giving away cheapo leases on the new q ? Don't ask for price just get cheap lease program deAl.
February 2015,@kyfdx - ok so you are saying they have great lease value but not to Own the same car which said manufacture is betting they will have decent value at said lease end. Making the $750 a month a bargain over 3 years because you can trade it in for a lot of coin- or if you keep it the extra year and get even more value per month held due to less depreshiayion in said 4th year. I love when people talk leases and think they are getting a great value but don't understand that buying the car could be a better option. Not so much - exactly.That's why I ask again what are these cars selling for .. ?? Is it really a50k car or is it a 42k car ?
February 2015,"I'm still interested in a '13 G37S sedan @ $28,200 with 20K miles."
February 2015,"Because, $350/mo is super cheap to drive a car like that... $750/mo to purchase it? Not so much.."
February 2015,"I have to assume the Q50 has been an underwhelming sales performer -- hence lease subvention to the rescue.I still see plenty of the Q50's predecessor, the G37X, on the road -- and they have kept the thing alive as a Q40. I also see plenty of the larger Infinitis on the road -- but the Q50s sit and sit and sit on the dealer's lots.My wife says they are soul-less machines. I actually like the Q50's styling -- but the engine is basically unchanged from the previous G's and the transmission isn't as good of a partner as you could want and as you certainly expect -- at MSRP. But subvented, well the mo/pay has to make the Q50 attractive.I always thought of BMW as the German Infiniti -- perhaps the incentives will gin up some greater enthusiasm for the Brand and the model. Maybe there's something rotten in Hong Kong (or Tokyo); maybe that's why Audi's former US President spent to little time with Infiniti and jumped to Cadillac before the paint in his new Hong Kong office dried."
February 2015,Why talk about lease prices and not the actual selling price?
February 2015,"In November, current lessees were given an extra $2500 incentive to lease.. that generates a lot of repeat sales.. Our 2011 G37X had an MSRP of $42K and a lease payment of $351/mo.+tax.. That's hard to beat."
February 2015,"well, the answer to the ""can Infiniti sell them for 50k?"" must be No, if they are subsidizing the leases that much!OK cars, but I could never imagine spending close to 50K on it. Heck, I can get a nice low mile 2013 MB E class for 35K!http://www.royaleasing.com/detail-2013-mercedes~benz-e~class-4dr_sedan_e350_sport_4matic_asterisk_ltd_avail_asterisk_-used-13233099.html"
February 2015,Exactly. Some loyalty and conquest cash goes a long way.
February 2015,Nissan/Infinity needs to fire their stylists; all of their cars(save the 370Z and GT-R) look like they melted in the sun and the SUVs are pretty horrible as well.
February 2015,Are they really able to sell Q50's for $50K? Fully loaded with all the bells and whistles???
February 2015,"The VQ engine is a masterpiece, however, it is a thirsty engine, hopefully Nissan will be able to turn the Infiniti brand around, and they really need to do it quickly..."
February 2015,"Exactly. They can't sell a lot of what they have in the lineup right now. Odd styling, and not much cachet left with the brand. They just fired their US chief within the last week or two. Infiniti needs to turn it around, fast."
February 2015,"When you have a product that isn't selling you tend to have a fire sale. People say that Acura has a problem, look at Infiniti, the QX60 is a rebadged Pathfinder, the QX70 hasn't changed in 6 years, theQX50 (EX) again nothing new there... The Q70 stale..."
February 2015,Hmmmmm....maybe Infiniti is throwing some support money at their leases?
February 2015,"What's with the Q50? people over on the ""prices paid"" and ""lease questions"" boards seem to be getting them at substantial discounts (not like @graphicguy & @qbrozen). They seem to be leasing in the $400 - $450 per month range. Cheap for a $50K ELLPS."
February 2015,"Check out the new Road and Track for an unabashed love letter to the new Audi S3.Whatever comes next for the S4 and S5 just have to be incredible. The S3 would not make me swoon -- too crude and rude. But the next gen S4, S5 and SQ5 should be a treat!"
February 2015,I run '18 winter spt dunlops - they have done the job thus far in the great white north east. Amazing how much snow = 90 inches in a month. The car kills it in light snow and is fun to get a little sideways. Im afraid to hit the gas when the snow gets deeper or at night. The video above I have seen before highlights Quattro but also brute force of a beast tuned car - if you had a 500 hp subi it would do the same in similar snow. The car being lower then a normal a4 I'm afraid to push it as those foglights can be expensive to replace↔️
February 2015,"Just saw my first F Type Jag, it was the sport model R type, nice sounding exhuast tone"
February 2015,"Annual Father/Son ski trip to Sunday River in Maine this week. Left a day earlier than planned as predictions of blizzard conditions Sunday morning. So, drove through some blizzard conditions Saturday night! The XF was a rock star, AWD/All Seasons tracked steady and true. Stopped for dinner in York, pulled up restaurants on the Nav, told son to pick one. I guess I missed the turn as we found ourselves driving through residential, one lane (due to snow) roads that hadn't been plowed recently. So, probably 6+"" snow, no problem for the XF! Used the rear foglight, oversight on Jag's part, no front fogs... One hour dinner, 2+"" new snow on top of the car! But, light and fluffy.Woke up Sunday expecting a plethora of fresh powder to ski...and nothing. It didn't snow the entire four days we were there. The wind did howl mightily, though. Kept lifts closed, so 3 days of skiing turned into more like 1.5. Probably good for me, skied trees and bumps. I ain't 16 like my son. Oh, my achin' back!"
February 2015,"No snow fun here. The storm was Sunday - started out with about 8-10"" of snow, then changed to rain for an hour or so, then about 2 hours of freezing rain with a flash freeze as temps plummeted. The result of it all was that everything had 1""-2"" of ice on pavement/sidewalks under the snow crust. I didn't even try to drive anywhere until today after 2 days of clearing efforts around the house. The roads here are atrocious. Even main routes aren't all down to bare pavement since there is caked ice stuck to the pavement in areas that is really hazardous. Side streets are still mostly all ice since it has been too cold for road salt to do much. Add to that all the snowbanks from previous storms making roads narrow, with many merge lanes on expressways simply not there. I'm not going anywhere over the next few days because it is still too risky."
February 2015,"What a DB. Former BMW driver I guess.It was a foot of light, fluffy snow. My 2005 FWD Passat did that last week - multiple times."
February 2015,I'm jealous you guys in the snow get to have fun like this guy:http://youtu.be/avSxOvJnE68Lowered S4 being the snow plow is great.
February 2015,"Well, why I usually am left confused by such a list is the breakout of the categories. So the Charger is a sport sedan? Really? Not quite the classification I would give it. On top of that, why are Luxo Sedans mutually exclusive from Sport Sedans? And same goes with Family Sedan. So the Charger isn't a Family Sedan?? Its just all so convoluted so they can list whatever they want. They decide they want to mention a particular car, so they make up yet another category for it. Note the 3 choices for Best Dream Machine. Why can't there be 1 winner there? And why were they too lazy in that instance to not make up 3 separate categories for them? ""Best Dream Machine AWD Coupe-like Sedan,"" ""Best Hybrid German Coupe Over $100k,"" and ""Best Italian Hybrid Supercar."" There ya go."
February 2015,"Yeah...I see where you're coming from. But, there are some here at Edmunds who have gone out and bought one for the same reasons they list.Not a Chryco fan myself. But, I haven't been in one for a long time. I think the last one was a Chrysler 200 as a rental...the previous generation to boot. Totally forgettable car."
February 2015,"CTS4 did great. Standard All Seasons did a good job. Other folks on the road, especially in SUVs? Some, not so good. Saw a few off the side of the road."
February 2015,"The Wrangler went out first because I wanted to make sure that there were no trees down or other problems. The MS3 was the real snow excavator, it was the least competent due to the lower rid height and the fact that it is running UHP all season tires- the Wrangler and 3er both sport winter rubber."
February 2015,seems like that would have been natural duty for the Wrangler. Guess you wanted to do it in comfort.
February 2015,"My wife's work sled was drafted for snowplow duty today(along with my MS3). Every 2-3 hours I drove one or the other up or down my 1500' driveway to keep the snow knocked down. The Bridgestone Blizzak LM-25 tires worked a treat, as the Brits would say; on the first run a few drifts were higher than the fog lamps."
February 2015,@graphicguy - I find them lists really interestin-dodge charger on the list kind of ahead scratcher here.

February 2015,"I remember coming across a couple of others reporting limp issues with the tune, but then they'd get quickly ganged up on and disappear. I did not see anybody else going through sensors like mine was, though. The reliability issues are why I did not have that car very long."
February 2015,"I don't know -- and with all due respect, I don't know how you know -- about Audi deciding the RS7 customer would not track the car, hence they (Audi) decided not to use the transmission that they typically tout as the one they reserve for their high performance cars. It is as if their engine technology advanced more quickly than their transmission supplier could keep up with, so they used the 8-speed tip instead of waiting for the DSG to get strong enough to handle the power of the RS7 motor.I have no problem at all with you upgrading your engine, knowing that the transmission will attempt to protect itself when it is pushed beyond its comfort zone. I don't have the money that it would take to self insure against the risk.Frankly, I think it would be less costly to get a new ""S"" with the uprated engine -- when it comes out perhaps as a 2016 -- rather than push the DSG with the upgrade.Of course, if you upgrade and nothing untoward goes down, well your risk will have been proven to be low.My experience with ""chipping"" is perhaps why I am concerned -- I chipped my wife's TT and the power and acceleration were thrilling -- but the damn thing went from being reliable (and I assume durable) to needing constant visits to the dealer for things that seemed to have started coincidentally with the chip's installation.My wife swore (and I couldn't counter her argument) that all the ills that beset her TT were chip related.We traded the car in for a newer TT with the FACTORY upgrated engine -- the thing was bullet proof.Summary: good luck and godspeed with your upgrade. I'll just wait for the factory to offer up an amped up S car without any post OEM help.My A3 mods did the opposite of souring me on mods. If anything though, I felt they over advertised the power improvements , or at least overstated them, didn't pass the butt dyno.I can understand being soured to tuning if you've had issues in the past. However, if the car was old, maybe it was just due to have those same failures anyway? Also, what kind of tune (company?) was it. I got Unitronics with the A3, and part of their sales spiel is that they tune it with OEM like reliability and durability in mind. Of course, my S4 tune will be Revo, so new territory. I find the Audi components to be over engineered so that they can handle these tunes with ease if done right."
February 2015,"It's not going to happen until March 20-22 as that's the weekend there's a track event and the shop sponsor to the club will be at the track event again. They are located far from me in Bakersfield, CA; so meeting up at the track weekend to do the tune works best. Since I won a huge discount, I'm going with them and REVO. I'll let you know how it passes the butt dyno test. I think it normally costs $1,100."
February 2015,"You are the only person I have heard who had this problem, so far I have not had this problem or others on bimmerfest.."
February 2015,"Thanks, RB."
February 2015,burger is what i used on my 135i. Was the tune responsible for the problems? I don't know for sure. Could be the car would have had all its problems anyway. I can tell you the car would go into limp mode far far easier when the tune was turned on.
February 2015,I've looked at the Sport model more than once. They are very nice cars.
February 2015,I need a new ride since my daughter turns 17 and we play musical cars. I looked at a '13 G37S sedan (RB-Approved Right Wheel Drive and 6MT). It has 20.2K miles for $28.2K. Still has 2 years on the BtoB warranty.It's not a bimmer or an audi but seems like a nice value. Any comments well received!

The Club Sport now has 140k on it- no issues, even though it sees the track at least once a year. The MS3 149k on the clock with no issues as well.My only concern regarding a tune would be warranty coverage on a newer car - most ECUs now have a flash counter. In my experience, if you go with a company that has experience with the engine/platform you should be good to go..."
February 2015,Got the performance package from my BMW dealer on my 335 coupe. Bumped HP and Torque about 10%. Dealer did it. No problems. All under BMW warranty.

February 2015,@andres3 keep us up on that upgrade- I've been debateing doing something as well after hearing about @flightnurse‌ adding extra to the bmw. Would love to know cost and location.
February 2015,"I'm not worried about it. When the DSG oil gets too hot, I know the transmission will go into limp mode, that happened late in my A3's life after I had a bunch of mods on that one. Usually happened when you got near the last lap of a session, but it was annoying nonetheless. Given the R8 has switched and upgraded to a dual clutch DSG unit, I think they've resolved any issues with the DSG and power/torque. I'm not too worried about it. I think they know most RS7 buyers aren't planning to track it, so they made it a slushbox transmission."
February 2015,I guess they figure a lot of Audi owners are made of money and won't shop around.
February 2015,M @all - I have to go tru the dealer recipe and confirm but it was 330 bux all in after taxes - no tire rotation and pretty much an oil change and a car wash which after getting 5 feet of snow the very next week did nothing. Yes I feel ripped off- the all road loner was a nice touch and was able to handle the Wegmans run I had to do. Shame on me. Fool me once.
February 2015,"I have a question (prompted by an article I read about the RS7): Audi, today, uses the DSG transmission on the S4, S5, S6 and S7, for instance. Yet on the RS7 they use the 8-speed Tiptronic. The stated reason is that the currently available DSG can't take the forces generated by the RS7's engine. The article said the S6 was on the cusp of stressing the DSG -- and owners of an S6 were cautioned not to after-market upgrade the HP and torque (which is quite possible with the turbo S6 V8, e.g.).Can the DSG in the S4 handle the upgrade you are contemplating and have a good long life? If not, what is the cost -- or risk in this upgrade?My dealer says the S4 is going to have a horsepower and torque boost to keep it ahead of the standard V6T in the 2016 A6 line. It means, to me, that they have resolved the DSG issue; wonder if there is the headroom in the current DSG to take the upgrade is my concern."
February 2015,"RB.....my BMW dealer keeps sending me ""Service Specials"" in the mail, even though I no longer own a BMW. They tout that their prices are in line with other national car service places. They say they'll meet or beat any other store on tire prices. And, they're charging $70 for a synthetic oil change, tire rotation and whatever inspections BMW requires.So, at least they're trying to be competitive.Even my Caddy dealer offers an oil change, tire rotation and inspection for $40. Won't need that for awhile, though given they're like BMW and offer free service for 4 years."
February 2015,"I took my Club Sport to my BMW dealer last month for an Oil Service, brake fluid flush, and coolant change and I was only charged $315."
February 2015,"At my last HPDE event I won an auction to get more than half off on a Audi S4 3.0 Supercharge tune that takes the S4 to 400+ HP. They couldn't make the tune happen on a Sunday, so it'll happen at my next HPDE event in March. This is a tune that turns the S4 into a M3 killer. Since my car has been pretty much flawless, I think I will go ahead and risk the potential ""warranty"" issues. It's already a beast; should be fun."
February 2015,"LOL @ $300 oil changes. I won't be getting my Audi serviced at the dealership again; it's just too much of a rip off. For your $300 they probably do lube things (joints/hinges, ect.) do a 150 pt. inspection, but in the end, it's just an oil change. I got them to give me 15% off because even at 10% off I felt as I was being ripped off (I originally thought 15K service included a new engine air filter at least; it doesn't!). They are making their maintenance intervals a lot longer it seems."
February 2015,"Well I am a big guy and this 535 fits me perfectly- this thing is a blast in the snow, the TL AWD is good but the Bimmer is GREAT. - Happy Motoring."
February 2015,"Sween....you and I agree (O.M.G..... . Wife being in an Accord, I'm beginning to see the Honda engineering in a lower priced car vs the Acura counterparts. I drove the TLX. Nice car. Not the same driving experience as the TL-S models or even the SH AWD TL that I had. Admittedly, I like the look of the new one better than the old one, but didn't have an issue with the ""beak"" look that others did. Truth told, if Audi had just fixed my S4, I'd still be in the fold. Instead, they lost me. I have to believe I'm smack dab in the wheelhouse of their demographic, too.Bang for the buck, an S4 is hard to beat.But, as these things go, every body is stealing from everyone else. My CTS AWD has the trick torque vectoring rear that the Audi Quattro and Acura TL SH AWD have. My CTS has the twin scroll turbo that the BMW 4 cyl has (and more power to boot). Get the V-Sport (last year could be had for high $40s). and you get the 6 cyl with two turbos...wicked fast.Took a couple of weeks, but once I got used to CUE, I ""get it"". And, I like it. My understanding is they went through a couple of interim updates to get it to this point, though.ILX needs that turbo motor. Otherwise, stick with a Civic.The Civic and Accord are great cars. Are their Acura counterparts worth $X,ooo more? It's not clear cut. So I guess that's pretty telling.That said, I loved all the Acura I've had. Not sure they shouldn't just go ahead and just be an upscale SUV brand and be done with it. Maybe they're hoping the new NSX will breathe life into their car sales. The ILX and the TLX both need that turbo 4, though. The TLX, in particular, looks like a took a step back going from the sweet 3.7L in the previous gen SH AWD version to the 3.5L in the current car. Not sure what the thought process was there. In the tech dept, where they used to be at the forefront, they're now lagging behind, even with a totally new refresh.BTW....here's my BMW dealer......http://www.sweeneybmw.com/index.htmFN....if the prospect of getting $15K+ off a CTS wasn't out there, no way I would have entered the Cadillac showroom. My issues with Cadillac came before the GM ""purge"". I think the Cadillac dealers had to get into shape or the prospect of GM cutting them became quite real. That was very evident in my experiences with the same dealership 11 years ago, and the experience with them now. Truly, it was a night and day difference. Drove the ATS. Thought it was a really fun car. A tad small for my tastes (reminded me of the A3, sidewise). Drove the CTS, and had as much fun, only with all the trappings of an E Class, A6, 5 Series......a better suspension than any of those, with better steering, braking, etc. A Cadillac....right? Who'd have thunk it.Frankly, if I didn't get such a good deal on the CTS, I would have been targeting an IS350 F-Sport, probably this summer. That's a fun car, too. A little on the snug side (and I'm not a big guy)."
February 2015,"Only if they add SH-AWD, then you'd have a Golf R or Focus RS competitor."
February 2015,that could make an interesting little buggy.
February 2015,"According to this article, Acura may be bringing back the Type S designation in the form of a turbo 4 cyl producing 300+ hp.  I think that would make the ILX, which it is apparently slated for, more than competitive.  http://www.autoblog.com/2015/02/10/acura-ilx-type-s-300-hp-turbo-four/"
February 2015,"my Acura dealer is perfectly nice. nothing over the top fancy. But, breakfast stuff (donuts), little water bottles, a TV, and a small business area if you want a desk or PC.. Good enough for me, since I go there every 6-7 months when the little wrench comes on, and just drive into the express lane (no appointment) and am done in an hour or less. maybe slightly longer if I was do for extra stuff. so I don't really need a luxury spa, since most of the time I am there I am checking out the new cars (at Acura or one of the other dealers in the complex), and if the car needed to stay longer, I would just get a loaner and not hang around."
February 2015,"I remember talking about the CTS and how I liked it and you mentioned that you wouldn't step in a Caddy dealer because of how they treated your mother many years prior, but giving you 15K off MSRP changed that for you.... Now if the dealer came back with only 7% off MSRP would you have taken the dealer? But in the end, money talks and did for you... I'm sure anyone would have taken the dealers deal of 15K off a 60K car I'm sure you lease payments are lower then what your TL was. Dealer experience goes only so far, it's nice to go to my BMW dealer and help myself to the coffee bar and pastries, but I'd rather not have to go to the dealership at all."
February 2015,"If you recently bought a new car and are really appreciating high-tech features you didn't have previously, a reporter wants to hear from you. Please email PR@edmunds.com by Thursday, February 12, 2015 and include your daytime contact information and a few words about your experience."
February 2015,Finally alive again - nice work men. My anger with Acura (don't get me going on Infiniti) is they were so close and they blew it. They had the turbo and shelved it. They had cool names and ofcourse the reliability.  The ILX is basically a TSX gen one reborn - - which is a good thing but the true comp has them beat. I don't have the numbers but my audi dealer has 60 a3s on the lot and 3 of them are the 1.8. Read caranddriver.com for there take and it's not a good read for the ILX. Weight 63% front should be fun on the twists go. The dealer experience in reading above posts seems like a big deal- Im about price - how much can I get into and out of a car not which has a latte machine. I would rather not be in a dealer at all- knock on wood I wont be again for anything other than a $300 oil change. bUt I can see @graphic_guy‌ frustration given his unreal experience. I also like the fact he's friends with SweeneyBmw which if I was shopping for a BMW no better place then Sweeney.
February 2015,Exactly. The surveys are ridiculous to begin with- anything less than a top mark being considered a failure.
February 2015,"And as I noted, I don't burn them on surveys. If I have a problem, I speak with them directly. A couple of years ago I had the timing belt done on my Passat. About 30 days later, the thermostat went. It requires just about the same labor time to reach the tstat as to get to the timing belt. I mentioned it to the service manager and he went through my customer history. He noted how much I've spent there, if I was asked if I wanted to change the tstat when they did the timing belt and I'm sure somewhere in there is my CSI report. Viola - 3 hour labor credit."
February 2015,"That's just about the same policy I follow. My SA at my BMW dealer is also a CCA member and attends HPDEs in his 1998 M3. I've also built a relationship with one SA at my Mazda dealer. I've also written letters of praise to the corporate offices; in 1996 I even received a personal reply from Vic Doolan, who at that time was the President of BMWNA. It's amazing to see what happens when you are courteous and don't treat the dealer as an adversary..."
February 2015,"Mark....I think the Audi Connection could be a very good dealership. I think they were hampered by their Regional Rep. Plus, neither them nor the one on Beechmont could come close to the deal I got out of the Chicago Audi Dealership (Westmont). We're not talking about a deal that was a few hundred better....we're talking about a deal that was a few thousands as the delta (I think it was about $3K difference). I gave both the opportunity to get close...even gave them a little working room given I'd save the time to drive to Chicago and back home again. The Chicago dealer bought me dinner and paid for a hotel room near their dealership. I can't even imagine either Cincinnati dealer doing that.Went to Dayton Audi store, too. They were more like the old ""let me get my manager to see if we can make a deal"". After waiting 30 minutes for this manager to show up, I left their store. Sales person tried to stall me more, but enough was enough.BMW Store is good. They never seem to have what I want. They have a pretty rigid set of criteria of cars they order from Stuttgart. They seem to get a lot of base models with base drivetrains. I tend to want the ones with the bigger, better drivetrains, which Sweeney always seems to have. I have a personal relationship with ""my guy"" at Sweeney BMW, though. He's been there for probably 20+ years. I've bought 3 BMWs from him. Deal is always skinny, and simple. Anything I've ever had go wrong, it's taken care of. No questions, no pushback, no fuss, no muss. No issue is too small for them (nor too large).We're not so different. We deal with people we trust. I think that's true of most people."
February 2015,"Dealership is the front line of your ownership experience. As the old saying goes...""you only get one chance to make a good first impression"".My wife is a lot more forgiving than I am when it comes to customer service. She's the one who is willing to give the benefit of the doubt. Me? I don't care if it's my real estate agent, my stock broker, my car sales person, or even my landscaper, Car dealerships (and in turn, car manufacturers) expect me to live up to my commitment when buying a car to pull 10s of thousands of dollars out of my wallet for their product. I expect that they live up to their promise that the car will operate as they said it would. And, if it doesn't, I expect them to make it right without pushback. That last part is where Audi got in trouble. The dealership Mark is referring to was actually at least moderately helpful, but still unwilling or unable (maybe both) to fix the car. Their Service Manager said the DSG trans and components of the Quattro system needed to be replaced. In a moment of unusual honesty, he said that Audi had a problem with some of the components for the drivetrain that were out of spec. He thought he'd get the green light to do the repair. That authorization never happened. The service manager said at one point that the Regional Audi Rep told him the car was too expensive to fix. Not that it couldn't be fixed, but that he thought it costs too much to fix it. Really? I mean REALLY? Guess what? It was 4X more expensive to buy back and label the car as a corporate buy back.It wasn't just me with the issues. One of the trade rags I read after they bought mine back, mentioned the same issue. I looked for recalls. Never saw any.The Audi Customer Service people suggested I take it to the other Audi dealer in town. I have no proof, but I think they looked at it, test drove it, called the Region, got stonwalled and essentially just changed the trans fluid. Clearly, that wasn't the problem as it still existed as I drove it away from their service bay. Took it back to them a 2nd time. Can't remember what they actually did, but it didn't fix the problem.At that point, Audi had the car for a total of about 6+ weeks. They came back and said lemon law didn't apply because I had the car in for two separate issues. It was the same issue, that needed two fixes....Quattro and DSG. I don't know what they thought....perhaps I was just going to forget about it?Icing on the cake....called Audi Customer Care (allegedly a Supervisor who had been assigned to my case), who proceeded to tell me the reason none of the local Audi dealerships would service my car, was because I didn't buy it from them. Uhhhhh.....izzatright? That's not what both of the Audi dealers told me. Game on. You're buying the car back, which they ended up doing. I told Mark's dealer what I thought could have/should have happened. They should have either replaced the trans and Quattro components. Or, they should have just swapped the car for one that worked correctly. Neither was offered....and believe me, I did ask. They wanted me to take a about a $10K hit to swap out the car, though. Yeah....that's really fair!As far as the Caddy? I'm not expecting the same resale percentage numbers I was used to getting with my Acuras 9which were exemplary). That said, I bought it right ($15K and change dff MSRP). So, I took the good deal up front with getting a great deal instead of on the back end when it comes trade time."
February 2015,"It happens I'm 50, not that you would have known, and so it's not like I need to google that 6-speed Legend. I admired it back in the day.In some ways perhaps the Germans are ahead of the 2016 ILX. For instance, the A3 seems to have nicer interior design. And the BWM 320i, of course, is sure to have better handling. But the Audi A3 under the skin has a lot in common with a $20k VW Golf. That doesn't seem different to me than an ILX having some common bones with a $20k Honda Civic. They take these bones, reinforce them, put new skins on them, put new engines in them, etc. Well, I'm not so sure about the engine for the A3, now that I think about it. Isn't that basically the new standard Golf 1.8 turbo engine? Not sure. A turbo for the ILX might be nice, but I think the ILX 2.4 is already beating all of its competition with the base engines in terms of 0-60. And the competition isn't really weak, and so that seems plenty powerful enough for the likes of me.And when it comes to reliability and long term ownership, many would take an Acura over an Audi or MB. If you're just leasing and want the prestige, then the others are probably better choices. But if you're actually buying it for yourself and plan on keeping it, then Lexus, Acura, etc., might have an edge there."
February 2015,@graphic_guy‌ lets not go gaga over dealerships- used cars and service bring in the big bux. The new car dealer is happy you bought the car and now happy to service it -  Let's see how the next dealer listens and responds to the trade in on the caddy.... Maybe you got a bad dealer and a bad car- but the end game is to make money.
February 2015,"Acura- this page and others on edmunds seemed to always be - let's see how good this new acura is- and the Tsx is a comp to others- and the TL is an poor mans s4. but acura for the last 15? Years has not done anything in sedan form. If you want a great Acura sedan (or coupe) get the second gen type2 legend -(6 speed please, google it)  (the square TL /s another) and also the bug eyed integra GS-r.  The last TL, the last Tsx and the first ILX - no good -(all ugly and could not match comp)  the RLX no one buys. The new TLX from reports is nice but nothing special- You can look at zero to sixty numbers and cost of new ILX (for 16) vs its comp but is it really in this class? It's still a civic under the skin and until Acura runs a turbo 4 it's a back burner car at best - Infiniti after gaining so much traction is now nowhere as well- maybe the parents don't care -"
February 2015,"Assuming my comments are not banned: We have two Audi dealerships in Cincinnati. I have dealt with both of them, but purchased every one of our Audis from one dealership -- now called The Audi Connection.We have two BMW dealerships, too. Purchased three Bimmers from one of them -- The BMW Store -- over the years.These two dealerships -- the ones that we have purchased from have been wonderful to deal with from a sales perspective AND a service perspective. Out of more than two dozen Audis we have had, we did have one that was problematic (actually the brakes were the issue). Audi of America sent their area representative to help out the situation. As usual, the dealer was helpful in making such a thing happen.OK, I get it -- your mileage may differ. I agree with whoever said -- get rid of the bad ones (or words to that effect). No mfgr can tolerate even a very small number of crappy dealers. The Internet spreads the tales of woe like a Cancer. I know dealers are often local business people, not mega corporations -- although this is changing, in the era of the $1B dealership ""groups.""The dealer can do harm, sometimes great harm to a brand -- and god knows Audi can't afford a sub-par dealer. No mfgr can.If you need to buy or lease a new Audi and you are within 250 miles of Cincinnati, you can certainly buy one here -- but that probably does you little good with respect to service after the sale. You need a relationship with your dealer somewhat like your relationship with your ""barber"" (or hair dresser if you don't like the term barber). Of course, if you don't work at the relationship too, it won't pan out favorably, probably.My Audi service mgr and I have been on a first name basis for perhaps 15 years -- our sales rep, in his mid-80's finally retired; he had been at the dealership since the discovery of dirt. Our new guy only has 12+ years with the dealer, he is so new he's still learning where the restroom is.The time on the job of the various players at the dealership is a huge clue. If the lot tech guy and your sales rep have about the same tenure, you'd be better off finding out the tenure, overall, of the reps. Ditto the shop people, shop foreman, service manager and service writers. My service adviser has been at the dealership for at least a decade. The Audi Connection is the poster child for what a dealership should look like. The BMW Store has a similar tenure with its people and the dealer experience is all the better for it.If you have a bad dealer, I do feel for you -- if you can, get the hell away from them."
February 2015,Good thinking lol! Hadn't thought of that. Might try that someday....
February 2015,"I have found that to have a great relationship with a dealer's service department, is simply to be nice. Most of my dealings are with the same service adviser at the Honda, VW and Ford dealerships. I go in with a good attitude. If there is a problem with the service work, they know I will come to them personally and not burn them on a survey. I try to be reasonable knowing that they very often have no control over the issue.Lastly, I write a letter - not an e-mail or facebook post - to the owner principal and the service manager praising the service adviser. Next time I'm in, they fall all over me."
February 2015,"As you say, I'm comparing the Audi A3 1.8 with the 2016 Acura TLX 2.4. Car and Driver seems to put the A3 1.8 0-60 at 7.3, while the 2016 TLX C&D puts at 6.2. One second faster is a pretty significant difference. When these two models are comparably equipped with leather, heated seats, backup camera, etc. I think the Audi goes for about $33k while the TLX goes for about 3k less. The Audi has more prestige and arguably nicer interior design, but the Acura is quite a bit faster and might even have better handling around corners. At least one test of the A3 1.8 that I saw complained about excessive roll and lean around corners. Plus, I think most would agree that for long term reliability an Acura beats an Audi.Here's what Auto Week says at the end of it's review:If you’re looking for an entry-level sports sedan, you’ll definitely want to consider the 2016 ILX now. The new drivetrain has done wonders for Acura’s gateway vehicle, giving it adequate muscle to make a stand against the Audi A3 and Mercedes-Benz CLA. The engine is potent and is definitely a throwback to Honda/Acura 4-cylinders of old that once powered vehicles like the Acura Integra and Honda Prelude.Handling will also remind you a little of the brand’s sportier performers from the past, which should be music to a Honda/Acura fan’s ears.http://autoweek.com/article/car-reviews/2016-acura-ilx-drive-review"
February 2015,"Dealerships go a long way to form the perception of any brand. I've been born beat even by Mercedes dealerships, and I've been treated like gold at Chevy dealerships. At the Cadillac, BMW, Mercedes dealerships, you expect better, though. You expect the sales and service reps to listen and respond to what you want or need. Not to resort to arm twisting to get you to buy or become deaf to your communications when talking about issues with your car.My BMW, Acura, and now my Cadillac dealer can't do enough to listen and respond to what I communicate. My Audi dealer couldn't do too little in response to the same. Guess which dealerships I'll contact first when I decide to get another vehicle? Pretty easy answer."
February 2015,"Dealer experience seems entirely local and hence quite variable. Last night on the news I saw a report of a Mini owner whose car had a bad engine just out of warranty and who had a very bad experience with her dealer and BMW Canada corporate. The local BMW/Mini dealer (not the one in the TV report) had a very bad rep for customer service but has recently been sold to one of the two local dealer groups, the same one I bought my ATS from, who probably will be better. The former owner's rep couldn't be much worse than what it was."
February 2015,"I can highly recommend West Houston Volkswagen. Their service department treats you so well, you will swear it's a Cadillac dealership. Archer Volkswagen (also here in Houston), well, you will swear you're at the Ford dealership service department (which is NOT a good thing!)."
February 2015,Now I've had a great relationship with my VW dealer and service department.
February 2015,VW dealerships don't have a stellar reputation. My experience with Audi dealers has been perfectly fine. They should definitely work at dropping the bad apples.
February 2015,"Exactly, my wife is extremely reluctant to buy anything other than a CPO BMW because of the great treatment we receive from both the sales and service departments."
February 2015,"The dealership experience makes all of the difference, doesn’t it? When I was younger, I could not understand why anyone would pay the money for a new Cadillac. Then I owned my first Cadillac (not new, but new enough to be under factory warranty). After that, I truly did understand. I no longer have that kind of money to throw around, but if I did, I would be driving a Cadillac."
February 2015,"Read a blurb yesterday stating that Acura is getting ready to bring back turbo 4 cyl motors (which seems to be the price to play in the premium segment). and it's speculated that one will land in the ILX. Wife tried one before settling on the Accord. Tough sell. Small, underpowered, and more expensive than her loaded Accord. Hard to make that fly.I did like the TLX. But, I didn't like it as well as the TL. So, no go there, too. RLX? Should have saved development money and killed it off. It's barely selling as well as the previous dismal RL. My hope is that there's something Acura is planning (maybe the turbo 4 in the TLX) like a TLX-S because as it stands right now, they're an SUV brand, who happens to throw a few cars in the showroom just in case you need one of those, too.No secret that Audi just seems to confound their customers...whether it's ""Sween's"" $300 oil change, or them playing ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil"" about the problems my S4 had. Troubling enough it was on the dealer level. Worse, the Audi factory team weren't any better. That attitude eventually catches up to you. You'd think their customer service would be a lot better given how they were almost wiped out of existence in the '80s with the hatchet job they got with unintended acceleration.S3 will sell. Not sure the age group. It gives a lot of performance. But, those it's targeting are raising families. Is it big enough? For $50K is it really nice enough?? Interior was underwhelming, as Mark pointed out. The materials were not what I'd consider worthy of a $35K car, let alone a $50K car. And, it seems to be a German thing, but who was it that decided a stuck on LCD screen sticking up in the middle of the dash was a ""new trend""? Somebody in their design dept needs a serious remedial course in aesthetics. Even if a childless couple ends up liking the S3, not sure it's demeanor will appeal given some alternatives who have sharp handling, and a more sophisticated ride. My money? Stuck in an Audi showroom with no other competitor to be found within 1,000 miles? I'd write the check for the S4 for about the same money. Better car, better interior, better suspension, better transmission, better engine....better all the way around.BMW? Cadillac? VW? Any of those dealers close? I'd be sticking my checkbook back in my pocket and looking at those over the Audi.Even Mercedes, which has given up its chase to be a sharp performer, puts out a decent product in the $50K range...C Class. Aside from the silly stick up screen (again), it has a nice interior and makes no apologies that it rides nice, while maybe not offering the last 10th in handling or performance.Buy, the CLA's suspension is every bit as ragged as the Audi's. Interior is....ummm....interesting. Not nearly as nice as the ATS nor an uber conservative 2 or 3 Series. But, it has a star on the front. So, for many, that's all that's needed.I liked my Audi...when I drove it off the showroom floor. It became troublesome almost immediately. When the dealer stone walls you (and I'm not the only person who's had that happen in these parts), it makes a frustrating situation unbearable. So long Audi.Had sterling customer service from BMW, and again with my CTS. Need an oil change? New wipers? Got a little parking lot ding? No problem. Leave it with the dealership, who gladly gives you a loaner to use, only to get your car back later all clean and shiny with everything taken care of.....NO CHARGE!Geez.....that got long winded. I don't have any catchy sign off phrases (wish I did). Ciao!"
February 2015,"Ben, thanks for that. I saw the piece in MT I think. See, this now sounds like the car I should have waited for. Exactly what my wish list it pretty much. I really liked the interior and size. Upping the speed and driving experience is all that it really needed. and if they kept the price the same, it should be a very good deal.Actually, it sounds more like the original tsx, which it probably is close in size to. and that car I always loved.Too bad I already got something. But heck, I'll still stop in to take a look when they finally come out. Plan ahead I always say!I am sure the comparison was to the FWD 1.8 A3. which makes sense, because they are closest in concept and price. Not really comparable to a 40K 2.0t model."
February 2015,"The M235i is the only sub-$50k BMW I would put in my driveway. My Audi dealer pretty much soured me on the marque due to the aggravation they caused every time I've tried to deal with them(I didn't want an Audi, but my wife was interested in an A4Q).By the way, those ""experts"" in the video should know that-on this side of the pond, anyway- a ""Bimmer"" is a BMW car and a ""Beemer"" is a BMW bike..."
February 2015,"Couple of things - first s3 thought some of you would like this mashup http://youtu.be/RPn8MGLtwGYthe other news on the ILX reviews above/ @benjineh how long have you worked for acura ? So it undercuts the a3 in zero to 60 time and price - what a3 are you talking of? the 1.8 fwd or the mainstream 2.0 with quatro- are they really in the same class? I mean we had this arguement before with the Tsx vs the g35, bmw 328 and others but it was nowhere close- remind you that acura has badicay been dead since the integra left us-"
February 2015,"Another review of the 2016 ILX by Left Lane News:""Cruising along the Silverado trail in Napa, California, gave us a quick taste of the ILX's improvements. From the moment we pushed the red starter button, we could see that Acura had corrected many of the motivational issues that plagued the last car. And to their credit, Acura executives acknowledged as much, when during the presentation about the vehicle's new features, they stated that they had taken many an expert's comments to heart. In addition to the lack of power, one of the bigger complaints of the previous version was the excessive road noise that made its way into the cabin. The NVH guys got it right this time, utilizing tricks and techniques that made a huge difference that was quantifiable in back-to-back tests. For 2016, buyers will get a taste of just what 51 extra horsepower and an additional 40 lb-ft of torque are capable of, especially in a car that weighs only 3,100 pounds. We found a compact four-door sedan that offered up just the right amount of torque steer when we launched from a standing start. They didn't post exact times but Acura officials state the ILX gets to 60 mph 2.5-seconds faster than the model it replaces. And that was in the normal drive mode. Switching over to sport mode allowed us to put the paddle shift levers to good use as we blipped our way up through the eight-speed gearbox. Offering a different feel then that found in the normal drive mode, it allowed us to hold our gears as long as we wanted while negotiating the twisties in Northern California's wine country."""
February 2015,"Good reviews so far for the 2016 Acura ILX with the 2.4 DI engine (201 hp) and the 8 speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter. Starting msrp: $28k, undercutting the Audi A3 by $2k while getting to 60 more than a second faster....From Motor Trend:""Acura lost the 2.0-liter engine and dropped in a 2.4-liter, direct injection, 16-valve four-cylinder engine that creates 201 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque. It also introduces the first dual-clutch eight-speed automatic transmission with a torque converter and paddle shifters that seem to always know the right gear at the right time. It launches with aggressive power, and once first gear winds out, it quickly shifts and maintains that torque until you let off the gas. There's a touch of torque steer to pull you to the right under heavy acceleration off the line, but that quickly disappears and leaves you with a compact rocket on the road. The electric power steering is taut and very linear, snapping back to center with ease. Driving around Napa, California's, winding mountain roads, the ILX kept its line through every corner and never let up. It's smooth but feels quick and allowed me a chance to make my driving partner just a little bit carsick after a few twisty corners. Acura also improved the car's braking, allowing it to remain smooth and quick. For those who want the car to do the driving for you, the ILX offers adaptive cruise control and lane-keep assist. I'm not particularly fond of the lane-keep assist system, because it seems to work even when I didn't want it to, pulling me back to the center of the lane during faster driving, but I should have merely turned it off then. On the highway, it does a nice job of smoothly adjusting the car back to the middle of the lane. Acura added a number of quieting technologies in the car, including active noise cancelation and additional deadening materials. This was quite noticeable. The car is remarkably quiet, especially considering it's built on the Civic platform, which is not the quietest compact around. A quiet ride remains one of the hallmarks of luxury, and the ILX allows for easy conversations at any speed. The interior improvements are just as noticeable as the exterior ones. There are steps up in the quality of materials, the soft dash, and nicely done stitching throughout the cabin. (The A-Spec model includes aluminum floor pedals and special seat inserts.) There are all of the regular luxury items, such as a moonroof, a clean instrument cluster, and comfortable heated seats. When you sit down in this car, you notice that it's nicely done."""
February 2015,"The 2016, S6 gets some minor refreshers/ updates and 30 more horse pw to 450. This vehicle is on my short list also https://autos.yahoo.com/blogs/motoramic/2016-audi-s6-and-s7-review-153154010.html"
February 2015,"The loaded S3 I test drove did indeed seem to just cross into the harsh ride category. The interior at freeway legal speeds seemed to show off its lack of sound deadening, too. A drive from Cincinnati to Cleveland would probably be wearying. The performance was very impressive -- the thing was super willing to be at full cry seemingly in one second. The handling -- this one had the magnetic suspension option -- was confidence inspiring. The transmission was great -- better than any manual, BUT it was the 6-speed version. The 7-speed seems like it would be a better choice due to the addition of another overdriven gear.The audio system was very good, not knock your socks off good, but premium ""enough."" That stupid pop up nav screen looks like one of those after market units (from Pioneer) from decades ago. Don't know why Audi chose to do that, when they had the built in look down to a science. But, that is personal preference.For a change, Porsche now does the integration of the Nav.infotainment system better than Audi. What a world/At a north of $50K price, the S4 (at least today's S4) seems like a bargain compared to the S3.. Of course a stripped S3 makes a strong performance argument, but, sadly, the premium-ness has been dialed way down. The interior is almost austere -- but perhaps minimalism is the look they were going for.I would never get a black on black one -- the interior felt like a little teeny weenie cave -- a lighter color would have certainly upped the luxury/premium quotient.Audi will sell as many of these as they can mint -- I would assume the market for the S3 would have to top out around mid-30;s (age wise). If you can afford an S3, you can afford an S4 and probably even a nicely equipped 3-series (without the i6 engine, however.) You can certainly afford a maxed out A4 SLine -- which wouldn't have the stump pulling torque, but it would have the 8 speed trans a less jittery sport suspension and actually FEEL like a premium car.I am clearly not the S3 (or A3) target market. Hell, I'm scheming for an S6 -- and hoping for an improved and all new S4 in a year or two from now.Drive it like YOU live."
February 2015,I have always run winter tires on my wife's BMW. She's had two 3ers and one 5er and we've nevr had any trouble. I run a UHP all season tire on my MS3(currently the Cooper Zeon RS3-A). The only issue is our 1500' gravel driveway- if the snow gets too deep we have to resort to Jeep Mode...
February 2015,"@graphic_guy‌ Seem a little sour to the s4/ audi experience - I too would love to see the pricing on this new v. I could never go V because it's rwd- my guess you would have issues too in Ohio winters .- numbers unreal 450/ sub 4 to 60. I'm a year one and 7k miles on the s4, cst in winter with winter tires - only complaint was service charge of 300 bux which amounted to not much more then oil change. Soured on Audi? Probably more than a little truth in that statement. Still, the S3 is something other than a refined piece in my estimation. Personally, I'd skip it for $50K and get the S4 for around the same money. Or, the afore mentioned M235i or the ATS-V. Save a bit and get a GTI or R. Either would be more livable and you'd be able to stuff some green back into your pocket.Ohio winters really aren't that bad, at least not compared to Boston, Chicago or New York. In the southern part of Ohio, we get a couple of dustings most winters. Every 3rd or 4th year, something more ""wintery"" happens, but I can live with that.I have business colleagues who live in and around San Francisco. I tell them all the time, their winters can be difficult to drive in, too. They don't get any snow, but the Bay Area is wet and cold most of the winter. Not fun to drive in because their traffic is so much worse.I like AWD installed in FWD platforms because it curbs some of the issues inherent in FWD cars. RWD doesn't have any of that. So, slap on some snow tires in the winter (just in case) and I'd be good to go."
February 2015,"The price is around $850 for 3 years... On a lease, it adds 1% to the residual, so the actual cost is closer to $400.. Which is pretty cheap for three years of scheduled maintenance."
February 2015,"I recall Audi used to sell 4-year maintenance package for around $500 (A4 price). With $300 right out of the gate, this would have been a bargain. It was even more attractive with lease as it increased the residual by couple of percent, too. Do they still do that, or did their prices increased?"
February 2015,"Or, wait a bit and get the ATS-V for what I'll assume will be a simla price and get Magnetic Ride (which is wonderful) and add a healthy dose of style to your performance.@graphic_guy‌ Seem a little sour to the s4/ audi experience - I too would love to see the pricing on this new v.

February 2015,"That goes for the all-new 2015 Golf R with 292 HP (just like the S3). If you want a stick, you gotta get the 4-door hatch."
February 2015,Well ... dang
February 2015,@kyfdx‌ You sure can.
February 2015,"I don't think you can get a stick in a Golf R, either..."
February 2015,"kyfdx...no stick on the S3 (at least that's what the sales person said). The MSRP on the one I drove, which was fairly loaded up (but you could add even more) was knocking on the $50K door, but you could still add more to it.You can get a 235ix for that money, which can be had with a manual transmision, handles as well and has a more liveable suspension.Or, wait a bit and get the ATS-V for what I'll assume will be a simla price and get Magnetic Ride (which is wonderful) and add a healthy dose of style to your performance."
February 2015,"I need to ask, what are/were the symptoms of the ""binding"" Quattro AWD system in your S4? How did you notice it? Did it happen every time? occasionally? Did it worsen over time?Details please.Maybe that's what made you not get all the BANG you paid for in the S4, because I'm surprised you felt the S3 just as quick (I know the 0-60 times tend to agree with you), but the S4 is underrated, and did you ever use the ""launch control technique"" described in the manual?"
February 2015,"You'll have to settle for the Golf R for a stick option. If you ask me, it's a fairly decent bargain since it isn't detuned mechanically. I still think the Audi interior and longer warranty and better customer service is worth at least a few grand, so it's a toss up depending on what you value. From what I've seen, there's better quality control in Ingolstadt than Mexico.I found the S4 to be stronger ""seat of the pants"" than the S3 though. 7th gear on the DSG is worth it too. Now, if they could just re-release the S4 being 300 lbs. lighter it would be perfect."
February 2015,Can you get it with a stick?
February 2015,"Had a chance to drive an S3 while I was in Indianapolis about a week ago. I usually don't do test drives unless I'm at least contemplating a car, which I'm not. But, as visiting my sister and on the way, with some time to kill, I passed an Audi dealer. Pulled in and saw they had 3 S3s. Dealer plate on and away we went.Fast car. A little small, but it reminded me of the A4 from probably 5 or 6 model years ago. Having owned the S4, the controls were all familiar. If I could only use one word to describe it? HIGHSTRUNG. If feels like it always wants to race. Suspension dances on the line between harsh and firm but never quite crosses over to harsh. You know it's working.....all the time, though. Seat of the pants performance tells me it's about the same as the S4. DSG was fun. Engine gets on the boil right now.The good news...the quattro system didn't bind like it did with my S4. It operated seamlessly. The bad news is it reminds me of some of the GM cars from the '90s. ""yeah....we can make a suspension that will corner....you'll have to put up with a ride that makes you tired and hurt your butt, but it can be done"". The suspesnion of the S3 just wears you out on anything other than glass smooth roads. The S4 would still be the way I'd go, for the better suspension alone, but the S3 would make me think twice given the price difference.If I had to go German, and I wanted a fast German sports car, I'd probably save myself a lot of money and go with the Audi's younger sibling.....the VW GTI.Or, step up the ladder and pay all the money and get a 2/335ix."
February 2015,I like the S3. Sharp looking but small. The 19' performance pck/ tires look awesome on this vehicle. Wondering what the mpg's are on the 2.0 turbo???
February 2015,"The S3 is a pretty solid package if you can live with a dual clutch gearbox and the small sedan which leads to well, a small car with a small trunk."
February 2015,"A friend of mine has a new Z06.. My son got to drive it, which sort of ticks me off..."
February 2015,RB....my friend went in the opposite direction with his Vette. He got a 1LT (lowest package with Z51 pack and Magnetic Ride Contro. No automatic. No Nav. Pretty much a stripped version (or more stripped than you usually find them).
February 2015,"A friend of mine just bought a new Stingray with every option save the 8 speed auto. He drove it to our Super Bowl party in the rain. He loves it, but to him it is still a car and he's going to enjoy driving it. He even told me ""Once it's broken in you are getting behind the wheel so I can see what it can do."" Bless his heart... I think I've about talked him into taking it to an HPDE at the new NCM course in Bowling Green Kentucky."
February 2015,"LD....I think I mentioned that my best friend bought a new Sting Rey convertible. Just an incredible car. His will be a Queen Bee, though. He'll only take it out when it's sunny and warm enough to put the top down. No track. No long trips.He almost went ballistic on me when he let me drive it and I got a bit.......ummmm....spirited with it.As I told him,,,,,""you should be ashamed of yourself"". He doesn't care. He is the ideal stereotype of a 'vette owner.Jags are nice. My sister loved her ""S"" type. She had many years of trouble free driving with it.She has a Benz now. Can't argue a Mercedes S. I wouldn't mind having one. But, it would probably be the last car I bought. And, I'd have to drive it for 30 more years until they take my license away."
January 2015,"I'm torn: I want to see Jag thrive, but (at least around here) I love not seeing one on every street corner a la 3, C and A4. Or in my case, 5, E and A6. The XF is probably more car/bigger than I need, so I'm intrigued by the XE. Although, I was hoping for styling other than MinimeXF. But, if the lottery ticket numbers align, I've fallen hard for the MB S Coupe. And, wow, I played in the new Vette at the auto show, wow. I'd love an F-Type, but the Vette is a lot of car for less $$$. Wow."
January 2015,"Yes, Acura has gone backwards in almost every category of measurement with the TLX from the TL.More negatives and downward trajectories than improvements."
January 2015,"GG, for 2016 the 3 series enters it's Mid Life cycle and gets updated, with new engines ""B"" series engines which are to make more power and be more efficient, better steering and upgrade interior. I hope the new Jag is a home run which makes everybody else do better."
January 2015,"Yeah....that's a lot of time to pass. I hear that BMW is revamping all of their drivetrains in that time. Audi's current A/S/4s are getting long in the tooth (although, one could make a case that at least the S4 is still running with the pack).I'll at least drive the Jag.After straying from German and Japanes luxury iron back into the American waters with the CTS, I'm absolutely amazed the amount of performance, technology, robust build, high quality, etc that the Folks at Cadillac have been able to come up with. As I was talking with another enhtusiast that other day, I mentioned this point. I also noted that perhaps it's not so amazing, given GM's debt was wiped off the books, the crustacean period management was shown the door, and listening more to the customers than the accountants would produce. Clean sheet, with all the engineering talent GM has, we're seeing some pretty nice resuts. My best freind has a new Corvette Sting Rey.....MERCY! Porsche who? While a bit small for my tastes, I test drove an ATS. Now THAT is a fun drive.Ben....I love me some Acuras. And, while improvements to the ILX sound promising, Acura seems to have transformed into a premium SUV company. I liked the TLX I had the opportunity I test drove. But, the hotly contested $45K-$50K market is strewn with gerat cars that offer some pretty potent entres. Heck, the wife's Accord EX-L is prett darn nice....as a performer, as a tech car, great build, good materials. We looked at the ILX and couldn't make the case for it given the Accord, all loaded up, was cheaper. One could say that the Accord V6 butts heads with the TLX. I became smitten with the SH AWD version of the TL (and that version was world class). But, even there, Acura didn't move the bar forward from the previous version. At the end of the day, I preferred the TL SH AWD to the TLX SH AWD. That's not a good thing when you're trying to sell your new iron."
January 2015,"Acura's ILX, up until this point, has been almost a joke because of the lackluster 2.0 engine. But the new ILX is going to get standard the direct-injected 2.4 liter with the 8-speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter from the larger TLX. The TLX 2.4 was tested by Motor Trend with a 0-60 time of 7.2. But since the ILX will almost certainly weigh about 500 pounds less, I'm thinking that the new ILX will really be quite a performer for the price. It's expected to start at c. $28k msrp."
January 2015,"GG as I posted by the time it arrives all the other sport sedan will have fixed their short comings to a point, so Jag better have it's game on..."
January 2015,Sounds hopeful!http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2017-jaguar-xe-sports-sedan-first-drive-review
January 2015,"FN...just saw that article last night. Jags have never been on my radar, but that one looks interesting. It will be a while before it gets here, but will at least do a test drive."
January 2015,"Here is a small article on the new Jag XE, sounds promising, however, it is not making it to our shore's until the Spring of 2016, by then the competition will be better then what it is today. For example, BMW will have a refresh 3 series for 2016 with new engines and improves steering, Lexus will have dumped the lazy 2.5l V6 in the IS250 for the new turbo 4, and MB has already improved the C class. Let's hope that Audi will dump the FWD and CVT in the A4."
January 2015,"My challenge, and why I tried different fluids and pads, was that the brake pedal would get really spongy after a couple of fast laps. Took me a couple HPDEs, but I finally figured out what the problem was. The TCS on that car had 3 settings. On; 1 push to turn off the TCS but leave on stability control; and hold it for a few secs to turn everything off. The middle setting was supposed to let you have some fun without letting it get out of hand. Well, after new fluid and pads didn't fix it, I realized that every time I would touch the curbing, it was trying to use the active rear diff (which involves braking one rear tire on that car) to ""straighten"" me out. I finally decided to give a session a shot with it fully off. It pulled out of the turns better since it wasn't holding me back anymore, and the pedal no longer went soft. Huge difference."
January 2015,"If I recall, the 135i weight advantage over the 335i is fairly small right? If I would have skipped the last 2 sessions I wonder if my rotors would have been restorable to specs. The tracks are a long drive from San Diego and I track only 2 weekends (max) per year, so I had to abuse the brakes and rotors and risk loss of brake power which can be scary. One fun thing is I had a full brake fluid reservoir and was able to pull enough G force on some turns that my ""BRAKE"" light indicator would come on briefly. Annoying multiple chimes with it though. Eventually I was able to figure out the G forces were making the fluid move enough that it triggered the low fluid sensor. I added a little bit and that solved the problem for most of the weekend."
January 2015,"I did exactly that setup on my 135i and ate through the pads in one 2-day HPDE. The stock pads, in comparison, lasted me 2 such events and still had life left in them."
January 2015,"I finally got to track my big heavy S4 and my only complaints don't involve power; there was plenty of that. The problem was weight, high speeds from all that power, and OEM brake pads. I went through 7 or 8 mm of front OEM pad in one weekend, and ruined my front rotors in the process (and blew a rubber gasket on the caliper too). I drove the snot out of the car, and it was fun, but I was left wanting more braking power. Went with the Hawk blue box HPS pads, as I'm told the OEM S4 pads are designed for A4's and their typical drivers, in frozen weather for the NE USA. Not for warm Southern CA tracks. Shame on me for assuming S4's had better brake pads than A4's. So my brake pads killed my rotors at 15K miles. Lesson learned. Also got better Motul 600 brake fluid."
January 2015,Thank heavens my wife doesn't begrudge me a few track weekends per year. They relax me more than a vacation- but we take one or two of those as well...
January 2015,"10.1 and 3:06.8 with my Vsport. Imagine if it didn't weight over 3900 lbs. haha.By the way, its nearly 2 secs faster than my mustang. that's pretty impressive."
January 2015,"To me, this vacation sounds like a much better use of money.  More than just you can enjoy a vacation.  So, kudos to you for this.  Unless you have money to burn (which I never have had), track stuff seems pretty selfish to me.  There is not much in life I enjoy more than a good vacation.  YMMV, as always.mrbean"
January 2015,"My modifications to the MS3 have been ridiculously cheap. I spent just $545 for a new Mazdaspeed intake and $230 for a used Hypertech tuner- which pumped up the motor to 310 hp and 324 lb-ft of torque. A stronger/stiffer rear motor mount from the Focus ST was a whopping $59.97. The suspension work set me back $1780- but that number includes an adjustable rear anti-roll bar with billet mounts, Koni FSDs with new strut mounts, strut bearings, and bump stops, and a set of OEM take-offs for my summer tires(Michelin Pilot Super Sports which I won for being a Street Survival coach).  So, for just $2,345 I have a car that keeps me entertained until I can find a RWD toy that is actually close to fast(0-100 in 10.5 seconds or less, VIR lap time of no more than 3.10 seconds)."
January 2015,"I want to, I plan to, when I can afford it. Unfortunately, I never did take my mustang to the track while I owned it. We took a big vacation last summer instead, so I didn't feel comfortable burning the money on a track trip. Who knows what this year will bring?"
January 2015,"Mark:I had a tune done to my '11 335i coupe. But, it was factory sanctioned and warranted, done by the dealer.It bumped up HP and torque roughly 10%. It changed the sound of the I6 turbo motor, too (for the better). Not sure that last part matters any more, though. Car manufacturers are given to pipe whatever sound they think their engines should make with noise generators through your stereo or with a resonator tapped into the firewall.Q.....funny, given my car shoice (and the regularity with which I change them), I'm often asked if I trace my cars be neighbors. I don't, at least not any more. It's not that I don't want to. It's that burning up brakes and/or tires every few months, messing with sophosticated suspensions (like the CTS's MRC), etc isn't something I want to do to a $45K, $50K, $60K car....one that I rely on as a daily driver.If you track your V, I'll come watch, though."
January 2015,"Yeah, I have absolutely no intention of tuning my caddy. The only time I would ever see the results would be at the track, so its just not worth it."
January 2015,"Getting a state of tune that increases torque and power and comes as a factory option is:1. An additional revenue stream2. Not standard since it probably impacts the durability of the car in question -- but, due to the probable customer who would pay the additional and want the power bump, probably not that much of an issue since the customer MAY be inclined to not keep the car into triple digit (before the 000) miles.This factory option, then is probably a win for all, in short.I look at what APR and others have done for the current S4 and even RS7 Audis -- and I'm tempted. But, then, I also know the risk of running naked, without a warranty -- and I think, nah baby nah.I at least like the concept and notion that my S4 will be both reliable (not too much of a stretch for any car, these days) AND durable (that's the $64,000 or in my case $57,000 question.) The standard state of tune, I'd wager is more likely to have that characteristic. Further, when I push the S4 in standard tune, it seems to me to be so much more capable than the vast majority of cars, I sometimes simply say -- why bother (""sometimes"" I say this.)"
January 2015,"My tune on my BMW has not affected my MPG at all, I'm still averaging 30."
January 2015,"So, yes, if you drive the vehicle to its potential (where you are actually utilizing that extra power), you will burn more fuel. So that is one reason. As for the warranty, well, stressing an engine just a little more and lasting through the warranty period isn't so tough. It is the longevity after the warranty expires that engineers can still concern themselves with. A particular car brand wouldn't sell too well if the majority of them self-destruct at 80k miles, for example. So sell the car with an less-stressed engine and that 99% of buyers who never modify it will demonstrate the car's reliability and reinforce a reputation. (that is, of course, for cars with a good reputation)"
January 2015,My mildly tuned MS3 develops an average of 50 lb-ft of torque over the stock engine from 3000 rpm to 6000 rpm and fuel economy actually improved a bit- when I can resist the urge to stay out of boost...
January 2015,"If you can get a tune that keeps the warranty I wonder why it wasn't standard in the first place. I bet gas mileage will drop in exchange for that 90 lb-ft. Sell a gimped but still quick car with decent mileage, report decent mileage to the government for CAFE purposes, then sell a cheap ECU flash that un-gimps the engine..."
January 2015,If it's around 2k I would really consider this if I had the Eco stang. Lighter then gt - good fuel Eco and close figures on paper
January 2015,You will soon be able to get a tune from Ford Racing that provides a healthy power bump yet preserves the factory warranty. The FRPP tune for the Focus ST boosts midrange torque by 90 lb-ft.
January 2015,Sweet!
January 2015,Eco boost stang getting good press and looks like its easy to toon.http://youtu.be/X0Qnov8aCA8
January 2015,"I still like the Challenger R/T and SRT,; big as they are they are pretty quick(well, the SRT is, at least) and just entertaining and involving in a way that most of the other cars I've looked at just aren't.I want to like the BRZ/FR-S but I just can't. Not appreciably quicker than my Club Sport with no other redeeming qualities.The Mustang? I looked at an Ecoboost, but really, a ponycar without a V8 is like the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue without Kathy Ireland(that dates me, I realize). As for the V8, yes, it's fast and handles well, but again, it lacks that ""Gotta Have It!"" vibe I need to keep a sled long term.The Challenger is big and brash and unashamedly retro in an intriguing way- and with the SRT notching up a 1/4 mile time in the high 12 second range along with decent handling and braking, I could enjoy it for some time. If I'm going to have numb steering I want some other facets of the car to entertain me- and the F30 3ers just don't excite me at all- even my lowly MS3 can show a clean pair of heels to a 335i these days..."
January 2015,"Stick...all good points. I don't think I worry as much about things going awry because it's rare that I keep a car outside the warranty term. I can't imagine what the cost would be to replace something like iDrive, MMI, CUE, etc. Then again, so much of it is software based, maybe they just download firmware.As it stands, I can control my iPhone through CUE (Siri eyes) now. Is it a big jump to think that the electronics on our cars will be controlled entirely by our smart devices? I have the Magnetic Ride Control on the CTS. Is it far fetched to theink that Cadillac can change the algorithm to how it respoinds via a software download via your phone? How about changing how your steering responds via download, given that most are electronic steering systems today?Cadillac could change the entier look of CUE and the way it fhnctions with a download. But, you have to have that starting point in order to do that.Will that make cars more or less reliable as a result? These are all hypotheticals, but it doesn't take too big of a leap of faith to see where this could go."
January 2015,"Huh. But you were looking at Challengers, right? I'm surprised considering the cars you seem to love are pretty lightweight. You checked out the Toyobaru, right? I would imagine the power is a letdown, though. What else have you tried out? New Stang, perhaps?"
January 2015,"on the flip side GG, the thought of keeping these modern hi-tech marvels for a long time/lot of miles is scary. My 2000 TL went 175K for me, but that car was a relative ox-cart compared to yours. The only worry I had was the tranny crapping out, and that was still simple even if it would cost around 3K! The rest of the fancy stuff was basic (bun warmers, BOSE radio, normal power options). I changed out the suspension front and rear on sale at Sears for about $600."
January 2015,"Mark....well said. I think all manufacturers, but particularly the American marques, have made such great strides in build, reliability, and longevity that is unparrallelled in any time in the industy's history.It used to be Honda or Toyota were the brands you bought for reliability. Not so sure you can make a significant case for that any more. Aside from Land Rover and Smart, who iare notoriously troublesome, one should expect a long, durable life from all of today's cars.Technology in cars is moving at break neck speed. You mentioned having your car become a wifi hot spot. Who would have thought of that even 5 short years ago?In these classes of cars, in addition to great motors and transmissions, suspensions become much more sophosticated. I know in the CTS, I'm amazed at how smooth the suspension is on the interstate, and at the same time can carve up some backroads with equal sophistication.With the torque vectoring you find in your S4, and what I had in my TL SH AWD, Cadillac has their own version of it, allowing rotation and curve hugging that borders on the unbelievable.Even the materials in cars of this class are first rate. While both my Audi and TL had pleasant materials, Cadillac is using real wood, real aluminum, real chrome, real suede, controls work like they are bathed in butter or have a tactile feel that really begins to define what the marketers are striving for.....a high end, high quality look ad feel.Aside from some of the foibles we have had with our cars (mostly along the lines of dealers and/or manufacturers not listening to our complaints), our cars are at the height of car making right now....again, especially in this class."
January 2015,My Club Sport track rat has over 140k on it with no major repairs; ditto for my 148k MS3. My son's X3 has nearly 170k on it with one major repair- but since I haven't had a car payment since 2006 I think I'm still ahead of the game.Still looking for something RWD under $40k that shows even the slightest promise of being entertaining.No joy.
January 2015,"Reliable and Durable:I am not a good ambassador of/for the durability of [Audi's in particular] German cars -- since the highest mileage I've ever put on one was just south of 67,000 miles (a 2005 Audi A6 3.2). However, my Audis (and we've had dozens of them) have always been very reliable (excluding our 1978 Audi 5000 which did die young, or at least the battery died young). We never had what I would call a catastrophic failure of the drive train in any of them, period. Moreover, I suspect our 2011 Infiniti FX35 would have ""run perfectly"" until the wheels turned square and the pistons fell apart -- but we only kept it until it had some 55,000 miles on the OD, so again, who knows -- it, like our Audis was totally reliable. And then:Our 2012 Acura SH-AWD seemed like a budget Audi S4 (a good thing), but it certainly felt both flimsy and tinny (even the doors closed with wimpy thud). And the brakes had about one good stop in them from speed before they faded; and, the rotors almost always felt warped -- even though much of that turned out to be three bent wheels (that Acura paid 50% of the cost of replacement). Three bent wheels? Even if I was abusive while driving, I still find it hard to believe there were 3 bent wheels -- and that the original dealer never thought to road-force balance the wheels to see if THAT was the reason the brakes always appeared to chatter and rumble so.I have to assume the new ATS and CTS (I did drive the latter) are very fine cars -- my in-laws were Cadillac people, but their experiences were with much older models (pre-2007) and during those [dark] years, their Cadillacs could hardly drive past the dealership without needing to go in to remedy some malady or another.Cars of all ilks, today, I must assume are very reliable and probably durable, too. I am thinking that based on the way my wife puts miles on her SQ5, we may want to trade it in after about 36-42 months due to the ""depreciation"" hit that happens at about 100,000 miles, not due to any serious ""durability"" or reliability issues.I can't remember where I read (or heard, perhaps) that virtually all ""modern"" cars will be essentially trouble free (not necessarily low maintenance, though) for a minimum of 150,000 miles. One of the folks I work with has a Bimmer (530) with over 170,000 miles on it and has never had any major repairs, only the maintenance required by the book. He's had dents and dings aplenty (and had them all fixed), but nothing major, ever.My friend says he puts about $500 in the car two or three times per year -- and everything works pretty much the same as it did when he bought the thing new in 2004.I'm a fan of the ""factory"" sponsored extended mntce and warranty programs -- and in my case, since my car is leased, I can have the car CPO'd to 100,000 miles for about $1,500 as long as I do so under 50,000 miles and have proof I've maintained the scheduled mntce requirements.I keep thinking this S4 is so good it will be a keeper -- at least so long as at least one of our cars has the latest and greatest technology. That's the drawback -- as each new gen of these cars comes out they add or update some ""gotta have"" feature or tech (yeah, ""gotta have"" for me, that is). My friend who is part owner of an airplane says he just keeps upgrading his decades old plane with the newest and greatest tech and rebuilds the engine so that despite its age, his plane is actually kept completely up to date. Makes me wish at least some of that approach would trickle down to automobiles. First thing I'd do is swap out that T-Mobile Internet connection module/radio. Why can't there just be a jack that allows the car to ""sniff"" the Internet from my iPhone. I know, follow the money.In conclusion, congratulations and kudos to those of you getting new Cadillacs and frankly just about anything new that might qualify today as an ELLPS or LPS car. I wonder, too, at the price point, if the new Genesis is yet a candidate for either ""class"" [of car] -- I've looked at them and they are seriously -- almost Audi A6 -- nice. Yet they're priced like an A4.Happy New Year."
January 2015,"When did GM end the across the board 5 yr./100K miles Power Train Warranty? That was better, though only marginally than the 6 yr./70. I remember they even extended that old 100K warranty to SAAB. I wasn't frightened at one point of the reliability of my mid-90's Dodge either. I figured by the mid-nineties Americans had figured out how to make a halfway decently reliable car. Didn't stop it from being a lemon though."
January 2015,"I dragged myself to a Caddy dealer to drive one for the first time before easily deciding to get the (ordered from Germany in August 2013) S4 for more bang for my buck. I drove the ATS 2.0T and 3.6. The high sticker shock was tremendous and a first strike. A minor imperfection in the roadway unsettling the car and suspension was strike 2, and I just didn't feel the in the pants OOMPH from the butt Dyno I wanted to feel. I may have to start driving used broken-in cars with some miles on them already because I think programming is making some of these new cars feel sluggish on test drives due to perhaps ""built-in"" breaking-in programming?"

January 2015,"I'm at 24K miles with the 320. Yesterday Rick and I went to the Lexus dealer and looked at the new NX and RX, Rick likes the NX and I like the RX. I think he realizes the NX is just too small for us and that the RX is just right.. The dealer was very laid back no pushing us to sit down and talk numbers. As we were talking to the salesman, a lot person brought up a new 2015 RC in Molton Pearl (orange) wow is all I have to say, what a stunning color.. It was a FC-F Sport, $51K it had the Mark Levinson/Nav package, we talked about it and I test drove it, I came very close in getting it, WOW, what a car, but the salesman was honest and told me that dealer isn't dealing on them and I would pay MSRP for it.. The car was that good, seats and steering was first rate, the engine and 8 spd tranny were just as good as BMW's, Lexus is very serious about this car and it shows... I don't think they have any problems selling every since one of them..."
January 2015,"I concur. Matter of fact, I consider it the best piece of automotive GPS/Voice/Touch control on the market. And, I've used Audi's MMI, BMW's iDrive and Acura Link. Even the ""MyCadillac/OnStar"" app is great. I can remotely start th ecar, see current MPG on the current tankful, find where I parked my car, lock/unlock the car, download addresses from the internet to the car's GPS, etc.I use my phone as a hot spot, so no need for in car internet service."
January 2015,"speaking of infotainment systems, I don't understand all the media hate of CUE. I prefer it to the system in my wife's Chrysler. I find it easier to navigate and certainly offers more features. Hell, at least Siri works with it, which is more than I can say for the Chrysler. Anyway, I like CUE. Just putting that out there."
January 2015,"I'm now at 22,000 miles on my '14 S4 -- the car, in every way has been flawless. Oh, I need to correct that: the Audi Connect feature (free for 6 months) was great (when it worked) when I was ""in signal."" The thing is, someone at Audi of America made a deal with ""the fastest"" 3G provider (at the time) T-Mobile. However, at least in SW Ohio the coverage, at best, is poor-to-fair, and overall is 2G to poor. The screen indicator registers 2G about 1/3rd of the time (which renders the feature useless). Now, it is true that when T-Mobile is able to pump out true 3G it can be as good as what sometimes passes for 4G from some carriers.I had enjoyed using this feature with the voice command to verbally invoke ""Internet Destination, Morton's of Chicago"" or other destinations that would have normally had to have been found via calling 411, getting the number, calling the ""destination"" asking for the address and THEN entering it into the sat nav.The thing is, the price for this service is $30/month -- which is galling since the TV commercials claim (for SW Ohio) 4, 4G LTE lines (family promo) for $100/mo. Of course, were I to buy a new A3, Audi Connect no longer uses T-Mobile.I'd pay $10/month for this crappy (T-Mobile) service -- but $30 for 2G? No way.The concept and the technology (in the car) make a lot of sense and when things work as expected (even in 3G) the execution is great (within a two block radius of a certain signal location). Swapping out the radio or ""unlocking"" the radio via software or some other method (the sim card?) would make my experience with this vehicle ""the best ever.""For those folks who want driving performance, I can assure you the S4 (with the 7-speed DSG) is, let me see, effortless to drive, meaning that there is nothing (within reason) the car won't do without breaking a sweat. Another descriptive term: ""carve"" -- driving the car is as effortless as cutting warm butter with a hot knife.Obviously, I am off-put by one little piece of tech that some folks who live in a strong T-Mobile reception areas probably can't relate to. But in terms of reliability and ""tightness"" this S4 is as new-feeling at 22K miles as it was with 22 miles.That's the story so far."
January 2015,"I've had my S4 for about a year now (more if you include down-time due to accident), and I haven't had any problems with it. Looks like you took out all the problems with your S4, and everyone else is benefitting! I'm at nearly 16K miles I think."
January 2015,
January 2015,"well, at least now the CTS and S70 are both sedans. T&C and CTS are our ""nice"" cars that we each really want/love, while the Fit and S70 are our ""beaters."" We each drive over 20k miles a year, and having inexpensive second cars for each of us to pile miles on seems like a good solution in my twisted logic. The S70 was simply cheap and supremely comfortable, and I am intimately familiar with repairing that model. The Fit seemed to be a reasonable edition for a small monthly payment, and I like hatchbacks, and it gets great mileage. I guess my S70 qualifies as the entry level luxe sedan for volvo in 1998, but its definitely lacking performance. haha. I think my CTS is well beyond entry level these days. So, sorry for the off-topic."

January 2015,Indeed.
January 2015,"Plus the way these guys flip, 2 of them may be gone by the time 2016 rolls around."
January 2015,That's true but very often one person will remark about their uncle's co-worker's sister that had a flat tire on her 1972 Deville and many accept that as proof that Cadillac must still make bad cars.
January 2015,"*""I know of three folks in these forums who have purchased / leased Cadillacs this year. 1 ATS and 2 CTS (one a V-Sport).""**""None of them seemed to be frightened of any reliability issues.""*You know of course that these anecdotal stories from this forum are not the same as the broad population of buyers - which is why my statement can still be true."
January 2015,"Should my lottery numbers ever hit or I get a large inheritance from a rich relative I don't know, I'm very interested in the ATS Coupe. I think it looks better than the 2- or 4-series coupe from BMW or the A5. Have heard many good things about the 272 HP 2.0L turbo engine."
January 2015,"Wow the coverage on caddy is unreal- good for the customers who are going that way. Cool looking cars- good to see reliability has come back but as others state above- I'm a car guy and I have not driven a caddy in my life- I'm mid thirties - in fact I have not been in one or a Lincoln in 10 years (not including biz trips to and from the airport runs). I'm trying to put a finger on why I have not driven/looked at one- recall concerns seem like a cop out, no one I know owns them-"
January 2015,"Exactly. All these things are cyclical. Look at the reliability/warranty issues that Audi and BMW seem to experience. I would be shocked if Cadillac wasn't far superior. I tell you, if anyone drives an ATS like mine for any length of time, they are going to be won over. I was out in it today and it is the first time maybe ever that I kept driving around randomly, just for the sake of having fun. What a hot-rod hoot of a machine that thing is! I love it."
January 2015,"well, Caddy has really stepped up on peace of mind. 4yr/50k bumper-to-bumper, 4yr/50k included maintenance, and 6yr/70k power train. Is there a better standard coverage offering in the lux market?"
January 2015,"I used to tell my sales staff that high sales volume at low margins does not mean they're good at their jobs. High margins coupled with high volumes were the keys to success.Getting the margins right for Caddy is going to take a while. In the interim, we're getting some really good deals on some very fine cars."
January 2015,...and I believe that the younger set aren't seeing the taint of their grandpa's Caddy whereas they don't want to drive their father's Mercedes.As for viewing fewer sales as better - he sees fewer profitable sales as better than low/no profit higher volume.
January 2015,"tlong said:I think the reason people aren't buying Caddys is that their traditional demo is dying off and the younger set is seeing the taint of decades of GM mediocrity and reliability issues.
I know of three folks in these forums who have purchased / leased Cadillacs this year. 1 ATS and 2 CTS (one a V-Sport).None of them seemed to be frightened of any reliability issues."
January 2015,And the new head of Cadillac has the very odd view that fewer sales are somehow better.....???
January 2015,I think the reason people aren't buying Caddys is that their traditional demo is dying off and the younger set is seeing the taint of decades of GM mediocrity and reliability issues.
January 2015,"Here is an article by Road and Track of what they though at the coolest cars of the 80's. One of the cars was the Saab 900, funky doesn't really describe this car, but it was a good handler and a comfortable car."
January 2015,"Losing $6K depreciation on the CTS probably isn't in the cards. But, I bought it right. So, it will all even out.I'm one of the few who actually liked the TL's styling. But, I realize I was in the minority. Good cars, especially for the money. CTS is a different level of car. The CTS' turbo 2.0L performs better than the TL with the 3.7L 6 cylinder. 50-50 weight distribution which makes for great CTS handling. In short, it looks better, handles better, performs better, is build better with better materials than my TL. That said, the CTS costs thousands more, too. So, it better be that much better than the TL.In the honeymoon phase with it. If it stays out of the dealership service dept, I'll be a happy camper."
December 2014,"Redic motivated - I hope the cts adds up to a good car for you. 100x better looking then the tL, as we can now agree was an amazingly ugly/ not so much in post surgery - but the early 08/11 wow Really bad. If you can get 6k off the CtS in 2 years please give me a call before you do it- need to see the approach"
December 2014,Thank you Sween. Motivated dealer who wanted to right a wrong and move into the customer service top tier was the key to the deal.
December 2014,"Ok well I officially call this deal the best of all time'- infact in my region within 250miles there are 6 TLs that are priced higher then your trade in price, all are 2014s with the exception of one 13 that has half the miles you traveled. Add in the ridiculous deal you got on the cts and it adds up to a nice kia."
December 2014,'13 Advance....20K miles.
December 2014,@graphicguy - what year was the TL and how many miles- ?
December 2014,"carnaught.....still in break in. Only 4 fillups so far. 1st tank-19MPG. 2nd tank-21MPG...all city. 3rd tank was 24MPG, about 50-50 city/highway.On my 4th tank, now.The car computer is fairly accurate. It's about 2-3/10ths off on the conservative side from my manual calculations."
December 2014,"Graphic, question for you. What are you getting for gas mileage? I realize that this is a minor issue currently while gas/oil prices are at a several year low. To me, in 2015 (well just about), along with style and other features, I just can't hang my hat on cars getting 18-22 mpg unless they're high performance or ultra-luxury vehicles. Like the new Caddy's though except the SRX doesn't do anything for me."
December 2014,"circle....good points. I think Cadillac is going through a transition. Not sure if people are used to paying prices similar to Benz or Audi or BMW. My dealer says he sells every $85K Escalade he can get his hands on....at MSRP plus. Cadillac split their lux sport sedan series in two. What used to be the CTS doing battle against the 3 and 5 series, the C and E class, the Audi A4 and A6, is now the duty of the ATS against the 3, C and A4, with the CTS doing battle against the 5, E, and A6.CTS moved up the ladder, with the ATS going against the cars we talk about in here.Their President even admitted this isn't going to happen over night, but will probably take a couple of years.Cadillac is in a unique situation where they don't seem to care about their ""traditional"" customer. I don't know if they ever would have snagged me unless the CTS were such a very good car to begin with.You'll have the customer who bought a previous gen of the CTS and walk into the showroom thinking ""no way I'll spend $7K more for the new one over the old one."" Cadillac points them in the direction of the ATS and says....here's a better car than your previous CTS and it costs less. Some will get that. Some won't.However, if you want an even better car than the ATS, here's the CTS.Again, it will take some time. And, some won't even like the way the new ATS or CTS drive, given they are more on the sports end of the luxury sports sedan/coupe market.But, once they take hold, I think they have a very good foundation to build on to compete, and excel in both spaces.They seem determined to do what it takes to get there. Good cars. Drive an ATS or CTS if you get a chance. They are very good sport luxury cars....almost getting to the point where tehy are filling the voids that Mercedes and BMW have abandoned."
December 2014,"And to be fair, the new CTS is priced right in line with the cars that GM sees as its key competitors: the Mercedes-Benz E Class, the BMW 5-Series, and Audi's A6. But Cadillac's customers aren't used to paying those kinds of prices, and some are shopping elsewhere. Meanwhile, BMW and Mercedes buyers aren't (yet) flocking to Cadillac's showrooms to make up the difference. In other words, Cadillac is losing its old customers -- but isn't yet winning enough new ones to make up the difference. So, why isn't Cadillac trimming its prices?Not long ago, a price cut would have been GM's response. But these days, Cadillac is under new management -- and its new president, longtime Audi executive Johan de Nysschen, ordered something different: a big cut in production at the factory that makes the two sedans."
December 2014,"Sween...paid $38 and change for the TL. Caddy dealer gave $32. Figure he'll ask 34, sell for 33.CTS is a '14....C&D Top 10. Caddy can't sell them. Don't know why. It's as nice of a car as I've ever driven. Caddy slapped a $6K rebate on them. I figure there's another $5K in hidden trunk money. Dealer sells at cost, moves a unit, gets closer to 2014 GM unit bonus."
December 2014,@graphicguy - can you go over those numbers again with this trade - / hard to believe you got 15k off a new car and then at the same time were able to trade the TL in for 6k less then paid after 2 years- (did you also get 6k off when buying the TL originally? I have done a few car deals in my day but this tops the cake.
December 2014,"Billy...I really had no good reason to explain why I got rid of the TL SH AWD. Great cars....all the TL's I've had.Long and short of it, through a friend of a friend, I met the owner (and his son) of a Caddy dealer that my late Mother did business with. I had relayed the terrible experience my late Mother had with the dealership about 10 years ago (one that I had to get involved with to work it out). He explained that the entire staff had turned over since then, and that he was not aware of my Mother's issues. He invited me to just come in and meet his son, who had just been named the GM of the dealership and to see how they had totally refurbished the physical building.I'm a car guy. I was curious. Went there. Got a tour of the newly remodelled dealership. Was invited to take a car home over the weekend. Really was enamored with the way the CTS drove and how well it was built. I essentially got a $60K car less $15K+ and, over two years of ownership, I only lost $6K on the TL. Thought it was a good deal.Rest is history."
December 2014,
December 2014,"No question, happened to me on the '06 330xi I leased. Made the station pay for a new rim!Cost me $250 for the tire and cost him the same! True RFT commerce!"
December 2014,"RB...you're a track guy. I admire you as your interest in track work isn't just superficial (vs some people I know who trick out their autox cars and like their car's decals more than their cars). I did some autox years ago (in a Toyota Corolla 16V), but I was mostly a 1/4 mile, dragstrip guy....had my own rat rod for that very purpose.Some people (including myself) just want a good handling car that can get out of its own way and offers some creature comforts.The majority want a 3 pointed star, or a roundel. Their car hunt begins and ends there.stick....I view the 320i to be a spiritual successor to the 2002. Having been in one of the original 2002s (not mine, but a college friend's), they broke the mold. BMW has built on that success. They are where they are today as a result of the 2002's initial success."
December 2014,Graph- Can I ask? Why did you get rid of your TL?
December 2014,"Sorry FN....just saw your question. Spent last week visiting wife's brother in San Francisco.I got the CTS AWD Performance version. The Magnetic Ride suspension is the real deal. Allegedly, the MRC is capable of infinitely changing the shock settings something like a 1,000 times a second, depending on road conditions. It has its own version of torque vectoring. These ""trick"" torque vectoring schemes really do improve the handling of these cars (as with the Audi S and TL SH AWD).It smooths out the roughest roads, yet stays sharp when cornering and rotating. Like most cars in this class, the adjustable suspension is available. I keep it in ""Sport"", which firms the steering response (best version of electronic steering I've used) and changes shift patterns. Feels much like a RWD based Audi Quattro or TL SH AWD. Put it in ""touring"" mode, and it feels much like a 4matic E class or an A6 Quattro.Sport mode, while ""firm"" really doesn't describe the ride accurately, Great seats, while not the sport seats in the TL SH AWD (which I loved), but certainly more ""sporty"" and comfortable than the hard, flat Mercedes seats. and not nearly as ""hard"" as the S4's.Not as speedy as an Audi S4, but quite torquey. Probably 0-60 in the 5 1/2 to 6 second range.....works for me. Probably more torque in the lower rev ranges than the TL....especially around town. It gets up and scoots to extra legal speeds in short order on the highway.All the gee gaws. It took a few days to get used to CUE. But, now that I am, all the controls for it fall immediately to had once the proximity sensor senses your hand near the screen. Touch controls work. Instead of sliding the ""metal bars"", you realize those bars are only there to guide your fingers. You slide just above the metal bars. All the chrome, wood, aluminum, suede, leather, etc is all real. Build and materials are all exemplary and as good, or better than anything in the class.For reasons that befuddle me (and probably Cadillac, considering the accolades the car has received), the discounts were substantial on the CTS. I got into one for about the price of a middle of the road A4, TL, 3 series.....a screaming bargain, that according to their management, will be the last time those deals will be available for the same car.Yes, it's new. Yes, I'm enamored with it. Pretty darn happy with a car that's made in Detroit that's able to match, and in some important ways, excel over the E, A6, etc out there."
December 2014,"I'd consider a 320i if the steering was decent- I just can't accept a setup that is so devoid of feel- in a BMW, at any rate."
December 2014,"I actually thought that the 320i, when it was introduced, was what purists were looking for. Simpler, marginally lighter, cheaper. More of the spiritual descendant to the early 2002 and 3 series cars than a massively powered 335. The volume model in the later 90s/early 2000s was likely the 323/325, right? so if anything, the 320 really is the entry level BMW to allow people that want one to get into ""the family"", same as the 323/325 did previously. it drives like a BMW, looks and feels like one, etc. So if anything, the purist's problem shouldn't be with the 320, it is the whole series."
December 2014,"As I noted in another topic, in 2007 I wrote an article on the international launch of the E93. I noted that BMW would sell every one they make, even if it had the driving dynamics of a Chevrolet Cobalt. The latest BMWs aren't nearly that bad-yet-but perhaps the tagline ""The Ultimate Fashion Accessory"" would be a more accurate advertising theme."
December 2014,"Wow! That's variety. My question is this: would there be a market for 107 variants of the 3-series in the US? And, that question assumes the cost of marketing to ""the market"" would have to include certification for the US. My assumption is that the market for 107 variants of the 3-series just isn't there, for if it were, it would seem to make sense that BMW (of America) would go ahead and import (and bear the cost of certification) the ""in demand"" portion of the range up to 107 variants. Someone, in charge, must have the data to support not doing this -- and by data I mean sales data or market research in support of increased choice.Of course I said my assumption -- is there any reason to think there IS a [profitable] market for that kind of variety?While I am at asking [hypothetical] questions, I am wondering why I've never seen an Audi or BMW (or any other brand, perhaps excluding Porsche) with a red leather interior ""in inventory""? -- yet it seems that ""everyone"" says they love red leather interiors. Both my wife and I had to order red leather in our 2014 Audi S cars -- despite the dealer telling us that if they do a dealer trade and end up with a car with red leather that such an outfitted car typically sells more quickly than one with, say, black or gray or brown leather.I assume the dealer rep was probably patronizing us [regarding red leather] (at least a little bit) but the claim is that white is the single most popular car color and dealer inventories (of Audis and BMWs) do seem to support that notion.One more question: what does it mean to say something to the effect that such and such a brand of car is ""worn"" (as opposed to driven, I assume)? I read the comment that new BMWs appeal to customers who want to wear their cars -- suggesting to me that the characterization ""worn"" was pejorative (at least as far as the author was concerned)."
December 2014,"BMW UK lists 46 variants of the 3-series with gasoline engines and a further 61 in diesel. They don't all represent different drivelines, but at least half do, with different engine size, transmission and AWD options that would each have to be certified separately by the EPA at what I'm told is huge expense. This in a country that is right-hand drive, while the majority of BMW production goes the other way, so don't tell me about economy of scale.I wouldn't mind ordering the car just the way I wanted it, if I could, but only a handful of the variants are available over here, and none are the ones I'm interested in. I think they've finally got oil level indicators that work, unlike the those that were first introduced to replace the stone-simple dipstick . Apparently one of the reasons was the oil vapor that escaped from the open dipstick tube(?!). Well beyond the point of diminishing returns I would think.I could change out the solid-rubber-feeling run-flats but there's no point with the vehicle choice that's available here."
December 2014,"The cars that are sold here in the US at least are here because of the customers, not the government. The governmental rules and regulations do not single out BMW or Cadillac or Fiat. The playing field, so to speak, is level. How a company responds to these regulations is what differentiates it.Overwhelmingly, the reason the cars from BMW are they way they are is because these cars sell -- if manual transmission diesel Bimmers, etc, were selling, they'd be brought into the US (assuming they are actually manufactured).In the universe that I am familiar with, I know that Audi of America responded to a LOUD, but very very tiny campaign (that I participated in) to reintroduce the manual transmission to the A6. Audi went ahead and made the A6 manual trans version available to US customers. The cars sat on the lots of understandably pissed dealers who bought the cars for inventory only to have them sit and sit and sit for months and months. I did go ahead and order the ""last"" manual transmission (think of the song the ""Last DJ"") Audi of size in 2003. It was an allroad and I had to special order it because the dealership general manager told me he had been burned by millions tied up in floorplanning manual trans A6's to an unmoved and ""I'll take my business elsewhere"" market.The last BMW I drove was a 2014 5 series with a bunch of options including X-drive and all of the stuff BMW deems fit to call ""sport"" or at least sport-like. The car was quick, fast, quiet, comfortable and for its size cornered like a snake in a rat hole (credit my wife for the phrase).One of the folks I work with has a 2005 BMW 5 series -- there is no comparison, the 2014 is the more desirable car.The car is what it is due to the votes cast by the market. We may, or some of us may, deride the newer cars as mere shadows of their ancestors, posers even; but, again, from the perspective of the engineers, marketers, sales people, etc associated with BMW, the new cars are improvements, advancements of the ""breed"" (or brand, at least).Yeah, I know, I'm preaching to the:Use itUse it upWear it outDo without. . .crowd. But, whatever one likes is certainly one's prerogative. I'll defend that too."
December 2014,I'm not.
December 2014,"The emphasis on electronic gadgetry and increasingly complex solutions to fairly simple problems (8-speed automatic transmission, anyone) is what leads so many people to dread running these ""new and improved"" cars bare (past their warranties).I fail to see why EPA/CARB-driven cars are superior to the incredible variety of vehicles that are available in Europe and elsewhere in the world. Certifying a drive train is so bloody expensive in the U.S. that any given manufacturer limits what's sold here to a bare minimum. If BMW sold any of the small diesel wagons (with a manual) that have been available for decades elsewhere here in the U.S. I'd already be driving one.Oh, and if anyone thinks run-flat tires, another solution looking for a problem, make any sense out here in the West, I'd be interested in their reasoning. Driving hundreds of miles with only rudimentary services available, particularly on the weekends and/or at night, without a spare tire of any kind, is asking for a three-day delay while the necessary $300 tire is shipped to within 50 miles of where you had a simple flat tire. Then there's the question of whether the tire machine at Ed's Gas, Bait and Whorehouse in Austin, NV, will be able to get it installed without totally wrecking the new tire, the wheel, or both.It's clear that the majority, as dictated to by various governments, have given us the selection of vehicles that are available. I choose not to participate, and I don't think I'm alone. The majority on here seem to think it's wonderful. Party on."
December 2014,"I don't think the enthusiasts are actually clamoring for simply a remanufactured 2002; what they want is a car that continues to embody the traditional BMW virtues- a nimble car that communicates what it is doing to the driver. Cadillac and Lexus are actually moving into that automotive niche while BMW abandons it. Pandering to the status-conscious ""wearers"" who want a featherbed ride and minimum involvement in the driving process may generate short-term gains, but those folks will move on to the next shiny ""in"" bauble in a heartbeat."
December 2014,"~BMW has not done much, if anything, because it ""needs"" to make money. It is a for profit company it does everything it does because it must make money -- fine point between needs and must, I know, but I think it is a given that all of these automobile companies are for profit. They were when they made the versions of cars that ""used to be"" so much better -- if they actually were better then than they are now.The perspective that I hold currently is that BMW is actually making cars they have evidence their customers want. They have ""proof"" that their new cars are an improvement over their previous models and their customers affirm that proof. If the customers don't affirm, they make changes to the cars until the cars ""succeed.""A key reason for the almost total abandonment of the manual transmission, for example, (by BMW, to name just one) is the customers (BMW is seeking) perceive them to be less desirable than the automatic shifting transmissions available. Said another way, automatic transmissions are superior to manual transmissions -- according to the market BMW caters to and wants (and needs and must) to sell to. That is an empirical fact -- it is not an opinion (based on the results that can be measured). If you -- the rhetorical you -- believe a manual transmission is superior, that is your opinion. The facts do not support the opinion, or if so, only slightly. Now one may prefer a manual transmission (again this is but one example) over a manual transmission, but that -- from the perspective that BMW values -- is an outlier, an anomaly, virtually irrelevant.I believe I have suggested previously, that ""we"" killed manual transmissions -- we killed them by not buying them, not because they weren't or aren't offered; they're not offered because we didn't buy them.Likewise, 4 and 6 cylinder engines (as another example) replaced 8 cylinder engines because ""we"" deemed them superior -- and proved thus by buying cars with 6's and 4's. The market proved that there really was a substitute for displacement -- and that was volume-metric efficiency.I do not believe that ALL new BMW's or Mercedes or Audis or whatever brand you favor are superior to their ""ancestors"", but the vast majority, the overwhelming majority of them are. I applaud anyone's affection for nostalgia -- I am often sentimental; the older I get the more I represent that remark, in fact. But nostalgia often -- some would say always -- represents a filtered view of the past. BMW (et al) would almost certainly fail if it attempted to build its new cars to emulate its previous generations, no matter how highly acclaimed or ""remembered"" they may be.Auto transmissions, forced induction smaller displacement engines, softer riding suspensions and more and more reliance upon ""technology"" are good things, superior things, actual improvements over previous generation's offerings and capabilities.You may not, for whatever reason, agree -- but the market, fundamentally, says you're wrong.Now, being somewhat (sometimes) of a fellow Luddite, I did (and sometimes still do) mourn the virtual and soon to be total death of the manual transmission. However, now that I have 20,000 miles worth of experience with an Audi 7-speed DSG connected to a super-charged 6, I must finally admit Eli Whitney had a pretty good idea after all.Dammit!"
December 2014,"@flightnurse:Wow, so an F30 handles better than an Altima, Camry, or Accord. Now THAT is a glowing recommendation! And as for ""road feel""[sic] not being a concern? You don't have to drive flat out on the street to understand why it's nice to know the level of grip you have available.Finally, note that I only said BMW was building cars that pleased poseurs- I didn't call out anyone in this thread; I'm actually surprised anyone rose to the bait."
December 2014,"Name calling never ends well- but like flight says a bmw does need to make money - thus the 320 was born. Its ""el cheapo"" bmw that plays many of rolls. It's got a bmw badge, it's cheaper then the old standard ultimate driver that came with a 6, it's holds value to get the lease payments lower (thus allowing ""poseurs"" to ""own"" one), it's great to put in print that you can lease one for 299 a month, It's also great having ""el cheapo"" in the showrooms as it brings in customers looking to go cheap then adding 10k in options or moving entirely up in class because that said bmw doesn't have nav or a cup holder. Point is all lux brands are doing this - makes sense given how close the base bmw (or other luxury cars are, around 30k) and how that compares to mainstream auto prices ."
December 2014,"Oh lord, BMW is a car company in which it needs to make money, so they build cars that majority of people would buy. If BMW would go back and build just niche cars they wouldn't be making any money, because people like you Road don't buy enough cars to keep BMW open. Yes, todays 3 series, 5 series are bigger cars, just like the Mazda 6, Camry, A4, and C class are bigger then their last generation. So does my F30 have the road feel that my E46 330 had NO, so is the F30 a horrible car no. It does what I want it to do, the standard suspension is much firmer then say the Nissan Altima, Camry, Accord and a dozen of other cars and it still drives like a German car. The road feel isn't an issue for me, and why, simple, I don't drive like an A55 all over town, when driven normal I don't have a problem with it. I wanted a M235, until I drove one for 3 days and saw that it is just too small for me, I have grown to like the bigger size of the F30. Your post calling people who like the newer BMW as a bunch of poseurs is way off base, and really not needed, remember we are all entitled to our own opinion but when you lower yourself in name calling, then the fun of this forum goes out the door,"
December 2014,"The 328i was the car she wanted so that was her call. It's certainly no adrenaline rush either- but at least it is possible to determine that the steering wheel is connected to the front wheels. BMW has decided to build the overwhelming majority of its cars to please people who wear their cars rather than drive them- and I'm afraid Munich will find that the people who can't tell which end of the car is driven, or ""need"" AWD, or think that a V6 is under the hood will prove to be a very fickle bunch of poseurs."
December 2014,"Road- i guess this is all subjective because I would not give a 328 a second look, not even for my wife. Just personal taste I guess."
December 2014,"The maintenance plan has changed, with the current plan you only get ONE free service a year, or unless the on board computer says differently. BMW uses synthetic oil and allows BMW to get away with the longer service intervals. The real start of the maintenance plan is the 4yr-50K bumper to bumper warranty., So if you drive aggressively you can go through a set of brakes in the 50K and save yourself about $1200... When I driving between Phoenix and San Diego the beginning of the year (weekly) I racked up a lot of miles, but the service indicator in the car kept the same date for when the car will need service, but in June I brought the car into the dealer to get the oil changed since I had 13K miles on the car, cost, $110... An expensive lesson... But back in Oct I took the 320 in for it's first free service, they did everything and changed the oil, for free... My service indicator says my next service is due in 1400 miles on 4-15-2015, I currently have 21500 miles on it. So not too sure what to make of the service indicator.. The maintenance plan is nice, but I think BMW needs to shorten the intervals in which they give the free service. BTW GC, which version of the CTS did you get? Luxury, Performance or Premium?"
December 2014,"I'm sure it's a 39 month lease too, since Oct, BMWFS has been pushing the 39 months lease.. But someone on Bimmerfest leased a 320ix with Premium Package, Lighting package and Nav, his payments were right about what you quoted of $336/m, and all he put down was about $1100. Deals are out there... In regards to lease specials BMWFS has sportline as the model in the special lease, a first time for that."
December 2014,"My sister looked at the 3 series (320ix and 328ix) before settling on her Mercedes. For the money, the 320ix with just a few options is mighty tempting.....especially with the 4 years maintenance included."
December 2014,"Regarding the cheap 320xi lease here in Colorado.Assuming that the $2500 is all cap cost reduction, that would add about $64/mo to the payment - total $336/mo before tax ($363 with tax for me @ 7.9%). Still not bad for a car that retails at $40K.And yes, it is only a 10K per year lease, which wouldn't work for me at all, unless it was a second car for fun and weekend duty only."

I still have to add the port installed locking differential- $3,240 last time I checked.That is beyond ludicrous, considering LSD was standard on my MS3 and costs less than $500 on a Miata or a Challenger R/T. So I'm over $48,500 for a car that is not significantly quicker around a road course than my mildly tweaked MS3(which, with an approximately 13.5 second quarter mile time can hardly be called fast). A Cayman S or Boss 302 looks better all the time..."
December 2014,"Yes, really. When I first drove an F10 535i the only thought that came to mind was ""Old man's car."" My wife later got stuck with an F10 loaner; she drove it home, got out and announced ""It's nothing but a big soft boat. I HATE it!"" The sled sat unused until her car(an E90 328i) was ready to pick up. And most every magazine review agrees with me; numb steering and ponderous handling are noted in virtually every road test. I find absolutely nothing compelling about the car in any way. You'd have to pay me to drive one."

Nothing but high praise. Handling is not in the Audi or BMW category but that's not why I bought this vehicle. The Genesis is very big inside , ultra quiet on the road , One of the best sounding radio systems ( lexicon ) 17 speakers in any car I heard. Plenty of giddy up when you want to live life fast @429 h/p A good bang for your buck. CR reports / C&D and most reviewers have put the new 2015 model at the top of the pack . A real good buy for your money if you could get past the brand.  I test drove the 2015 Genesis v-6.. This luxury sedan @48k is a great choice that offers amenities that European vehicles are selling 15, to 20k more. The Upgraded suspension modes , Handling, Refinement is well noted on this 2015 model . Add Hyundai's 5/60....100k powertrain warranty makes this vehicle quite appealing .Lets see if Resale value on this model can stand up."

December 2014,"Is the Genesis 5.0 worthy of ELLP, or at least ELL sedan?

 The new Genesis is a more substantial car, and the weight has a predictable effect at the track. Acceleration from 0 to 60 mph comes in 5.2 seconds, up from that last-gen Genesis' 4.8-second time. That makes the 2015 Genesis V-8 a midpack performer, depending on what you think its competitors are. Smaller, pricier V-8-powered competitors such as the Mercedes-Benz E550 and Infiniti Q70 5.6 will smoke the Genesis V-8. Among price-competitive offerings, an all-wheel-drive 2012 Audi A6 with a supercharged V-6 engine sprinted from 0-60 mph in 4.7 seconds, while a 2012 BMW 535i checked in at 5.5 seconds, an all-wheel-drive 2014 Mercedes-Benz E350 at 5.8 seconds, and a 2013 Lexus GS 350 F Sport with a six-speed automatic at 5.4 seconds. Passing power from 45-65 mph is ample in the Genesis V-8, with a 2.6-second time not appreciably different from that of the last-gen Genesis V-8 (2.4 seconds), A6 3.0T (2.5 seconds), and 2013 GS 350 F Sport (2.6 seconds), but quicker than the 535i's 2.9 seconds and the 2014 CTS 3.6's 3.1 seconds."

If you can get a Cpo that fits your criteria why would you not want to save first year depresh- even if it's not cpo you can still get a better (than cpo) deal with the balance of a luxury car makers warrantee and get a better car then you would if new. Love cars - like deals- why not get both.

December 2014,"Mark...as always, I like reading your posts. And, can't disagree. I also just realized that LG has a TOTALLY different connotation than the old GoldStar brand, even though they're the same company.Best to you and yours!"
December 2014,"Well, here are some thoughts on Infiniti -- from a former owner of an Infiniti product and also, at the same time, an Acura product.The auto manufacturers in the past decades have wanted to ""rationalize"" their product names. They have wanted to do so for essentially a singular purpose: marketing (leading to increased market share, mind share, sales, etc.)Infiniti decided that Q was the answer as a prefix and that the following numbers/letter combination would signify the size or perhaps even class of the vehicle. I would assume if money were no object they would have liked to have rolled out a completely new -- across the board -- product family. They had to settle for one new car, the Q50. The M37 became the Q70 as you identified.It is true that most of us here on Edmunds know the Q70 is the former M37. I would posit that most people, however, won't have a clue that the Q70 is a renamed product.The M37 and the Q70 are still very competent LPS offerings, even though the Q70 does need to be updated, refreshed or replaced with a newer version. To me, Infinitis have often been [note the tense] the most German-like of the Japanese (and Korean) offerings. The recent ""transfer"" of their President, Johan De Nysschen, (then late of Audi) to go to Cadillac probably is a negative for Infiniti -- but, well, there you have it -- since I would have assumed Johan would have made good use of his 19-year Audi stint to imbue Infiniti with even more German-ness.Right now, it seems to me that Infiniti and Acura, both, appear to be somewhat rudderless if their recent products are any indication of what is going on ""at the top."" The TLX could've have been the vehicle for Acura to announce ""we're not Honda anymore,"" but I think they missed the target completely if you axed me. Meantime, Lexus has inched its way even further from Toyota and the Koreans are the ones the Germans are probably seeing in their rear-view mirrors more so than anything out of Japan (with the possible exception of the IS350F-sport).Again, if you axed me, the saving grace for the Germans is the brand name ""KIA"" -- at least if you live here in River City where removing all the KIA badges seems the norm. If KIA somehow figures out a new name (think GoldStar becoming LG) for their brand, I would think the Germans might have more to worry about.Today, the Germans seem to be the aspirational cars -- but, as the poet Frost once said, ""nothing gold can stay."" I did enjoy my time with my 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance, but -- money not a factor -- my 2014 S4 is an entirely different experience (despite my belief that the TL was about as close to an S4 as one could get for about $47K.) Merry Christmas all."
December 2014,I feel the same. I almost think of them as the Lincoln of Asian cars.
December 2014,"I've tried to like Infinitis for a long time. Every time I look at them and test drive them, I'm disappointed.Assuming the Q70 used to be the former M chassis. What's the point of going from one letter to another?I know they did make a drastic price cut of the former G series, and that may be saving their bacon. But, even there, it's long in the tooth and certainly not very fuel efficient, by any stretch.I just don't know where they are competing."

December 2014,"I think you're probably right...either new or used I don't like paying for 5 years. I should make whatever is purchased (new or used) fit in 3 years of payments. When I get around year 4 I always have the inner dialog ""I'm STILL paying for this...""."
December 2014,"I received a e-mail from my BMW dealer that said, that all CPO 2011-12 models are on sale, with .9% for up to 3 years and up to $750/m for two months free payments..

December 2014,Got it.
December 2014,"How many miles are on your 2011 535xi? What's the original in service date? $20.5K for the TL is a testament of Acura's excellent resale value, you car's low mileage, and I'm sure it was in exceptional condition.Funny, you got that itch. Same thing happened when I leased my 328xi. There was nothing wrong with my TSX. The problem I had with it was after I test drover the 328xi and got back into it. Now my DD is a 175 horsepower Subaru"
December 2014,yup- twin scroll.
December 2014,"Twin scroll turbo is what billy meant, maybe?"
December 2014,Now I'm confused; I thought you bought an F10 535i.
December 2014,"I took a three year loan paying .90 bps (pretty cheap loan), they gave me 20.5K for the TL - I think I did okay."
December 2014,"To be blunt, you simply bought a car you couldn't afford and the five-year loan simply masked that fact. Having to take a 5-year loan on nearly 3-year old car is basically an equivalent of taking a 7-year or longer loan on a new car and nobody with their right senses would do that. It's a false choice between a new non-luxury or used luxury brand for those who have to borrow money for long term to buy it. That choice only works financially when one can pay cash or takes a two or three year loan."
December 2014,"""makes sense, and I have done the same thing. How old it is when you get it shouldn't change your tolerance for how long to keep a car.""I go with the itch- had the TL for almost six years (LOVE the car) but I had the itch for the twin turbo."
December 2014,"makes sense, and I have done the same thing. How old it is when you get it shouldn't change your tolerance for how long to keep a car."
December 2014,"That's what we do; we've had our newest car(the CPO E90) for 2.5 years and will probably keep it an additional 3-5 years. Our next newest car(the 2007 MS3, bought new) has been in the garage 7.5 years."
December 2014,"I agree with Sween. And NYC. NYC in that I don't want to pay on a car more than 4-5 YO. And sween that if you are, you spent too much on the CPO.I look at a CPO this way. If I am willing to go 5 years payments on a new car, I will go 3 on a 2 YO CPO. Payments end at the same age. So the only way it makes sense is if the price is lower enough to make it worthwhile, since I am giving up two years use on the car (and the best 2!)Plus you have to keep a car older than 5 years, otherwise you are always making payments. Though overall the payments should be lower (since the car is cheaper) but that can actually cancel out if you trade every 3 years."
December 2014,The payments someone would make on a cpo would be a lot less then a new car. Yes the car would be older but the payments would significantly less and the ability to buy a better car (all in) with less cash. The financing rates of used are as good as new - so that's not the issue- if you are paying for a cpo 5 years after delivery you should not be buying a Cpo- you should not be buying a new car- you should lease or maybe downgrade expectations on what you can afford.
December 2014,You and I are in the same boat. I don't want to be making payments on a car that's more than 5 years old plus pay for maintenance & out of warranty repairs.
December 2014,Same for the IS350 - residuals are nuts!
December 2014,"I think some are missing my point, I'm sure Mark leases his car's for tax breaks, so buying a CPO wouldn't work for him. Buying a CPO can be a smart choice for some, just like buying new is a smart choice for others. Rick at one time was looking at a Lexus LS460 but the original sticker was over the top, even though the car residual for very high, the payments were higher then what he was willing to pay, so he was looking at a CPO LS 460. But he came to his senses and moved on... BTW, leases residuals for Lexus's are out of this world, RX is 67%, LS 66%.."
December 2014,"No lower class for me- always looking to upgrade.I am not advocating for CPO-just for me, its the prudent thing to do.The 535 I have now was listed for 65K in 2011- no way I am going to lay that kind of money out."
December 2014,"I don't think I'd do a CPO again.I had an 06 IS350. When I purchased it it was 2 years old...but quickly turned 3 a few months later. Even though I had the CPO warranty I had a few items that fell outside of that coverage (which was annoying).The biggest problem I had was after year 3 of the payments I was (still) making payments for a 5-6 year old car. So when you're nearing 5 years of payments you're paying for an 8-9 year old car. I knew all this going in...but didn't think I'd have an issue making payments on an ""old"" car. It held up fairly well, but there were still wear and tear issues that revealed themselves when it was 6 years old (tiny chunks of the dash crumbling off, suspension creaks, few rattles, etc.). To make matters worse, you're paying a premium for the CPO; mine was at least $2k over a comparable model (and mileage). So if you're attempting to sell early you're at a disadvantage.Plus...when I traded it in (at another dealer) it was revealed that at some point before I purchased it there was a claim for hail damage; so this reduced it's trade in value. My fault here...I assumed CPO vehicles never had been in accidents/claims, etc; doesn't cost much to do a quick search...For me, I think I would have been better off just purchasing a used vehicle...or a new vehicle in a ""lower"" class since I like ""new""."
December 2014,There are so many complex systems in today's Luxury and near-lux cars that it might be worthwhile to offer how-to seminars. A buddy of mine bought a new E350 and clearly hadn't had the time to learn most of the systems. I told him if he'd lend me the car for a couple of days I'd learn the features and give him a quickie lesson. He didn't go for it.
December 2014,"My wife's last two cars(her current E90 and the E83 passed down to RB Jr.) were CPOs, but I doubt that either of us will be buying another BMW; while their reliability has been excellent, driving excitement has gone MIA in the Fxx cars/trucks..."
December 2014,I would go CPO again and I probably will in a few years- the 650 XI would be coming off leases then.
December 2014,"There's no right or wrong answer to the question either. I've only owned or leased new cars since I got my license (except for a used 1990 BMW 325i Coupe I bought for $950). I am open to CPO cars especially in this segment for a future purchase. Our Pilot is about a year & a half away from being paid off. I know my wife drives it because we have 3 kids and need a big, family, truckster. We could keep the Pilot around for kid hauling, car pooling, & vacation duty and pick up a CPO ELLPS for her to drive. I'd look at an IS350, previous body style C300 4Matic, heavily depreciated CTS or ATS..."
December 2014,"I drive 8k a year and could of bought a new s4- but went slightly used, saved 10k or more, have full warranty, and know if I want to sell it I won't take a bath, paid cash plus trade- would do it again. First year depreshiayion is a [non-permissible content removed].""Female dog""http://www.edmunds.com/audi/s4/2013/tco.html"
December 2014,True but he can deduct the Metro North pass from his taxes. You can't do do with a car payment in most cases.
December 2014,That Metro North ticket is like a car payment itself!
December 2014,NY- I drive only 5-6K per year- I commute into NY via Metro North.- Taking out the 5 tonight- YIIIKES!!!!
December 2014,"I can see going CPO if you've got cash in hand, or put a large chunk down and get some cheapo financing for maybe 2 years if you don't drive all that much.Whatever I buy, I have to make payments on with as little out of pocket as possible. So (and this only pertains to me) even if that CPO car is a smoking deal compared to an identical brand new one, I'm still going to have to make loan payments, pay for maintenance, and pay for out of warranty repairs. I drive 20,000 plus miles per year. Yes depreciation is the most expensive cost of ownership, but right now I'm not equipped financially to make payments plus, plus.I'm glad you are enjoying your 5er."
December 2014,"Bill, for people who lease, a CPO will not work, those who do not lease, a CPO is a great way to get into a luxury car without selling off their oldest child."
December 2014,Flight- I was in that bucket (new only) until I bought this CPO 535- only 28k miles.So far no regrets.
December 2014,"A CPO is not a new car, pretty simple.. As I posted some people only want a new car, while others don't care."
December 2014,"@flightnurse‌ ""You can't compare a new car and a CPO, some people will only buy new, while others will only buy CPO"" Why can't you compare?"
December 2014,"I don't think any one will say the ATS isn't a good car, but for it to compete against cars that are bigger i.e 3 series and A4 and now the new C class GM needed to think ahead, that they didn't..I'm glad that the Mag didn't get a AWD car, again shows that AWD isn't needed these days if one has good snow tires.."
December 2014,"You can't compare a new car and a CPO, some people will only buy new, while others will only buy CPO."
December 2014,"Also, was reading one of my car magazines, and they had a long term wrap up on their ATS with the 2.0 motor. overall really liked it. small back seat, but you have to know that going in! a few nits I believe (cue?), but dynamically sounded really nice (power/handling/MPG). quite the depreciation though. IIRC, 47K sticker (def. over 40) and 3 year residual in the 18s. Ouch. also, for all the traction worriers, they had the RWD version. In Michigan. And said it had no problem at all in snow and ice. Yes, it had winter tires, proving again it really is about the treads not how many wheels are driven!"
December 2014,"was at the mall today (what kind of idiot goes to the cherry hill mall at 4:30 on a Saturday just before Christmas? Oh yeah, me. And a ton of other fools!). They had a couple of cars parked in there. One was a Q50 (white). Not bad looking. The other was a black Acura TLX. a V6 FWD tech. MSRP $40,150. Sharp looking car with the espresso leather. Still seems kind of pricey to me, but pretty well loaded. Though if I was spending that much and getting the HP, would probably want the AWD to better manage it.but for that money, you can get a lot of nice iron. Especially if you don't mind slightly used CPO."
December 2014,"Well, I just leased a 2014 ATS 2.0T AWD and am really impressed. It is an incredible car to drive and I love the looks. Got a great year-end deal. Happy."
December 2014,"Happy holidays- good to see the world of Ellps continues to drive on. The mentions of the IS250 and caddy cts - cads not talked of . I think the Lexi is an interesting looking car but as mentioned the drivetrain and cost for me it's a non-starter. The cts was car of the year - but poor gm they can't get out of own way when it comes to bad headlines. Caddy has a good car here but I would never own one (maybe lease) do to poorer resale values, some of which is due to continued recalls. This article from a website flight knows well says it all. Nice car - bad parent/strategy . -http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/12/07/why-general-motors-stuck-with-high-cadillac-prices.aspx"
December 2014,"Man-I am loving this 5 series-this is really a nice car- I hope I don't sound too carried away.The Dark Graphite color really does justice to the Zaino Products, even the pipes are Zainoed.Whooopeee!!!!"
December 2014,I agree completely and the better the competition the better the cars...
December 2014,"FN...no issues. Lots pf vehicles competing in this space (E series, 5 Series, A6, ets). Someone will find what they're looking for."
December 2014,Nothing beat the 1970's Chrysler Cordoba with the fine Corinthian leather. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIL3fbGbU2oCheck out the 1970 Dodge Challenger commercial its a classic.
December 2014,"While at the MB dealer we test drove a ML250 that had the fake stuff, at first I didn't know it was fake, it felt like leather, and the contrasting stitching really elevated the whole look. CG, I'm still not sold on the new CTS, having driving one a couple of months back over 600 miles I just couldn't get comfortable in it. I'm just surprised how you made a 180 turn around and even went and drove one."
December 2014,"I'm with Graphic on leather. I drove several loaners with the ""ette"" and they did not feel that great. Rough touch, dull color and of course smell. All the ""tex"", ""ette"" stuff is to me selling a simple fake for a price of real stuff (50 grand or more) and great legend so they can cash the profit - and charging extra if you insist on real stuff. Well, they obviously can get away with that. Especially Benz. I see BMWs have much higher percentage of real leather, but new 320 may buck the trend.If not leather, I would rather choose premium microfiber seats (if they made), just like for a couch, as those at least would be better in hot-and-cold sweat absorption, be nicer in touch and even stronger than leather. And it doesn't pretend to be something else."
December 2014,"FN....it's a long story. Reader's Digest version, I got a deal I couldn't pass up. Had a couple of hiccups, but they seem to be sorting themselves out. Cadillac is really stepping it up. CTS has turned into something I never would have expected. They're shooting at E class, 5 Series, and A6, and bulls eyeing the targets, in some ways, exceeding what the others are doing.Test drove the ATS a couple of times. That car's a blast, too. You'd like it.Leather....I've heard the argument that Mercedes ""pleather"" is better than leather. That mostly came from their dealers. However their fake stuff may or may not wear well, I'm sure it's cheaper for them than putting leather in their cars.Even old leather looks great. Not sure that old vinyl will look all that good down the road. I know old vinyl never smells good. To me, it's a cost cutting move by Mercedes. I can't imagine paying $50K? $60K? Maybe more, and not getting leather as part of the package.If I were going to see any potential problem with the new TLX, it would have been with their transmissions. Acura/Honda has had a bit of a history with dicey transmissions. I really like the TLX. I hope they get that shift button thing sorted out in short fashion, and it will only take once. They are kind of on a sales roll with their vehicles right now. It would be a shame that this would bring them to a halt. If they've stopped selling the TLX, it looks like that's exactly what happened, though. I can't imagine how long it will take for then to identify the cause, come up with a fix, and get all those cars in the shops to make the fix. Hope it works out well for them.Thanks for the professional opinion RB. I'm waiting to hear that defense in a DUI case sooner rather than later."
December 2014,"Heh... I went down that road in 2007. I had all these crates full of vinyl records I had bought from the mid-70s until I finally bought a CD player in the early '90s that were just gathering dust. My old turntable had issues and wasn't easily repairable. And my receiver had a bad channel. So I went the retro route, first locally-sourcing stuff, later going the ebay route. I ended up with several turntables, several old 1970s Pioneer receivers, a few cassette decks, new old speakers, totally retro. That lasted not quite a year before I lost interest. Yes, it sounds good, but I seem to have lost that desire for the one true sound that I once had. Now it is all gathering dust again."
December 2014,"And speaking of vinyl, while I do not belong to the ""LPs are superior, CDs are garbage"" cult, I dug out the AR-XA turntable I bought from my uncle(for $75!) and set it up in the basement HTS. Now to buy a Shure M97xE cartridge and a few accessories..."
December 2014,"I have leatherette in my 2005 Passat. It has worn like iron and does not show any signs of wear or cracking. Given a choice, I would take leatherette over leather every time."
December 2014,So it seems that Acura is having issues with the TLX...
December 2014,"WOW, I thought you weren't going to ever step into a Caddy dealer? What made you change your mind?"
December 2014,"That's also been my experience with BMW's ""Leatherette."" The only reason I would choose leather is because I wanted a color that was only available in cowhide. My BMW salesperson told me that people will bring in a BMW(that they bought used) and will not believe the car has vinyl seats until he runs the VIN and pulls the car's build sheet."
December 2014,"I'm not against quality in-car audio systems or decent navigation systems. My issue is that today's buyers are usually distracted by the ""shiny things"" that are tangential at best to the overall driving experience.As for crossing the center line and the lane keep feature? It would depend on the individual case, and the competence of the judge and counsel. Me, I'd probably let the defendant argue that- assuming he could prove his car had that feature.As an aside, the judiciary has one of the highest automotive illiteracy rates of virtually any profession. A couple of judges in my district would take voluminous notes if they were hearing a case involving vehicle repairs, etc., take the case under submission, and give the notes to me so that I could sift the wheat from the chaff..."
December 2014,"The MB-Tex will eventually crack -- not the kind of cracks you can see in old leather, however.The PLEATHER seats unlike real leather doesn't or can't breathe. Of course with modern seat ventilation technology, that may be less of an issue.I'm still of the ""leather is better"" opinion -- but I remember ONE TIME ordering a new Audi 5000CS turbo quattro with wool seats (leather was standard and wool was a special order at no cost option). These seats, in many ways, were the most comfortable ever. Not cold in winter, not hot in summer (mine were heated, too).The issue, with gray seats, was dirt. Well, OK, not ""dirt dirt"" but coffee, mustard, coke and other drinks, ice cream droppings and, I would imagine all sorts of other messes should one have kids in the car. A good old french fry stain would be a heart breaker.Now, I did put sheepskin seat covers on the front buckets -- and that helped. But as good as the wool seats were, I was one and done.I have no doubt MB-Tex is good fake leather, or faux leather -- but give me the real thing."
December 2014,In my experience the MB-Tex is so good that the only major difference to me is that the leather is more aromatic. Tex may be actually more durable but I have no anecdotal or other proof of this.
December 2014,"I was recently browsing local inventory of BMW and Benz dealers. One thing jumped on me - new C-class is in stock in good number - NOT A SINGLE unit with leather seat in multiple dealerships. Even upscale C400. All have MB-Tex. BMW on the other hand - majority of 328 and up has premium package, which is leather. I really don't get it, especially that C-class is supposed to go ""upmarket"" as CLA filled the entry point. There are units there well in $50K+ and still no leather. I don't know - is that plastic MB-Tex so good? I just find it hard to believe... Not to mention that not a single one?"
December 2014,"Mark....interesting take, as always.I think some of the safety nannies fall in the category, ""we had the sensors on the compute power. So, it was easy to do""....by the manufacturers.I do like lane departure warning. Not so much the ""Lane Keep"" features. I have front end collision mitigation which I'll assume works, as I don't want to test it out.GPS in cars is to the point where the ones I've used are extremely accurate. I expect that's a feature that will come with just about all cars in the not so distant future, given most have a ""cutout"" that was engineered in the dash for some sort of screen.At some point I'm waiting to hear of the drunk guy who was pulled over for crossing a yellow line and got a DUI. His defense will be ""no way...I had lane keep feature on my car. There's no way that's possible."" Maybe RB can comment on the legalities of such a scenario.It amazes me how far suspension technology has come. I now own a CTS with Magnetic Ride Control. It's pretty darn amazing. Aside from the car having nearly ideal weight distribution and weight reduction, the MRC keeps the wheels planted while the body stays tight, and the ride is superb.....kind of what you were talking about with an A8.About DVD-As....I have a bunch of them. They are amazing sounding. Used to love listening to them in the car. No longer. I don't know of any cars that can play them in all their surround sound glory anymore.So, I play them at home (where they sound even better). But, no one in my family just sits to listen to music any more. It's always a ""background"" activity."
December 2014,"Roadburner -- you crack me up! Of course the Cheap Trick quip suggests you've been around the sun quite a few times (as have I).Two of my friends (one is an aunt) acquired new ELLPS (1 Lexus and 1 Infiniti) cars. One of these folks (who will remain otherwise unidentified) was going from one city to another about 30 miles apart. The call to me proclaimed ""the GPS lady gives incorrect instructions"" -- and my friend ended up in a city some 60 miles in the wrong direction. Now, I have had numerous GPS systems, my first in 2001. I have had the experience where the GPS lady did indeed provide incorrect directions (but I still arrived at my destination, just with a long detour). The last time I had a car provide wrong directions was in 2004.The ""science"" of GPS technology and the map makers themselves have improved greatly is the point. Or perhaps the point is the GPS lady was not wrong -- and if you would have followed her directions you would not be 60 miles out of the way.I said nothing to my friend.I am thinking I will suggest a return visit to the dealership for a ""training class"" on the marvelous tech these Japanese cars afford. Of course, my other friend was unaware of the car's sat radio tuner and when I turned the radio to the sat band and found Classic Vinyl, my friend was amazed -- no commercials and tons of music.Analogy: Maybe we've reached the point where CD's and iPods or iPhones (for music) are good enough and DVD-Audio despite its amazing quality, is just not worth it to most folks.I remember, too, Sprint spent a ton of money on the sound quality of their network only to find people would rather have fewer dropouts than hi-fi sound from their cell phone network.These cars have lots of tech, to be sure -- but other than the folks reading and writing here on Edmunds, I wonder who is actually using automatic cruise control, lane keeping, in-car Internet and even google earth (which is, at least, pretty cool to play with even if it is not really all that practical).Have we reached some kind of saturation? Or are we all collectively waiting for ""Jarvis"" (in the Iron Man suit) to mature to the point where we don't have to learn anything to program our GPS other than to say ""I wanna go to Austin and avoid the Interstates.""I'm back to wanting the performance of an S4 with the ride of an A8 -- that plus an upgraded sound system and I'd be fine. The current gen of GPS and the other tech is probably acceptable to folks like you and me, since we actually (apparently) take the time to learn to program it.I'm clearly not waiting on Jarvis, but he can't get here soon enough."
December 2014,"The emphasis has shifted from driving dynamics to technology- either entertainment or electronic nannies. I guess that's understandable; 99% of buyers in this segment believe that ""trailing throttle oversteer"" is a band that used to open for Cheap Trick and think ""contact patches"" are used to help you quit smoking..."
December 2014,"A car we often don't speak of in here is the Lexus IS. We all know the volume selling IS 250 AWD's acceleration numbers are lackluster and the IS 350's high 5s 0-60 times won't win you too many bragging rights on the Internet. The IS 350 F-Sport version has some positives going for it. Power train - the 3.5L V6 has remained essentially unchanged since 2006 as has the 6-Speed Automatic still found in the AWD version. The RWD has an 8-Speed automatic (maybe it can't handle the AWD?). It is old school for sure, especially compared to the other 4cyl turbos in the class, but tried & true none the less. Body - yes you can call the IS polarizing. It's grille even looks like The Predator. It's looks are very modern. The car does stand out in a crowd of ubiquitous 320s, 328s, C300s, & Audi A4s. I like the charcoal, split 5 Spoke wheels.Adaptive Suspension - many of today's ELLPS are too soft in their base form and too harsh with their sport suspensions. The IS350 F Sport has an adaptive suspension that constantly monitors and adjusts each shock absorber.Now back in 2006, I attended a Lexus test drive event and was able to drive an IS350 back to back with an E90 330i. Now the IS was MUCh faster (butt Dyno), but BMW took care of that in 2007 with the twin turbo 335i. I thought the BMW was a better driving car (brakes, steering, suspension). Things are different today. The BMW still puts up good numbers (328i & 335i), but they have also gotten softer and are much less engaging to drive. Maybe the playing field has evened out."
December 2014,"Mark....I think overall, the quality and competence of today's cars are so far removed (better) from where they were even 5 short years ago is a pretty big gulf.I look at my former TL SH AWD and remember what the first one I drove of the current gen was like. Not sure what Acura did, but it was clear they had tweaked the suspension, updated to electronics, and numerous and sundry other things in the ensuing years up until the TLX came out. Most of what they did, you couldn't see. You could sure feel it in the way the car handled, the way it rode, the way it steered, the way the electronics responded, etc.I have a CTS now. It iOS light years ahead of anything I've looked at recently....from the way it drives, the way it handles, the way it rides, the quality of materials, the careful assembly, the paint with lustrous, no orange peel effect, etc.Over in the sales/purchase threads, there are lots of discussions about how much Mercedes has changed over the last 5 years. I know for a fact that the E92 BMW I had has been changed immeasurably (some say improved, some say not) vs the F3x versions.Given your experience with the S4 vs my experience with the S4, it sounds like Audi quietly addressed their (what I considered major) issues.The march of technology and performance in cars over the last few years is nothing short of breathtaking."
December 2014,"Mark, we are looking at a SUV for Rick, and at the Phoenix Auto Show 2 weeks ago, it was nice to have all the SUV's in one room so to speak to take a look at them all. So far the BMW X3 and Audi Q5 are the two top contenders. At the Auto Show we looked at the MB GLA, GLK, and ML. The GL is just too big (this is Ricks words, not mine.) the GLA I was impressed with, but too small, the GLK was too small, the ML I found to be just right. What I found interesting with the ML was, the faux leather in it looked and felt real, and the contrasting stitching made the interior look more upper class. We test drove a ML250 with the new 2.1l diesel engine, I was not impressed at all with the engine, lots of turbo lag and the engine did not feel refined like the Audi or BMW. But the size was just right, slightly bigger then the Audi and BMW, but smaller then the X5 and Q7.At the Auto show we looked at the Infiniti QX60 and was surprised on how there isn't much of a difference between the dash of the QX60 and Pathfinder, lots of Nissan switch gear in it, for almost 20K price difference between the two Nissan needs to not use parts bin parts (nissan) in the infiniti."
December 2014,"You may know that my wife and I, after decades of German only, went with an Infiniti and an Acura (2011 and 2012 respectively). She kept her 39 month lease vehicle 35 months and I kept my 36 month lease TL SH- AWD Advance 25 months.These cars, hers an FX and mine a TL were stickered at a combined $97K. The leases had to have been subvented by the mfgrs and the cars were reliable (and I assume durable) and well made with several obvious (and successful) attempts to move them upscale from their Nissan and Honda lineage. Perhaps for the right money -- and it would have to be seriously inexpensive -- a new TL, Q or IS (I actually ordered the Lexus IS-350AWD F-Sport) might have made it into our garage.Since we test drive cars almost as a hobby, we were really -- this time -- able to see how far the Germans had come since our last German cars, hers a 2008 BMW, mine a 2009 Audi. The differences, now, at this point of inflection are, once again in favor of the Germans.My wife puts it this way, ""The Japanese cars are 'competent' appliances -- but they ain't got no soul."" This from a person with one undergrad and two graduate level degrees (one of them a JD) who hates it when improper grammar is used.The hell of it is, her description is perfect -- in tone, tenor and accuracy. The Germans, today at least, have indeed again found that certain something that can best be described as soul. And, the money (when leased) is no longer an excuse to 'settle' for the more or less soul-less vehicles currently marketed by the big-3 Japanese ELLPS and LPS providers.Frankly, even the new Volvo products bear a good long look. Our guess is the Japanese premium cars may offer higher durability scores, but even that seems not to be the case as my wife's SQ5 Prestige now is approaching 30K miles and still feels new. We'll see if this new car smell (so to speak) remains at 50K, but things look good."

December 2014,The 6.4(392) SRT Challenger has some significant upgrades to the suspension- not to mention a more usable power curve. It is a bit overweight- but so is the F10 5er- and when I drive the SRT I don't feel like I'm piloting a Bavarian Town Car.I need to do a bit more research on the NISMO; Car and Driver wrecked one at their Lightning Lap a few years ago- the brakes went MIA. Apparently the brakes get so hot that it will even boil fresh ATE DOT4 fluid. Can't have that...

December 2014,"Both would be good choices. C&D just had a nice write up about the Challenger....saying it could run with anything. But, it belies its size and weight in doing so.Aways liked the Z cars. I had one a long time ago. Have toyed with getting another ever since. Last time I came close I ended up with an RX8 because the Nissan dealers were all acting like asses.Trade rags have liked the S3, except they all say it would be hard to make it a daily driver because of how harsh the suspension is, and how uncomfortable the seats are.Billy...nice pick up with the 535. I went a step up from ELLPS and ended up with a CTS, like you with you with your 5. These cars are bringing ""game"" to that A6, E Class segment."

December 2014,"Long (food-centric) holiday weekends are for cooking, dining out (and over eating), going to places in your city you haven’t been to for years, movies, more movies . . . and test driving new cars (regardless of the possibility you would ever buy one).The following list of – hopefully descriptive – terms, apply to the latter activity, or better said apply as descriptive terms of the test-driven car, this past Friday (the day after the food coma).Clarification of the terms, that is how they may be applied, is noted (in parentheses): -Aroused (you don’t start this car, you press the button on the console and it is “aroused”)-Audacious-Bland-looking (dashboard)-Brutish-Close (front seat)-Cramped (back seat)-Crude-ish-Dart-y-Expensive (unfortunately, equipped as it apparently needs to be equipped, it is easily 10-15% too much money for a car that has luxury intentions but doesn’t deliver much luxury despite its long list of features)-Fast (as in, “How fast would you like to go sir, I can manage 150 if that would be sufficient.”)-Firm (harsh-es kinder gentler side; this car is capable of firm only on the smoothest of road surfaces and/or above 85MPH) -Fun (to drive for relatively short distances)-Harsh (on secondary roads you are punished over every patched pot-hole you drive over, pounded by every expansion joint you meet and slammed when you drive over the various undulations presented by our aging highway infrastructure)-Jittery (think hum while strumming your lips)-Loud (road noise, wind noise is minimal)-Minimalist (the large expanse of black plastic on the section of the dash in front of the passenger isn’t exactly cheap looking, no, it’s not that, it just looks boring, unimaginative, perhaps like there is some carbon fiber or brushed aluminum trim piece that was accidentally omitted)-Nervous (the car, not me)-Nimble (turns like a go-kart)-Noisy (not much isolation from the engine or the road – makes conversation at speed require LOUD TONES even for the two front-seat passengers; I could imagine it would require yelling for back-seat passengers to hear or to be heard)-Powerful (not quite OMG, but very much like a two-year old V8 Mustang, in fine tune)-Precise (I imagine it feels like a Swiss watch, if you could actually drive one, that is)-Punishing (see harsh above, but add to it a couple of kidney punches thrown in just so you don’t get the impression this car could be, in any way, considered supple)-Quality (the feel of the switchgear is like a German chef’s knife in your hand – makes other knives (and other cars) feel just a tad bit of a lesser tool)-Quick (dart-y could have sufficed, and “quick” is not the same as “fast” – this car is seriously quick at 0-62 in 4.7 seconds)-Raucous (the road and tire noise would argue against a cross-country trip in this car)-Raw (I guess I need to point out that it is also – in some ways – refined (see below), at least in terms of the power-train)-Refined (the fit and finish are great, the doors close with nary even a hint of a tinny sound, everything is solid)-Responsive-Rough (you probably could have deduced this by now, but I need you to know that this only applies to the ride – the engine is like buttah)-Sensitive (have you ever seen an old movie about a safe-cracker; you know the guy who sandpapers his fingertips before he begins turning the dial – his fingertips are sooo sensitive he can “feel” the tumblers falling into place; well, this car is sanded fingertips sensitive)-Slick (the transmission, although “only” a six-speed, this transmission mates nicely with the smooth, powerful engine)-Smooth (the engine)-Solid (like a brick, you know what)-Sonorous (the engine – ok, here’s a preliminary reveal – you would not be blamed if you thought this engine was a 6 or 8 cylinder with an old-fashioned air-sucking, honking wildly, air-intake; but you’d be wrong, this engine is the devil’s own 4-banger, avert your eyes, carry garlic cloves and cover yourself with wolfs bane just in case)-Stiff (harsh-es kinder, gentler, cousin)-Sublime (the seats are so good in this car they could almost make you forget its boy-racer characteristics)-Tense (this thing is really on-edge once it is put in gear)-Tight (jam up and jelly tight – I never knew what that meant in the song, but it seems to fit here)[I've been told Jam up and Jelly tight is a sexual reference, so I'll let it stand]-Tiring (again, lovely car to drive about 20 miles, maybe even 25 miles; just not the kind of thing you’d want to take long trip – even of a 100 miles – in repeatedly. . . you’d just be worn out from the, er, Sturm und Drang -Twitchy -Urgent-Unyielding -Violent-Visceral-Wearying (see tiring – in short this is a $50,000 go-kart; and, there is nothing wrong with that, but I think, given the car’s lack of Premium-ness, I’d go for the Subie WRX and pocket the difference).Much to like, a bit less not to like, but overall “at these prices” you do have the choice of giving yourself kidney punches and endure about the same cacophony (maybe less, even) in the Subaru WRX.The car in question? A 2015 Audi S3 with the Prestige and Sport packages, plus the upgraded seats, trim and premium paint.I so wanted to love this car – and I must compliment Audi on figuring out how to make a 4 cylinder growl and snarl -- and yes I know it is partially the work of the audio system, but who cares? (all the while being as smooth as silk) like a Mustang V8 (circa 2012) – but the thing, as fun as it is to drive for a relatively short distance, just doesn’t feel like it is a Premium Class car (beyond the interlocking 4 rings on the front and rear) – it feels like what I imagine Subaru is shooting for and largely doing (but for a lot less money) with their current WRX's. The Audi’s 19” wheels and tires may well be the culprit, but the almost total lack of sound deadening (well, OK, not really) just doesn’t do it for me (especially when the thing is north of $50K). Getting out of an S3 and then driving off in an S4 is like night and day. The S4 may be more isolated, better at mastering road imperfections and designed to press your kidneys rather than punch them, and that’s what makes even the “old” tech 2015 S4 still a bunch more car for just a little more money and the S4 actually feels and looks like the 4-rings suggest it ought to feel and look like.Oh, BTW, the S3 has fantastic LED headlights – and the thing is a looker. But $50,000+? Nah.Keep on driving it like YOU live. I couldn't live with this car -- dammit!"
November 2014,"When I was at the Audi dealership I was talking to a guy getting a oil change on his SQ5. Absolutely loves this vehicle. Claims the ride and handling is phenomenal. price tag was up there thou. Didn't actually see one there.  I find the S6 a little smaller inside for me. At 6'1 with 2 back surgery's under my belt and weighting closer to a quarter pounder with cheese area these days Car size, getting in and out is priority. In a perfect world I would love the S8 interior dimensions in the size of a S-6 but with a S6 price tag. That being said my dilemma which probably is not a bad one is replacing my 13, R-spec Genesis for a S6, or trading my 2012, BMW X-5 with 30k miles and buying the Q-7.  I originally went to dealership to test drive the Q7 and wound up driving a 2015, S-6. I Love this vehicle or lust for it............ maybe both.. This car is the total package. So I'm either going for 2 shots in the ribs for a Hyundai trade in or 1 hard slap in the face for the X-5. I'm hoping my golf buddy takes my X-5 off my hands. Then my decision will be a lot easier.  Such problems around the holidays for us car lovers. Probably why strokes are up holiday time."
November 2014,"Some quick (for me) follow ups:Equipped pretty much to the max, the SQ5 (Prestige) will be in the $60's. A ""nicely equipped,"" but hardly Porsche equipped pretty much to the max will be close to $10K more. My Audi dealer says the Porsche will be almost $15K more ""similarly"" loaded.I don;t know how accurate that latter claim is, but the Macan S can easily go well into the $70's and the Macan Turbo can pass $100K -- but it will be about a half second quicker than the S and the SQ5.The US SQ5 is also sold only with a set ground clearance, and the Macan is both lower and can be had with an adjustable suspension.Those who want more headroom, too, will consider the SQ5 since its proportions are more generous for rear seat passengers and their stuff. I thought the two cars were redundant, and I can still convince myself of that, but I can also see the Macan appealing to a different audience, but then, at the price, the Macan is now able to actually be more expensive than a Cayenne.I'd test them both unless you have a specific purpose that only one or the other fulfills.The SQ5 does have more HP and torque, and an 8 speed non-dsg transmission -- to the Macan's 7-spd PDK.Both are very fine examples of excess -- in a CUV suit. We have 25,000 miles on our SQ5 -- and would get another in a heartbeat and we have driven both cars; we like the higher ground clearance of the Audi and the nearly $10,000 lower price is a plus too.The S6, at its price, doesn't seem to have an analog from the other Germans. The BMW 535 doesn't even come close and the 550 isn't as sticky as the S6 (thanks to quattro).I can't really call the S6 a bargain, but it does offer the buyer more content for the MSRP than the BMW. I'd avoid the 20"" wheels, but that is a personal choice.I floored the S6 and counted to 3 -- when I looked down I had gone beyond 100MPH from about 60. Nothing I've driven (other than a Corvette) even comes a little bit close. The S6, to me, seems just a bit too big, just like my S4 seems a bit too small -- so I look forward to a larger S4, although the S6 is my ""lust for"" car.The least talked about ""car"" if you axe me, is the SQ5 -- it is a vehicle that deserves a bit more exposure. Too bad the Macan is likely to steal the show, being that it is, after all, a Porsche."
November 2014,@flightnurse‌ the s6 has a 8 not a 6- and it's twin turboed - FYI - 2015 they made it better- check it out below http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2016-audi-s6-first-drive-review
November 2014,"That's correct. SQ5 is supercharged, Macan is turbocharged."
November 2014,I thought the SQ had a supercharged V6 like the S4 and S6 have?
November 2014,"A base Macan is comparably equipped to an SQ5.. Similar 340 HP turbo-six engines.. But, good luck finding any Porsche without $15K of options.."
November 2014,"Spent some time driving my son's Macan recently, and was amazed with the handling and performance. His was about $65K. Has everything I would want. Very impressive. Only drawback was the 4 month wait time between ordering and delivery, which I understand is even longer now."
November 2014,A base Macan at that...
November 2014,So with people talking about the Audi S6 here is a Car and Driver quick drive of a Audi 2016 S6.
November 2014,"In the US, the Macan is about the same price as the SQ5.."
November 2014,"This is a Canadian comparison, but their Macan was cheaper than the (loaded) Q5:http://www.autos.ca/car-comparisons/comparison-test-2015-porsche-macan-s-2014-audi-sq5/?all=1"
November 2014,"Audi has a 1500 dollar loyalty bonus for owners of a Bmw , MB, Lexus which I qualify for. Looks like BMW has a 2k incentive also. This just might be a Dec. to........ Remember"
November 2014,"The least expensive Macan that Scottsdale Porsche has is $75K, that isn't a turbo model either.. So not too sure how competitive it really is with the Q5..."
November 2014,"There are ways, on the BMW forum I'm on they have Forum sponsors who always sell at invoice or below plus other incentives that BMW might have. I believe right now on 5 series there is a 2K rebate."
November 2014,Have you driven the Porsche Macan? I understand that it can be very competitive with the Q5.
November 2014,They didn't look like one either.
November 2014,"Both Q's 5 and 7 are nice.......... but pricey  The 535 was nice but not in the same league as the S6. . I drove a 14, 550i........... its a little bigger inside and has 20 more ponies than Audi's 420 h/p. Again I felt the S6 rode and handled better. Problem with BMW is here in the NY/ NJ area cant get to many dealerships to come down off MSRP right now where Audi will deal closer to Invoice price."
November 2014,"Test drive a BMW 550i, Since BMW really doesn't have a car to directly compete with the S6, some would say a 535 would be close, but I think a 550i is closer, but the BMW would be faster. For 75K you get a car faster with roughly the same equipment. In regards to the Q7, we are looking at the Q5, and have test driven a VW Touareg which is equal to the Q7 in size. We liked it, but VW has really dummy downed the Touareg as far as equipment goes. Nav is not in the same league, voice control the same issue, but the fit and finish was on par with Audi."
November 2014,The Intergra and RSX had no problems shaking the Civic stigma.
November 2014,"@markcincinnatiWent to the Audi dealer 3 weeks ago to test drive a Q7 and wound up driving the S6. WOWWhat's your thoughts on the 2015, S6. Test drove the car twice really impressed with it. Nothing comes close to the excitement with this bad boy. My only problem is interior room getting in and out and the 80k price. The S6 I drove on the lot had the 19' tires. Handling and taking turns were incredible. I want to upgrade to 20' tire and rims. I like that whole look but I'm afraid I may lose some of the ride and handling/ . Dealer claims I wont notice much of a difference. Thoughts."
November 2014,To me it seemed nothing like a civic though. Just not very fast.
November 2014,"The first ILX was DOA, so anything will help. Still difficult to shake the tarted-up Civic stigma though."
November 2014,decent upgrades. New engine certainly gonna help. Though not that much distinction from the TLX. Kind of surprised they didn't follow the trend and distinguish it by going with a 1.6 turbo or some such.
November 2014,"So Acura is on a roll, here is info on the 2016 ILX, interesting...."
November 2014,Saw the older body coupe amg C63? (65?) today in a flat gray - sitting in traffic right infringe of me - I could not keep my eyes off the quad exhausts. Car was prob newer then mine but body showing its age a bit- but will continue to look great 10-15 years down the line.
November 2014,The C300 with the Turbo 4 is their volume seller. The 400 has a V6 and here in Canada is $8400 more than the 300.
November 2014,"Yep, that's what they cost with any kind of options. I recently priced one out for a friend who really likes options and we ran it up to $65K. (He's not doing that, not on my watch)."
November 2014,61 large for a C class? Wow.
November 2014,"So here is a short Car and Driver test of the new C400 4matic, prices tested was north of $61K."
November 2014,"mark - dude, you have way too much time on your hands!!"
November 2014,"=====Here goes:=====I'll stick with the A3 & A4 to introduce a new forum class for ""LPS"" [suffix'd] cars.For the moment, let's say the ELLPS class is solidly where the new A3 belongs, To me, that seems to suggest the A4 (and the 2016 A4 leaps to mind) is no longer an ELLPS, nor is it an LPS, since the A6 is the representative of the LPS entry from Audi.Well, two LPS classes used to be sufficient -- but over the past few years car companies have scrambled to ""find a hole"" in the market and create a new car model to plug it. And, no hole seems either too big or too little -- model proliferation is the norm these days.Audi and BMW (and Mercedes too) have become the masters of model proliferation, it seems.And, just about ""everybody"" demonstrates ""wheelbase"" [or overall length] and girth growth every time they birth the new generation of a model. The BMW 3, for instance, has grown so much so that it is, in many ways, larger than a not-that-old 5 series. The current A4 used to be the size of the new A3 -- and when the current A4 was introduced in the US as a 2009 model it's wheelbase was within a fraction of an inch of the size of the then current A6. I know, I had a 2005 A6 that I kept for 6 months after the lease ended so that I could move to the new A4 and not have any period of time where I was not in an Audi. When the 2009 A4 came in to the dealer, I pulled my A6 up beside it -- and it was virtually impossible to tell the difference between the two with respect to wheelbase.The A4 got big! Then, when the new gen A6 came out, it, of course, grew in size -- the A3 was in the pipeline (not the 2009 A3, which was essentially a VW) and what we have in the brand new A3 is a car that plugs the hole left by the move up of the A4 into what used to be the size class of the A6, Numerous examples of this phenomenon can be cited for the cars that come from BMW, Mercedes, Cadillac and Lexus.We now have -- at least -- 3 size (and price) categories for cars to fit into and still be, in some fashion (class) LPS cars. ELLPS, ILLPS & LPS is my proposal. ILLPS means Intermediate Level LPS also known as a member of the phylum: Luxoperforiososedantis.So, assuming we all accept the notion that three LPS classes are now appropriate, we move the current (and certainly 2016's upcoming) A4, 3 series and C class (while were sticking with the Germans) to the ILLPS forum and open up the new, 'blank slate', ELLPS board (forum) for cars like the new Audi A3, BMW 2 series (which may be problematic since it doesn't have 4-doors as far as I know) and the Mercedes CLA (which is a 4-door coupe, according to MB). We move the CTS firmly to the LPS forum and put the ATS in with the ILPS cars if its wheelbase (among other things) doesn't force it into the ELLPS class.I would think wheelbase would be one criteria, total length and width of the car two additional criteria, base price and 90% maximum price yet an additional criteria, and so forth.Which brings me to perception.I cannot -- YET -- place the Hyundai Genesis (for example) in the mix of LPS anything; however, there is a strong resemblance to some of the phylum's class members at least insofar as luxury content is concerned. I would assume the Genesis will be an LPS member someday. Perhaps time in the market is a criteria -- no one wants a poser -- and it takes time to earn your place in phylum Luxoperforiososedantis. In any case, the time has come for the current ELLPS suspects to move to the ILLPS forum.At least I think so."
November 2014,"that C&D article said 6.5 0-60 for the 1.8. That seems to fast, since it put the 2.0 quattro in the mid-5s."
November 2014,Nobody has had a problem with the A4 being ELLPS and that is FWD in base form as well. 1.8 is smaller but so is the car so the performance may be similar.
November 2014,But is it an ELLPSEL = under 30K so yes IMHOL = leather is standard so yesP = 1.8 maybe FWD no manumatic maybeS = it's a sedan.
November 2014,"So here is the first test of the new Audi A3, 1.8T FWD, and of course it is silver.."
November 2014,"@flightnurse‌ - silver car- checked out the website seems pretty cool, but I wish my car was another color. I have not rented a car in years but this would be a better way to go-"
November 2014,"I travel for work and for the most part get to drive many different cars over and over again, my current fave cars to rent are Nissan Altima, Chrysler 300 and Chevy Impala. The new Chrsyler 200 is nice looking but still need work.. But there is a new car company that is in select city called Silver Car all they rent are Silver Audi A4 Premium Plus cars with Nav. I have rented from them once, and was impressed their service and the car. They aren't a force to make a difference in the rental car world but it is nice to rent a fun without spending too much money."
November 2014,@kristie_h - love those adds - always on topic and useful-this information is it actually used for an article or market research?
November 2014,"Didn't there used to be a topic entitled ""I'm Upside Down and Can't Get Up?"""
November 2014,A reporter seeks to interview a recent new car buyer who financed through a 72-month or longer loan. Please email PR@edmunds.com to share your story.
November 2014,"Now in my second swap out and mark I agree it's not the best- I don't know the perfect date to do the swap- don't want to wait to long and hit a patch of ice on slicks or drive to long on the harder winters in decent mild weather. The cost to swap is not cheap when also buying another set of rims along with the cost of tires. The goodyear a/s UHP I had on the G - they did the trick just fine. They def rode a little harsher then the standard G tires and were better in the sun- but the G on the old set (when new) was better in the snow with the standard non UHP - a/s. No perfect answer in this equation, unless you move to either Arizona or Alaska. I would go to Zona."
November 2014,"sween and roadb -- you two are doing it the way that it really SHOULD be done. I assume I am in the majority who just aren't willing or perhaps even mentally willing to spend on two sets of tires. I admit the solution you two have chosen is superior. My original point was to suggest tips that would improve your (our) lot in life -- if we live in a place that has moderate winters or in a city that mitigates the impact of snow with super human snow removal and lots of road chemicals.Were I a resident of, say, Minnesota or North Dakota or perhaps even Michigan, I may feel the need for four dedicated winter shoes.Were I the type to really push my car (S or no) to more than 85%, perhaps that too would argue in favor of summer MAX Performance tires (my 2009 A4 did come with MAX performance 35 series 19"" x 255's -- they lasted 11,000 miles).I like to drive somewhat at a higher level than, I assume, most US drivers. I have a car that allows me to be a better driver than I probably am (in real life); I have been to 4 Audi driving schools in Austria, one Porsche school in little ol' Dayton, Ohio and a BMW X-drive school in South (and North) Carolina. I have the schoolin' and the car to get 'er done -- therefore, I find my skills and my car to be under-tired with the mostly crappy all-seasons manufacturers foist upon Americans who (mostly like me) don't do what you two do.I am lobbying the manufacturers (Audi in my case) to consider stepping up to UHP A/S's rather than the much lower ""performance"" rubber most manufacturers shod their cars with when the customer orders ""non-Summer"" tires.I take my hat off to your two who are willing and able to not go for the optimum, rather electing to go for the maximum you can get, even if it means changing your wheels and tires out twice per year.For those who aren't willing to walk the walk (that would be me) of the twice yearly ritual, all I am hoping to convey is that there is a much much better performing car waiting to be let loose if you will at least upgrade to UHP A/S;s rather than not even know what you're missing.You two, indeed, drive it like you live. I applaud your behavior but I'm still OK with mine.You might say, and I do, that good is the enemy of great. In this case, I'll say what I am looking for is to graduate from good to very good -- which still remains the enemy of greatness, but in this instance, I, for one, am willing to live with it."
November 2014,"UHP all seasons are fine year round for vehicles like my son's X3 truck, but I run summer rubber and switch to either winter tires or UHP all seasons in early December on most everything else in the stable- even my wife's E90 328i snoozemobile. In any event, I have a Wrangler Sahara equipped with winter rubber in case the snow really piles up."
November 2014,"@markcincinnati‌ and others - the a/s UHP tires are really nice- I had a set on my old Infiniti made by goodyear that did the trick - BUT even though they are nice ""What is better -- much much better? Easy-peasy:"" is dedicated set of summer UHP and dedicated winters set up if you indeed would like to use the S to its real performance / utility abilities. My set up is as such- summer on car now and in profile pix are 19 Zr 255/35 conti extremes. Winter we go 18 R 235/45 winter sport dunnies on standard rims. Talking max grip when weather is nice, - sport diff helps as well. In the winter it's a billy goat with Quattro. Dedicated winters are where it's at if you have to deal with tough winters/ I know there has been some debate about this but its a fact, they work wonders no matter what drive wheels are pushing or pulling the sled."
November 2014,I'm going to give a shout out for the Michelin Primacy MXV4.  Excellent tire with stellar reviews for a V or H rating . Like mark posted above with the new Premier A/S tire you no longer have to worry how long it will take to accomplish a panic stop while driving in a downpour because of the premiers tire wear.. which was not good before the upgrade. Cant go wrong with either tire
November 2014,Also pricier I bet.
November 2014,"Continental ExtremeContact DWS Ultra High Performance All-Seasons have, as some here have alluded to, been somewhat dethroned in the most recent Tire Rack test:""Michelin has reset the performance standard for an all-season tire with their Pilot Sport A/S 3, which delivers impressive handling in both dry and wet conditions. And while not apparent during our short road evaluation, when running laps on our test track at the limit this tire showed a little more tread wear than the others tires. But this focus on ultimate performance during the summer months compromises its wintertime capabilities somewhat. The Bridgestone Potenza RE970AS Pole Position is a pleasure to drive, with a satisfying feel in the steering wheel and good handling in dry and wet conditions. However, it falls way short of what most drivers would consider adequate in winter conditions. The Continental ExtremeContact DWS doesn't quite have the nimble feel of the others, but offers good ride quality and reasonable handling along with good overall traction regardless of the weather - dry, wet or winter.""I found the above @: http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tests/testDisplay.jsp?ttid=177Now, having lived about 20,000 miles with the Contis DWS Ultra High Performance -- in Cincinnati's climate -- I would not hesitate to ""go again"" with the Contis.If I lived perhaps 100 miles or so due south of Cincinnati, the Michelin Pilot Sport A/S 3's would certainly vie for my dollars. The further north I might live, however, the Conti DWS UHP's would still be the ones to beat based on the Tire Rack review. The review does tend to make me think the DWS's are much more of a compromise than anything else, but they are much stiffer than the standard GT Contis that came with my S4, very quiet and they do improve the handling of the car as noted in my post regarding air pressure and tires.It would appear that the Michelin's are the new standard in UHP all seasons, but the review seems to suggest they are not as all year round good as the Continentals.It's great to have such excellent choices."
November 2014,"We did that with both of our Saturn VUE's ... new tires meant that it got traded in within a few months.Wife was concerned that when we put new tires on the CX-7, it wasn't long for the household."
November 2014,"I actually replaced the OEM Dunlop Summer tires on my '09 XK with the Conti Extreme Contact DWS in order to have the slightest chance of moving on any kind of grade in the snow (not intentionally, but with Boston weather, you just never know when snow will strike....like Sunday morning!). Of course, once I put th new sneaks on the XK, I traded for an AWD XF. As I traded my newly Vredestein-shod '05 TL for the XK. It would seem with me, new tires are a harbinger of new cars to come..."
November 2014,I run the Cooper RS3-A UHP all-season as the winter tire on my MS3(the Michelin PSS is the summer tire) and year round on my son's X3 truck. It looks like I will get over 45k miles out of the tire in each application. I will likely go with the Michelin Pilot Sport A/S 3 when the Coopers wear out since the local tire shop I use no longer carries Cooper tires.
November 2014,"I just bought those Contis for my MINI---they do stick well but are also somewhat compliant, which I like. ""Skateboard"" cars like the MINI are harsh enough as it is. Nice tires for the sporting driver who doesn't need to go to extremes on public roads."
November 2014,"Mark, bravo...."
November 2014,"And the punchline is: ""He Only Took Tips!"" A tip for those who are either owners of or contemplating one of these ELLPS or ELLPSUV/CUV's -- assuming the vehicle in question is not a BMW. Here goes: many, probably most of these cars tend toward -- or outright already have -- some degree of nose heaviness. Audi is certainly not known for ""50 - 50"" weight balance, for instance. Acura, Volvo and most certainly others (again not BMW) are absolutely nose heavy when configured as 2WD vehicles (since they mostly are FWD when ordered thusly). More and more of these ELLP vehicles are ordered every year with 4-driven wheels (the up take here in SW Ohio is now for ""mostly"" AWD versions -- even most BMW's and Mercedes are acquired with AWD so say the dealers). Alas, even the AWD versions are nose-heavy. The thing that I've learned that is a quick, easy and virtually free way to improve upon some of the effects of being a bit porky on the front is to inflate the front tires +2 pounds more than the rear tires; and, typically to inflate the fronts to one or two pounds MORE than the factory sticker suggests.My S4 says to inflate the tires at max to 42 pounds. I inflate front to 43 and rear to 41 (using the free nitrogen ""air"" Costco offers its members).We had a cold snap here in River City yesterday -- of course the air pressure in all four tires dropped dramatically -- we went from 70+ degrees to overnight temps in the upper teens with a daytime high an optimistic 41.Since I was at Costco getting my fill up of their Top-Tier premium, I also went for the free air fill-up. Based on the length of time before the ""ding"" indicating 43 pounds, the pressure had to have been over 5 or 6 pounds below that. To ensure the tires were cold, I drove to Costco, parked and went shopping in the store for a while, then went to the tire dept for my fill-up.I kid you not -- and I've known this for years, yet I was as pleasantly surprised as could be -- the turn-in was IMMEDIATELY sharper, like the car had been placed on a set of shiny new rails.OK, that is the ""free"" (as in almost zero cost) tip.Here's one, that when coupled with the above free tip, will further dramatically improve your heavy nosed (and this one works on any car) ELLP vehicle's steering dynamics: switching out of the factory tires (unless certain tires are already on your ELLP car) into the top of the line performance tires in the class (of tire) that you would normally drive.For example -- here in SW Ohio -- no one (well, virtually no one) uses ""summer"" and ""winter"" tires -- they use either ""summer"" tires year round or (more likely) all-season tires, year round.The Germans have even gone so far as to specify as no cost options, typically, the ability to order your car with summer only or all season rubber. Dealers typically order their for-stock vehicles with all-season rubber to keep their customers from complaining about the super fast tire wear and the almost unusable traction summer tires offer to those of us who do have temps that go below 40 - 45 degrees from time to time (our typical winters are usually above freezing, but usually below 45 which is the kryptonite temp for summer only tires).The thing is, a lot of the ""all-season"" tires are either Grand Touring tires or are simply H rated all-seasons (generally from a well-known brand and generally with a fairly long tread-life expectation).My S4 came with H rated Grand Touring tires. What were they thinking? Offered up to order is an S4 with either summer or all-season tires. I checked the all-season box since, well, you know, I live in Cincinnati and we really (usually) have very mild winters in terms of both temp and snowfall. Why do I need dedicated winter tires in my climate, so to speak? I don't. Grand Touring tires are fine -- but, if you ax' me they have no business on an Audi S car of any stripe.What is better -- much much better? Easy-peasy: an Ultra-High Performance All-Season tire from one of the name brands all of the German's buy from. We ended up with Continental ExtremeContact DWS Ultra High Performance All-Seasons from Tire Rack -- shipped to the dealer, installed and road-force balanced. These tires should have their picture placed beside the word ""sticky"" in your Merriam-Webster.They have super-stiff (compared to the rather comfy-biased Grand Touring H rated rubber that the S4 came with) sidewalls and they are Y speed-rated. Of course, since I ordered my car with the all-season tire option, Audi saw fit to engage a max-speed limiter that tops out at 130 (easily switched off, if you really think you're going to need to exceed 130MPH). So, you can, for relatively little money (close to zero) noticeably improve your ELLP's turn-in, gas mileage and overall handling by simply cranking up the fronts to +2 pounds over the rears and by cranking up the front 1 or 2 pounds over the door jam's ""suggestion.""Then for what will probably amount to $700 to $1,000 all-in (but for some of these cars that you can order 20"" wheels, the $ amount will be higher), you can take the next big step and get rid of the almost certainly ""wimpy"" tires the manufacturers seem to put on these cars when the ""no summer only"" tire option is checked.Virtually all of these ELLPS, ELLPSUV/CUV vehicles are nose heavy -- which manifests itself as under-steer. It is unlikely you can, as the saying goes, put lipstick on a pig and turn it into a Porsche in the handling department -- but, with my hand raised on high, I can attest that by doing both of the suggested tips above, I even transformed my TL Advance from somewhat of a farm-implement (i.e., it could tend to ""plow"" a little bit even with SH-AWD) due to its less than ideal 60-40 (or something like that) F/R weight distribution) into a confidence inspiring and -- with a consideration for its price -- ""S4-light"" ELLPS.Of course, in the case of the Acura TL Advance w/SH-AWD the 19"" H rated tires that it came with couldn't have sucked anymore even if their name was Hoover (I crack myself up).So, my friends and fellow posters, if you're laying out something north of $45,000, you can for no to relatively low money transform your baby from ""nice"" to a vehicle that, quoting my wife, ""goes like a snake in a rat hole.""If you play your cards right, you can make the UHP all-seasons (or whatever you and your ""climate"" could call optimum) part of the purchase/lease deal when you order the car or before you sign on the dotted line to buy/lease one off the lot.Hopefully the above will have some merit and even more $ value and most of all ""fun to drive"" value for at least one forum participant.Drive it . . . oh hell, you know the rest."
November 2014,I've seen a few IS350 F Sports around. Those are really sharp & aggressive looking. Probably my favorite looker of the current (classic) crop of ELLPS.
November 2014,"This is how I feel in regards to the Q5 TDI.... Gobs of torque that starts off so low and just pulls and pulls..BTW the Audi dealer had a couple of the new Q3, nice SUV, for 37K was surprised on how it was, but on the small side for what we are looking for."
November 2014,"isn't the Q5 interior (and cargo area) on the small side for the class? I remember looking at them before we got the RDX, and I have it in my head that it seemed very tight in the back."
November 2014,"Simply put, the SQ5 -- even at its price point -- offered more content, the immpeccable interior Audi seems to do with aplomb, and oh that supercharged engine with zero lag, weapons grade torque -- and the SQ5 had a gorgeous red leather interior to boot.To get the same or similar content, the BMW was even more expensive; and I think she felt the SQ5's interior, sport seats in particular plus the B&O sound system cinched it -- almost. Panther Black Pearl paint sealed the deal. That plus a 6% discount on NOT your garden variety Q5 or X3 -- Audi iimbues its ""S"" cars with ""that certain something"" -- undoubtedly sealed the deal.Having matching interiors was probably a minor influencer, too.She has had 2 X3's since 2005 -- very fond of them. But, if you've never driven an SQ5 at full cry, you may not quite understand the almost immediate reaction: An ""addiction"" to the sound and the fury, wrapped up in what seems to be a premium CAR -- the BMW for all of its inherent goodness just doesn't seem as nice of a place to spend hours in. Then, of course, there is that oh-so-cute flat bottomed sport steering wheel on the SQ, too.If you can take an SQ5 out for a test drive. On the other hand . . .The BMW is better balanced -- but the SQ passes the triple speed around the curve test with ease and poise. As a practical matter, that attribute felt pretty much like a draw, despite the BMW's less heavy nose. The Audi engineers did a very nice job taming the potetial understeer of the SQ's fatter front-end.Just test drive an SQ -- perhaps you too will want to keep on driving it, long aafter the test drive ends. One more thing, the SQ5 is very rare, you won't see yourself coming and going -- the X3 even with the more potent i6 motivation is rather easy to find, and unlike the SQ seems to do little to differentiate itself from the ""regular"" X3."
October 2014,"Mark, entertaining posts, as usual."
October 2014,"What was the reason for your wife getting the SQ5? over the X3? I find the interior of the Q5 a much more inviting environment over the X3, but the X3 did handle better I thought."
October 2014,"We want to stay south of 55K, well I bumped to 55K, Rick didn't want to go north of 50K. But the Q5 with the TDI can't be had for under 50K with the Tech package..."
October 2014,"well, as always, money comes into play. Big difference between stretching from a ""normal"" CUV to an RDX in the low-mid 30s, and jumping to a European hot rod for 50k+, if not pushing 60 large.Modest performance? If you mean acceleration, given that it does 0-60 in the low 6's, you have some awfully high standards! We obviously travel in different automotive standard circles!"
October 2014,"The RDX is FWD biased and currently can't be had with what used to be the RDX's secret sauce, SH-AWD. The RDX is certainly nice looking and is, as noted, high content for the money.It is, however, an appliance, a very good appliance but rather unremarkable if you are looking for anything beyond modest (and I think that is generous) performance.The RDX, like all Acura's is probably one of the most reliable and I would, therefore, assume durable vehicles in the small to mid size CUV universe.Life, as I now know, being north of 60, is too short for boring cars.My vote would be for the X3 of the choices suggested -- but I did much appreciate the XC60 T6 when I floored the accelerator -- the thing has some serious torque, the X3 (at the price point) couldn't even come close.The X3 however felt like it was on rails.Here is the test I use -- I find a curve on a secondary road -- a very lightly traveled secondary road. I look for a curve marked 15mph or 20mph (at most). Then I approach the curve at more than double the posted speed; next I brake hard for a moment to reduce speed to double the posted speed and to force a weight transfer to the front wheel. As I enter the curve at 30mph, I accelerate hard as soon as the front wheels have passed the mid point of the curve. If the car easily remains in its lane, I repeat the process at triple the posted speed.The X3 easily handles this ""experiment"" and the feeling is that it could go at the corner at more than 3x the posted ""suggested"" speed. The RDX (old version with the turbo 4 and SH-AWD could do this all day.) The new one plows and crosses the center line. The XC60 was a T6 Type R and it felt in good control of its understeering urges too. But the Volvo was much closer to its limit since it didn't shift enough power aft since there technically was no actual loss of traction.The X3 was the natural -- were money no object, the X3 with the i6 turbo would clearly be the one to get if you wanted some salt and pepper on your ""meat."""
October 2014,"My wife wanted the nice blue badly, but they only offered it on the MDX. The dark gray we got is nice though, and we have the tan interior. Gray would have been nice too."
October 2014,"I agree that for the price it is a bargain, by other issue with the Japanese is you can't custom their cars, it's take it or leave it. It's more the color combo then anything else that bothers me. Acura has a great blue, but it only comes in Grey leather.. Why not tan or Ivory..."
October 2014,"I meant 60, since that is what you said you drove. Freudian slip I guess.I find the RDX to be roomy enough up front, and I am not small, nor is my wife. But it does have a very large back seat.Headroom? First I heard anyone complain about that on the RDX. I normally have issues (large Torso to leg ratio!), and some cars like the 2001 TL I just could not drive without my head jammed in the roof. But I don't come close to hitting in the RDX. Oh well. that is why they make so many cars. Just have to find what works for you. The RDX at least is a bargain compared to the Euro ones."
October 2014,"The XC90 is the larger of the two Volvo SUV's, we looked at the RDX and it felt cramped to us. I was surprised that the rear had the amount of legroom it had, but the head to roof test was the problem. Plus the new XC90 is coming in the spring with a price tag that starts with the X5, north of 50K."
October 2014,"If you are looking at an x3 and xc90, should look at Acura RDX. Instead to be comparable. Very quick and less bulky than an MDX. And quite a bit cheaper."
October 2014,"I would agree with the 2002 observation -- and even agree perhaps for a number of years after 2002; but we're just about at the end of 2014. My point? Things have changed in 12 years. The 335, the S4 and some incarnation of the Mercedes C class are ELLPS cars based on the places we could logically and appropriately place them.And, while I am certain you could find ELLPS cars all day long with ""about"" a $40K price tag, it does seem -- now -- that because there is both a stronger ""P"" and ""L""component in the acronym (than 10-12 years ago), that the price of entry has probably crept up to a more realistic level of $45K or more.As I mentioned, I believe that because folks here on Edmunds are er, more passionate, about cars and they really do want both the P and the L, ""strippies"" of some of the ELLPS cars are probably not what we're opining about here.Now, along comes the new ELLPS class, perhaps?What [or, perhaps, WHERE does it belong?] is an A3 or more pointedly an S3? It/they, today, could possibly be argued as deserving a footnote or honorary inclusion into the ELLPS class. But perhaps with the 2016 current ELLPS models looming ""larger"" (perhaps somewhat literally) than today's and certainly larger (for the most part) than the A3 (with its shorter wheelbase and girth), perhaps the entire current membership of the ELLPS family needs to be moved to a newly named forum vacating the ELLPS space thus allowing the A3, S3 and the soon to follow cars from Asia, Europe and the US, to fill in as the NEW NORMAL ELLPS cars.Of course, if that happens, where does a BMW 3 or Audi A4 or Volvo S60 or TLX, Q50 or, or, or, end up? A 3 series will not be welcome in the LPS forum discussions -- will it? A 3 series is not a 5 series an A4 is not an A6, and so forth.The lines blur, they come into focus, they blur again; the cars get bigger (almost univerally) every time a new generation is released. A 2014 3 series seems bigger, to me, than a 2003 5 series -- etc etc. So what was true in 2002 just doesn't carry on (my wayward son.)What's between an ELLPS and an LPS anyway? PPPLPS - Popularly Priced Premium Luxury Performance Sedan (or would that be the step below ELLPS?) Or perhaps UMLPS - Updwardly Mobile Luxury Performance Sedan? Maybe NQQFBLPS - Not Quite Qualified to be a Full Blown Luxury Performance Sedan. No no, how 'bout ILLPS in keeping with the ""E"" for Entry -- we bump it up to: Intermediate Level Luxury Performance Sedan, and we move the current ELLPS players into the ILLPS class and move the up and coming ""Jr ELLPS's"" of today into the void left by moving the current folks from ELLPS to ILLPS and so on . . .Yeah, that's the ticket.Almost forgot: Boo! Happy Halloween!"
October 2014,"Interesting video, Rick and I started the look for his SUV, and we went to the Volvo dealer and drove a XC60 with the E-Drive engine, this is a Super and Turbo Charged 2 liter engine, rated at 302hp and 295lbs of torque. Just as this video shows, the S60 just walks away from the TLX, as did the XC60 very impressed with the amount power it makes. So for 50K you get a fully loaded top of the line Volvo XC60 that can run with the other guys. I noticed that invoice for this SUV is 48K and people having been paying under invoice for it, also if you do the Euro Delivery you save 5% of the purchase price, PLUS 2 round trip tickets to Sweden, hotel stay (one night) and 15 days of insurance. This sweetens the deal a lot..We also liked the Q5, a lot, and the 3.0 TDI torque is way addictive, so far the interior of the Q5 is our fave... The X3 was nice, the 2 liter diesel was hard press to complain about the power, We have more SUV's to look at, I'm looking forward in testing the Jeep Grand Cherokee with the diesel engine. We drove a MDX, we both thought it was nice, but bulky and the lack of customizing made it fall off the list quickly. Now if you are on a budget and looking for a nicely loaded SUV then the MDX is one to look at. While at the dealer we look at the TLX and liked it, Acura did it right..."
October 2014,"well, those are 2 cars I certainly wouldn't be buying if I was planning to go drag racing!"
October 2014,For those considering a Volvo or the new acura TLX -or those who would compare both- http://youtu.be/QsLrJZsP38o
October 2014,@stickguy might have a real point - would add the Q50 and old G37 now q40 to the list as well. Bang for buck plus sudo lux I would find a better car then old g37 that bests fits. Or one could get a used 335 or s4 with a few miles.
October 2014,"I actually looked back to the beginning of this thread (from 2002!). I still think that the S4, 335i are a step up (middle level?). The TLX, A4, 320/328, S60 still fit the profile for EL."
October 2014,"It's hard to find a legitimate ELLPS below 40 grand. There are some nice ELLS below 40 k, but they lack the ""P"". Then there are also some nice ELPS, too, but their luxury scope is often limited to couple of nice features. Ok machines, but not ELLPS. Another part is base version vs. optioned. Not just leather, but engine, sports suspension, or engine, will change the machine dramatically."
October 2014,"Love the @markcincinnati‌ posts - flow so well. I also agree if 60k (msrp on my s4 was 57 and change) for Ellps is now the norm then the s4 (please get the sports diff for the 1k, it works magic) is the machine to beat even in its 5th year. I have to wonder thou what is ELLps- when I was looking at my G 35k was always a number I thought would be entry level lux. I really wonder what exactly is entry level performance and lux- Is it now 40k ? 50k? 60k? If it's over 50k and you are looking be hard pressed to find something better the s4- imo"
October 2014,"S4 M3 Much as I love my S4, the M3 and S4 aren't in the same class -- Audi's S4 is the competitor to the BMW 335 (and to be fully comparative, the BMW would have to be an X-drive version.)There is no RS4 (US) available which would be the M3's competitor.I believe the S4 used to be the M3 rival, but once ""RS's"" were introduced the ""S"" moved a step down the performance ladder.The net of this is to clarify that the S4 is still in the ELLPS category, no matter how much it can be optioned to (well over $60K in a New York second).For the record, I wouldn't kick a 335 out of bed for eating crackers -- hell, I'd even bring the crackers.Perhaps I lucked out with my S4 -- based on the way I equipped it; it seems the ""distance"" between an all singing, all dancing, S-Line A4 and an S4 is remarkably short. If you're looking at an A4 with a bunch of options, the S4 with not so many options, is just a smidge more (on a lease) than the ""lesser"" 4.My wife's SQ5, Prestige, too, was ""within reach"" of a Q5 3.0T -- and, like the A4 S4 comparison, the ""S"" cars are remarkable, almost thrilling, performers.The top of the line versions of most of the ELLPS cars are -- almost universally -- great performers available for something far less than a King's ransom. And, what you end up with is very close to the driving fun of a true sports sedan.Of course, the ""bottom of the line"" of the ELLPS cars is/are still firmly planted as a card carrying member of the ELLPS family. Yet, for folks who frequent these formums and the brand specific sites, my assumption is that very few of us look to the ELLPS brand of our dreams and think, ""I'm gettin' me a strippie . . . ."" My conclusion is that the mavens who are participating here are more likely than not to equip their cars with a lot of performance and tech options -- and probably a fair amount of ""L""uxury features too.The ELLPS class here on Edmunds, IMHO, has to be one of the most active boards and enjoys the participation of mostly very passionate (and opinionated) car lovers.Much as I love cars like the S6 (if there are many ""like"" the S6), I think the S4 ""class"" (ELLPS) is really where the action and drama lie.I'm driving it like I (at age 63) live."

October 2014,"sweendogy Any tickets with the V1? Last 5 years from MA. to SC I have had not one close call. The pop radar is the one that could bag us. Open roads, speed trap area's are no match for the 9500. Even your older unit works well."
October 2014,@brian125 - I'm a V1 guy- have one for 7 years and never upgraded it. The upgrade is expensive and just looking at V1 website makes me wonder if an upgrade is worth it or to jump to the new passport- looks like the reviews are great and the its close to my upgrade price for my old v1.
October 2014,nycI have been seeing a lot of Legacy's on the road lately. Sharp looking vehicle. Passport 9500 ix radar detector will take care of a lot of your travel/ getting ticket problems. What I like about this system is its Satellite Technology. Every time you mark a speed trap/ location on your system its updated and all passport 9500 detector's will learn/ store these spots across the country. One of the best Car investments I ever made.
October 2014,"@sweendogy‌ So far, so good. I'm a little over 1500 miles in. I just filled up the tank for the 3rd time. I think if I can get the stars to align, I might try for 500 miles on this tank. The Legacy is a fantastic daily driver. The suspension is comfortable and very well tuned. The 175 horsepower is nothing to brag about, but it does get me up to speed. I really like the CVT. If I wasn't such a car nut, I'd have no idea this wasn't a conventional automatic. The CVT is quite responsive and very smooth. It adds to the Legacy's overall character and refinement. I haven't had the traffic conditions to ""wring it out"" yet, but the car doesn't ""beg"" to be driven hard like my 328xi did. Good thing too. It seems like the CT State Troopers, the NY State Troopers, Local Stamford PD, & NYPD Highway 1 are stepping up patrols and speed traps big time."
October 2014,@nycarguy glad you like legacy. How's the cvt? Weird side note miss the old crock Dundee outback commercials of my youth.
October 2014,"@m6user‌ That could be part of it, although I am a card carrying CCBA (Chronic Car Buyer's Annonymous) member:) Also the thought that I purchased instead of leased meaning there is no ""end date"" for me to check out ""what's next.""I'm very content with the Legacy so far. Definitely not the fastest car on the road, but passes well & cruises nicely on the highway during my 6 day per week, 65 mile RT commute."

October 2014,"Stick....S4 is equivalent to a BMW 335i. Then again, it's equivalent to an Acura TL SH AWD that's a tad slower, too.TLX is a nice ride. I compared the suspension to an E350 when I, test drove it. Tech is better than Mercedes, too. It's finished nicely and has great, premium materials, too. IMHO, it had the best stereo in the biz (ELS). Tranmission shifted quick and smooth enough you won't notice (similar to my E92 335i). Acura prgrammed the trans well. In sport, it will downshift almost telepathically. It's not as quick as the S4 or the 335i, but it is quick."
October 2014,"Regarding the Acura TLX: personally, the styling leaves me cold. Reports I have read are that it doesn't seem luxurious enough inside, with poor tech, and that the 9-speed autobox is not impressive."
October 2014,"Also, I kept meaning to question what gets counted here. To me, your S4 is not an ELLPS. That would be an A4, or a 328i. S4 to me us another class, along with the M3."
October 2014,"I recall reading somewhere recently that it is selling well, at least relative to what it replaced! And have seen some good reports. As always, have to filter the magazine stuff to get to what real people care about. And no, nit everyone here represents the ""average buyer"" for one of these (the same folks that by 320is and don't order the big engine sport pack models).I have sat in one a few times, and really liked it. And to me it is attractive. Still haven't driven one, but from showroom testing, not confusing it with an accord, any more than an ES350 vs. a Camry XLE.My guess is Acura never expected a better than 10% take on the AWD model anyway. But we shall see. Supplies seem to be better now, so will be interesting to see how sales trend through end of the year."
October 2014,"The new TLX with SH-AWD ought to be the IT car right now in this class (and maybe on this forum). Content-wise, this (and from an actual cost, not MSRP basis, the Q50, too) ought to be setting the world on fire sales-wise.Seems tho to not be of too much interest here. Once again, my wife and I looked at this car from a bang for the buck perspective (the TLX Advance V6 w/SH-AWD): What even comes close to the combination of features and alleged capabilities for the money?Now, still NOT having driven one, perhaps the TLX just seems like an expensive Accord -- but on paper, it would seem not.Further, it seems far enough UNDER $50K to merit ""our"" attention.Of course the car magazines are just giving the thing the briefest of ""test-reports"" -- and I would say the reviews from the performance perspective are rather mixed, despite the recognition that there seems to be a lot of car for the MSRP.What am I, what are we not impressed enough with -- the styling, the tinny sounding doors when slammed?I have a regret, now that I think about it -- I wish, for a lousy $1,000+ bucks that I would have gotten the torque vectoring diff on my S4 (Audi's SH-AWD).Any TLX SH-AWD owners or wanna be owners here?Hello?Is this thing on?"
October 2014,"Back on topic- In anti tesla style - I'm amazed how bad Infiniti has stubbed of late. For 2013 the ""g"" was retired but late in 2013 they announced they would keep the car and g label for another year and sold in 2014 a 2013 G as a new car. They never produced a 2014 G or Q? but for 2015 the old G will become they new Q40. http://www.infinitiusa.com/q40/ - on the website it's coming soon- but local dealers already have the on the lots and they are offering sweet deals. Could you market something worse - I don't think so."
October 2014,"Well okay we'll let it rest and sit back and see when/if the company makes an actual profit. That after all, is the mark of a successful automobile company."
October 2014,"@Mr_Shiftright‌ - agree they didn't have to go back - they went forward-- the comp is taking notice for sure-and will be trying to copy the model- they have no show rooms - the cars most buy are direct ordered- both reducing costs. They have one of the most efficient assembly line of any product ever- they have no massive unions that have ruined some brands- no pensions of workers no longer on the books. The comp needs to pick up game- proof in stock prices- and reviews. If tesla sold a 50k car (with all the tech you crave) it would compete with the 3 series, no doubt- it's expensive because of the tech needed to roll this car. I have an idea of who's flagging posts but don't really care I find it funny- I feel my ""PL"" is just fine- I find it hard not to look at facts when talking about cars- everyone has an opinion but its worthless without fact. More on Musk / tesla here in a 60 mins piece from a while back.- I'm done talking tesla because off topichttp://youtu.be/34seeTzjNZk"
October 2014,"True, but Tesla didn't have to re-invent the wheel and go back to 1896. . It was all out there waiting for them. This is the Auto Industry 2015, not 1955. You have to be on top of your game every minute, because your competition is clever, fierce and relentless.Not sure who is flagging your posts---not I. Perhaps you could check your PL (Politeness Level) and bring it up a bit for the other members?Anyway, a Tesla really isn't apropos to this topic--I don't regard it as ""entry-level"" LUX. Optioned out, it's a pretty expensive piece of machinery."
October 2014,"Tesla just had an event last week and added a bunch of new features in the sedan. That said- they have been around for less the what -10 years? Not 150 like mb - the term ""tech"" is different for everyone - I would like to thank whoever flags my posts - I think I'm top 10 on Edmonds now."
October 2014,"The car I test drove didn't have it and the salesman said it wasn't available yet. . The Tech Package that I have listed is:Turn-by-turn navigation with seven years of free map updates; Daytime LED running lights; LED cornering lights; Automatic keyless entry; Lighted door handles; Electrochromatic side and rearview mirrors; Power rear liftgate; GPS enabled Homelink; Memory seats, mirrors and climate controlFrom reading that blurb, it looks like the monitoring features are ""forthcoming"". The sooner the better. Maybe here as we speak? Actually, the Tesla doesn't have more than a dozen comfort and convenience features that are available in the comparably priced Mercedes S class 2014 model. And the interior isn't up to snuff with the German cars either.Keep in mind that I test drove a showroom demo, so maybe a Tesla with updated features is now on the road---I don't know."
October 2014,"Its the Model 3, actually. (technically, 3 horizontal lines stacked on top of each other), and the projected base price is $35k. Although I'm sure reality will see it creep higher than that. I think your $45k number may be much close to reality."
October 2014,"""I'm not sayin' Tesla CAN'T do these things--just that right now the car is no longer competitive. "" you should read consumer reports about this car- or better yet go to the website. Moderate this....."
October 2014,I'm not sayin' Tesla CAN'T do these things--just that right now the car is no longer competitive.
October 2014,"It might have ""tech"" but not the latest tech. It's really last year's cellphone already. There's no lane avoidance tech, no collision avoidance tech, no heads up display, no blind spot technology. You can have some of these features in a GMC Yukon and all of them in just about any luxury sedan built for 2015."
October 2014,"Tesla is all about technology, while I was in San Jose in March of this year, my niece took me her favorite hang out, a very upscale shopping and Dinning place called Santana Row in this place is a Tesla Boutique shop we have one here in Phoenix, but they are not allowed to talk price or lease payments, however, at Santana Row they can, in fact they offer test drives, so far San Jose has the most Tesla's I have ever seen on the road, as my niece says, ""they are nice, but they are just another car now."" We were able to take one for a test drive. we drove a Model S 85, it wasn't fully loaded and MSRP was cough $98K , walking from the store to where the cars are at, the employee (not too sure what her tile was) had the car starting to cool off for us. After 20 minutes of showing us how some of the feature work, the key fob was given to me, and I have to say, what an impressive key fob, it is weighted and looks like the car very impressive. The first thing you notice when you settle into the car is how low it is and how long it is. The car had 21"" wheels so it rode a little on the rough side, and of course my tech geeky niece (she works for Sun Microsystems/Oracle) was playing with the center dash touch screen. As Sweeny said, Tesla could be (it really is) considered one of the best technological advanced companies ever. What can be said about elec motors that no one on this forum hasn't read about it, instead torque, scooting around traffic is not a problem, and if you drive it normal the car just purrs along. The car felt solid, but the closing of the doors didn't have the German feel when closing them. Leases are backed by Wells Fargo, and to lease this particular car it would have ran $1300/m with $7500 out of pocket, or purchase the car $1200/m with 10K down but with the 7500 federal tax credit really only 3K out of pocket. Tesla shows that one can build a pure elect car that is not boring and what the true cost of the car is without being subsidized my the motor-company. If I could convince myself to spend $1200/m for a car I would get one in a heart beat, I love the design and the 265 miles range is not a problem, and I'm seeing more and more charging stations then ever before.With the Model X and E coming school and the price dropping, who knows I might have one. The model E is to start at about 45K.Between San Diego and Phoenix a long highway 8 one can see the charging stations and these are the supercharging station which can charge a Model S in under in 20 minutes half full these are free.. ,"
October 2014,"""IMO--it even has more tech."" I guess that depends what ""tech"" is important. Tesla could be considered one of the best technological advanced companies ever- from production to completion. It's overpriced for sure - and maybe it shouldn't be a comp to the s class- but it's got plenty of tech --maybe not the best radio - any 4 door sedan that can get to 60 in 3.2 seconds and now has an auto pilot feature is pretty cool- oh and it fits 7 people and yes doesn't need gas or oil change."
October 2014,"As the Brits would say, I had a bit of a play with a Model S while driving a new 2015 X6 at the truck's international launch in South Carolina. The Tesla was pretty quick, but it seemed to slow and fall back the longer we ""played""- don't know if that was due to the driver, the batteries, or some other issue."
October 2014,I was cruising the used car listings and the local Ford dealer has a used Tesla on their site (pictures showing it in the showroom). No price listed though.
October 2014,"Hmmm...I don't think the Tesla is worth $130K at least not the current model. It's maybe worth the $75K level. Even the new ""entry-level"" C class Mercedes fully equipped, comes in at $62,000 and it's a match for the Tesla S at the moment, IMO--it even has more tech."
October 2014,@Mr_Shiftright‌ - right its not for the 1%rs. At that price level it's a comp to the s class- the standard.
October 2014,"I priced out a fully optioned maximum, all you can buy Tesla during a test drive and it came out to just over $130,000. Maybe ""entry-level"" for the 1% ?"
October 2014,"True about the range issue and the ""baby phase"" of electric autos....but what a baby!http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2014/10/11/tesla-p85d-price-performance/17098819/"
October 2014,"How about the Tesla Model X SUV. Is 70k worth a 95 mile range? Base price: Currently unknown, but expected to be around $70,000.Fuel economy: Unknown, but based on the Model S specs, expect a figure around 95 mpge from the 60kWh battery option.Pros and cons: The Tesla Model X, expected out this fall, is the crossover to wait for if you want something truly different. In true Tesla style, it’s completely electric; it features falcon-wing doors that lift up and an all-wheel drive option that will make it the first production electric car to run on all fours; and it also has Tesla’s trademark 17-inch touchscreen center console. It has the usual EV drawbacks, though: limited range coupled with potentially long recharging times.Options worth splurging on: It might come to the detriment of range, but the all-wheel drive model might be too good to pass up. These vehicles are in the baby phases. Give this industry another 5 to 10 years with more research and cost cutting ways where most buyers can afford similar models like mentioned. Tesla moved an estimated 4,600 Model S vehicles in the U.S. in the first three months of 2014 -- 1,600 in March and 3,100 in January/February. 11,000 vehicles have been sold to date this year.The Nissan leaf ev leads all sales in the US with almost 22k units sold ytd. followed by the VOLT at 14k.

October 2014,"I do agree with you about up here in the North East. RWD is terrible in winter months especially when you consider dropping this kind of coin. If you can afford to take it out of the garage for some pleasure driving 8 months out of the year that's fine. Last I looked the driving range was under 300 miles. That to me is unacceptable to travel around with a vehicle. Local driving this car is fine. I drive from NY to Myrtle beach 2 sometimes 3x a year. The Tesla wouldn't make it to M.D without stopping to charge up................ LOL.Another problem is how many charging facilities are there through out the country. With pricing at 80k plus this vehicle is a toy for the rich and not for a family guy / most buyers . When I was working this would of been a nice car to write off on a lease. Not now retired.

October 2014,"@brian125 what's the charge/mile figure that you would go for?Problem I have with current car isn't range - it was RWD (I live up east , they fixed that) but always has been out the door price. Tesla does a nice job of telling you how much you will save in fuel and time and whatever- they also give you nice lease options and other financing tools- but 80-100k for the one I would want is way to much- even with the cool rear rumble seats that face like my dad's old caprice"
October 2014,Not to mention a very sharp looking vehicle. When this model can go further without a charge I may entertain buying one. I have been seeing more Tesla's on the road this past year here in the NY area. The Telsa S is not cheap either at almost 80k. Still not sure if its worth the money even if you could afford one. The reviews are stellar.
October 2014,All American Muscle - Not Entry Level however...
October 2014,"entry level (as in the title) does serve a purpose. If this is your first step on the ladder, nothing wrong with it. Say, coming from something like my 2007 Volvo (aka the ""putt putt mobile"") the 320 is still a seriously nice car. Is it the highest end? No, but it is cheaper.you can pretty much make the same argument with the 328i. The 335 is faster/better, so if you aren't getting that, then you are cheaping out."
October 2014,"@nyccarguy‌ ... ""El cheapo"" indeed. I like how this was written- honest and to the point.  How many ""enthusiast"" have been duped. Wow"
October 2014,"Flight -- even with the 333HP my S4 claims to have (which Motor Trend says is an understatement), I can only assume my time (to a speeding ticket) can now be measured -- at most -- in weeks.Of course, with all the crazy people on I-71 North heading from Cinti to Columbus thinking 80MPH is a good place to START, well, there may be safety in numbers.I can't seem to make this thing slow down -- I mean it seems that it keeps pushing me to go faster and the heck of it is, I'm too willing to abide.I saw the Motor Week test report of the M3 -- talk about trying to control the wrath of gawd . . . . Even with the wider rear rubber the thing was wheel spin happy to the max.I somehow doubt there will be an RS4 (or RS6) brought here -- the RS7 was, in my opinion, just a demonstration to show that Audi could bring a very high performance car to the US for what some see as a relative bargain. A higher output S4, well, that I am willing to bet will be brought here -- just like I'll bet there will be higher output ""335's"" brought here, too."
October 2014,"Mark interesting thought, and you are probably right, look at the 335i 300hp and torque, with the MPPK and MPE you are looking at 335-340hp easily and BMW is very conservative with their HP rating. The current M3/4 makes 425hp (but a recent dyno test shows the M4 making 435hp at the rear wheel) so if Audi where to bring a RS4 you would right to saying it would be 400+hp, more like 450hp and not from a V8, but from a V6. I have not driven a new M3/4 yet but from articles they are some scary machines, the amount of power they make can be very over whelming, do cars of that size need more HP? Right now, the biggest issue BMW has with the M3/4 is getting the rear wheels to hook up. And Mark if I had a M4 and drove it like I lived, I wouldn't have a license..."
October 2014,And now back to our regularly scheduled program:An article on the BMW 320i from our friends at Consumer Reports.
October 2014,"Here's my [generally in violent agreement] thought about that power figure, sween: Ever escalating abilities to get power, coupled with a market that seems to have an endless appetite for more power may well take the next S4 (not the RS4, the S4) to 400 HP. Yet, there may be good reasons NOT to go there. For instance, isn't it true that part of the cost of our auto-insurance is based on HP (not torque, HP)? If my assumption on that matter is correct, perhaps AoA will lobby for whatever the next lower HP (below 400) is but press for more readily available torque. Economy and emissions, too, would have to be a consideration, no?The current 3.0T in the S4 puts out a conservative 333HP and 325 pound feet. The beefed up version in the SQ5 adds 21HP (taking it to 354) and 21 pound feet (getting us to 346). The crank is a heavier duty part than in the S4 iteration and apparently the SQ5 engine is ""strong enough"" to be cranked to another like increase without breaking much, if any, of a sweat.A new model S4 with 375HP and 367 pound feet might just be the Goldilocks answer (at least in the US). This would leave plenty of ""headroom"" for either a blown V8 or an even more tightly tuned V6 (T) to be fitted into an RS4 model. Indeed, based on what is easily do-able these days with plain ol' ""normal"" forced induction (super or turbo), twin-charging (super AND turbo) or other, ""compound induction"" derivatives, I wouldn't be shocked to ""hear-tell"" of an S4 with a 4 cylinder engine of some-kind or another, putting out an easy-peasy 350HP with gobs of low end torque, either.Program note:For reasons that would require at least two more paragraphs, I will tell you that I was cruising along at about 67 MPH on I-71 N (north of the I-275 interchange this Saturday PM last). I had the ""need"" to ""punch it"" -- and for the count of 1, 2, 3 floored the S4, cleared the incident, glanced at my digital read-out and found it reading 100. Under the circumstances (light traffic, four lanes heading north, etc), I was simply able to coast down to a relatively legal 68 without the need for the dampers. I realize the S6 seemed to do this exact same thing in what I ""recall"" as 1,2,3 -- the difference is that the S6 did so with practically zero drama. The S4 made all kinds of fun sounds as it made the jump to light speed.Newer S4's will, due to market conditions, surely come with more grunt than current versions, but for the life of me, I find it difficult to imagine ever being able (or rarely so) to use such power.1,2,3 -- the thing is like a freakin' sling-shot.Dizzy with the rush of speed, I leave you saying ""Drive it like you live""!"
October 2014,"Mark I just had a 15 loaner a4 - and missed every bit go the s4 power for those 2 days. With The new s3 at almost 3oohp I would guess the power bump for the next s4 should be close to 400, but I have not seen any publications on this figure. Maybe that is to high of a figure given the s6 is at 425- that would get us to the Sq5 's 350ish listing. I would love to see a dyno of a stock s4 and a stock sq5 - something tells me they are closer the you think."
October 2014,"The ""She's Too Fat Polka""!Not too long back, I took out a new S6 and was smitten by the intoxicating power of the thing, as well as its ability to blend sportiness and luxury into one sweet, sophisticated and sporty package.Another month, about, has passed with my S4 -- now at 17,300 miles.And, while I am certain another wild drive in an S6 would have me again tumescent with desire for this $80K super-sedan, it's just too damn fat, too big in the overall scheme of things. What would be really to my tastes, with the benefit of hindsight now, would be a slightly larger S4 -- add about an inch or so to the wheelbase, make it another 3 or 4 db quieter and put the SQ5 engine in it (for the added torque, natch). Open it up just a smidge in size and power -- 333HP and 325 ft/lbs just are about at a point in the marketplace to require a bit of a bump northward.Here we sit with no new 4's coming until 2016 MY and, if history repeats, no new S4 for at least another year (or two) beyond that.Now, if someone wanted to provide me with a new S6 for a couple of years at no charge, well, you can be certain I would not re-gift it.My comments pertaining to my opinion that the S4 will certainly require a power boost to remain competitive are a good example of ""situational velocitization"". That is what used to feel really quick and fast, well, feels simply ""normal"" these days. The only cure for this velocitization is to get an A4 2.0T loaner for a day or two, so I can essentially push my quickness and speed reset button, for there is surely no lack of quickness or speed in my S4 -- I've just gotten used to it so much I take it for granted.Drive it like you live."
October 2014,"Has anyone here yet test driven an Acura TLX Advance SH-AWD or a high-spec Mercedes C class?If so, please post your driving impressions -- the TLX seems to be getting less than stellar reviews from the likes of Automobile, C&D, MotorTrend & R&T. Funny thing, to me at least, Acura put the transmission that the paid car reviewers seem positive about in the 4-cylinder rather than in the high contented, big motor, SH-AWD version.The TLX 8-speed dual clutch (but with torque converter -- a rarity) transmission in the 4 is everyone's darlin'. Then the review turns ugly by suggesting that the 9-speed V6 just feels [essentially] fat, sluggish (due to its apparent porky-ness) and a lot less fun.On the other hand, the new C-Class is lauded as a baby S class. Who's driven these here? Tell me more, tell me more -- in many ways, your opinions are the ones that matter most."
October 2014,"In the 3 series there are two type of Sound Systems, Standard and Harmon Kardon (upgrade.) So in the 320 I have to standard sound system, however I have improved it slightly, I upgraded the amp and made the ""sub's"" under the seats more of a mid bass then ""sub's"" so over all the sound has improved. There is a thread on Bimmerfest about upgrading the standard sound system by upgrading the amp, for $45 was able to buy the adapter and a friend had the amp I did (he gave it to me.) 55 minutes of my time and I used the setting that people have recommended. Oveall, much improved, but nothing close to the B&O in the S4, or Lexus."
October 2014,The good news people the mark lev is awesome - bad news is its in an 80k msrp dollar sedan the size of Texas- more good news 10k off right now according to truecar. How's the camry systems? How's the system in the 320? I'm ok with the b&o from audi- just like I was ok with the bose from Infiniti - good radios - better the base but not like sitting in a movie theater or an Lexus.
September 2014,"I think I answered that, and the answer is no, well unless you add about 200 lbs of sound deadening to the car. People who compete in the car audio competition spend HOURS making their cars as quite as possible. When they go through the SQ (Sound Quality) check their engines must be running so of course they do not want anything entering the cabin. This is why I said to use a CD instead of the FLAC files. Who remembers DAT (Digital Audio Tape) players poor Panasonic (for the car) thought they were going to be future and make CD's obsolete, the sampling rate was far superior then that of CD's but did not hold the same amount of music as the CD. Car audio in cars today are very good, for me, I think the Mark Levinson system in the Lexus LS460 is one of the best."
September 2014,The question is can you hear the difference in sound quality between a high bitrate MP3 and FLAC when in a car moving down a road and generating its own noise? I would be interested in somebody running a blind test to see if and how many people could tell the difference.
September 2014,"I have the b&o and recently had a 2015 loaner a4 non- b&o and found the stock radio fine but nothing special, it couldn't stream from my iphone. I like the b&o as I'm usually listen to Rihanna and she sounds pretty good, I listen to a lot of streaming talk radio as well --For a real treat in sound I throw it in dynamic mode/ and hammer down- the artificial sound coming thru the car is all I need."
September 2014,"The ""upgraded sound system"" is only speakers and amp, not head unit. I also think the reason for not supporting FLAC has to be the HD space. Since the files would be too large. In regards to sound quality, and this subject has been beaten to death on the forums like Car Audio also people like Harry Kimura (he lives in San Diego and is the grand father of the modern day aftermarket sound competition) if you truly want sound quality in your S4 then contact usdaudio.com/ they are the only people who I would allow to touch my car. Sound Quality comes at a price, and that weigh and space. So if you could get your FLAC files to work, they wouldn't sound all that much different especially driving down the road. If you think your S4 is quite now, you should hear what 200lbs of sound deadening will do to your car. But then it comes at a price, added weight.. Current car audio has come a long way from the days when I work in then car audio industry... But they are far off from having a complete sound quality atmosphere in which you would hear the true difference, also if you want SQ, just use a CD..."
September 2014,"Hit 12,000 miles in the S4 the other day. It has past my ""it better get through Summer without needing a tow truck post accident"" test. Other than the body shop ""coolant hose"" debacle, it has been flawless and perfect mechanically. No breakdowns, no problems, no issues. I love the car. It is amazingly fun to drive and flog around turns at extremely high rates of speed. I feel like I have double the power and control with Quattro and the 3.0 vs. my old FWD 2.0T. I did find one issue, I'm getting into the music file market (still a CD guy), and I like high resolution ""HD"" music files... like FLAC, but Audi doesn't support anything but MP3 and AAC (the two worst for sound quality). The manual says up to 320 bit rates but in my testing only 256 will work, at least in AAC.Using ITunes to turn a CD into AIFF, AAC, ALAC, WAV I found only 256 AAC to work. (avoided MP3 all together but that works too; though I didn't test 320 bit rate MP3 yet). Shame on Audi for not being up to date with FLAC support in a 2014 car. I even have the Bang & Olufsen upgraded sound system, so you'd think they'd support modern quality."
September 2014,People still buying manual corvettes as take rate is 40%.Who says you have to go thru all 7 speeds each time? 6 was a nice number in my VW GTi but I can count on one hand the times I went into 5th and not straight to 6th. I get what you are saying
September 2014,"> Audi probably thinks the only people that'll order a manual will do so despite the mileage penalty, >and there's so few they won't bother developing a 7 speed with 3 pedals.I think trying to row your way thru 7 forward speeds would be very confusing and really a bit annoying but then again I'm a bit old-fashioned and for most cars I think six speeds is one too many."
September 2014,"I read the same article and it was overall positive on the vette- the other problems a punctured tire and a chipped windshield, sure the blown engine - they seem happy - as the header reads ""Our Corvette blew an engine but we still love it."""
September 2014,And not just on high end cars either- Mazda and Ford charge extra for certain colors.
September 2014,"Its been interesting following C&D online, they talk about the issues they have been having with their long term C7, not a good thing to have a blown engine... I'm fully aware of issues that manufacture have, but GM has been plagued with them for years..."
September 2014,FN.....didn't know that about the 'vette. My best friend just ordered a '15 convertible a few weeks ago. I wonder if he knows production is held up? He said he expected it by early-mid- October.
September 2014,"Yes, of course, however, I was just pointing out that the C7 has been plagued with problems, first blown engines (Car and Drivers C7) as well as others, these are on early C7, as well as auto transmission problems and now safety recalls which GM pulled the sales of them."
September 2014,"Charging extra for ""special"" paint colours is much like the high-end hotels charging an extra $10 per night for internet while Super 8 (and nearly everyone else) includes it in the nightly rate. If you complain or feel you're getting screwed, you're not worthy.There's a lot of this going on."
September 2014,"The green has disappeared from their online configurator. It was $595, though. I'm almost certain of it."
September 2014,"No, I haven't taken a look at the TLX yet. I'm leaning toward wanting a smaller car, however. My TL is a bit bigger than I'd like."
September 2014,"Every manufacturer now errs on the conservative side when it comes to recalls, stop sales, et al.On the BMW front, they have recalled i3's for airbags, X5's for latches and 3 series, X1, Z4 and X3 all for brake issues. Porsche Macans have already been recalled. Some GLK350 have been recalled. Even 918 Spiders have been recalled."
September 2014,"Regarding the vette, GM has stopped selling them as there are a couple of safety related recalls. I like the new C7, but why can't GM get it right when it comes to reducing the amount of recalls.The Costco by us will either have two Mazada's or one MB sitting outside, never a BMW."
September 2014,"Some of those I think are actually special process paint, so probably actually cost more to do."
September 2014,GM is doing this now too. Their nicer colors like White Diamond Tricoat and Crystal Red Tintcoat are significantly more money - I believe $1200 on a Cadillac here in Canada.
September 2014,Actually it's $200 and it's for the white pearl mica.
September 2014,"The only paint charge I saw at Mazda was $300 extra for the flashy red. If the are doing it on the 2, probably why you can see them advertised so cheap."
September 2014,"I noticed Mazda is charging $600 for metallic paint on the mazda2, so its definitely not limited to luxo cars anymore."
September 2014,"One of the things that always confounded me was how you go up the lux car ladder, that things like metallic paint was a costly option. My former S4, which didn't have metallic paint, made it available for a fairly significant extra charge. I think my 335i had metallic black paint that ran somewhere near $600 extra. My TL's? No extra charge. And, Acura puts a very nice paint job on their cars to boot....easily as good as anything else on the market, most times better.While Acura isn't immune to trying to get people to pay more for leather, all but the base TLX's have leather....and it is a very nice leather....soft, high quality. MB tries to push their vinyl to be as good as leather. From what I can tell, they seem to do a good marketing job on that front.Was in Costco last night. They always seem to have BMWs in the front as an enticement to use their car buying service. They had a 435i xDrive with the M Sport package....dark metallic grey with red leather interior. It was equipped exactly the way I'd want it. Very nice. But, as I suspected, it was knocking on the door of $60K. For $60K I could negotiate a new Corvette plus a Spark for daily driving duties."
September 2014,"TLong, did you try the TLX yet? I haven't had interest in the TL since your series was destroyed by the last gen TL but I'd like to get your take to compare to the '05 you have.I appreciated the reviews from others here as well and did some research on the TLX. Sounds good but haven't seen one live.I've been pricing the 335is used. I'd never go for the 328 or lower. The 2 series is too small for me and the premium for new 335's are too dear for my aching college-ravished bank account!"
September 2014,"I rented a BMW 328 last week while staying in Las Vegas.In short, I was particularly underwhelmed by this car. This is coming from somebody who currently drives an '05 TL and previously had a 6 cylinder Audi A4.The BMW was black and is gorgeous outside. I was a bit surprised at how low the roof is on this car - definitely not a lot of headroom.Since it's a rental, I'll grant that this was probably a downmarket trim level vehicle. The seats were black and I'm not sure if they were leather or leatherette - I suspect the vinyl as they didn't have a leather smell. The seat bottoms were very flat with almost no bolstering. In general, although the car did have nav, I didn't feel the interior was very upmarket. Seemed pretty middling to me - not as cheap as entry-level cars, but certainly not luxe, either. The trunk is large laterally but is shallow.The automated nanny behavior had me screaming thoughts of repair costs had I owned this car. The electronic shifter seemed more gimmicky than useful. The auto-engine shutoff was exactly as has been described here - unrefined and jerky on restart. Yes, you can disable it but you need to do that every time you get back in the car.I thought the steering was a bit numb and vague on-center. The ride was decent but not that quiet. The engine was refined for a 4 but not all that smooth to me. I didn't push the car as I was in traffic, but this car firmly convinced me that I didn't want to pay north of $40K for a 3-series."
September 2014,"Jets fans are huge target for acura, always has been that way- you go 10 seconds into Long Island and you are bound to find an acura. Just like today's game they are very promising but when it matters they can't score- very similar to Hondas acura but maybe this year will be different."
September 2014,"oh, and as I typed this, saw about 3-4 different ads for the TLX on the Jets game. So Acura is making a push for selling this car. I think it will do well, assuming it drives as well as the car shows (particularly the interior and feature content).my one big peeve? They pulled a Hyundai and deleted the spare tire. No run flats (a good thing) but just a can of fix a flat, and a cheap pump. I just refuse to own a car that has no back up plan for a bad tire. Did not explore/question if you could just take out the foam tray under the trunk floor and put a donut in there. Heck, the Legacy not only had a tire, it was on a matching alloy wheel! and per the salesman, was rated for 200 miles."
September 2014,"OK, stopped at the dealer yesterday, and had a chance to see the TLX in person (did not drive, will do that when I take my TL in for an oil change soon). they had a couple of black ones on the apron (did not scope out due to pouring rain). But, there was a graphite lustre (same color as my RDX) in the showroom. a V6 FWD. Overall, very nice. Loved the looks. Even the front end was sharp, particularly the headlights. Beak did not offend. the rest of the car had enough curves and design points to be interesting, without feeling overwrought. Interior, very nice. pretty much shares the dash with the MDX it seems (the RDX and ILX are close to each other too). Well done. Nice, clean dash and very ""Acuraish"" super duper comfy seats. back seat to me was fine. I am 6' with a long torso, and had no problem with leg or head room. Might not be quite as big as the Legacy we drove, but plenty of space for 4 adults. Trunk was acceptable.not a huge car, but certainly seemed to fit the entry level luxury profile. Performance? Well, the V6 is going to be fast, just based on how fast my RDX is, and the TLX s/b lighter and has more gears. oh, the ""shifter"" gizmo on the V6 was a bit odd. Simple to use, but just strange. Did not get a chance to see a 4 cyl which has a normal gear shift. I plan to drive a 4 cyl base car if they have one available in the next week or 2 when I go back down."
September 2014,"Although the TLX is based on the Accord, they actually did several significant structural upgrades, included use of even higher grades of steel. Here's some stuff from the Acura press release about that:http://www.acura.com/PressReleases.aspx""High strength steel uses include:UISBOR – USIBOR is a boron-alloyed steel with an aluminum-silicon coating that protects against oxidation during the heating, forming and hardening process. This high-strength hot-stamp steel is used for the TLX's door opening rings, for 5% of the unit body. (See Safety section for more information.)980 grade HSS – Used in certain key structural points such as the front edges of the door sills, and in the A-pillars and B-pillars, for 2% of the unit body.780 grade HSS – Used for most structural load paths for ACE™, including the side sills and forward spars of unit body, for 2% of the unit body.590 grade HSS – Used for the front frame spars, floor and roof supports, for 35% of the unit body...Magnesium Steering Hanger BeamLocated behind the instrument panel, a 3-piece magnesium steering-hanger beam replaces the 26-piece aluminum and steel unit in the previous TL model. Its purpose is as a structural attachment point for the steering column, pedals and instrument panel, as well as a structural element that helps the passenger cabin retain its shape in certain collisions. This single robust magnesium component makes up 2-percent of the TLX's body weight...."""
September 2014,@benjaminh interesting you are cross shopping an Accord Vs an acura - I remember guys like @graphic_guy‌ on the old TL board loving the 'new' TL only to swap it a short time later. Argument has always been acura is a better car - but no one can argue the construction is accord- and nothing wrong with that
September 2014,"The base TLX is very nicely equipped for $31k. I'm tempted to see if in 6-10 months good discounts are available....Otherwise, I'll probably go with the Accord again."
September 2014,"The RL lacks in looks, there is nothing standout about it, it doesn't say Q-Ship, the RL is the top sedan for Acura and it doesn't say that, very understated.."
September 2014,@stickguy - agree - my point was more directed at TL- as you stated I also think the RL was fine in looks. Nothing flashy but hard to buy that when you can pay similar for E class(thus the fail). The new rLx again looks fine but at that range it's tough when you look at comps- haven't seen a TLX yet and won't comment.
September 2014,"The TL I think did take a hit from bad styling. The RL though to me looks just fine. Certainly not exciting or edgy, but conservative and reasonably attractive. Definitely not ugly though. RL was too expensive though, which hurt."
September 2014,@ TLX talk- one thing that acura has been missing in sedans - more then anything is LOoks. You can talk about go fast spoilers or whatever BUT reason last TL failed - and make no mistake it did fail (along with RL) is looks.
September 2014,LOL that you even looked! haha.
September 2014,"GG, those are all the reasons it is attractive to me!"
September 2014,"AB.....from the reviews I've seen, the TLX is been rated from positive, to very positive. You're going to have the ""Fast and Furious"" crowd that laments the omission of ground effects, ""go fast"" spoilers, etc. They still want the ""blaaaaaat"" exhaust cans that you won't get on a TLX. Matter of fact, like a lot of upscale cars, there's no visible exhaust pipes at all on the TLX.I know it's early, but the numbers suggest Acura has a hit on their hands with. They want to sell 44K of them over 12 mos. They are on track to sell 50K to 60K (probably closer to 50K once the initial flurry slows down).Something for everyone....4 cyl with DCT, and all wheel steer or 6 cyl. with SH AWD if you want it. As good in the tech dept as anything else on the road, and probably better than most. Performance that's competitive. Value equation that is probably best in class.Plus, they're about darn near impossible to break, they last a long time, and they don't cost much to maintain or operate.That's a winner to me."
September 2014,Not according to my wife I don't.....
September 2014,hahaha
September 2014,Or you have better taste in music
September 2014,The most interesting thing about that photo is .... you're listening to Rihanna?I must be getting old.....
September 2014,Haven't seen a TLX in the wild and after a year finally found one of these....I don't care care what the reviews say acura needs a win- the ILX clearly isn't it - nor is this -
September 2014,"overall the in depth reviews seem to be positive. as always, especially with individual opinions, you will find people all over the spectrum. Always need to try for yourself!"
September 2014,"In fairness, I am seeing a number of non-professional drive reports from interested parties/potential buyers that are not at all positive, so that weighs heavily against it too. Could Acura have badly missed the mark?"
September 2014,And yet there is someone in another thread who would absolutely not consider the new TLX because of the commercial Acura created for it.
September 2014,"Yeah....probably right, Kirstie. Fact is, I was looking at my TL's value on my iPad the last time I got an oil change. My sales guy happens by, greets me, looks at my iPad to see I'm looking at trade value and invoice numbers on the TLX. He laughs and said, "".....TLX is too new for a GG type deal. I'll call you in 6 more months, though. We van hammer something then when the supply catches up with demand.""That put's us right after the New Year. They're really nice cars. Acura has done a nice job."
September 2014,"Maybe not here, here. In CCBA? I wouldn't be surprised if people were shopping in their sleep."
September 2014,"Doesn't everyone here do that? I'm not in the market, but find myself looking on my iPhone for pricing info anytime I take my car in for service."
September 2014,"Test Drove the S3 today. I like the light feeling A3/S3 chassis, but my general impression is that the S4 is the closest to perfect car for Audi. The S3 is just missing something. Well, it's missing several things or doing serveral things not quite right. I didn't get to really wring it out though as it had 5 miles worth of fuel and went to zero before the test drive was done. All new cars seem to have a ""break-in"" lower power period these days too. I want to test drive one with 1,500 miles on the clock already."

September 2014,"=====
The number of years before the literal elimination of manual transmissions even from some of the performance stalwarts is damn few. The number of years before the virtual elimination of manual transmissions is even fewer, and some would say that time has already arrived.
The truth (my truth, at this point) of the matter is that the 7-speed (and most of the German/European 8-speed versions) is (are) so good, I only miss shifting for sentimental reasons.
I don't think I ever was as capable (and certainly not as quick/fast) a shifter as the S-Tronic in my S4. And, the tuning of my wife's 8-speed in her SQ5 is very very close to that same ideal.
Sentimentality is a [non-permissible content removed]."
September 2014,"Got my S4 back today from the body shop, 4 trips total, 68 days total in the shop, and the car is looking and driving great. I think I finally got them to do it ""right."" Still not perfect mind you, but good work that should of been done the first time without repeated return trips to correct deficient work.
I just don't think they have enough ""skill"" in their work force Still, for my money I think the ""body shop"" in Ingoldstadt is superior and better. Audi proved to me they do tremendous quality control with this S4 at the factory. They obviously build them to appease guys like me that notice when gaps and panels are off by a MM or two.
This last visit was to correct inconsistent gaps with the front hood, lack of buffing/polishing on the front fender and front quarter/fender panels, and 2 bad paint edges at 2 locations on the hood (which was replaced).
I drove a new NON SH-AWD 6 cyl. TLX and wasn't impressed at all. The transmission is lazy, why'd they give the 4 cyl the better tranny? Why no exhaust? Why less HP than the outgoing TL SH-AWD? This is your Camry/Prius-like TLX.
Perhaps the SH-AWD is another animal? Admittedly, putting the transmission in sport or sport+ mode made it less lazy, but still lacking. I heard the dual clutch still has a torque converter. NO NO NO Acura... no no no.
Oh, and the moon roof cover is cardboard covered in vinyl.....compare it to the S4's and you'll believe me that the TLX is an overpriced Accord."
September 2014,"A seven speed manual would be interesting to compete on fuel economy with the 7 speed DSG/S-tronic. Gas is too expensive to entertain the thought of settling for the available 6-speed manual S4 which is still available (probably only by special order). Audi probably thinks the only people that'll order a manual will do so despite the mileage penalty, and there's so few they won't bother developing a 7 speed with 3 pedals."
September 2014,"If it doesn't have 3 pedals, it's an AUTOMATIC. Call it what you will, couch it in Teutonic techno-babble, whatever. You aren't fooling me.
Of course, sometimes I do wonder if some automakers made their shifters so clunky deliberately, to wean us off them?"

September 2014,"Another One Bites the Dust
This is gettin' serious now: ""Nissan Plans to Make Autonomous Driving Common by 2016""
-- Motor Trend, October 2014; Pg - 26
You know what Pogo said: ""We have met the enemy and he is us.""
Well ""us"" -- and we know who we are -- killed (or at least put it on its death-bed) the stick shift. Now, of course that's only partially true -- at least if you even a tiny bit agree that the DSG (aka PDK) dual clutch 'automatic manual' transmission is (and I hate to say this) equal to or better than the best manual transmissions ever made. But so few of ""us"" actually have these marvelous inventions -- and, I'll wager, the number of folks with the excellent 8-speed automatics available is also still somewhat small.
I can only sort of forgive YOU and hold my head up high with righteous indignation: Because god knows my wife and I did our parts to preserve the manual transmissions going so far as to custom order nearly 2-and-a-half-dozen German cars with stick shifts since 1977 (we finally quit this practice out of the sheer futility of the act when we realized that [most of] the rest of YOU -- overwhelmingly -- had given up on stick shifts years earlier). And, my wife was appalled to read some of lame excuses, most of them blaming ""the wife"" for her inability to pilot a car with a stick shift.
Of course, there is always that nagging feeling that the mobile phone also played a big part in killing the stick shift; even today it seems I don't have enough digits to count the number of cars I see being driven down the road with the driver holding a cell phone to his or her ear. So what? I forgot to mention the ""phones in the ear"" (thus requiring one free hand) I am counting are for the drivers' of cars that I know have Bluetooth! These drivers should be forced to ride the bus for one-full-year or pay a 5-figure fine (or both). This morning, in fact, I saw a woman (phone in ear) in a very young Maserati (with temp tags it was so new) pulling into Starbucks. I could only wonder if she was going to attempt to be on the phone and drink coffee all the while driving in rush hour traffic here in River City.
The point? Qwit yur complainin', for the Market has spoken.
But this latest outrage -- autonomous driving (by 2016 no less) -- is, some will say, both inevitable and welcome. Perhaps. It is also inevitable that we will -- eventually -- run out of fossil fuel. But we're talking decades and decades if you believe many of the scholarly studies from think tanks like the Rand Corporation to name one.
Mean time, WHO (among us) is asking for self-driving cars? I'd rather pay more taxes (and I can't believe I said that) if some of them could be earmarked for public transportation infrastructure improvements and additions. A one-person (or 4 person) public transportation vehicle (manifested in the form of a self-driving passenger vehicle), is not something I want to sign up for.
On the other hand, I do want driver aids: laser headlights, night-vision, ""city safety"", all around-view cameras, rear cross traffic alerts -- even automatic cruise control for those 100+ mile stints behind the wheel that are part of my weekly routine trips between Cincinnati and Columbus or Cincinnati and Louisville or Indianapolis.
I want a connected car (better even than that which is in my 2014 S4: ""Audi Connect""), but I still want to press the pedals (most of the time, anyway) and turn the steering wheel myself.
I am [now, happily] resigned to allowing my dual-clutch 7-speed automatic manual transmission to do the rowing for me, but I am far, far, far from wanting my car to drive itself. Indeed, I'm mostly sure I don't even want the thing to park itself, thank you very much.
The only good news in the Nissan announcements (if you can call it ""good"") is that Nissan claims they will NOT ELIMINATE the need for human interaction (like some competitors -- gulp).
""There is no need to sally forth, for it remains true that those things which make us human are, curiously enough, always close at hand. Resolve then, that on this very ground, with small flags waving and tinny blast on tiny trumpets, we shall meet the enemy, and not only may he be ours, he may be us.""
Drive it like you live -- but do drive it yourself."
September 2014,"My son attended the Teen School at the BMW Performance Center as well as Street Survival. While he's driving an X3 at present, he has made it clear that his next car has to be suitable to take to BMW CCA HPDEs. He's leaning towards a ZHP or maybe a GTI Performance Pack.
Also under consideration in an E36 M3- a good choice as it has a true LSD and no overly intrusive electronic nannies(my 1975 2002 spoiled him with respect to an unadulterated driving experience)."

I've literally LOVED every second behind the wheel of my 2011 328xi. The lease is up on 9/22 & I've decided to go a different, less expensive route. Today I put a deposit on a 2015 Subaru Legacy. I'll still be here lurking as a former and hopefully future owner of one of these fine sedans."

No awd with the 4.....Some wished they had a manual, even thou Acura killed it(rightfully so..look at the sales numbers.) This on paper looks like a nice car but if you don't go Awd it seems you could prob find more sport elsewhere- (my opinion ) That being said the written reviews have been positive.

September 2014,"Mark....I wish I could be as eloquent with thoughts and words as you are.

September 2014,"If it makes you feel better, both my kids (23 YO son and 18 YO daughter) are obsessed with getting new cars."
September 2014,"When I pulled up to the sidewalk and parked in the No Parking zone, the boys’ bicycles were on their kick stands under the porte cochère at the back of the public library where the night drop off for books and, in my case, DVD’s is located. The library wouldn’t be open for more than an hour, so I assumed the boys were just there to get out of the hot morning sun. I put the DVD’s into the slot, nodded at the boys and turned around heading back to my idling car. Just about when I got to the driver’s door, one of the boys said “How much did that [car] cost?” I replied, “How much do you think?” The young man and his friend yelled back in unison, “A lot!” I told them it cost about $57,000, and I heard oo’s and ah’s in response. I drove off, giving them a quick honk and a wave.
What’s the point?
The point is, I’ve been thinking, saying and writing about what I assumed is the pending death of the automobile as most of us here know and love it. I’ve been of that opinion because it seems to me that virtually anyone under the age of 35 (or maybe under-30) seems as if they could care less about cars beyond them being appliances or means to get from point-to-point. These “young people” wouldn’t or couldn’t talk about cars if you threatened them with pain and death, and wouldn’t even bother to feign interest to win the new not-yet-released iPhone 6, so little interest do these folks seem to have in cars. These two young men gave me hope!
Now, I’ll bet when you and I were in our formative (‘tween through teen-age) years, we had but several topics we cared to opine about: Cars, Girls [or boys] and Sex. I my case, I was a budding audiophile, too, which kind of rounded out the whole emerging nerd stereotype. Had there been personal computers (of any stripe) or video games available (it was the early to mid-60’s and such tech had not yet been introduced to the mainstream market), I most certainly would’ve been into them; but instead I was into “stereo” in addition to cars, girls and sex (talking about sex, not actually having it, of course).
So when I was with my buds, the topic was often the “cars we were gonna be driving” as soon as we turned 16. We were dreamers, of course – we, then, were the kids sitting at the library entrance (where else?) watching the guy drive up in his new 1965 Bonneville pillar-less four-door painted in dark blue metallic with a ton of chrome accents and shiny chrome hub-caps and big ol’ tires (white walls, of course).
“Hey mister, how much did that thing cost?” The reply, at the time, was “About $4,000,” and of course we then obliged by making the same oo and ah sounds like the ones I heard the other morning.
My overarching point to this erudite group of auto enthusiasts here at Edmunds is that I believe we are pretty much smitten with cars and everything to do with them – but that we’re also mostly predisposed to acquire one of these Premium (or near-premium) Class cars based on history, loyalty or perhaps even looks. I would submit if you’ve had more than one representative of the same brand (back to back), that your next car is perhaps pre-ordained to come from that manufacturer. Loyalty to a brand is – along with several other characteristics – another sign that you are passionate about cars. You’ve come to identify yourself with BMW’s (a quite common occurrence here in Cincinnati) – you are a “BMW guy”. My friend, now President of his second software company had an Acura when I met him. In our times in the car often driving from Cincinnati to Chicago or to Bowling Green (KY), he would go on and on about what I’m convinced must be the best car in the world – at least he certainly thought so: the BMW M5. This guy was about 10-years my junior.
Thankfully he didn’t have to keep the Acura long – so less than a year after I met him he leased his first (of many) BMW’s – a 3-series. Followed by a 5, then a 7 then one of the “Z” car convertibles (he called that one Penis).
I submit that most of us here are (or want to be) “XXX” guys (intended to be gender neutral, don’t you know). You’re a Mercedes maven, you’re a BMW bigot and I’m an Audi aficionado. No matter what “empirical” data is brought to bear, you’re sure your new IS 350 F-Sport is superior to that guy’s BMW 328 – after all, Car & Driver says so; and, you just know you can run circles around the Bimmer’s 4-cylinder, turbo and all.
So it is with the foreknowledge that no matter how much evidence I can produce to the contrary, you will remain steadfast that your own sagacity has been validated and put on display for all to see by your choice of the latest and greatest Volvo S60 (or whatever).
So where does that leave us?
With hope, I hope.
The upcoming generation still needs to ratchet up their passion for all things automotive – or we could be doomed to forever being but passengers in our autonomous vehicles. But, I think there is some evidence, not much, but a little, that there are kids who are just as interested in cars as they are video games, social media (and, hopefully, sex).
There may be some hope, too, that those of “us” who may not as of yet yet been inculcated by a Brand of automobile, may find our personal automotive archetype and to coin a phrase, “Live long and prosper.”
I’ll close by saying this: While I still remain convinced that the Audi S4 is the best representative of the Entry-level Luxury Performance Sedan (and for the money it damn well ought to be), I must say, after having visited the Acura dealer to “See what’s new,” that the new TLX SH-AWD in Advance trim (the one with the 6-cylinder), ought to be this category’s leader if “price” (MSRP) is factored in. If you haven’t checked out this exact configuration (I can’t offer the same praise for the lesser TLX’s), I urge you to do so before you spend one dime on a new ELLPS car – this thing (the 2015, to be clear) is IMPRESSIVE!

September 2014,"Sneak peak at the new 1 series. Going to be interesting to see bmw takes on the other German who launched early.

September 2014,Just read that Infiniti is going to bring back hydraulic steering to the Q50s because so many complaints about electric assist. Wonder if anyone would consider it?
August 2014,I'm surprised you can't find an attorney to take the case. In most states the insurance bad faith statutes provide for recovery of attorney's fees.
August 2014,"They may offer an arbitration. If so, you and your appraiser should be VERY careful whom you choose--in most cases, do not accept the arbitrator offered by the insurance company. Corruption is rife in this business."
August 2014,"Andres....man, that really is a hassle. I know I'd be steamed, as I'm sure you are.
Sounds like you have enough evidence right now to take them to small claims court. Expect them to ask for a delay. Get them on the 2nd trip. Should be done with a check in hand within 60 days."
August 2014,"Next time someone hits me my neck and back is going to hurt a lot.
The insurance industry at times have created business to help those who are bring screwed by them... Most of the time if you have enough proof of ""bad faith"" and file a law suit in small claims court, the insurance company will pay up, the last thing they want to do is go in front of a judge and explain to them why they haven't paid the claim."
August 2014,"I finally stopped being cheap and hired the collision claims consultants that were recommended to me for a professional unbiased independent diminished value appraisal that finally happened mid-August. It refutes the DV appraisal Mercury (at fault insured's company) paid for where they claimed my car sustained no structural damage (what about pulling an upper right rail isn't structural)? claimed it could be a certified used Audi still (no dealer I talked to seems eager to Certify a $22K+ repair billed S4. Car Max saw bolts spun on the hood and fender and that was enough for them to only offer wholesale price at $37K. They claimed they'd wholesale it, but part of me thinks they'd turn around and list it for $10K more at $47K.
Based on their ""outside the ballpark of reality"" DV report, Mercury only offered $1K for DV. They upped it to 1.5K in a fake attempt to settle the claim.
I've now sent my demand based on a ""REAL"" report that seems to be in the ball park of reality at $8850 DV amount. Plus the $445 fee and the $2,400 for rental car and insurance deductible expenses. I know they only have a $10K pot to pay out, so I'll settle for $10K total. They just want to delay this claim forever, and their tactics to frustrate me worked. I should of hired this DV Appraisal company from the beginning; I was wasting time without their help.
I now have 20 boiler plate letters to refute the predictable excuses and false claims/reasons they can't pay my demand. It's kind of hilarious the letters I received answer and refute some of the BS reasons I've already been given.
Each letter gives them 15 days to respond in writing which is more than reasonable. I predict they will offer to split the difference between their $1K DV report and my 8.8K DV report. One of the 20 letters is ready to go on that excuse. Their report is just so inaccurate, and the CarMax appraisal will help show that if need be.
Could take 4 to 5 more letters going back and forth before I get paid, or worst case scenario, I have to take them to small claims court for $10K. The thing is these letters help build a ""bad faith lawsuit/claim"" if they refuse to pay up, so maybe a lawyer would take my case at that point. No lawyers seemed interested in talking to me over a potential $15K property damage claim.
Next time someone hits me my neck and back is going to hurt a lot."
August 2014,"I was wondering and doing a search on the nissan A35. Seems like Nissan has forgotten its roots. Maybe turbo 4 / 300hp awd,or diesel awd with stick option would be cool- but I'm dreaming. Looks like 2016 for those who care.  A35=maxima for those not up on car codes."
August 2014,I am surprised that they have brought over oil burner myself. Wondering if they are waiting for mid year release or MY 16. I think the currently 2.1l d is too much for the C class..

August 2014,What been the outcome in getting the insurance company to give you diminished value on your car?
August 2014,@andres3‌ - I think the back up camera plus beeping things are a great help in my s4 - but the camera and the beeps are just an aid in backing up. Sorry to hear about the friends situation but hard to blame a camera for user error. To each is own on optioning a car but cameras should and will be standard on all cars- fact is they help and the govt has taken notice and I'm sure insurance companies are going to be happier too.
August 2014,"I think the back up camera and the Navigation are tied together with the Audi S4, so it's like $3K to get the two features. NO thank you. I know a guy with a 2011 S4 and he was using his back up camera while backing up and it caused him to wreck his side mirror housing on the right side. The problem is the screen doesn't show your sides, only the rear.
I forced my insurance to replace the aluminum side mirror housing due to a chip from my accident in March. I now know why they ignored the small chip originally, as the part is $500 and nearly $600 installed.
My money was better spent getting the 3.0T, the S-Tronic DSG, the Sport Diff, and the Nappa Leather than on Navigation or backup cameras.
Some people don't want to spend $50K, let alone MORE THAN $50K to get a great vehicle.
P.S. You have to turn off the ESC to use launch control."
August 2014,Nice write up Andy; it's good to remember it's about driving- not leather upholstered electronic gadget dens...
August 2014,"Our Epic ELLPC Road Trip
My wife and I recently completed an extensive motor tour of the Intermountain West in our 2001 BMW 330 Ci Cabriolet. Sometimes in this topic we lose sight of the fact that these cars aren't just about high tech features and luxury appointments, they're about enjoying driving . I thought I'd give you some impressions about what it's like to take one of these ELLP cars on an extensive road trip.
I'm not going to give you a travelogue of what we saw and did but talk about the journey, which, if you love to drive, is as important as the destinations. I'm well aware that the convertible version of the Three Series isn't the sort of vehicle most would choose for such a trip, in fact the default choice for such long-distance touring is a motor home/RV or Fifth-wheel trailer. I understand the appeal of such vehicles but pros get paid good money for driving large heavy vehicles because driving them is a chore, at least IMO.
If you love driving and haven't driven in the Far West you should put it on your bucket list. You can really drive out there, speed limits are high and traffic enforcement is light. The roads (with some notable exceptions*) are in beautiful shape and even the Interstates have dramatic curves, steep grades (up to 7%!) and the most spectacular scenery you'll see anywhere.
Our 14 year old Bimmer performed beautifully without any problems other than a healthy appetite for 91 Octane (we averaged 28 MPG) and took to the highway as an autobahn-bred car should. We always had more than enough power and brakes to handle anything and the sublime steering made every mile a pleasure.
The major drawback of course was the small size, it wouldn't be suitable for more than two on such a long trip. We took advantage of the feature that allows one to flip away the recess where the top goes when it's down which greatly increased luggage space but robbed us of the ability to cruise topless until had we offloaded the bags. I've been a convertible guy for a long time but I wouldn't care to go more than two or three hours w the top lowered anyway. Thanks to the well-designed top, the Three-er Cabrio makes a very nice Grand Touring coupe w the top in place
.
After 20 days, 4500 miles and 8 states (AZ/UT/ID/OR/MT/WY/NV) we arrived home tired but satisfied after a great drive in a wonderful car.
*Western roads are generally in fine shape with a couple of notable exceptions (mostly in Montana and I-40 in Western AZ is surprisingly bad give the state's rep for good roads) but they are littered with ""Road Alligators"", shreds of truck tires, one of which tore up the lower front grille and left side fog light. This is surprising in light of the proliferation of truck inspection stations. Don't they ever notice that the tires on these big rigs are crap?"
August 2014,"I think virtually the entire in-car ""avionics"" or ""carvionics"" should be able to be updated by BlueTooth streaming from (why not) a smart phone. New features and functions could be loaded into the dash's brain just like an app can be downloaded into your smartphone.
Certain things, I'm sure, would require hardware upgrades, but heck, make everything a module (as if it isn't already in a lot of cases) that could be plucked out like a radio head unit and replaced with new technology. And, why not make things at least one, if not more generations backwardly compatible (with some loss of functionality).
Right now I want to update (replace actually) that piece of crap Audi Connect ""hardware"" that apparently, forces me to have but ONE choice, other than to go without -- T-Mobile. I go less than 5 miles and the connection drops to 2G, which totally kills Google Maps and the eye in the sky-view on the screen. Even 3G isn't all that great.
Yet, right there, on the showroom floor is an A3 with 4G LTE -- which is pretty much like being there (and the carrier is AT&T which works about 98% of the time compared with T-Mobile's 70% of the time.) There must be a ""module"" under the dash that is nothing more than a ""smart phone"" without the phone case.
Or, why not allow the ""phone"" to be ""unlocked"" and allow, via software, me to use another, more reliable carrier.
Heck, for all I know T-Mobile is great (just not in Ohio), elsewhere.
Update-able tech, that's what's next -- or at least it should be. Of course, I think EVERYTHING should be standard on the car as it comes from the factory. Then, if you want the option, you pay for it -- you don't get rid of the car. This could even be done for many engine performance enhancements -- base cars comes with 200HP and 200 ft/lbs of torque. Pay the man (the dealer) to turn on the next level up the performance ladder and the engine now cranks out 250HP and 275 ft/lbs., etc etc.
I'm not suggesting a basic BMW 3-series come to market equipped with a software hobbled M3 powerplant -- awaiting someone to pay for the upgrade to have the secret code entered. More like what IBM does with some of their hardware that can be upgraded for the end of month processing -- for a fee and then returned to normal for the routine daily processing of data."
August 2014,"Take a look here: https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/
You can see that the touchscreen in car shows the phone icons. And the screen in the car also display the Apple Maps & turn-by-turn directions.
Looks like it is up to car manufacturers to integrate car play in the car. For 2014 the list includes Ferrari, Honda, Hundai, MB and Volvo. Others are listed in future."
August 2014,"Here's the latest on Apple's ""CarPlay"" (Siri integration).
http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/apple-carplay.html
Still trying to figure out how this will work.
Via Bluetooth, I can already use my iPhone's phone functions. I can also get the spoken Buetooth directions through the TL's sound system via maps. I can ask Siri questions and get answers via Siri connected to bluetooth.
So, if they're planning even more integration (say, just having a screen where an iPhone displays it's maps and bluetooth where the directions can be heard), I'm thinking onboard Nav systems may be a thing of the past."
August 2014,"Yeah, that would be cool. I have heard rumors that Apple has been working on tighter integration with phone in the car. Hopefully we see that happen sooner than later..."
August 2014,"I do the same. Google maps and OK Google ... It's great and I'm not going back. Same with a back up camera by the way. It's a must for me now.
I just wish they would let bluetooth stream the map/route to the cars screen so I wouldn't have the need for that suction cup thing on my dash to hold my phone."
August 2014,"@‌robr2 Like everything in mass this will be slow - as this is a 2012 announcement, and they have not marketed an app or website. tsure they have signs everywhere and they do have real time traffic to certain exits on highways but this does not help in planning a trip. So it's great when you are already sitting in traffic and it tells you it's 30 mins to go another 10 miles,   WaZe uses users speed and not just interactions - but the interactions are what make it better- ""Police Ahead"" helps and will never be integrated with MassDot"
August 2014,"Only twice, but It's one of the tracks I get invited to. My next stop is the new track at the Corvette Museum in Bowling Green KY."
August 2014,"Mass DOT has implemented a system similar to Waze on major highways. Starting in 2012, the state set up Bluetooth readers and message boards. It's called Go Time. They anonymously read Bluetooth devices in your car and measure when you get to other readers to estimate how much time it is between set points. That information is sent to the message boards and to an app called RTTM.
And it does all that without any interaction from the user or Waze's silly icons.
One can use the message boards to plan your drive or check the RTTM app on your phone. I'd like to see something like this expanded to nav systems."
August 2014,"Yeah, I had that in my previous BMW and used that quite a bit. Even though its Google Maps, doesn't look like they get updated automatically like they do on the phone. Still Send to Car option is convenient.
This time I want without a navi and am glad I did. Now I like it so much that when I drive my Acura with built in navi, I still use the navi on my phone.

@sweendogy said:
Nav discussion - interesting - I have had nav on both the g and now the audi- the g's touch screen and interface better - audi crisper (it's 7 yrs newer, dah!) and has the google integration - BUT I still use my phone more then factory- to all I recomend an app called WaZe.

I will have to give WaZe a try. Looks like Google is incorporating their technology in Google Maps as I have found it's route and traffic info to be quite accurate, even for smaller streets."
August 2014,"Mark....I think we all are in the same boat. We like cars so much, we'll test drive them....well, just because. Plus, I'm lucky enough to be on enough car lists that the manufacturers seem to be sending me $25-$50-$100 gift cards just to stop in their dealerships. I oblige them.
The inherent risk (and the dealers who know me, know this) is that I fall in love with something. Before you know it, out comes the check book. So, I try to temper what I drive, and when. If property taxes are due, that's a good time to test drive. I'm less likely to pull out the checkbook (which would be severely depleted at that time.
I did look at the new '15 C300 at my nearby Benz dealer. My sister bought a car there ('14 C350). Nice interior. Dealer wanted to go for a spin. I said ""no"". Pretty inside. But, $50K? For a relatively mundane 4 cyl with middling power? Can't see it, at least not on my watch.
RB....do you go to Mid-Ohio much?"
August 2014,"I have 8 days left- spread out over the next 4 months and then I can consider myself fully retired. Like you, I will probably pick up a part-time job, if only to allow me to pour more money into my HPDE fund. Every year I get 10 or more invitations to instruct at tracks all over the southeast and the only things that keep me from accepting most of them is time-which will no longer be an issue-and money(for brakes, tires, motels, etc.)."
August 2014,"Nav discussion - interesting - I have had nav on both the g and now the audi- the g's touch screen and interface better - audi crisper (it's 7 yrs newer, dah!) and has the google integration - BUT I still use my phone more then factory- to all I recomend an app called WaZe. They were recently bought by google (a yr ago)- it uses real time driver info from users and the reporting is via users. Gives info on traffic, weather, potholes and best of all Cop locations. It reroutes on the fly- like if there is an accident 2 exits away it will tell me to get off and take service streets - wicked smart. As I sit here there are 7500 users near by with 2300 reports this am, and 50 million worldwide users according to forbes."
August 2014,"Now I'm not too sure how Audi or MB does it, but BMW uses Google Maps. In Google Maps on-line you can save the route you choose and have it sent to your BMW (car has to have Navi and BMW assist), it's a pretty slick system they have, you can set it up to go from Point A to B to C to D if you like. The dealer has shown Rick this since it will help him with clients showing multi houses."
August 2014,"Kind of you to ask.
I am at the other end of the entrepreneur scale from you. In a previous life I was self-employed (owner-operator driving a KW), but for the 30+ years since I've been working for ""the man"" in the form of an international conglomerate. I balance my 401K once or twice a year and my finances look pretty good, compared to the high-flyers over the years.
I enjoy driving more than I do cars (in the art form, keep them polished but never dirve them sense), and my work allows me to do so, at their expense.
I could have retired three years ago and continued to draw as much money as I do now, but I've chosen to continue to work. This puts more into the 401(K), as opposed to taking it out, and keeps me entertained. There's nothing quite like working in an environment in which I could quit at any time, and the supervision knows it."
August 2014,I tried using the maps on my iPhone but couldn't figure out how to use it. Call me Luddite.
August 2014,"I use Navi too - but not the factory installed as they get outdated and are not as good as Google Maps. Google Maps on my Android device automatically picks the best route for me out of the possible 3 options I have to work based on the traffic conditions. And it keeps recomputing in realtime as I am driving. It tells me if alternate routes will be X minutes faster or slower. Maps are always up-to-date. It has information of road closures, accidents, everything I need.
And since it is on my phone or my computer (same Google maps), I can lookup the route beforehand to plan ahead and I see the same route in my car.
With Ok Google Now, I rarely need to type in the address or destination. The voice recognition is pretty good and I can lookup and navigate to addresses and destinations.
The phone connects via Bluetooth so all the voice turn-by-turn directions are played via the car speaker system. If I have music playing (again via bluetooth audio), it will pause the music to speak out the directions.
And all of this is Free.
I don't think I can every go back to factory installed navi."
August 2014,"This is a big tent, we do have room for Neo-Luddites -- and smart alecs (like me).
I must have something wrong with me -- for I use my nav system every day, every single day. I leave for work in the AM and I punch up my nav system, set the scale to 4 miles, which is enough to capture two Interstate highways that I may have to travel.
Wait 5 seconds.
The screen paints a series of red, yellow or green outlines along either the north/south or east/west route that I must travel to get from sub-urban Cincinnati to the CBD (where I need to be). If I see too much red painted on the Interstates (275 or 71), I know things are gonna be s=l=o=w so I take a secondary road route -- and I often try multiple routes and ask the navi lady to help me.
I also ask the system to give me an approximate arrival time.
Hell, I play with all this stuff and wish there was more tech to assist me in my journey.
To each his / her own -- but the thing is, increasingly, the buyers of ELLPS's and LPS's take for granted that their vehicles will come with nav and a lot of other driver aids.
I was in a meeting in Lexington KY (80 miles south of Cincinnati) the other day -- we were discussing an upcoming meeting and the client made the assumption that I would just input the address into the car's nav system (he knew not anything about my car), so he didn't give me directions, he just gave me the street and number of the destination to plug into my nav.
A Garmin certainly works fine, folks often say they are superior to the factory systems (other than not being integrated with the rest of the car's ""avionics"".) It is just a preference (of mine) to have everything built in.
Hence my frequent close: Drive it like YOU live. I submit, however, that all of this tech will soon, soon, soon be standard and that there will be a bunch of new tech none of us have even imagined, yet.
Besides, I wouldn't pull over and ask for directions or attempt to use a map, if threatened with pain and death."
August 2014,Navi is just not a big deal to me. I so rarely use it that my garmin is more than enough. Plus my wife can program while we are moving!
August 2014,"Biz (software sales and services) has, in 2014, improved greatly. But it's still not back to the good old days, and you cdnpinhead?
The light at the end of the tunnel now appears NOT to be an on-coming train!
Woo Woo.
Back to cars!
Adding a backup camera would cost something, sure, I get THAT -- but the cost would be passed on to the consumer and probably with at least a penny profit.
I know it may sound like blasphemy, but I'm really curious about the new 2015 Genesis 4-door sedan. Priced here in the ELLPS pack, certainly doing a great cover as an ELLPS (wishing they were, I assume, an LPS, which won't be too much of a stretch over the next few years, I'd imagine).
If I thought I could count on any of y'all to start mass quantities of test-drives, I'd pass on doing that, at this time.
My wife and I must be outliers -- test driving is a serious hobby for us; and it is free, and about every 36 months we drop about $100K or more on a couple of new cars, and the dealer group we use to take our test drive adventures knows it, so there's always a willingness to let us go out and explore.
Seems like a decent number of folks here probably do the same thing in terms of being in the market -- but y'all (and I grant I could be wrong) don't seem to be taking out the latest and greatest to see what's what.
Think of it this way -- a new restaurant comes to town; I'm assuming most (51%) folks here eat out -- A LOT -- well you probably give the new eatery a go. The characteristics of the ELLPS and LPS ""buyers"" is (I've assumed with the data points y'all share here) would seem to indicate you're -- most of you anyway -- auto mavens (experts or connoisseurs). You like to ""dine"" (drive) the new restaurant (auto). True dat?
I also assume y'all subscribe to at least two of the ""big"" car magazines and devour them both in print and on-line.
Well the challenge I'll throw out -- and there is no prize for winning -- is to get into the new cars and drive them, then sign on here and tell us a story, whet our appetites for all things automotive (or at least ELLPS and/or near-LPS). Make the others here -- force or compel the rest of us -- HAVE to take out the car you drove to experience it for yourselves.
Even if it's not an Audi."
August 2014,"It's quite clear that Mark's business fortunes are looking up.
It's a good thing -- things got quite quiet for a number of years around here."
August 2014,"Mark...there was some auto company (probably more than one) who probably protested, stating how difficult and costly a back up camera would be to integrate into all of them, rendering their models uncompetitive price wise. Or, that their so called research stated the public didn't want back up cameras.
So, NATSB probably said...OK, we'll give you 4 years.
Sounds familiar....we heard that about airbags a couple of decades ago, too."
August 2014,2018?! what a joke!
August 2014,"Yes. The requirement was supposed to be implemented by 2011. But the DOT filed for extensions - presumably on the behest of industry. Now all vehicles under 10,000 lbs. built after May 1, 2018 must be equipped with a back up camera."
August 2014,"Most of the technologies that surprise and sometimes shock me for coming to the party so late are very inexpensive (and have been for some time).
I can actually understand why ABS took a long time to ""trickle"" down. But, according to so many ""experts"" the single most valuable technology to come along is/was the electronic stability program (ESP) -- or just stability control. Once ABS is in place (my first car with it was built in 1986) adding ESP is relatively inexpensive. Yet it took perhaps 15 years to get it into ""mainstream"" cars even though it had been proven to be a life saver and a money saver since it was almost magical in its ability to help a driver avoid an unwanted crash (as if there are ""wanted"" crashes, eh?).
Same with the backup camera -- cheap to implement and very valuable.
Wait a minute, now I remember my dealer telling me that ESP was a $550 option for a couple of years on Audi products and that sunroofs were $1,250 (and not actually used that much), but that people would almost always opt for the sunroof they'd use twice a year and omit the ESP charge proclaiming ""It's just an electronic nanny, I don't need it.""
In short, @m6user and @flightnurse: Point taken!
?'s
Has Congress finally passed the ""mandatory"" back-up camera bill they've been promising?
Oh, btw, I do see an abundance of folks driving cars (that I know have bluetooth) with phones pressed against their heads, all while driving one-handed or with their heads cocked to keep the phone from falling. Why wouldn't you use bluetooth if you had it?
Inquiring, confused minds want to know."
August 2014,"It's two-fold. First, it's safer to navigate the Pandora app through the vehicle's infotainment center than it is to try and control it through your phone. Voice controls and steering wheel controls reduce the need to pick up the phone to use Pandora. Second, it's a marketing push. With Pandora in the infotainment system like Sirius/XM and terrestrial radio, you are more prone to use it which shows greater users/ratings and allowing them to sell higher priced advertising.
I have Pandora on my phone and never use it in the car. It's too much of a pain to use the phone while driving a stick shift in the city."
August 2014,"I could not agree more, with all the car's I rent I find it interesting that some ""features"" that are in the Altima, Accord, 300's and now the new 200 (just rented my first MY 2015) you can't get in the 50K cars. Not too sure why these cars have a Pandora app built into the radio, when you can stream it through bluetooth from your phone. Regarding bluetooth my 2005 330i had it but was very basic and it was only for the phone."
August 2014,"Why so shocked that a $50k car had something well before it became standard in a $18k car? Isn't that part of the reason luxury cars cost so much more.....cutting edge tech, quality materials and driving experience? I think the Civic had bluetooth available for some time but now it is standard. Hence the commercial."
August 2014,"Personal Preference Speaking Here:
I do I do I do really like the A6 family (espcially the S6) -- the current A6 is, IMNSHO, a looker from the outside and MOSTLY on the inside.
A few years ago, pre-widespread implementation of nav systems in the LPS and ELLPS classes, Pioneer electronics offered a replacement head-unit for many cars, Audi being among them.
The thing looked pretty standard, seemed to fit in nicely with the rest of the car (this was back in the days when Audi cars came with Blaupunkt head-unit systems), at least as nicely as the Audi OEM units.
The Pioneer solution included sat nav. The way it worked was to seemingly eject a rectangular panel horizontally and then articulate the panel (the screen), by 90 degrees.
At the time, I thought, ""Gawd that looks soo after-market"" -- they (meaning Audi) need to inegrate the navi screen into the dash, not copy this fugly looking contraption. Once Audi abandoned the very small navi screen between the tach and speedo and went with a 7"" widescreen aspect ratio built into the dash, I thought we'd taken a big step forward in interior design.
BTW, why buy one of these $50K cars without navi, etc and smack a Tom Tom or Garmin unit onto a patch of Velcro every-time you get in the car? Or even more inexplicable, why buy one of these high-buck cars without nav and then spend a king or queen's ransom to retro-fit the OEM nav system (literally for double the cost of getting it on the car in the first place)?
Virtually all the car-buff magazines agreed -- for years and years -- ""No one does interiors better than Audi.""
I got my 2005 A6 with all options, meaning the built in screen was present and accounted for, acting as my navi screen, as well as radio screen, telephone screen, etc etc etc.
As an aside -- I've had BlueTooth for 10+ years and I saw a Honda commercial last night on TV where you'da thunk the new 2015 Honda Civic ""now with bluetooth"" was making some cutting edge revelation. What's that about? I mean, seriously, I've had bluetooth for over 10-years and it is being touted as some great new feature that should make you want to consider a new Honda ""as if"" the thing is a leader in Automotive Electronics.
My 2009 A4 had an upgraded and improved version of the 2005 A6 dash and, of course, added a back-up camera (which didn't come to the A6 until the 2006 model year). Don't get me started again on Honda's cutting-edge inclusion of a back up camera on a 2015 car ""as if"" it was the second coming!
Then, I start looking at the new A6's that came into the showroom in 2012 and they had that damn Pioneer aftermarket screen protruding out and up EVERY time you started the car. The salesperson says ""OK, if you don't like it, you can push a button to keep it hidden."" Sure you can, but you'll miss radio info, telephone info and also other key information that is displayed and is to be acted upon from time to time -- so, you can't really keep that stick-em-up screen hidden since it is one of your key components for management of some of the cars systems.
That damn pop-up aftermarket looking thing was/is one of my pet peeves about the then (2012) current CTS -- but at least Cadillac had some of the data visible when the screen was in its retracted position.
It looks even worse on the A3, since the dash is soo plain (barren from the middle to the passenger side, really.)
The Macan, TODAY, has taken over for the best NEW dash, if you axe me. Audi needs to get rid of that protuberance in the A6 and A3 right away, like NOW. The A4 and A5 (for 2015) dash may be a bit dated, but it is crisp and clean compared to what seems to pass these days as modernistic. Audi, look at the Macan's dash from the perspective of a front seat occupant -- that should be YOUR dash-look.
""You cursed brat! Look what you've done! I'm melting! melting! Oh, what a world! What a world ...""

What time is it now? Oh who cares -- it must be 5 o'clock SOMEWHERE.
Anyone care to join me?
Cheers and beers."
August 2014,yeah the S3 - the car you have been talking about above- sorry for the typo
August 2014,"Wondering if it was supposed to be S3, not S4."
August 2014,"$45K?
Looks like the S4 MSRP starts @ $48,400?"
August 2014,"I just went back to audiusa to price the s4 out- I think for 45k you can get a hell of a machine- b&o sound (a must) and nav pack plus I would need to get better color body and spring for the German color charge. All other items are nice but not needed. The bmw 328 and ""el cheapo"" 320 should bring the bang soon with more power, and I'm sure they will. The Japanese need to also act quick- as Americans will follow the German badge to sudo lux unless they are offered more. Interesting stuff"
August 2014,"Yep, it's the association of Geely and Volvo, not Audi. No tachycardia intended ."
August 2014,"Yikes!
Why in the wide wide world of sports are you talking about Geely and Audi in the same breath?
I do like Volvos -- but what is the relationship between Geely and Audi?
Say it ain't so."
August 2014,"Just had the 15,000 mile service on my '14 S4 S-Tronic. While in, I also had the tires rotated and was comp'd a set of $69 wiper-blades, causing the computer to spit out the admonition that these freebies were a one-time deal. The service manager's good will was somewhat offset by the wag of the computer's finger.
I had no expectation of free wipers, but appreciate them, since I replace them every 15K as a matter of routine.
Typical to the Audi powerplants, I am now enjoying the 10,000+ mile break in surge of power. The engine that keeps on giving now even shows 30 or more MPG's from time-to-time, beating my 2009 2.0T A4 (which had the 6-speed Tiptronic.)
After driving the S6 recently, I am still smitten -- were $'s no object. But, if you're considering a $55K+ ELLPS, you owe it to yourself to drive one of these -- other's may come close, but -- for the money -- this is THE one to beat. Of course this is certified, 100% bias-free fact based commentary.
Couple of program notes if you get serious about a 2015 S4:
If leasing go Premium+
If buying at least consider Prestige
Get the full-leather seating
Get the B&O sound-system
Get MMI Plus
Get Audi-side assist
Consider Audi-sport differential if you ever like to really carve into curves
Debate the merits of sticking with the 18"" wheels -- even they come with 40Series tires -- ride improves, tires cost less, last longer -- and if you axe me, the OEM tires aren't the best anyway, so you'll want to consider replacing them. Of course the 19"" wheels sure are purty.
The trim on the dash, doors etc, can be had in 3 flavors, look at examples of each, then decide.
Paint is expensive -- if on a budget (what am I saying) get one of the free colors.
The video reviews and Motor Trend says 0-60 4.4 sec. The S3 may equal it, but there are several reviews all over the web that claim the S4 is quciker than Audis published claims.
The Audi Connect is 3G -- it sucks (if it is T-Mobile) -- great concept, crappy execution.
Objectively  this is the best you can get, if you don't want to spend more.
If you want something for less $ that will satisfy your needs for speeds, etc, consider the Acura TLX V6 w/SH-AWD and in Advance trim -- consider it a bargain S4, sort of.
And: drive it like you live.
Remember, this post is certified 100% objective, there are no opinions, zero, zilch, nada in this utterance."
August 2014,"I'm definitely not a ""read tester""- the type who provide ""expert"" opinions on cars they haven't even sat in, so I relate the following with the understanding that I haven't driven either car.
I was thumbing through the June 2013 copy of the British magazine CAR and it contained a very positive review of the new S3. That review was followed by a comparison of the S3 to the Mk7 GTI with the Performance Pack(an extra 10 hp, better brakes, and an electronically controlled mechanical limited slip diff). The same guy(Ben Pulman) wrote both articles and he concluded that aside from the S3 being @1.5 seconds quicker in the 0-62 mph sprint, the GTI was essentially the equal of the S3 in all but the worst road conditions. Given the price differential, he would ""...take the GTI every time.""
In my case, it's rather academic, as I already have a FWD hot hatch with a true limited slip for semi-pro levels of hooning and I'm not at all interested in an AWD track toy, but I still found the articles to be illuminating."

August 2014,"Sticker - not sure, [ it was not on the window, they typically remove & laminate them! ] but without the 19"" wheels & Mag Ride pkg nor the 'Daytona 1 Pkg' [ that includes the 19s + special paint ], and I do not believe it had the B&O audio, but did have the MMI Nav @ $2,600 - and I think the Driver Assist @ $1,400 - so my guess is approx. $46K, including $895 Dest.
The one in the showroom had the Daytona 1, Nav, Driver Assist & a few port installed accessories = $49,765.
My current [ hypothetical] configuration is - + Driver Assist only = $43.4K.

Will certainly drive again, when I have a bit more time . . ."
August 2014,Thanks for review
August 2014,"Thanks, Ray!"
August 2014,"Ray, what was the sticker on the S3 you sampled?"
August 2014,"This S3 checks most of the important boxes for me.
Car: 2015 S3, black on black, base suspension & 18” wheels / tires.
The TQ is everpresent and always available – offering instant thrust any time, even in higher gears. One of my top ‘requirements’. [ I am a Torque Addict. ] The 2.0L 4 cylinder [ highly boosted ] engine feels and sounds much smoother than the [ not nearly as highly boosted ] 2.0L in my 2013 GTI. Sounds, and feels and pulls ‘expensive’. Pulled cleanly and smoothly from low RPM and sounded eager to run all the way to the red line. I believe the C+D 12.9 sec. quarter mile result.
[ Horsepower 292 @ 5,400–6,200 rpm
Torque 280 lb-ft @ 1,900–5,300 rpm ]
The 6 speed DCT is very responsive and the shifts, both up and down are accomplished very quickly and with no interruption in power flow. RPM match on downshifts is flawless. The paddles are active at all times, another of my requirements.
I spent several minutes looking over the interior, while my sales contact was on a call. Everything = switchgear, surfaces, displays, etc. looked and felt of appropriately high quality. The seats were immediately comfortable and felt very supportive. They have the adjustable thigh support that I like. The front center armrest is adjustable up / down & fore / aft. A nice touch that I appreciate.
The handling, on several deserted curves, was quite confidence inspiring. No feel of front heavy weight distribution. The steering works well, for me. I was pleasantly surprised by the ride, given that this did not have the Audi Mag Ride, nor the 19” wheels & tires than are required with that option. It handled the occasionally broken and deteriorating sections of asphalt and concrete pavement I encountered very well, indeed. This could save me $1,500!
Overall, I was very impressed – and [ pending a longer test drive ] this has been added to my ‘short list’ of possible next car to purchase or lease. That list includes the BMW M235i.
One minor complaint – the interior rear view mirror is oddly small & oval shaped?
That’s about it, for me.

August 2014,I think I can believe it only because the street start is so much slower (5.6) and a more accurate representation of the power/weight ratio it supposedly has. The 4.4 maybe involves launch control and obviously add the advantages of AWD and DSG.

August 2014,Audi s3 now on usa website as you now build it out- a tick under 50k in the form I would want. No sport dif (maybe I'm missing it) which for me makes the s4 really ride on rails. Looks like the prem pack is prob the way to go as it packages more but what do I know. After sitting in the a3 I would def look at this car - looks well done.
August 2014,"Think you are thinking Volvo, right?"
August 2014,Great tradition with the brand. Hope China's Geely keeps it that way.
August 2014,"Not a lawyer or even an expert, but I'll disagree. It's just a used car. The only thing Honda has to do with it, is the extended warranty. Which,if they find out it doesn't qualify for, may rescind and refund the dealer.
They may pressure the dealer to make it right for the customer, but I doubt they have any legal obligations. (Which is probably what you just said..lol)"
August 2014,"My S4 has nearly 10,000 miles, and it's been to the dealer only for a free oil change once. Superb vehicle that I find to be significantly superior in both quality, performance, and price/value to other sport sedans on the market."
August 2014,@nyccarguy‌
August 2014,"Being manufacturer certified, they are on the hook, just the same as on a new car. They are not legally fully liable for dealer's misconduct, like not following the procedures, but there is some liability. If they are happy to collect franchise fees, they should assume part of responsibility what comes under their name. That being said, there is legal liability and there is smart business."
August 2014,"@sweendogy‌
Paragon?"
August 2014,"It would be interesting to find out how much Honda(if any) is actually on the hook for a certified car or is it entirely between individual dealers and the customer. Seems like if they use the name ""Honda"" certified they would be partially liable. Or for that matter any of the luxury certified programs as well."
August 2014,"@ audi problem - I could see how that frustration in customer service would be a slight on a brand. I bought a certified honda in another state after finding a great deal, clean car fox and all. After 250 miles it started leaking fluids, I opened the hood and found a piece of lower bumper lodged in the engine well- along with a poorly done overspray underneath some plastic bits. At 3 weeks of ownership I took it to my local dealer which is 200 miles from where I bought it. They confirmed my worse fears that the car was in a major frontal and should never has been given the honda certified status- Honda was no help said but would investigate, I could not have my family in this car and promptly drove the 200 miles- with documentation from the other dealer- a detailed letter from my lawyer with threat to sue- my detailed expenses incurred -homework done on new model, honda reference numbers on said case and best of all my cop buddy friend (to restrain me) . After 2 hours and almost a black eye I walked out my total cost for used car including 1k for said expenses- I also was given a heavily discounted new car which we have had now for 3 years and runs like a top. Love Honda hate certain queens honda dealer on northern blvd- but that being said HOnda didn't want to hear my problem either."
August 2014,"The flag is to bring either abuse or spam to a host's attention for review. Have you been bad?


No spam/-abuse / at least from the 3 flags (which they allow to see the said posts) I don't get why they wouldn't let offender see who is the flagger."
August 2014,That about sums it up.
August 2014,"So according to the Rep, don't get transferred while your car is under warranty. Because Audi wont cover it? Nice...."
August 2014,"Presuming you didn't post an ad for Amsoil, or cast doubts on a host's parenthood, I suspect that another member might be confusing ""flag"" for ""bookmark"" or ""save for later"" or some such. The flag is to bring either abuse or spam to a host's attention for review. Have you been bad?"
August 2014,"Robr2....yes, all true. Bought it outside the servicing dealers' territory.
Bought in Chicago....serviced in Cincinnati. I saved $4K on the car by doing that. Plus, the selling dealer went to great legnths explaining to me how Audi values me as a customer, and that warranty work/service would gladly be done at an Audi dealer in the country.
I've bought enough cars to understand what happened. You're probably right. There was a rep who was operating with the idea that the car was bought outside his territory (not totally sure about that though, given Audi has a Central Region based out of Chicago...not sure if OH is included in that).
However, that's a case of not seeing the forrest for the trees. They acknowledged there was a problem. They said Audi had a fix. They never did, or if they did, it didn't work. The local dealerships (Audi recommended I try both) diagnosed it the same way. Both said it was a problem. No one could or would fix it. There were other issues with the car, however....not just the Quattro binding.
At one point, the Audi Customer Service Rep even said that I was having it serviced at a dealer that I didn't buy it from, and that could be an issue. I've always thought that, but that's the first time I heard an actual manufacturer's representative admit it. That said, I would imagine this does happen. There has to be a procedure to account for this....some sort of a paper trail to account for something like this.
So, you go to Audi, with them telling you they don't care where you buy their cars, as long as you buy them. But, in reality, at least in my case, unless you buy it from the dealership closest to you, geographically, you might have some issues getting the car fixed. That must have been in their fine print somewhere that I missed.
Don't get me wrong. Not taking it out on you, Robr2. You've brought up a lot of bad feelings I had with the brand, their dealerships, etc from when they'd rather fight with me than focus their energies on fixing my S4. They had an opportunity to keep/save a customer. They made a concious decision to act like jerks instead."
August 2014,"Didn't say it was right. It's just the way it is. The rep has a job to do and his performance is measured by goals set by the company. If he simply bought back every car that people felt was a lemon, he'd be out of a job very quickly. Besides, his customer is the dealer not the consumer.
IIRC, wasn't yours bought out of the offending rep's territory? In that case, the buyback would come out of his budget and his district didn't get credit for the original sale. Once you went to the original dealer, everything was handled."
August 2014,"I'm now have 3 ""flagged"" posts - what does that mean, hosts?"
August 2014,There are ways of protecting the manufacture and not being a jerk it's called diplomacy. As GC stated you don't want to piss off your customers then they wont have a job.
August 2014,"Robr2.....seems counter intuitive. Tick off your customer base, so they won't ever shop for your product again"
August 2014,"Reps have to be jerks because they are paid by their employers to be jerks. Their job is to make sure the manufacturer isn't overpaying for warranty repairs, goodwill, et al. They most likely get bonuses based on how much money they save the company."
August 2014,"GG, I just caught up on my latest pile of car mags this weekend. one of them had a recap of their LT test S7, and one of the issues was some sort of binding. sounds like your issue.
so at this point, it sounds more like a ""feature"" than a ""bug""."
August 2014,"FN....if the regional guy didn't act like like a total tool, I might have considered just replacing it with another Audi. However, since they bought it back, I've read a couple of trade rags who mentioned how their test Audis with Quattro would bind. Towards the end of my ownership of the S4, it felt like one of the wheels was locked up whenever I went around a corner.
My BMW dealer was always helpful, as my Acura dealer is, too. That has a lot to do with them being my two favorite car brands."
August 2014,I saw that 535 on the highway once- I though he was being nice moving over for me-
August 2014,"Happens with all brands, over on Bimmerfest a guy bought a new 535d and his complaint was it pulled to the right, after being at the BMW dealer 4 times they found nothing wrong with it. He decided to make a couple of videos haven't seen a car pull to the right as hard as that 535d did. The area rep was like yours, everything is in spec.. Someone on BF gave the guy a contact person at BMW NA he sent the video's with all documents from the area rep and dealer. 3 days later he got a phone call from BMW NA and instructed to bring the car to his dealer, where BMW bought his car and he got another one. Not too sure why Reps have to be jerks and play games..."
August 2014,"FN....They NEVER want to buy back any car. The Regional Rep was a real pain to work with and bordered on total ignorance of the products he represented.
Once I was able to find his bosses name and location, I contacted him and things moved quickly after that."
August 2014,How hard did you have to push Audi to buy the car back?
August 2014,"I am the former S4 owner.
I guess this is a situation where you either get lucky with an S4, or you don't. I didn't. Quattro system would 'bind"". Audi said they could fix it,but couldn't. Had some other gremlins. Was annoyed by the Audi rep and how they handled my situation. Audi ended up buying it back.
MPG was 18-19 MPG in town...mid 20s on the interstate. I kept my foot in it most of the time, though.
Wished it turned out better. Fun car to drive when it ran right, though. Just too many problems."
August 2014,no problem - thanks for the info. Glad to hear you like your S4. I will decide in a few days.
August 2014,null @ sorry I know a Joel beck thought it could be him
August 2014,"@jbeck5‌  Yes I have 2 sets actually Summer Hartmann S5 Alloys with https://us.v-cdn.net/5021145/uploads/editor/lz/yx31v9ljxg6g.jpg 35 Continental Extreme Contact 255's - those are 19s, as you can see in this pix & Original 5 spoke OEM with Dunlop Supersport Winter tires 18s.  Sticks well in both summer and winter."
August 2014,"And no, it's not Joel."
August 2014,thanks for the info. Do you have the 19 inch wheels? The car I test drove had 19's with very low profile (35 series continentals.
August 2014,@jbeck5 - is it Joel? The s4 for me has been a good commuter in traffic over 4k miles. I drive a total of 20 miles each day- decent on gas in traffic I'm getting 18-19 in city- when I'm able to drive traffic free I can get 27 - I've seen 30 once. I do flog it time to time so I'm guessing I could prob do a little better. Great stereo - seats are nice and firm- wish they were full leather (prob the only thing I would change) - car rides on rails and even with its girth can get around the twists with little drama(sport diff def works). Has been a good rig thus far.
August 2014,sweendogy - How have you liked your S4? Is it as good as a day to day commuter as it is as a sports car?
August 2014,"2015-A6 3.0 supercharged test drive.  Prem pack, Bose, nav - non sport - 18 all seasons.  Got a service done on my s4 yday/today and left with a 15 a6 with 32 miles on the car as a loner. First off audi interiors are amazing and this a6 was extra cushie compared to my s4 with summer slicks. Nice highway cruiser - but a bit of a boat in the turns. Pickup from the 3.0 smooth but not dramatic even in dynamic mode. Infact it made me wonder how slow or unsporty the 2.0 would be- as the car is huge. I drove the car for approx 20 miles - and have to say if I was maybe 10-15 years older it would be my cup of tee but not at this juncture.  Other observations - sat in an A3, while the doors seemed a little tinnie the overall car was pretty impressive and I would certainly take a look at this car if considering. The layout is simple and it seems like a great commuter car in 2.0 form. The trunk also huge for a compact.  S6 - saw one in blacked out (optic pack?) form - so attractive.  Glad to have the s4 back- small puncture fixed in rear tire."
August 2014,"jbeck....I like the TLX 4 cyl as much as I do the V6 version. I like the power of the V6 more, though. Good luck in your choice. Have fun shopping."
August 2014,"thanks for the welcome. I should add I have also owned the previous generation of the A4, bought in 2007. That was a good car. The decision for me is coming down to A4, S4 or TLX. Test drove TLX V-6 yesterday and liked it. But if I go TLX I will wait for a 2.4 liter 4 cyliner to be available.
Also test drove Audi A3 and was less impressed than most of the reviews that you read."
August 2014,"OK....for no other reason than I'm interested in a lot of diffrent cars, and I MAY BE in the market in the next 24 months, AND I was in close proximity to both a Lexus and an Infiniti dealer last night after work, I did some test driving.
This is hot on the heals of doing the BMW drive event. I like BMWs. I wanted to drive the M235i, but they didn't have any to test drive....only 4 series.
435i xDrive, with sport pack? Yep....I'll take two. Problem is, I think BMW has now started to believe their own marketing hype. And, they've priced themselves accordingly. Not sure you get anything more than what I got from my former E92.... less, actually. But, there's been a definite rise in price while staying the same or getting worse in some areas (steering being the most obvious). High $50s? Low $60s? Sorry I'll drop out of that market. Some will walk into their local BMW store with $60K burning a hole in their pocket for a 3/4 series not knowing what else they could get for that kind of money. I'm sure they aren't going to miss me, though. They're doing fine without me.
Infiniti Q50.......drove an AWD version with sport wheels and supposedly sport suspension. It was either too soft, wandering, needing constant minute corrections to stay straight, or doing the same thing, with much higher effort involved. Electronics feels like a cold Windows 3.1 boot up. $50K? I'll take the highly discounted G37x Sport for $10K+ less.
Not bad looking, mind you. Just not my cup of tea (yet again).
Lexus....IS350 F Sport. Tried to buy one when they first came out. Dealer didn't want to deal, so no dice. Now, they're ready to deal I see why the trade rags have rated this car higher than the 3 series. The grill is a love it-hate it affair. I'm used to that (with my TL), though. Drive it as fast as you want, however you want, wherever you want. Very nicely weighted steering. Really fine handling/ride feel. As is typical for Lexus, very good materials and build quialty.
The one I drove was $49K, pretty loaded up with Nav, leather, sunroof, etc. Probably the prettiest grey paint job I've seen on any car (Nebula Grey). Out of the shoot, sales manager (who introduced himself after the test drive was over), said the IS I drove would be in the $47K range (maybe get serious in the $45K-$46K range?). If/when I get ready to buy, I'll come back to give them a shot at my business. Once again, the 3/4 Series are nice cars. The IS350 is better, for significantly less money.
I informed all the dealers I was not in the market. This is the difference between high end dealerships and the ones that know at some point they want you back into their store. They'll acknowledge you're ""just looking"" and offer to be there when you're ready.
This, tied to what I've seen from Benz and Acura recently, not a bad time to be shopping for an ELLPS."
August 2014,I know what the former owner will say!
August 2014,"@jbeck5‌
Hello & Welcome to edmunds. You picked the right board for owner info. We've got 3 current S4 owners and 1 former S4 owner."
August 2014,"Not exactly. 4-series has wider wheel track (1/2 inch), lower ride, not just roof, but seats, too, i.e. CG is lower, and reportedly more feedback on steering and suspension vs 3-series. It is a different car, newer development derived from the sedan, but took its own life. BMW heard complaints on the new three's steering when it came out, so they reportedly made some efforts to improve it. Now, it is possible four's those settings will filter back to the original soon."

August 2014,"Hi
New poster here. I am considering a 2014 Audi s4 with 1200 miles. Auto tran, sport differential, 19 inch wheels, navi and B&O stereo. To those who have driven or owned this:
1. Is the ride acceptable over non-smooth roads?
2. Reliability?
3. MPG?
I really liked the feel of the car and the smooth power from the supercharged V-6 during the test drive.
Basically, how do you enjoy owning and driving the car, and how livable is it. Also, how has Audi been to deal with? I have previously owned BMW 335i and 128i with sport packages. Enjoyed them both. How woul you compare the S4?
Thanks in advance for any feedback."
August 2014,"I am very executed about the TLX. Other than not being a hatch, sounds exactly like what fits me."
August 2014,"So far 435i GC is going to be my next car. Not sure when, will probably take a while, but so far that's the one. One bad thing is the price - with all goodies I want it would cross 55 grand on the sticker, push 60  Just crazy."
August 2014,"BMW did a good job in hiding the fact it's has a hatch, I wasn't a fan of one until I drove one at the BMW event last week. Like, you I am now a fan. Since I don't carry people in the car very often but when i do at least they do not have to crawl into the back seats."
August 2014,I like it a lot - make the runs to Home Depot easier
August 2014,"I didn't realize it was a hatch, either... and, I've sat in one (though just for a moment..)
Now... I like it.. ;-)"
August 2014,"Huh. Actually, I like that more that I would the sedan."
August 2014,
August 2014,"The GC is a hatch, the 3GT is a different animal but has a hatch. The X4 is more a SUV then a coupe."
August 2014,"I thought the Gran Coupe is a sedan, not a hatch. There is the 3-series GT, which is a hatch, and the new X4, which is a CUV-thingy with a hatch."
August 2014,"BMW 435 Gran Coupe is the swiss-army knife for me. Low wide ""coupe"" so I can drive in style. 4 door and 5 seats so I can put the 4 kids in. Hatch so I can fit all the football equipment.
Too hot for a convertible so that feature is not on my list.
I'm just not in the market now..."
August 2014,Nissan tried that with the murano - and I don't know if that's the answer
August 2014,"The quest for the ""Swiss-army knife"" of car models soldiers on. There will be a car that is a four-door coupe, CUV, convertible and hot rod all rolled into one any day now.
That cue comes, somewhat, from Porsche with the Macan -- all they have to do is figure out how to make the roof retract and by George I think they'll have it!"
August 2014,"@markcincinnati‌ - agree a4 should/will move up as it seems the new C class has done as the new Cla has arrived - audi now has a smaller sedan- a4 moves up- bmw I'm guessing will have a new 1 class at some point and move up the 3.  -on a side note I'm amazed by how many different classes of cars Bmw has - GTs, coupes, converts, wagons, SUVs, weird looking SUVs, 5 door coupes , (where is the pickup?) - if there is a car Idea they make it and I think it's pretty cool-"
August 2014,"Even without the ""3"" Audi would be/will be hard pressed NOT to increase the content of the A4/S4 (either optionally or as standard equipment). Sitting in the back seat of an A3 is not something I would want to do, granted -- but I'd rather not have to sit in the back seat of a current A4 either.
Now, then, that comment might suggest Audi will enlarge the A4 -- I guess there would be a temptation to do that; there is an A4L in China (at least) to be sure.
Making the A4/S4 more luxury, high-tech contented is, I think (I have no secret or insider info) virtually inevitable -- if not for the competition from the A3/S3, just the competition from the market itself."
August 2014,"New s3 vs older s4 agree if I was buying new 6months ago and the s3 was around I would def take a huge look even with its smaller size. I have had 3 people in my car once - 4 people never, mostly it's just me."
August 2014,"""I think the A4 should get a power boost, say in the 230-240hp "" I'm sure the 10 hp advantage will drive sales."
August 2014,"I agree and I'm 6' also, granted I think the A3 is more for people who want a premium brand without paying the premium price, since a mid level A3 is around 32K which is rougly the medium cost of a new car today."
August 2014,"Why does the A4 have to have more ""luxury"" to differentiated itself from the A3? Also how can Audi make it more Luxury? The A3 is about the same size as the first gen A4, so if the A3 is too small for some, the current A4 is bigger and roomier which would fit most people. One can get the same 2L turbo engine in the A3 as in the A4, I think the A4 should get a power boost, say in the 230-240hp range and keep the A3 at the current HP rating. Now for the S4, 333hp is not enough to make it faster then the S3 Audi can either increase HP or not worry about it. Again, people who want a bigger car then S3 will move up to a S4, I'm sure there are some items that can not be had on the S3 that you can get with the S4."
August 2014,"My point regarding the new A3/S3 (which I have not driven, but have sat in) is that it will ""force"" the A4/S4 to move upscale in terms of luxury and it will also get more power so that the S3 will not be quicker than an S4.
The basis for my comments is the new C&D article where C&D says the S3 makes the S4 irrelevant or something akin to that.
I have not seen the S3 yet -- but the A3 would probably receive the same comments -- this time aimed at the A4 -- from the author of the C&D piece on the S3.
If you accept that as having some truth to it, it would seem that Audi will be forced to do something to keep the A3/S3 from siphoning off customers from the A4/S4.
Many folks buy/lease these cars and only the front seats see much adult duty -- the rear seats may be used by an adult, but probably only rarely. I think the A4/S4 is a bit cramped in the back seat -- so the A3, of course, must be quite cramped.
But, who cares if 95% of the time it is a driver and maybe a front seat passenger. Even those who take their colleagues to lunch probably would find no issue with the A3 for the often short drive from the office to the lunch wagon.
What could the A4/S4 do -- add performance and/or add luxury -- and being that you're Audi, you would probably err on the side of adding lux first, performance second (my point about the S6 is that it is a far more ""muted"" sporting vehicle, emphasizing luxury first -- even though it IS a screamer performance wise.)
The 2016 A4 line will -- if history repeats -- not offer up an S4, rather that will come in MY 2017. But, even the A4 vs the A3 will have the A4 needing to be different enough from the A3 to justify the price. Size of the wheelbase, length, width, etc, alone is (and I'm with C&D here) will not be enough to make the choice clear between the two -- the A4 will have to lead with more ""stuff"" more lux stuff and more performance than the A3 at any one point in time.
Perhaps, the 2015 S4 will be more heavily discounted due to the birth of the S3 in the US next month -- get 'em while their hot for about a year.
I may be wrong throwing my lot in with C&D, but I just can't see what the A4/S4 development team has as an alternative to the A3/S3 but to take the A4/S4 upstream, so to speak.
Please make your argument to the contrary, I would really love to think the A4 family can and will hold its own, will be differentiated sufficiently from the A3 to keep the A4 sales on an upward trajectory.
I just don't see any alternative for the A4 but to head for the top (of course this will likely mean a stupid price delta will ""erupt"" between the cars -- something like I was lamenting regarding the price difference between an S4 and an S6.)"
August 2014,6' even.
August 2014,"And you're 6'8""?"
August 2014,I sat in an A3 a couple of weeks ago. The rear seat was way too cramped for me (leg room OK but way short on head room.)
August 2014,"Mark, have you sat in a A3 yet? From what I have read the rear seat are pretty cramp for adults like they were for the first gen A4. I thought the A3 was a way to get people into the Audi fold be offering a lower entry point. BMW decided to offer the 320 to do the same thing, which has been very successful for them since the 3 series sales are up 7% over last year."
August 2014,"The new Car & Driver tests the almost here S3 (and at its price point, it ought to be in the ELLPS family). The article opens and closes suggesting that the S3 will cannibalize sales from the S4.
After reading the review, I would mostly agree -- but, as the S6 is to the S4 (that is to say way more luxurious but with plenty of go and stop talent), I would think the next S4 we will get will distance itself from the S3 by virtue of great gobs of power (instead of 333HP, how about 395 -- 100 more than the S3 as a nice round number?) and even more luxury bits and pieces.
I mean the new S4 has to have (or be) a step up either in performance or luxury or both -- and Audi probably will go with a decent power upgrade over the current S4, but likely will go with a huge dollop of lux given the brand's positioning. Perhaps if there is an RS4, there will be great gobs of new power and large lumps of added luxury.
I mean, really, other than the satisfaction of knowing you're in an S4 (and paid more), C&D is right, for most folks the S3 will be the one to asipire to.
My gawd, the S3 can be had for the price of an A4 -- and only loose a bit of trunk space and rear leg room. Most folks here will drive the car solo or have but one front-seat adult passenger.
The only thing lacking from the new S3 is the torque vectoring rear diff. Wouldn't surprise me if they figured out how to do that within a model year or so.
One last thing, a prediction: Given my recent S6 test drive: the new S6, whenever that comes out, will loose 2 more pistons, but manage to have more power and get better mileage and with it being a V6, the car will be less nose heavy, improving its handling performance."

August 2014,"Mark, here vicariously with you. Nice review, thanks."
August 2014,"I Never Would Have Thought of This Outcome:
I wouldn’t want you to think that I take advantage of my Audi dealer’s willingness to throw me the keys to a new A3, A6, A7, Q5, Q7, S4, SQ5, S6 or TT (who me?!) – I’ve not really been interested in driving an A8 and the S8’s and R8’s are almost always “sold cars,” besides since my dealer knows when either my wife or I am “in the market,” I’d hate to push it by putting them in the position of having to say “no” especially since we’ve only had our 2014 “S” Audis for months, not years.
It was with the full understanding that we are not currently in the market that my wife and I decided that Saturday last was the day we would test drive a new Audi. We thought long and hard about taking a test drive of either a 2014 A6 3.0T or a 2015 A6 2.0T with the sport package and lots of options. Both of these cars were on the lot and not “sold” cars. My wife asked me what I really, really wanted to drive, now, if I could only drive one car, I immediately answered a new “S6” – that was easy.
A few minutes after walking in the showroom door, we were handed the keys to a 2014 S6 with about 300 miles on the OD and with a few choice options: cold weather package, black wood and aluminum trim, black interior and panther black exterior. Also present: 20” wheel upgrade (from the standard 19” inchers). Since the designation of the S6’s is now Prestige, there were very few features the car didn’t have – it did not have the top view camera for example, or the automatic cruise control including stop and go, etc.
To my eye, I sat down, behind the wheel of The Batmobile (the color combo having a lot to do with that) and pressed the start button only to be immediately more than a little impressed by the “awakening.” Unfortunately, this car was an S6, not an S5, RS5 or even S4. I say unfortunately because the car was clearly focused 90% on the luxury side of sport-luxury. This became even more evident when I put the car into drive (which means “S” or sport mode since I had set the steering and air suspension to Dynamic (along with the engine and transmission) using Audi-Drive-Select. I ultimately changed the steering to Auto mode which gives the car super easy turns at slow speed, but tightens things up considerably as the MPHs climb.
Speaking of climbing, I got onto a nearby Interstate (I-275 by-pass, eastbound) and was cruising along at a steady 60MPH – when all of a sudden, I floored the S6 and counted to three (one, two, three) – I counted pretty quickly too -- certainly 1, 2, 3! (think Sia) -- in less than three seconds. I released the accelerator completely and looked down at the speedometer only to see an indicated 102MPH. The sensation I had was, well, muted, subdued, suppressed – sublime. There was virtually no drama, barely any sound (angry engine or otherwise) lingered at all, and I was coasting down but still showing an indicated 90+-something on the speedo.
What did I do next? Well, I “punched” the accelerator pedal for another Sia-like one-two-three moment, signaled right for the rapidly rushing at me exit ramp, hit the ramp at incredible speed, barely “mashed” the brake pedal only to get a momentary sensation that the S6 had impossibly instantaneously scrubbed off about 80 miles per hour (and almost magically seemed to be going backwards the descent was that swift) as I damn near just coasted to a stop as if nothing had happened 1-second ago. Meanwhile, I awaited the traffic-light to glow green.
I tried out the S6’s handling envelope using my completely accurate and totally made up (therefore unscientific) routine of driving faster and faster and faster in a circle, then carving through an imaginary slalom barely nicking those [also imaginary] orange cones. The thing carves like a hot knife through buttah! A little, not much, body roll – but hey, this thing is a full-sized vehicle, remember.
Here’s the thing, after my test drive – during which time I became thoroughly smitten – I drove (in sequence) our 2014 SQ5 and next up our 2014 S4. Now, I read the mfgr’s published 0-60 numbers for all three of these “S” vehicles, and the S6 is, after all, the quickest of the three, on-paper. The thing is my $58,000 S4 is very quiet, too, and I have the upgraded seats (which certainly seem very similar to the S6’s) further blurring the differences -- between the S4 and S6. My B&O sound system edges out the S6’s Bose system by a small but discernable difference, especially in the clarity department – the B&O tweeters are really impressive, the Bose’s less so.
The S6 however, commands, no, demands your attention – much more so than the Ibis White S4, which seems to have a bit less “presence” than the Panther Black S6.
Regarding the S6: I want one, I want one, I want one – and for perhaps $68-$70,000 (as equipped), I would actually say the value is really there. The thing is, however, the bottom line on the sticker was $79,500+. It (the S6) just didn’t seem to be THAT much more car, even though it would be worth considering hocking the family jewels and taking out a second mortgage.
I loved the S6, I mean I really loved the car – it just isn’t worth (to me), as far as I can tell, $22,000 more than my S4 or $19,000 more than my wife’s SQ5. With an emphasis on more performance, I would possibly see where the money went – however, the emphasis is on luxury, isolation and stealth.
Where the S4 is an iron fist with a velvet glove on it, the S6 is an iron fist wrapped in thick density foam with a velvet glove on it. I guess for nearly 80 grand, folks might well prefer stealth to show-off. I think I get that.
Me? Well let’s just say, I’d like a bit more sturm und drang."

August 2014,Very amusing article actually.
August 2014,This is a fairly pointless debate. Time to move on.
August 2014,null No never widespread just without fact -
August 2014,I never said widespread.
August 2014,"So since Bimmerfest was just a sample of your reference and you seem to be so sure that snow tire use is widespread, what are a few of the other sources you're basing your statement on? Traction control and other electronic nannies as you call them would seem to further lessen the use snow tires to some degree. The nannies and very good quality all-season tires have led to smaller and smaller percentage of snow tire users IMO.
I think there are small regions in the N.E. where topography and winter snowfall probably lends to a much higher percentage of snow tire use than most areas. Anywhere where mountains and lots of snowfall cross paths would make them popular. But in probably 80% of the country they see very little use."
August 2014,"LD...FN.....I can see where RWD and snow tires are a must, depending on geographic locale and the type of car (no way either my former Mustang GT nor my RX8 would budge even at the mention of snow). But, they had summer only rubber. Put something half way descent M&S tires and they would go.
Tire technology has indeed advanced in the last half dozen years. I know the first time I encountered run flats were in a 330i (RWD). No problems in the snow, but they made the car ride like a brick. Those run flats are better these days.
Even the all season tires on my son's Fiesta and the wife's Accord are better than the ones I've encountered just 5 years ago.
As you state, with the computers and sensors in today's cars, things have to be pretty severe to get stuck or go flying into the weeds (barring shear stupidity while driving) in the snow.
Even rental cars can get around with their ""base model"" tires. Spent a lot of time from Logan Airport to Lynn, Marlborough, Acton, Waltham, etc.....summer, winter, didn't matter. Coming in and out of the ""Big Dig"" was a challenge. Never got stuck. Never got sideways. Always in a rental car."
August 2014,"My reference of Bimmerfest was just a sample, and I never stated other wise. But modern cars today that are RWD have the elec nannies to make them drive-able in the snow with the correct tires. The fact that manufactures are telling people they need AWD was true 25 yrs ago, but technology has changed this."
August 2014,"The last time I used snow tires was before radial tires even became common. Growing up in Michigan with nothing but rear wheel drive cars and bias ply tires it was a necessity. Have lived in snow belt all my life and haven't needed or used snow tires for the past 40 at least. Nobody in my neighborhood uses them nor any of my relatives. With all the toys now nobody has room in their garage anymore. Half the people can't even fit two cars into their two car garage.
FN..reading comments on Bimmerfest and extrapolating that to the general population is referencing a very small and select sample of the population. Hardly the reference work to use to get an overall picture of reality. Living in AZ certainly doesn't give you a lot of direct knowledge of the nations snow tire use either. Do a lot of people that live in snow country which also run summer tires on sports cars also change to snows in winter? Probably. A majority? Who really knows. But even if a majority of that group does, that still says nothing for the other 99%. Definitive statements need facts or direct relevant knowledge."
August 2014,"Like RobR, I live in the Boston area and am a life long skier (including VT, ME, NH). Until the Jag XK, always driven (fun!) FWD cars. Until my '05 Acura TL, never had snows and always survived and thrived in the white gold. But, the TL was sub-standard in that respect, first time I felt the need for snow shoes. Got Dunlop WinterSports mounted on (on sale) alloys for the winter from Tire Rack, did el swappo winter/summer. Big improvement, snow problem solved.
Then, of course, I traded the TL for the Jag XK. A natural progression, happens all the time. OEM Dunlop Summer tires made even saying the word ""snow"" out loud a dangerous thing! First 1/8"" snowfall and I couldn't get up my mildly steep driveway. Luckily, SUV in the garage to the rescue...
But, as the only constant in life is change, I had to once again grow up and buy the eminently sensible pair of shoes ride I now so enjoy. AWD, with big RWD bias and Conti all seasons. Handled this past winter's best with aplomb. But, should my next sled by RWD, I wouldn't hesitate to buy another set of winter tires, probably again on rims.
And, FN, I lived in Burlington for a bit one winter. Oh, so long ago... Lovely city, but winter time can last a long time!

August 2014,"I live in Boston and all 3 vehicles (including the AWD Explorer) wear snow shows. I travel all over New England in my job and I'd rather not get stuck in Burlington, VT when a few inches drop while I'm there. Further, we ski and it's the same thing.
Some of what drives me to use snow tires is keeping the OEM rims out of the salt and muck. Even waxed, they take get damaged in the winter."
August 2014,"We live in the same ""neck 'o the woods"". I can't remember the last time I bought a snow tire.
If it's so bad out that I feel my RWD, AWD, FWD car can't make it with the shoes it has, then I don't want or need to be out in the weather. That sort of weather only happens once every 2-3 years around here, though.
Come to think of it, I've driven in worse weather with bald, skinny tires when I was younger and much less intelligent.
I had a really nice Datsun 240Z (bought used) and an MGB GT (bought very used) at one point. Used to drive those in the snow and muck. Not sure I'd attempt that today. But, that was done when I had more nerves than brains."

Yes RWD cars fitted with dedicated winter tires should do fine when the white stuff falls. @kyfdx and @roadburner both have RWD BMWs and have had ZERO problems getting around. I agree with @stickguy.

I'm also sure that you'll have to put down a hefty, non-refundable deposit too.

I am in NJ. No one swaps here, unless they have dedicated hi po summer rubber, and half the time they don't either. That is fun to see in snow!"
August 2014,Wow! The steering in the Genesis must be light-years beyond horrible...
August 2014,"Heck, I've run into more than a few poor fools who say they can't buy a RWD car because they need something that they can drive in the rain. At first I thought they were joking, but they were serious. I suggested that what they really needed was public transit..."
August 2014,"Yeah.. if you don't do everything the manual calls for, then it's cheaper.. 
Mine goes back in October... with about 35K miles on it... I'll probably get hit for tires... I'm down to 5/32 now.."

August 2014,"BMW has gotten a bad rap on the suspension/handling of the F30 and F10 cars but there is a easy fix to this, order the Dynamic Handling Package (DHP in BMW language) cost $1,400. BMW in the past had been criticized on how ""harsh"" it's ride was, so for the F30 they went a little softer (more on this) however, DHP allows BMW to have the best of both worlds, creating a softer ride and keeping the sporting handling. Graphic I'm surprised that the 4 series you drove did not have this. The only F30 not to get DHP is the 320, but this will change, the sales of 320i have exceeded BMW sale projection and for 2015 new options and color choices will be available to it. 
My BMW dealer will be hosting their Ultimate Driving Experience here in the next week, I have reserved 3 cars, M235i, 428 Grand Coupe and 5 series Activehybrid.
Now regarding the F30 and it's soft ride, in our house we have a unique chance of driving two cars from two different mind sets. Ricks Genesis and my 320i. I think Rick has enough seat time in both cars to see first hand the difference between them. Latley, I would say the last 3 months Rick has been driving my car a little more and he is picking me up at the airport in it, he tells me the ride in my 320 had a better feel, a more ""planted"" feel on the road and the ride is more controlled then his Genesis also Rick says the steering has better feel."
August 2014,"Acura's model is giving options standard that BMW and Audi charge for, and for a much lower price. I purchased the revamped MDX that came out in 2007 - think it was the 1st one Acura had introduced with sh-awd. Paid under50K for fully loaded. Similarly equipped BMW and Audi were north of 65K. There were quite a few car magazine reviews that had put that MDX best in terms of handling over X5 due to sh-awd. Not that was my priority, but it made the decision easier. I still have it and it is going strong with nothing more than regular scheduled maintenance.
That said, it still does not compare to driving a RWD BMW for me. I will have to drive a TLX to compare to the 320i that I just got.
Here's another review of TLX - http://www.digitaltrends.com/car-reviews/2015-acura-tlx-review/, recommending to get the four cylinder over v6. They say: if the V6 model is Tim Duncan, the four-cylinder is Chris Paul."
August 2014,"might not be necessary, but most dealers feel it is. or at least have buyers brainwashed."
August 2014,@kyfdx - if you strip out a couple of items on the 30k service and do the must need items it's significantly cheaper - did the filters and wipers myself- car basically needs tires and oil- my experience of 39k was pretty good.
August 2014,"If you live in the NE and want a RWD car you can get them, might take you a little longer to do it. It's been interesting reading on BIMMERfest that people have bought RWD cars in the snow belt and have no issues getting around in the snow. So is it really necessary to have AWD cars?"
August 2014,Data point: 30K mile service on the Infiniti G37X was quoted at $530.
August 2014,Usually when someone likes something very much they remember the name. LOL.
August 2014,"Bradd....I'm not going anywhere.....

FN.....Until I was with my sister, test driving 320i/8i, I didn't see the appeal of the 320i. Driving one, if your priority is not stop light wars, but a well made, good handling car, the 320i offers all those attributes. Gotta say, you get a car that if you're careful with the options list, for mid-high $30s, that you don't have to worry about, at all, for anything, for 4 years, that's appealing.
Lots of reviews coming in for the TLS. Seems as if the press cars have some sort of glitch where there's some hesitation coming off the line when you first hit the gas. I didn't experience that. Both the 4 and 6 cvl pulled strongly at throttle tip in. I estimate 0-60 in the low 5 sec range, add a second to that for the 4 cyl.
Are they the fastest? No. But, they will be competitive to an ATS or CTS, A4, A6 (4 cyl), Infiniti Q (pick one), Lexus IS/ES. Unless you go to a blown V6 (like in the S4/A6) or turbo'd BMW motors (at much higher cost), you'll be right in line with the field. And, you'll have to climb the price ladder quite a bit to really get significantly better performance.
But, the suspension is where the car really shines. It feels as sophisticated as anything I've ever driven. It trumps BMW and BMW's own game. Ride/handling is superb.
Acuras are notorious for holding great resale. I can see this trend continuing. It is now back on top the tech heap, too. Good looking interior with high quality build and materials.
In short, it feels much more expensive than it is.
Can you tell I like the new TLS?"
August 2014,"@benjaminh you are right no excuse for 10k difference - RWD is very important for sure but again most are bot with auto and standard suspension set up and certainly in awd as I have not seen the cheapo 320 without it up east.
bmw you pay for badge for sure."
August 2014,"you live in the desert, right? Up in the north east (and north, and mid west) almost no one buys RWD. Would have to be AWD. Heck, in NJ, you basically can't find a new RWD in stock at most dealers. Everything they have is AWD."
August 2014,"Some people want a FWD car and others want RWD,"

August 2014,"I love the enthusiasm for acura- yeah- they are getting back to what they were as someone noted- so much for so cheap another wrote- and the best quote was from someone who said looks like some good deals coming. On 13-14 TL sh cars , cars that didn't sell to begin with. Hello - acura needs to show the enthusiast something. Infact they need to show the general buying public something- that something is a car that not only is cheaper - but performs (including mpg) and also looks good- now I have not seen or tested one- as another acura lover did here but reading this article says all -
http://www.nydailynews.com/autos/latest-reviews/beauty-queen-valedictorian-2015-acura-tlx-earns-high-marks-luxury-sedan-segment-article-1.1891166
Car forgot some stuff- 1) Looks - 2) performance - 3) mpg in ""volume leader""
The last TL got lapped by every car in sales- performance and looks- even thou some like to believe the car actually looked good -(after compliments, really?)
The last tsx was no better then current accord that ""all about the benjimens"" is looking at.
I respect the review from past TL owneder but I will wait for the professionals in comparo test, also the eye test is huge (like the [non-permissible content removed] and grill on the last TL)-will it actually look ok, or do you have to get it in certain colors in order to escape the elephant man car a select few leased?"
August 2014,"As nyccarguy says, the entry-level Acura TLX is quite lavishly equipped for $31k.
Out of curiosity, I just priced-out a BMW 320i with most (but far from all) of the equipment on the TLX Tech Pkg. The BMW 320i came to $42.5k, and yet was still missing several things found on the Acura."
August 2014,"Are you trying to push me, Bradd?"
August 2014,"@graphicguy‌
I'm checking out the standard features on the ""base"" model for $30,995 and am digging it. All Wheel Steering, Bluetooth, Backup Camera, Dual Clutch Gearbox. Although I do like the 18"" Wheels on the V6 model better.
Once these TLXs hit the streets, there are going to be some very nice used 2013 - 2014 TL SH AWDs getting traded in & leases ending for the mid-high $20s."
August 2014,"Yes. I remember admiring the original Legend in 1986 when I was in college for those very reasons. This one's about the size of the Legend too. And so maybe I'll get to own a TLX with a little ghost of a ""Legend"" in it after all.
It does seem to represent a great value for the money. And made in Ohio is a plus!+++ All three of my Accords were made at Marysville, and they have all been great cars."
August 2014,"Benjamin....those of us who remember how Acura got into the U.S. luxury car market was by doing the exact same thing they're doing now. They're putting a very feature and tech rich car, that competes with drivetrain and suspension that rivals (sometimes exceeds) their much more expensive German counterparts.
Looks like they're getting back to that winning formula."
August 2014,"Accord EXL Navi vs. Acura TLX Tech
Since I love having built-in navi, this will be a comparison of the Accord EXL Navi ($30,835) with the Acura TLX with Tech Package ($35,025), and so we're looking at a difference of $5k. We all know that to get a good discount on a TLX anything close to what you can get on the Accord you'd need to wait c. 4-6 months for production to ramp up. But I can wait. My 2008 Accord EXL navi 5MT is working quite well, and is still under the HondaCare warranty all the way until Jan. of 2016.
Here's my very subjective evaluation of what each feature of the TLX might be ""worth"" to me personally, compared to an Accord EXL navi. I admit, I haven't yet been in the car, but I do trust Honda/Acura to create a good quality product, since I've owned 3 Accords and had good experiences with all of them....
8-speed dual-clutch transmission compared to CVT: $1000
206 hp engine compared to 185 for the Accord: $600
PAWS precision all-wheel steering: $600
larger performance tires/better alloy wheels: $600
Upgraded brakes (320mm vs. 292mm): $400
440-watt ELS Studio surround 10-speaker: $800
JewelEye LED headlights $300
60/40 split fold down seats: $300
Premium interior including Milano leather: $800
Very nice exterior+structural upgrades: $800
longer warranty: $400
tilt down mirrors: $200
paddle shifters: $300
Real Time Traffic: $200
Rain sensing wipers: $200
Blind Spot Info system: $300
Lane Keeping Assist: $300
Rear Cross Traffic Monitor: $300
Driver's side Knee airbag: $300
Integrated Dynamic System (Econ, Normal, Sport, Sport +): $400
-$600 for LaneWatch which comes with the Accord but not on the Acura.
Some of this stuff I have no idea if I'd like. Lane Keeping Assist? I hope I pay attention and drive for myself (wish everyone would hang-up and drive), but maybe useful....? Rain sensing wipers? Surely I'm not so lazy or blind that I can't turn the wipers on?? So I didn't put much down for those. I imagine an Acura engineer looking at how much time and $ it cost for them to put that in would be annoyed at me.
But a great sound system like the award-winning ELS set-up is worth a lot to me.
Quite possibly I'm still missing some things.
But anyway, admitting that this is very subjective and a total guess (since I haven't yet driven a TLX), but based on the strong reviews, as well as my strong trust in Honda/Acura this upgrade to the TLX seems to be ""worth it"" to me. In fact, it seems to add up to:
c. $8500 or so imaginary dollars of ""worth it"" to me for a c. 5k price.
Seems like Acura is trying to get back in the game by making the TLX a lot of car and a lot of tech for the money.
Sorry this is so long...."
August 2014,"stick....I can see the 4 cyl being the volume leader. That's a whole lot of car for mid-high $30s. Plus, it was fun to drive...built as good as anything I've ever driven...that includes some pretty nice cars.
My sales man, given his job is to sell cars, tried to get me to trade. He can't. The car is ""too hot"" right now for a skinny deal.
Anyone in the market in this segment owes it to themselves to put the TL at the top of their shopping list, though."
August 2014,"Makes me want one. The 4 would be plenty for me. 2 weeks back when I was in for service the salesman said the were giving a preorder discount, plus the $500 in ad dons if you put a deposit down to get on the list.
Does sound like it could be a hit."
August 2014,"Stick....thanks.
Get this out of the way up front, The TLX looks much better in person than the pics I've seen.
Dealer had two cars....one black with a sweet dark saddle interior. i really like that combo. The other one was white with black interior.
The interiors are a big upgrade over mine, and pretty much turns it into a leader in the segment. All controls move with precision and smoothness that lead the pack.
The 4 has an 8 speed, dual clutch trans. Fun drive. The DCT performs extremely well. Steering is light, and precise. It tightens up well as you gain speed....very linear.
Gun it, and it leaps. Quick, firm shifts with ""blip"" matching revs. It's as roomy inside as my TL. They say it has shorter front and rear overhangs. Maybe. Not sure. Plenty of rear seat room.
Seat of pants tells me 0-60 around 6-6.5 secs.
Leather is good...better than the fake stuff other brands tout. Better than most premium leathers in other premium brands.
Dual screens...top one for NAV. Bottom one for audio and HVAC. This car will compete well with 4 cyl A4s, 320/8i, C300 4 cyl.
The V6 was a FWD Advance. It was as loaded as any car I've ever driven. 9 speed push button trans. It's always in the right gear and will run to redline in every gear. It will snap to any gear firmly....right now!
Great seats, very high quality materials. Super quiet. Again...steering was light but tightened up at speed.
Suspension is really refined and sophisticated...comparable to a much more expensive car. Nothing seems to upset it....and I tried.
I expect 0-60 to be in the low to mid 5s. Like the 4, it loves to run and sounds/feels smooth, typical Acura motors. These just seem to want run hard.
P-AWS is slick....you point.....it goes...no drama, understeer well controlled....as fast as you dare to go.
I saw the MSRP of the V6 Advance.....~$42K. Not sure about the 4 cyl. That includes the ELS surround system (best I've heard in a car), lane keeping, intelligent cruise, sunroof, really nice leather, remote start...everything. A BMW 3 or 4, A/S4, C class would easily cost an extra $10K to $15K for something similar. Dealer said Acura is giving $1,500 discount and $500 in ""add-ons"" for anyone trading an '08 on up.
They had two demos (which I drove). But had sold the 4 they got in stock Last weekend.
This car is going to be a hit. Plus, the headlights are really cool."
August 2014,"@graphicguy‌
Great write up on the 435i & C350. There are a few things the current (outgoing) C has going for it. Good old hydraulic, belt driven, power steering. An adaptive suspension that reacts to road conditions & steering inputs (electronically). MB is a big company and can throw major incentives in the form of trunk money, cheap financing, & attractive lease rates.
I agree that price is a factor, even when you get north of $50K."
August 2014,nice. I will trust your reports more than the magazines!
August 2014,"Opprtune posting....my Acura sales guy got two TLXs in stock....one 4 cyl, one 6. Just test drove both. Will give impressiosns when I have more time."
August 2014,"Thanks FN and M6....looks like Acura has a winner on its hands.
They all make the point that plopping in a 328/335 similarly equipped with similar performance is going to run way up the price scale. And, as was pointed out, like Audi and BMW, Acura's style is evolutionary, not revolutionary.
As previously mentioned, I want to hold onto my TL SH AWD at least until the warranty is up....which won't be for another couple of years. As it stands, I've had two oil changes and two tire rotations in 17,000 miles. That's it. I think maintenance has cost me about $140 in the 1.5 years I've had it.
It will be at the top of my shopping list when the time comes, though."

August 2014,"Graphic and I stated, that, ""there are people who shop price and really don't care if it is a BMW, Audi, MB or Lexus.... But look at Mr. 28 Audi's for the most part he will get an Audi doesn't matter if he could have gotten a MB for $30 less a month."
August 2014,Price def matters - a 10% difference means a lot. Just like when people talk about cross shopping under 35k it gets a little mixed with mainstream loaded sedans verse barebones sudo lux.

August 2014,"Not seen anything about the coupe specifically. MB has a general '15 C Class page, though."

August 2014,"FN....no disagreement about the Benz. But, based on my sister's C350 sport, it's tuned to where the vast majority of drivers would like a sports sedan to be tuned.
In all frankness, BMW is moving towards the type of tuning BMW and Audi have been slowly going towards for the last few years. The IS 350 is now the ""sport sedan King"" according to the trade rags.....a Lexus. Go figure!
It will be interesting when the C400 finally hits the streets. For what looks to be $5K-$7K less than a comparable 335ix or an S4, you get a Mercedes sports sedan."
July 2014,The issue is MB sport suspension is not very sporty. But time will tell once they hit the market and the cars get reviewed.

Personally? That '14 C350 coupe is mighty sweet. I'd be tempted to get it instead of waiting.
I also learned that the C350 coupe is relatively hard to come by vs the much more common C250. That's kind of like the 428i being much easier to find than the 435i with BMW."

I still have a soft spot for BMWs. I'm really interested in the new TLS. But, I won't be in the market for another 2-3 years, so it really doesn't matter right now, at least for me.
I will put the C400 on my shopping list, though."
July 2014,That Benz was the 2014 model right? I didn't think the 2015 C class is in the showrooms for another month or so? I can't keep track of all the model numbers anymore!
July 2014,"Mr Shiftwright.....the Benz C350 4matic wasn't a car I expected to like, but surprisingly did. Probably not a good thing for a BMW comparison drive event. I just went with my sister to help her buy a C300 4Matic sedan.
The coupe felt like a different car. The engine was stronger than the C300. It gave up some power to the really excellent twin scroll turbo 6 in the 335i. But, in the Benz, the 3.5L felt quick, I'd dare to say, fast enough (about the same as my seat of the pants feel in my TL). It was smooth. I think it may have had ""start/stop"" technology. But, compared to the BMW's implementation, it was so hard to tell, it might not have. Just goes to show what a little better engineering for something like that can achieve.
The C, while entertaining to drive, seemed more relaxed in doing it than the BMW. Granted, the BMW was probably better when driving at 10/10ths. The Benz felt better everywhere else in the driving experience.
The Benz was easier to drive fast than the BMW. I'd say that's true of the Benz over my previous S4, too. It's not as fast on an absolute basis. But, it's easier to drive fast in every day driving.
The suspension really did offer a good ride/handling feel....very well sorted, with a premium ride that not so much isolated you, but made it so you really didn't care of there was broken pavement underneath you. It stayed eminently composed while not doing anything untoward while traveling around corners and/or over bad pavement.
Materials.....very nice. The one I drove had leather......good leather....extra cost leather. Seats were better than in the BMW, but still not quite as good as in the TL. Same goes for the stereo (H/K, again). Not bad, but not nearly as good as the ELS in the Acura.
All the other materials, and their execution/build, etc were a ⅓ step above the BMW. Very nicely done...felt expensive....even the way the dials worked.
Where it falls down...who in the world designed the cruise/turn signals? How can you use one without engaging the other. They're both on the same side of the steering wheel, in the same vicinity. Somebody at Mercedes needs to lose their job over that design faux pas.
The nav and knob system felt a couple of generations behind BMW's iDrive or the Nav/buttons in my Acura. The Mercedes took forever to boot up. Once it did, it seems it took multiple inputs to do even the simplest tasks.
Whereas you could find areas of cost cutting in the BMW, you found no such items anywhere in the Benz. Everything looked, felt and functioned with a premium look and operational feel.
So, to sum up. The C350 4matic coupe is fast, comfortable, handles well, rides well, feels premium.....AND.....
It was $2K-$3K cheaper than a ""like for like"" 435ix BMW. Icing on the cake....while subjective....I found the Mercedes to look lots better than the BMW, too.
While you may get the premium customer treatment at Mercedes, maintenance is extra cost. From what I understand, a fair amount of extra cost. Perhaps this is one of those cars you never take back to the dealership for routine maintenance. Maybe this is one you get to know an indecent mechanic who is fair in what they charge."
July 2014,When I went to the Ultimate Drive at my dealer they had a 435i M Sport fitted with just about every M Performance accessory you can get. A 4er similarly equipped would be one of the few new BMWs I would actually want to own.
July 2014,"Oh yeah, please do. I have a friend who might be shopping for a C class."
July 2014,"So, last weekend, by invite, I went to the BMW drive event at my local BMW dealer.
Always a fun event. For those unfamiliar with it, BMW, through the local dealer, allows you to drive their cars, and the competitors' models, back-to-back.
I chose the 435i xDrive, as that is the successor to my beloved former 335ix coupe (E82). Total redesign....interior and exterior. As best as I could tell, the drivetrain is a little ""tamer"" in the 435. But, that could be because I had a performance package on my former coupe. Still, these are Bavarian muscle cars.
The uncommunicative steering was the most noticeable. It's not that the steering wasn't up to the chore of spirited driving. It's that you were never sure if it could do what you asked it to do. You pointed it, and the car followed, but I was never sure it would. Maybe with time and experience, you get used to it. I preferred the steering in my E92.
The other big complaint is that people felt they made the suspension to soft. I don't get that. I think the suspension is a worthy upgrade to the suspension in the E92. It soaks up broken pavement better, even at speed, without unduly upsetting the cabin. Not a huge difference over the E92 mind you. But, a worthy one. I liked it.
The new 4 is definitely bigger than my previous 3. I liked my E92. I like the F32, I think. It definitely has more ""creases"" (my technical term). Headlights are the same with the BMW ""ring"" DRLs. Plenty of room.
My tester did not have the sports seats. Coming from the sports seats in my TL SH AWD (which are some of the best in the biz, IMHO), this was immediately noticeable. Wasn't a fan of them in my E92. Still not a fan of the standard seats in the F32.
Nice dash with color heads up display.....EXCEPT.....the display disappears when wearing sun glasses. Usually BMW thinks these types of things through. This time they failed. Kind of defeats the purpose of a HUD if you can see it only on overcast days.
Whose idea was it to make that auto shifter so convoluted? It's a beer tap looking thingy. In unfortunate BMW fashion, instead of just putting it in ""D"" or ""R"" depending on what you want, you push a button, pull a lever, do this, do that, just to put it in gear. Why make something so simple, so complex?
Stereo was the standard one. I had the HK in my E92. The standard stereo is worse than the HK. The HK wasn't all that great to begin with. Neither is all that good compared to the one in my TL (ELS)....not even close.
The iDrive has evolved. It only took BMW over a decade to get it to a reasonable level of operation and ease of use. But, it's now good. You can write on the top of the little dial between the seats to input a letter. Not so good while driving. A little better when stopped. Not nearly as good as the same Audi technology on the A6 w/Nav. As has been mentioned before, the NAV screen looked like an afterthought.
The ""start/stop"" technology seems a bit smoother than the last one I drive in a 4 cal 328i. Still needs work, though.
Usually I don't sit in the back seat, particularly in a coupe. I tried it out with the 4, though. Entrance and exit weren't bad, given the (slow) electric seats that will move out of the way. But, if you're looking for cost cutting, this is where you'll find it. Back seat was filled with hard plastics that sounded very ""cheap"" when you knocked on them.
All-in-all, still drives like a BMW. Offers good handling, and decent comfort, all while going fast.....very fast. On a tech note, BMW has joined those in the top tier. iDrive is good and offers everything you could want and is relatively easy to use.
If you want the ""snob"" appeal, the BMW muscle car feel, the maintenance and warranty that covers practically everything, and the uber good BMW dealership experience where they take care of everything for you, this is your choice.
At a price, that is. My tester had an MSRP of $57K. For that kind of money (and for a whole lot less), you can find other cars that are just as good, if not better.
Still, I have a soft spot for the 3 series (now the 4). They do a whole lot really, really well. The dealer experience is superlative. I know they are the car to lease vs buy. So, maybe I'm not the person they're targeting.

July 2014,Anybody discussing cars here?
July 2014,"Hawaii 3X....Key West 2X. I'll take Hawaii. Nothing against Key West, but it seems just a little too small, and Hawaii is small enough.
I have a college friend that moved to Hawaii right after we graduated. Cost of living is obviously out of sight. But, she never looked back, As she said....""my house may not be as nice as yours, but I'm waking up everyday to the most beautiful sunrises in the world, and ending my work day to the most beautiful sunsets in the world."" Something to be said for that. Although, she bemoans not being close to main land friends and relatives. For example, when her parents passed away, she couldn't get back (for you locals, she grew up in Middletown, OH....a small rusty town) for the services. She missed them by a day.
She only gets back here about once every 5 years or more. She said when she first moved there, although she's a U.S. Citizen like the native Hawaiians are, some treated her badly, as if she were an intruder. I guess the way Hawaii became a state was not to everyone's liking when it happened. Some want the Monarchy to be put back in place. Then again, if that were done 70 years ago, they'd all be speaking Japanese right now.
She loves it there, and is willing to make that trade off for living in paradise, though."

I know I'm a little ways away, but whenever we talk about where we want to live in our retirement years, everyone mentions FL. Nothing against our Floridians here, but I just don't like it there.

I've been fortunate to have been able to travel around the US earlier in my career, so I've been able to experience a lot of what this country has to offer. Not sure how she would deal with humidity - we spent a week in NC a few years ago (in May) and it was a bit tough on her.

I could handle the Gulf, even a place like Austin. But, of the ""no socks"" areas, that's about it.....unless I become an ex pat somewhere.

Not been to Austin, though I've heard good things. She's a small town girl at heart - she grew up in Cheyenne, and we now live in a town with a population of 50K. But, she likes her shopping, so wherever we go, it would have to be somewhat close to a bigger city."

July 2014,"The question has to do with whether the drive is the deal, or the car.
I live in the West where it's possible to drive at very high speeds on virtually deserted roads, and I enjoy doing so. I also spend far too much time in commuter traffic, but that can be more pleasant driving the proper vehicle.
That said, the capabilities of most of the ""watch me and what I dirve"" cars are never even approached, unless you live out here, where there's a bit less of the ""watch me"" culture. Certainly more than there used to be (which was zero), but not so much.
I continue to watch the parade go by."

July 2014,"Loved the power of both the 335i and the S4. Seems Audi has issues with some of the cars that use recent iterations of their Quattro system, as I've seen mention in some of the trade rags about the same ""grinding"" issues I experienced.
There wasn't much on the road that could beat you in stop light wars, though. It would have to be a very recent muscle car, and the persin driving it would have to know how to launch. Or, AMG, RS, M, etc tuner cars. Aside from that, not much can touch them.
That said, I do think the TL SH AWD, while not as fast in a straight line vs the S4 or 335i (but certainly more than capable), feels more balanced, confidence inspiring and entertaining in its own right. Then, there's the elephant in the room....the significant price difference
I'm pretty excited to get behind the wheel of the TLX."
July 2014,"Driving at high speeds in virtually a straight line gets boring after a while. Fortunately my job involves a lot of driving and I often choose to take a nearly deserted rural two lane as opposed to a dull interstate slog, which allows me to enjoy the handling prowess of whichever car I'm driving. The Club Sport requires a bit of finesse and the ability to conserve momentum. You have to make sure it is always in the right gear at the right time(fortunately the pedal placement is ideal for heel/toe downshifts). In contrast, the MS3-fitted with Koni FSDs and Michelin PSS tires-simply bludgeons the road to death; just leave it in third gear, turn in really late with a bit of trailing brake, and nail the throttle once you see daylight(or, as I've said before, visualize obedience training a bipolar pit bull that is mainlining crystal meth).
Think of it this way: if the Club Sport is a Steyr SSG 69, the MS3 is a Colt AR-15 with an extended capacity magazine."
July 2014,"I have been to no less than 8 HPDEs and you are correct roadburner, you can push the cars (however the HPDEs I have attended supplied the cars for us, we weren't allowed to use our own). However, I was thinking more of the ""everyday"" that I ""remember"" from past years.
I'm not suggesting I want to get on a crowded (and ours almost always are) interstate and floor it, consequences be damned. My ""wistful"" intents are more to find a relatively deserted stretch where I can ""punch it"" with the only concern being getting a speeding ticket, not endangering the clog of cars (and their drivers and passengers, of course).
Of our many trips to Germany, some of my fondest memories have to do with taking my BMW, Mercedes or Audi rental on the autobahn and driving from Berlin to Munich where there are some fairly long stretches of the autobahn that have no speed limit.
During those driving moments I had no sense of danger or that our collective high speeds were reckless. Here, as the freeways are ever more crowded and people pass on the right or sit in the far left lane and cruise along below the posted speed limit, driving has become much more like work -- and increasingly risky work at that.
We'll go to an HPDE perhaps once or twice every five years -- always love them, but I guess I'm looking for an American Autobahn -- not gonna happen in my lifetime.
Next up our cars are going to (already are) provide ever more driver aids that take the wheel, accelerator and brake away from us.
Driving and our car culture are changing -- and I am, usually, in favor of the change. This time, however, what I am longing for is my memory restricted return to having fun behind the wheel as we did not that many years ago.

It's the weekend, it's summer -- I'm going to go out and find a curvy ""back road"" (whatever that means anymore) and carve it up.
I'll get over it in a minute.
There, I'm over it."

July 2014,"We live in a little town about 20 miles north of the CBD of Cincinnati. The routes to get from home to the CBD (approximately where my wife and I work), include I-71, looping around from north to south by sort of going east on I-275 and heading down the back road (or so it seems) of Wooster Pike and SR 50.
OK, with that much info at hand, I must say it is virtually impossible to use more than a relatively small fraction of the potential of an S4 or SQ5. I had, for about 5 seconds, thought it would be cool to change out the supercharger pulley and engine management software for more torque and horsepower.
But to what end?
There are so few opportunities where I can push my S4 -- I, so far, literally overtake every other car on any of the above mentioned hi-ways and roads. The ""joy"" of punching it on a freeway entrance ramp is something I would love to do -- unfortunately the acceleration is so quick (sub 50-seconds to 100kph) I overtake everything and end up hitting the brakes hard.
I wouldn't give up the feeling of deep wells of power and torque that these S cars offer -- but I must say, it has become virtually impossible to ""play with"" the power offered in a sane and unselfish manner.
Tuning the Auidi S's or the ""35"" BMW engines would certainly boost their power, torque and therefore increase their ""accelerative"" force and overall thrust -- but I have now reached the point that I see no merit in chipping, changing out the exhaust system, etc, since I can't use (and enjoy) the factory force available.
I assume the same frustrations are ""enjoyed"" by certain Cadillac, Mercede, Volvo, Porsche and other ""sported up"" model owners -- at least if you live in just about any medium to large US city.
You finally get a modern ""hot rod"" and you literally can only tap into a fraction of its capabilities.
Kind of a drag."
July 2014,"Yeah, my '13 XF stickered for ~$65k, but I paid significantly less. Big incentives on '13 XF ($6500, $1975 on '14 in my zip code), if she can find one and would buy last year's model new... Still, with the 6 cylinder, I'd imagine price would still be in very high $40s, low $50s for a '13. But, ya never know..."
July 2014,"Sister is a buyer. She didn't inherit the same car gene as I did. She has had her Jag for over 12 years. So, MSDs don't enter into it.
Her ""wants"" are a bit different than a ""price"" buyer......mineral white, tan leather, nav, xDrive. All that makes a loaded up 320i. And, price wise, you creep into 328i territory. But, she's not a speed demon. I think her salesperson hit it on the head when he said the 320i is the car that BMW wants to sell to hook people on the brand, regardless of what they are coming from. Really good suspension and toss able, as it's much lighter than my previous 335i coupe.
Audi is off the table based on hearing of my experience.
C class was underwhelming....still a $45K car with some equipment added on, that felt ponderous compared to the 320i.
CLA......really good looking car.....but in reality that is the ONLY thing it has going for it.
She was shocked that the Jag (XF?) she looked at had a sticker of close to $60K. Not sure what she paid for her ""S"" type a dozen years ago, but I didn't think it would have been that big of a jump. So, Jag is off the table.
We'll see how this turns out."
July 2014,"I seriously considered a3 before going for 320i. I didn't feel a3 to be any more faster (though numbers say it supposedly is) even though I think its 220hp. Also a3 lease was lot more expensive, in the range of 328i or more. But the biggest issue for me was I could not get used to the audi awd system. Never was able to take the exit like I wanted to, had to slow down lot more than I was used to a rwd bmw. But still check it out. You may like it."
July 2014,"Our '03 325i was pretty loaded up.. MSRP around $38K... 184 HP and 0-60 in about 7.1 seconds... pretty quick..

July 2014,"Stick, the 320i goes 0-60 in 6.7 sec, faster then a Hyundai Sonata Turbo or Kia Optima Turbo that have 274hp. Stops from 60-0 in 106 feet. Overall I'm happy with the car, and extra boost added has given what the 320i needed. Now for 2015, the 320i will get a power boost, officially BMW has not stated what is it, but talk is between 200-210hp, the 328i is also getting a power boost too.
Now the new M3/4 are nice cars, but are they practical? Some people will say yes and some will say no. But BMW wont have a problem selling every single one. But then again, some people are happy at buying a used car while others don't. The 320 has sold very well for BMW and I'm sure it will continue to do so."

If the dealer really wants to make a sell, they will do a dealer trade, take MSRP - 7% this is a good start on any 3 series, then subtract the 1K from that. Now since you are previous BMW owner they might give her another 1K off. Is she buying or leasing? Do you know about MSD's?"

Pickins are getting slim, given the '15s are right around the corner. '14 you get what you get. She wants mineral white with tan leather, plus nag, winter pack, etc. '14 she gets $1K incentive. '15 she has to order, but can get exactly what she wants....no $1K incentive.
Really surprised by the suspension on the CLA......it felt closer to a Cobalt than it did to a Mercedes.....no exaggeration."
July 2014,"You really should test drive the actual C class, or the A4. Those three have always been the classic three ""European Sedans"" to test drive. The CLA is a front wheel drive piece of fodder aimed at yuppies who don't know better and just want a luxury car to putter around town in. Yes, the A4 also is normally front wheel drive, but they have spent decades perfecting AWD in their cars. An A4 with AWD is a very good car to drive.

A little sobering, actually. The 320i has such a weak engine given the price you pay. BMW should just stop selling it and make the 328i the entry level model. (the 0-60 for the Mustang? not listed, but it's 5.7 seconds)"

July 2014,"well, after driving at least 1/2 a million miles in a stick, I am not sure that being more attuned has to be true. Shifting became such second nature, you just did it without really having to think about it. no different than steering or braking!"
July 2014,"I would think those who drive manuals would be in tune with car and surroundings more then auto people. I have no documentation that says manual drivers as a whole are better but this is my opinion- it seems one who drive stick would need to listen more to the engine, have a better feel for speed - prob missing other things but its a good skill to have - certainly better then texting and driving"
July 2014,"My son was the same way. I insisted he learn from the beginning (when he had a learners permit) that I teach him how to drive a manual transmission. Now, they're tough to come by. Still, I think it's good that he knows how to drive a manual."

July 2014,"Our 18-year-old learned to drive manual only because it was required in order to take dad's car to the prom. A few months later, he was ready to buy his own vehicle to take to college, and we mentioned that since he'd already learned how to drive manual, and seemed to like it, that he should look at manual shift vehicles. Not an ELLPS, but he ended up buying a manual Focus. One of the advantages we sold him on was that he wouldn't likely have to be the bad guy when non-vehicle owning students wanted to borrow his car. Sorry man, I would let you, but it's a manual shift.  Still, I was pleased that he learned and wanted to continue to use his skill. When he was in learning phase, we did continually reiterate that it's a skill he'll never be sorry to have mastered."
July 2014,"As nice as the Accord may be, and even including the fact that the Honda is somewhat larger factored in, too, well, the TLX will offer PAWS and SH-AWD. These features put the TLX into another performance category (and the TLX will also offer an 8-speed transmission and a ""sport tuned"" suspension.)
Folks that shop for Acuras do so, I think, because they don't want a Honda (hence Acura's efforts to distance the Acura lineup from Honda products as much as the corporate checkbook will tolerate).
These two cars aren't really competitive [with each other] if you axed me. The new TLX, I would assume will end up being in comparison tests with the Infiniti Q50S AWD and the Lexus IS350 AWD, to name just two.
The Infiniti and the Lexus may have an initial advantage since they are -- ""foundationally"" -- based on RWD chassis. Of course, I wouldn't count out the impact of the PAWS and SH-AWD technology making for perhaps a more interesting showdown.
Certainly these cars will want to be included in the same sentences with a BMW 3 and even the somewhat aging A4/S4 family, but I do believe the TLX will work like crazy to position itself as the alternative vehicle (alternative to the Infiniti and Lexus, to be sure).
I'll end where I began, the Acura TLX, perhaps for the first time in years, seems to have distanced itself more from the [Honda] Accord. I'll be so nutz as to suggest these two cars will rarely be cross shopped (other than perhaps the BASE FWD TLX vs the Accord).
Often wrong, never uncertain, I remain."
July 2014,"I know the wife's current gen Accord is as big as my 4th gen TL SH AWD, even though it's shorter.
I would imagine the same will be true for the upcoming TLX. Probably the way it's packaged with useable space, will be as big or bigger than the current Accord. You really have to look at the entire picture. Packaging efficiency makes a big difference in passenger comfort/room.
My wife really wanted one of the last TSXs. There just weren't many on dealer's lots, and she felt the TL was too big. So, she settled on an Accord (which she does love)."
July 2014,"I bought my '08 TSX specifically because it was smaller -- it was the Accord sold in the rest of the world. It also had a suspension designed for something other than isolation from the road and an excellent 6-speed manual. I am not of the opinion that bigger is better (I realize that I'm in the minority here as well), but reading these posts helps me understand why the Civics of today are bigger than the Accords of yesteryear."

EPA Passenger Volume = 93.3 cu ft
EPA Cargo Volume = 13.2 cu ft for base and Tech (14.3 cu ft for Advance) 
EPA Total Interior Volume = 106.5/107.6 cu ft
Compared to
As far as the Civic comparison, the 2014 Civic has an EPA rated interior volume of 107.1 cu ft total. Of this total, the cargo volume is 12.5 cu ft. **Meaning that the passenger volume for the Civic is 94.6 cu ft. **
Even the Civic is larger inside the passenger cabin than the 2015 TLX by 1.3 cu ft.
It is important to note that the 2014 Accord provides 119 cu ft of interior volume. This is more than 10 cu ft more than the 2015 TLX that only has 107.6 in the Advance model.
I assume the interior will be nicer than a civic, but I think my interest in the TLX has just died. I'm sure there are pros and cons about this, but I think I'm going to pass."
July 2014,"This whole Auto v Stick debate will never be settled, there will always be people who want a manual car, and there are more who do not. My last stick was my E90 M sport 328i, it was nice, however, it became very old when sitting on the freeway in the city of angels.. Today, you can order most BMW's with a manual. Now with the CAFE # needing to be improved all manufactures need to increase their numbers, and BMW went with Elec steering, now this can be blamed on the EPA. I also blame the oil companies, they keep diesel product low (they say there is no demand for it) but I have to say is there really a demand for mid-grade too? IF diesel was between regular and premium in price, then the advantage is really there to switch."

Exactly. The new 3er isn't a bad car, it simply doesn't drive the way a BMW should."
July 2014,"@roadburner‌
I've noted on several occasions that I think the current F30 Body 3 series would ""out-handle"" my AWD E90 328xi on a skid pad or road course. The chassis is stronger and tighter. The car is faster. But I don't know for sure because I can't feel what's going on. Its not that the current 3 series isn't a nice car. If I drove one and it was my 1st time ever driving a BMW, I wouldn't lust after it and WANT it like I did when I first drove my friend's 1995 E36 325is (SP - MT). It isn't like my Prelude with its 200 hp @ 7000 RPM & 156 lb ft of torque @ 5250 RPM that begs me to drive it every time I get behind the wheel even after over 152K miles & 12 years."
July 2014,"That is not a very accurate analogy; the BMW enthusiasts I know aren't clamoring for the return of carburetors or deletion of ABS systems; I'd even hazard a guess that most could make peace with a decent DCT/DSG as well. What they DO find objectionable is BMW's current penchant for making their cars bigger, heavier, and more insulated from the driving experience. As I've noted before, I've spent considerable seat time in several F10s and F30s and I find my son's 2004 X3 and my Mazdaspeed 3 to be far more involving drives. BMW is coming in second or third in many magazine comparisons, and their novocain-infused steering and poor ride/handling balance are a major reason for their poor showing."

F you ever get a chance (and if you can find one), test drive an ATS manual. I've shifted tractors that were better."
July 2014,You're also probably the only person in your office that even knows what Burma Shave is or the nostalgia surrounding it. My last stick was a 1975 Pinto. Marriage and a wife that will hear nothing of learning how to shift gears precluded anything but an automatic.
July 2014,"One guy at my office (besides me) knows HOW to drive a stick -- the others aren't interested in learning how. They say ""what is the advantage""? I try to suggest ""fun"" or ""connecting"" more with the overall driving experience (human/machine interface, etc).
Everyone here is under 55 years of age. I am over 60.
The baby boomers MAY be the last gen to both understand and appreciate manual transmission cars.
I usually use the phrase ""hand in glove"" when I describe stick shift driving.
I did test drive an Audi S4 manual ('14 MY) before ending up with the S-tronic.
The S-tronic was THAT good. Besides there are some few instances when I must use a valet -- my recollection of valeting my 2003 allroad were gear-grindingly painful.
I have met the enemy and he is me.
And so are you.
Burma Shave!"
July 2014,"It's not the EPA but the buying public. VW sells both manual and DSG transmissions, the DSG transmissions out sell the manual. Yes, this is a FWD, however, the modern day auto is best suited for the oil burner, and with people exceeding the EPA rating in the BMW 328d this wouldn't happen with a manual transmission. Also the only manufactures of RWD diesel are the Europeans i doubt they will import a manual."
July 2014,"Would if I could, but the EPA has rendered that choice impossible."
July 2014,Soon you most likely will also be looking overseas for a manual transmission along with said RWD diesel.
July 2014,"No one has every gone broke underestimating the taste of the Amerian public -- H.L. Mencken.
I want a medium-displacement diesel with a manual transmission. These days, VW is the only show in town, and their reliability (yeah, I know . . . I should be prepared to tolerate ""breathtakingly expensive"") is somewhat suspect.
What I'd like is a BMW 320 or 325 diesel with a manual transmission, since they've not yet discontinued RWD -- they're available in the thousands outside of the CARB-driven North American market. As a second choice, I could deal with an Audi A3 diesel with a manual. Or, I could go piss up a rope.
What I want isn't available, so I continue to tolerate what I can get. I presently drive an Acura TSX from the pre-beak era with a very nice manual transmission that drives the wrong set of wheels. It's been stone-reliable (well, there was the blower motor issue that I dealt with a month or so ago) for the whole time I've driven it (approaching 100K miles), but I've never forgiven Acura for not bringing in the diesel TSX that was promised for the model year following my purchase of the gasser that I drive. Guess what -- they couldn't meet CARB.
I drove my first modern diesel in Europe 13 years ago and have been waiting ever since for the opportunity to buy one here. I'm getting older by the day. I don't think it'll ever happen. Thanks, CARB."
July 2014,"I am probably wrong in concluding that those of us who write down our opinions and push POST COMMENT here are not exactly the kind of folks who these ELLPS car companies are marketing to. But, then again, I might be right.
The comment somewhere, ""it's missing a pedal"" is one I personally relate to -- but, well that's two of us. Audi, BMW, et al, certainly WANT our money -- but there is probably very little (if any at all) financial reason to offer 6-speed manual transmissions any more.
We're lucky -- I think -- to have the wonderful 7-speed DSG unit that Audi uses in several of its cars, I'm as fine as wine with that transmission. Heck, I've even come 'round to the 8-speed tiptronic when tuned for performance shifting.
And, even were I not happy with the 8-speed Audis and BMWs and the 7-speed unit employed by Mercedes, well, I really don't count much anymore.
BMW is selling a lot of cars these days -- up over 12%. The super-majority of these sales, I assume, came with automatic transmissions. Good for BMW. Ditto at Audi and MB -- at least I assume so. It has been ""forever"" (2004 or 2005) since I saw, let alone drove a manual transmission at an Audi or BMW dealership. My last stick was an Audi allroad -- 2003 model.
My wife's last stick was a 2005 BMW X3 3.0. Since then we've had a 2005 A6, a 2008 X3, an Infiniti 2011 FX35, a 2009 Audi A4, a 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD and now a 2014 S4 and SQ5.
In this (the examples of the cars we've owned) one way, our buying probably represents more of what most ""real"" people actually buy. Although I would argue that those who buy Audi's S and RS cars and BMW's M's, and Mercedes AMG's no matter how poshed-up, may not be the manufacturers' main, or primary customers.
If BMW 3 series cars really have fallen out of favor with many of their previous customers, I would agree (with whoever posted this idea) that for every ""die hard Bimmer-file"" that leaves the fold, several new to the fold customers come on-board. Ditto the message for Audi and Mercedes -- lose 1, gain 5 (or whatever the number might be).
There were die-hard horse and buggy customers -- back in the day -- too.

July 2014,"The E92 has long been a favorite of mine, I like the looks as well as the performance. The is package is really just icing on the cake..."
July 2014,Thanks. I saw a few with decent low miles in the $35-40K range. Just thinking...
July 2014,"It's just the Aero package and suspension and seats nothing else. The M235i is the complete package extra HP, larger brakes and extra suspension parts. The MPPK can be had for the 335i. but that doesn't add the extra suspension items or larger brakes."
July 2014,They are quite nice; a bit of extra power plus an overboost function. Just about my favorite non-/// M 3 Series of that vintage.
July 2014,Anybody have any feedback on the 335is? Never drove one but the write ups make it sound like a real BMW.
July 2014,"Currently the only new BMWs I would consider owning are the M235 and the M6 Gran Coupe. I also drove a M Sport 435i fitted with a raft of M Performance parts and it wasn't bad aside from the total lack of steering feel.
I had an F30 loaner while my son's E83 X3 was being serviced, and when I jumped back into the X3 even I was surprised at how much better the truck's steering felt. As it is, if I ever do buy another Bimmer it will be a friend's 135i M Sport fitted with Dinan Stage 2 software. I also wouldn't kick a Z4 M Coupe out of the garage..."
July 2014,I believe you can get an M performance package for the 335i 4-door.
July 2014,"I think BMW can cater to both, look at the M235i, and M cars, but it would nice if BMW did build a M328i or M335i."
July 2014,"If Munich wants to pander to poseurs and badge hounds that is their choice- but I believe that any short term market gains will be overshadowed when they become just another car company without a clue as to what distinguishes them from other marques.

A company that doesn't have a set of core values to guide them will eventually pay the price. Just look at Mercedes; they ashcanned their ""Engineered Like No Other Car in the World"" mission statement in favor of a more affordable/attainable line of vehicles- a three pointed star in every pot, if you will. M-B is still climbing out of that hole..."
July 2014,"All Im saying is that bmw sales YTD are up 12.1%. They will use whatever formula sells the most cars and keeps pace with their competition.

Sorry to burst the bubble but they just don't care about what a few of their customers want. They want to sell cars, and currently are doing a very good job."
July 2014,"Majority? Make that VAST majority; most new BMW owners think ""trailing throttle oversteer"" is a band that used to open for Kansas.
Here's an excerpt from a post I wrote back in March 2012- after attending my BMW dealer's reception for the introduction of the F30:
First Class as usual- valet parking, open bar, all manner of hors d'oeuvres, and a raffle for an iPad3. The new 3er is an attractive piece, but my thoughts were straying to a 2011 135i M Sport over in the Pre-Owned lot.
Pathetic story of the evening: I'm looking at 328i Sport Line and a salesman asks me what I think. I tell him that it's nice, but that it is missing a pedal(the car has a slushbox). A guy standing next to him says ""I like automatics- I want to get in the car and not have to do anything."" I told him that if I can't take the car on the track I'm not buying it- and the guy replies, ""I'd never take my car to the track; especially after I spent three hours washing it."" My son(17 at the time, driving a 1975 2002) laughed about ""The Dork"" for the rest of the evening, but all I could do was silently pray: ""Dear Lord, deliver the BMW marque from all poseurs. Cast them all into the Lake of Fire- or even worse, make them drive an Aveo, Festiva, or Yaris for all Eternity."""
July 2014,I suspect a majority of BMW owners are in those cars for the image rather than the driving.
July 2014,"Seems sort of like how Holiday Inn has free wifi, but you pay $15 for it at the Hilton, etc..."
July 2014,"I did test drive the X3 with the top view monitor and it was about 90% as good as the Infiniti -- and of course was breathtakingly expensive compared to the Infiniti.

July 2014,"So in other words, it's a smart business move for a marque that has built its success by striving to be ""The Ultimate Driving Machine"" to build overweight numb steering luxo-barges while several of their direct competitors(Audi, Cadillac, Lexus) build better BMWs than Munich. Allow me to quote Peter M. De Lorenzo:
""By selling something acceptably agreeable for all, it’s all but guaranteed that BMW will fail to elicit passion from anyone.

July 2014,"Hmmm disagree with the statement that 99% of drivers are operators. Or if it is true, than bmw has built its company on that 1% of people that prefer the majority of cost in a car to be in the engine/suspension/driving dynamics (when bmw drivers call the interiors ""driver focused"" this is code for not as fancy/nice/supple as other cars in those price ranges). I think they're recent expansion into more comfortable, diverse cars is simply an attempt to take market share in other categories. Anyone that says ""bmw is deviating from their core customer"", just doesn't have any common business sense. 
My 2 cents!"
July 2014,"@nyccarguy said:

But you enjoy driving- 99% of people behind the wheel are ""operators"" at best- and they are attracted by bells and whistles. When I covered the intro of the E93 I noted that it would sell like hotcakes even if it had the driving dynamics of a Chevrolet Cobalt..."
July 2014,"That's sort of an ongoing discussion here. It's all in the eye of the beholder. Do you value the ""luxury"" or the ""performance?"" Are you looking for the perfect blend of both? For $35K (MSRP) you can get an Accord Touring with every single bell, whistle, & piece of latest technology available today or you could get a lightly optioned Audi A3 or Mercedes-Benz CLA 250.
My current 2011 BMW 328xi doesn't have a backup camera. My former 2010 Acura TSX did. Guess which one I like driving better?"
July 2014,"That's sort of my point. If Honda can put these features on an 18,000 car, is it asking to much for an ""luxury"" vehicles to have this as standard equipment?"
July 2014,It must have been a Civic EX which does come with cloth seats and Honda's Lanewatch. back Up Cameras are standard on ALL Civics.
July 2014,"I went to dinner last night with a friend in her new Honda civic. The backup camera has lines and the move to adjust to the steering wheel. When the right turn signal is pushed (or when pushing in on the end of the turn signal ""pole"") a camera comes on showing the right side of the car (i.e. blind spot) and that camera also has lines. Interesting that this technology comes standard in the civic. I believe it was a base civic as it had cloth interior and no satellite radio."
July 2014,"I have a 2008 TL and a 2013 MDX. The TL does not have lines but a fairly decent rear camera. The MDX has the ""lines"" and 3 views from 2 cameras. Fairly accurate and reliable. However, I still turn my head around to get a wider perspective on what's around. Now, my 2011 335i 2-door does not have a camera but an outstanding proximity sensor system. I find this system more reliable because it audibly warns me of every obstacle on the entire rear side of the vehicle when reversing. Comes in very handy when backing up into my tight garage.
Regarding the German vs. Japanese car comparison, both my Acuras are great vehicles and I will not trade them. However, my BMW gives me a smile each time I accelerate around a turn. The interior ergonomics are ""different"" and takes time to learn but the quality of materials and engineering is first rate. Take for example the windshield wipers. BMW perhaps makes one of the best wipers in the business. The rain-sensing wipers have never let me down even during driving in heavy rains at 80-90 mph because the vehicle is designed from the ground up to be driven fast. Same goes for my headlights which are bi-level xenon. With my poor eyesight and sensitivity to glare, the BMW is the only car I take out at night because they make absolutely wonderful auto-dimming exterior and interior mirrors. Even the seat belt assist (who I lovingly refer to by name) has an intelligence to it and does not extend if there is no one in the passenger seat, the door is not closed, or if the car is in Drive. These are subtleties and design elements that still make, in my opinion, the German cars stand out from Japanese counterparts.
Sorry for the long post."
July 2014,"The 2012 TL I had, did have ""lines"" that would eventually pop up on the backup camera image -- but they did not articulate to track with the steering wheel -- these fixed lines were, in my opinion, worse than no lines.
My wife's FX, on the other hand had the ""all-around-view"" monitor -- now THAT's valuable tech and sadly is only available on BMW's and Audi's of a certain model and/or with a special (high cost) driver assistance package.
I did test drive the X3 with the top view monitor and it was about 90% as good as the Infiniti -- and of course was breathtakingly expensive compared to the Infiniti.
Interesting ""opinion"" from Bob Lutz in the current R&T magazine in response to a question posed to him essentially wondering why German cars are often held up as the zenith of automobiles.
Lutz essentially gave a response that said something like this: ""German cars used to be at the top, and they still may be, but everyone else can do the same thing as the Germans these days.""
I would assume Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Porsche and VW, too, would beg to differ.
Although, there is a point there -- when C&D crowns #1 to a Lexus in a comparison article and the BMW 3 series is #2, you know the times they are (at least once) a changin'.
Still loving the S4 -- but every time I see the IS350 F-Sport, I do pause for a nano second -- there, I'm over it.
Happy Fourth, Campers"
July 2014,"No, the Lexus RX has no lines according to the dealer. They get a lot of questions on it and don't know why Lexus didn't include the lines on the RX. My friend has gotten used to not having the lines fairly quickly though so I don't think it's a big deal. The camera itself is good and the car has proximity alerts that beep when getting close to something in addition to the backup camera."
July 2014,There is probably a setting for the backup camera to show the guide lines or not. I know it's a selection for my Explorer.
June 2014,The camry I rented last month had lines in the backup camera.
June 2014,2014 Lexus RX350 doesn't have lines in the backup camera. I don't know if the Corolla does or not.
June 2014,On the audi connect and the t-mob problem just another example of do you really need it? I let mine expire and have not missed it- my iphone does everything better. I say save the 15 bux. The bmw charging 900 bux for something should not be a surprise- they charge for everything. Think about the poor sob who thinks he got a deal on a 320 and lives up east. 40k with a nav and 180hp.
June 2014,"It seems to me that the electronic features of these cars hits the showroom floor one generation behind (sometimes more); wouldn't you win friends (and customers) and influence people if you could market your cars as having the ability to be kept current (at least insofar as some ""electronic"" systems are concerned?)
Funny that you would say that. I have read Q50 forums that complain about the technology problems - essentially ""not ready to be marketed"". 30 seconds for the backup camera to come one; no lines on the backup camera. Come on - I think these things are standard equipment on a Toyota corolla! My neighbors new BMW 335i sport package - he didn't get the backup camera because it was a $900 option. $900 option for a backup camera? I think most cars, even economy cars, come standard with a backup camera."

June 2014,"Other than the easy answer: Marketing or Money, why can't we upgrade our cars telematics and other electronic items?
I don't know if you know this, but Audis come with a pretty neat technology called ""Audi Connect."" It is provided at no charge for 6 months then it is simply shut off if you don't elect to subscribe to it (at $30 per month or the equivalent of $15 per month for a $450 lump sum payment).
Audi connect through 2014 MY's utilizes T-Mobile as a carrier to provide Internet connectivity and the ability to turn your car into a WiFi hotspot. Using Audi connect and apparently some neat software from Google, many desirable features are offered that are probably worth up to $15 per month on a month-to-month payment plan.
The thing is the carrier is T-Mobile. I can't begin to tell you how poor T-Mobile is -- and when it is at full-strength, it is 3G, very slow and often drops down to 2G, and, well, has very poor signal coverage here in our River City.
Sitting right on the showroom floor, however, is a new Premium+ A3 with 4G LTE AT&T Audi connect. It fires right up, goes about 3 or 4 times faster and is quicker to start-up to boot.
So Audi calls me and wants me to re-up my Audi connect plan -- I do offer $15 per month paid monthly, not $450 in one lump -- IF I can swap out the simm card or the radio itself, for a new carrier -- AT&T would be fine, so would Verizon.
Now I do understand that you may be loving T-Mobile if you're in certain areas of the US. But what may be good in Baltimore sucks in Cincinnati from a phone coverage, speed and drop-out perspective.
I've had Sprint, Verizon and AT&T (currently with AT&T since I got off my BlackBerry -- which was RIMM wasn't it?) The only service I've ever had any issues with is, you guessed it T-Mobile.
You'd think there is a little radio device behind the face of the dashboard that is, after all, a cell-phone. Just like when I got rid of the BlackBerry and went with the iPhone (and changed service providers), there ought to be a way to swap out the tech -- not buy a whole new car for pity's sake.
My friend has a private plane -- the thing must be a million years old, but ""the avionics"" are as current as can be just as the engine and the whole plane are ""overhauled"" annually to keep them ""jus like new"".
It seems to me that the electronic features of these cars hits the showroom floor one generation behind (sometimes more); wouldn't you win friends (and customers) and influence people if you could market your cars as having the ability to be kept current (at least insofar as some ""electronic"" systems are concerned?)
I probably answered my own question, the reason these systems are not ""allowed"" to be updated with new tech has to do with marketing and money not feature and function.
I'd re-up for Audi connect in a heartbeat -- but not with T-Mobile as the service provider; what are you nuts?"

June 2014,"RB....have you tested an M235i, yet?"
June 2014,As I mentioned in another topic. my salesperson at my BMW dealer gave me a line on a 2011 135i M Sport with DCT and every option but SiriusXM. Plus it has Dinan Stage 2 software(IIRC). The guy is ordering a new M235i. I prefer the 1er- communicative steering and bags of power and torque.
June 2014,"Well, I also know you're highly hung up on the M235i as well, so I can't say I'm too surprised.
Though, $80K for an M4 seems like quite an awful lot, but it was still more than $10 grand cheaper than the 911.
I think the M235i for, what, $50K seems to give you more bang for the buck."
June 2014,"Sorry, that's what I get for writing and watching TV at the same time..."

June 2014,"The latest issue of Car and Driver contains a comparison test of the M235i and the 911. The 2er won, more as a result of the Bimmer's low price(relative to the 911, anyway) than it being the superior driver's car..."
June 2014,"Reliability - since I was able to own my own car-let's rewind-
leased the 2000 acura integra gs-r, great car but again like most here it's a lease so didn't over due it with maintence besides oil and rotations, zero issues...it was a honda so bullet proof and prob the best car with an acura badge - certainly for under 25k at the time, (for those who will argue the NSX and 6 speed legend type 2 are better cars but cost thousands more)- this acura hit a snow bank and had its nose bent with its buggy eyes - was able to snap the plastic bumper back into place. The five speed throws I still have dreams about and the 8200? Rpm limit was something else, let's not forget about the start of v-tec, the v-tec where at 2 different levels you would get the umph. Man I should of bought that car, infact I extend the lease 4 extra months because I had no ideas what to get next.
03- wanted a 6 with a 6- few options - considered Cl, thing Mazda had the 6, wanted a 330 but inflated price, went with jetta gli. Car while very attractive with heated cloth sports seats and nice rims had issue ps with monsoon radio as it had a passenger volume bias that drove me insane at times. Went back to dealer 10 times in 3 years for non-oil changes. Car was purchased at a good deal and after 4 yr warrantee was up I was quick to exchange at good value for the loved Infiniti g.- at the end was very worried I would spend a lot of time at VW.
07- g35x - great car- sure it was now an auto, and a bigger sedan but with the power and yhe tech could not be beat at the time, considered many others but nothing compared at the cost. Had the car for 7 model years, went back for brakes, bought new tires and had a issue with the window seals- at the end I also had it back for a drive train belt that snaped on way to work, car was towed and work done at dealer for a cost around 200 bux. Best car you could own- but at the end I thought with the tech and power it was a good idea to move on.
Audi 13 s4 - 17k or so - I've owned for 3500 miles no issues yet- but knowing the costs and brand I will be monitoring and deciding around warrantee time on next move. So much tech, power and random items to worry about, I am not a person who wants to spend a lot on a car, and would rather downgrade then deal 
with the added cost. Sorry about the long post-"
June 2014,I try not to think about it...
June 2014,...psst - lots of the parts in your Japanese or European car are made by UAW employees....
June 2014,You can't compare UAW cars from 20 years ago to the ones built today. I had my first Chrysler 200C 2015 model and was impressed with it. The new Chevy Impala as well as Malibu are lights years ahead in the cars they replace. The same with the Ford Fusion. Some of the blame really needs to go with the companies since they allowed those poorly built cars to leave the factory.
June 2014,My issue with the UAW is the 5 UAW-built vehicles I bought. Bought them while in the service (retired military) thinking it was patriotic. Now believe it was stupidity that took me back to purchase another disaster. I now look at it a bit differently and think of it like this: IF I dated a woman and it was a disaster I probably wouldn't want to date her four sisters one after the other. Perhaps wisdom does come with age.
June 2014,"I have an awful lot of respect for the UAW. At one point in my life, I was a UAW member. They work hard, long hours, with pride. Go to the Corvette factory or the Jeep factory, and you'll see that all day, every day.
Have they outlived their usefullness? Perhaps, particularly given their inability to affect the recent automotive crisis (not sure they could have if they wanted to).
I love BMWs (x3). I love Acuras (x3), too. They're my two favorite brands. BMWs have robust drivetrains with many times sublime suspensions. They can and do cost more to maintain over time (first four years are covered, which means you have to deduct those maintenance fees in your equation). After that, you keep that maintenance up, and they car be reliable over a long period of time. Those charges are more than what I've experienced on an Acura.
Acuras will be reliable, for a long period of time, with little in the way of maintenance (certainly much cheaper than after warranty maintenance on a BMW).
Can't say one is better made than the other. Both have high quality materials.
Both brands are great in my estimation....for different reasons. Choice is good, though."
June 2014,"That is the reason I love my 1995 Club Sport; over 19 years, 138,000 miles, and countless HPDE laps it has only needed a thermostat, a heater hose fitting, 2 LCABs, a few bulbs, one set of pads/rotors and a couple of serpentine belt idler pulleys. Aside from that I just service the car according to the SI system, except that I change the brake fluid every six months when the car sees the track. And of course it has consumed several sets of EHP tires...
I am never selling it."
June 2014,"I don't think many are confused between routine wear and tear vs. unexpected or repetitive repairs. Everyone knows oil has to be changed, brakes wear out, tires need replacing, etc."
June 2014,"I, too, am a firm believer in preventative maintenance. In addition to what the factory suggests, I change oil & filter ever 4k miles, I flush the cooling system annually, I flush power steering fluid every 2 years, etc, etc, etc. I just got tired of little electrical things constantly being in need of repair, windshield seals leaking (VW), alternators going bad, relay switches going out, fan motor going out, etc."
June 2014,"I think people confuse reliability with normal wear and tear items. If people plan on keeping care for years then spending money on routine maintenance will cost. My E46 3 series had no issues of reliability but I also made sure the services were kept up to-date. Right out of College, I went to work for Sony, I had bought a MB 300SDL (used) as my business car (yeah it was an over kill) and ended up turning into a Demo car for Sony car audio products. I bought the car with 36K miles on and after 10 yrs sold it with 225K miles on it. That car was stone reliable, but it was taken in to the dealer for it's services according to the maintenance book that was provided by MB. Three issues with the car after 100K where covered by MB because of known problems would be the only black eye I had with the car. I believe if you follow the recommended service for cars you wont have issues, granted I lost count of how many window regulators had to be replaced on the MB,."
June 2014,"In 2007, when looking for a car for my wife to commute in, I was down to a Jetta and the Mazda6. I have a nephew that is a VW tech and not a lightweight tech either. He was recruited from a dealership in Maryland to a huge dealership in a midwest city complete with all moving expenses and and nice up front bonus. I had no idea that auto mechanics had these kinds of opportunities. Anyway, I asked him if it were him which one would he choose and he asked me how long I planned on keeping the car. I told him if we liked the vehicle we usually kept a car for 6-7 years. He told me without a doubt get the Mazda or I would be a frequent visitor to the repair shop after warranty and it wouldn't be cheap. I think with his many years of experience he knew what he was talking about and took his advice. Her car has been absolutely trouble free for 7 years and 109k. Not a dime on repairs, just normal maint. Oh, I take that back.....I've replaced two light bulbs."
June 2014,"I also had an audi 5000 and I spent a small fortune on mine. I bought it used (2 years old) when I first went to Ramstein Air Base Germany. It didn't have a lot of miles on it when I got it and it didn't have a lot of miles on it when I got rid of it, but it spent plenty of time getting little things fixed. My second assignment to Germany saw me getting a 318i. Great little car until it learned that I'd pay for electronic repairs. It seemed to have a mind of its own and loved to have little things fixed. In the US, I had 2 diesel rabbits (made about 50 miles from my hometown) and perhaps because they were ""diesel"" they provided a license to steal when they went to the shop. Lots of little things that nickel and dimed me to death.
I won't even go into the UAW-built cars I have owned. I will not even consider buying a car built by the UAW. Since going Japanese, I have been most happy. Very reliable! I think I'm going to stick with Japanese. My wife wants to ""step up"" a notch and thus the look at Infiniti and Acura. She says the Avalon is for ""old people"", but I know better than to ask what age she is talking about. She turns 59 next month and I know she wants something before she hits 60. To be honest, I can handle just about anything (other than European or UAW-built), but will buy whatever she likes. I'm pretty sure it will be Japanese."
June 2014,"Durability kicks in well after the warranty expires; the truly durable cars are owned by people who eventually get tired of not being able to find replacement parts because the car has been out of production for 10 or 15 years. My Datsun 510 was one of these, so I ended up with a Miata. Not such a bad outcome.
This is a concept lost on the majority of people who post here (or anywhere else)."
June 2014,"The words reliable and durable do give my wife and me pause -- but, gulp, we went ahead and bought our first car EVER, the SQ5. I leased the S4, but with the intention of buying it off lease -- we'll see how the word durability holds up to time and miles.
With respect to reliability, however, I would have to say my European cars have not lacked reliability, but the longest I ever kept one was 66,000 miles (a 2005 Audi A6), so I am probably not the poster boy to tout European reliability.
My negative reliability experiences all have had to do with American cars -- and mostly Chrysler cars, at that. The thing is, as ""unreliable"" as the American cars proved to be, well, it was pretty close to impossible to KILL one of them -- so I guess I would say I've had unreliable, yet durable cars -- and I thought, at one point, ""why can't I have both?""
Sit down: Then I bought a brand new AMC ""American Eagle"" -- my first AWD car (pre Audi, if you can believe it -- but I am, after all 62 years old). Holy cow, talk about a rolling pile of junk -- if it wasn't welded on, it fell off. The brakes were ""same day"" affairs -- but the thing had a plaid cloth interior and a really cool steering wheel (leather wrapped). And, hey, it WAS AWD (I assume, after all, it was a Jeep with an AMC Concorde body mashed on the frame) and it would go where no one has gone before in all kinds of weather. This was pre-trail rated, but -- idiot that I was -- I took it soft roading and had no fear going at least a little bit off road, too.
Taking it into the dealer was a real treat, too -- something was always needing to be salved with money. I couldn't wait to be able to afford an Audi -- got my first FWD one in 1977 a 1978 5000.
Anyway, I guess I am at a point where I really do expect, nay, demand both reliability and durability -- I get your desire for the same and hence your conclusion to go Acura or Infiniti.
I'll echo, somewhat, the above statement by quoting my wife who I asked ""why not get another Infiniti -- the thing has been trouble free?""
Her reply: ""Infiniti ain't got no soul.""
In short: ""Cutty says 'e can't hang!"" (Airplane -- jive talk scene)

June 2014,"Maybe it's a 335. IDK. But I do know it's a 2014. They bought it off the showroom floor and it now has 1,200 miles on it after 2 months."
June 2014,"Just a FYI, your neighbots BMW is not a new one, since they do not have a 330i in the current line up."
June 2014,"The dilemma seems to be that nothing gives the passion of an Audi or BMW, but then there's the maintenance and repair costs if you keep the car a long time. With Acura you get Honda reliablity and 80-90% of the experience. I had an Audi and loved it but got rid of it sooner than most any other car. I have my Acura at 140K and it's been very reliable but I still miss the Audi..."
June 2014,"Thank you, markcincinnati. I'm looking forward to the TLX coming out. Our neighbor just bought a BMW 330i with sport package. We alternate driving when we go out together and my wife doesn't like the car because it sits too low, rides too rough (rigid) and she thinks the interior is cheap (leatherette). I have owned a number of European cars (two while stationed there and two while living in the US) and I swore I'd never own another (frequent and high maintenance costs). We've been taking a lot of trips and will get serious about buying when we return from our trip to Maine in August. I think we're leaning toward Q50, TLX, maxima or murano, but my wife is likely to throw a curveball and pick something totally different. It is good to get honest feedback (educated) from people who own these cars, though."
June 2014,"wayne21: I very much enjoyed most of the experience of owning an 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance. I had added the rear parking sensors and the ""factory"" splash guards to the car and I, to this day, call my TL, my ""Honda S4"" or my ""Acura S4"" -- the car must've come with 3-bent wheels, which may be the reason I thought the brake rotors were warped and had them turned three times (all under warranty).
Once the wheels were replaced (with a 50% credit from Acura), the car was smooth and the brakes didn't chatter or feel warped in any way.
I got the idea to call the TL my ""Acura S4"" not from an original thought, but from an Automobile test report where the S4 and the TL were compared even though the report observed most folks would probably NOT cross shop the two cars (they were some $11,000 apart, too -- the Audi was more expensive, of course).
I got tired of the Acura feeling about 90% of what I had hoped it would be -- which is actually a compliment considering I was comparing it to a car that was about 25% more money.
In any case, my Audi dealer (who is also an Acura dealer, go figure) made me a deal I couldn't refuse once he found out I had ordered a new Lexus IS350AWD F-Sport. Bought out the Acura lease (less than a year to go as I recall) and gave me a discount of 6% off the sticker of a new S4 configured exactly as I wanted it.
At the same time, my wife's Infiniti (2011 FX) was also coming off a 39 month lease and, yes, you guessed it, the Audi dealer (also an Acura dealer) is also an Infiniti dealer and once they got wind of my wife's tap dancing with a new BMW X3, made her an offer on a new Audi SQ5, that she couldn't refuse.
During our shopping adventure, we test drove the daylights out of all the usual (and some unusual) suspects.
I oh so wanted the Q50S/AWD to be the ""it"" car for the 2014 MY. It was good, maybe almost very good -- but for the money that I had to pay for the 2014 S4 I ended up with, I couldn't do it. BTW, probably not gonna make any friends, but I think I'd rather have the Q50/S than the 3 serires BMW we tried.
In any case, I want to be supportive of your pre-decision to go with the new '15 TLX SH-AWD, the Acura's can still make (for me) a pretty good value case, even if they are kind of an ""S4 lite."""
June 2014,"Wayne21- the dealer add on to sticker in my experience has been on newer well wanted cars- I would doubt the acura dealer would purposely add massive fluff to an acura TL, and if they did you could call bluff pretty easy because fact is acura is not selling many TLs. Good luck with the search, church and Vensa."
June 2014,"I plan to wait until the 2015s are out (TLX and Maxima) to seriously car shop, but I was out of town today and stopped by an infiniti and an acura dealership to just check out their cars. Not to test drive them, but was interested in the ease of entry/exit (a very important issue for the wife) and the interior appearance. Infiniti Q50 - nice that the passenger seat elevates! I think wife may be able to get in/out without any difficulty. It was a base model and I thought the interior was fine in spite of the vinyl (I would pay the extra for leather). It's been awhile since I looked at an Altima, but I don't think the Q50s interior was any nicer (maybe not even as nice) than the top of the line Altima. I also didn't understand why there was a spare tire taking up such a large portion of a small trunk in a car that has run-flat tires. But I realize the idea behind the Q50 isn't a ""nice interior"". I had read a number of sites that talked about an odor in the Q50 when left in the heat. I looked at one on the showroom floor (not in the heat) and didn't detect anything. It's a car I could own.
Then to the acura dealer just for a look. Looked at the TL with tech package on the floor. I was not impressed. I hope the TLX has a nicer interior. I thought the leather surfaces were nice, but I thought the materials used elsewhere on the interior were pretty cheap - a lot of hard plastic! The passenger seat elevated which was nice to see, but it seemed that in elevating the passenger seat it would be a bit harder to get in and out (harder than the Q50). I think it was the layout of the dash that forced me to move the seat all the way back to get it in that may make it hard for my wife to get in/out. Will wait until seriously shopping and have the wife try it out in the TLX. I am no fan of dealerships adding things to the car and this particular dealership adds about $3,000 to each sticker. I may be off by the individual numbers, but it was $500 for theft marking (if someone steals my car I don't want it back!), $700 to wax the car and spray the interior with scotch guard (I prefer turtle wax ice sealant and my own scotch guard - about $15 for both - and unlike the high school kid working for them that doesn't care about my car, I will do a good job  and not miss anything), $750 for wheel locks, mud guards and a rubber mat in the trunk (a mat I wouldn't want in my car) and some other overpriced stuff I wouldn't be interested in and wouldn't pay for. I would pass on the car before paying for any of those things.
If I had to choose between the two, it was a no-brainer. It would be the Q50. I don't think I would even be interested in the TL. But once the TLX and maxima are out I'll seriously shop. Just one person's opinion... the guy that's going to pay for it. Not trying to step on anyone's toes or insult anyone. My wife is most interested in something that not everyone has. We bought a Toyota venza in 2010 and that was one of the reasons for purchasing it (as well as incredibly easy entry/exit for her). The people two doors down from us bought the same green venza. At church, we have 4 green venzas and 1 white venza (ours and the white one are the only 6 cylinders) and 3 of the green venzas (1 of which is ours) park side by side at the church (handicap parking)!"
June 2014,Glad you are enjoying your ride Sweeney - now you see what us European aficionados find appealing about these cars!

June 2014,"@wayne21 - enjoy retirement - good for you not worried about resale- I will say I recently saw a v6 genesis, the 2015 version on the road and was impressed by its looks and stance. If you are looking for something comfy this could be something to consider."
June 2014,Thanx roblaw. I think we're going to wait until the TLX and the new maxima are available before we make a decision. We're in our 50s and retired and I'm not really concerned about the cost or resale. I am more concerned with getting what we want and I think that after looking at these cars we'll have a better idea for what we want. It is good to get honest feedback from people who have driven these cars though.
June 2014,"The Genesis is a very quiet car and the 2015 Genesis is probably quieter still. But you have to know what you want. The TLX is likely to be sportier than a Genesis. The new Genesis is a full on luxury car with a premium interior and wonderful seats. It handles well but I will bet the TLX will be tidier, if for no other reason than it is will smaller and Honda has a good rep for tidy handling cars. The Genesis It is going to weigh probably 400+ lbs. more than a TLX is you compare the 3.5 TLX to a 3.8 Genesis. It is probably almost a foot longer. I will bet the TLX will handle better, be faster, be pretty quiet and get much better fuel economy (and front wheel drive will be better in bad weather as compared to the RWD Genesis unless you purchase the AWD model which will cost more and have even worse mileage).
It really depends on what you want and what you are willing to spend. Also, as great a car as the new Genesis is, its resale will probably be lower than the TLX because of the perception of Hyundais and the price (probably comparable to the TLX when comparably equipped). This will affect the overall cost of the vehicle whether you buy and hold or lease and dump.
So drive a lot of cars and try to ignore preconceived notions, as hard as that is. I think Acura/Honda is coming back from its worst years and probably still makes excellent cars. Hyundai also makes fine cars today (remember the 1986 Excel?). There is an amazing array of great cars in the TLX/Genesis price range that meet a wide variety of needs.
Good luck with your purchase."

June 2014,"I will say my wife's 11 crv does have a lot of wind sounds- I don't mind driving it in yhe city with sunroof open but hate it on long halls- I find it better on highway with a thule cargo rack then without it, maybe just me.
Audi and bmw good with wind from my dealings, Infiniti was good when new but after a few years I noticed the wind and had the dealer replace the moldings ( @flightnurse) for no charge and sound was fine. Acura wind could be from pronounced grill ? Kidding"
June 2014,I agree with @stickguy. My wife's 2011 Pilot is very quiet and I don't notice wind noise. Nor did I in my former 2010 Acura TSX. I hear a lot of noise coming from my 2001 Prelude. Mostly intake & exhaust. If there was wind noise I wouldn't notice it in that car:)
June 2014,"well, only way to tell for sure is drive one and see.
I think this is something that is very subjective though. I have a new style RDX, and notice no wind noise. I also never noticed any on my 2005 Odyssey, 2005 Accord, or 2000 TL (still have that one).
about the only noise is tire noise on certain surfaces, but I never considered that objectionable even on bad pavement.
maybe not quite as tomblike as a Camry or Lexus, but far from driving an old Wrangler with a loose top!"
June 2014,"Thank you, sweendogy. I had seen those sights before when googling wind noise and acura. My wife doesn't want another Toyota (we have a 6 cyl venza) or Honda (had an accord). I had a 2000 accord and it had tons of wind noise. In 2005, I looked at an accord (knowing about wind noise) and the wind noise was very obvious to me on each one we test drove so we bought a ford. In 2010, I test drove a couple accords and could hear wind noise on the test drives (ez to do when you actively listen for it) so we bought a Toyota. I have test driven and ridden in a few new accords (close friend has a 2014) and can hear the wind noise (my friend hears nothing). Wife doesn't want another ""car that everyone else has"" so I thought we'd step up. I know a number of people with acuras and when I ask them about wind noise they all say yes it is noticeable, but tolerable. I'm not interested in hearing wind noise. I'd think Honda could figure out how to build cars without wind noise.
Cars I'm considering - Acura TLX (agree on the first year model thing, but thought it to be a worth a look - just the wind noise issue associated with acuras/hondas), Infinit Q50 (don't care for the option packages I have to buy to get what I want), and the pending 2015 maxima (a significant update that I don't know much about, but my wife likes the looks of the car). I might even consider a Hyundai genesis sedan. The venza runs great and we're not in a hurry, but if the right ""upscale"" car comes along I'd buy it. (Car buying is a ""two vote"" for us - with no pressure to sway a vote  so I think I'll wait to at least look at a maxima before buying, but I'm not sure when they're coming out - I think Sept."
June 2014,"Welcome Wayne to mostly ELlPs, the TLX could be a good choice and looks better and should perform well in the class- I would be a little weary around buying a first year car but with a honda you should be ok.

The acura TLX is one that I've been waiting for, but have recently had some concerns. Although not a scientific sample, I've spoken to 8 people who own the TL (2007 - 2012), TSX (2010 - 2014) and MDX (2014). I had read a lot of people complaining about one issue with their acuras and it seems they have the same problem as the accord - wind noise (that is one of the reasons I bought a Toyota in 2010 instead of another accord - wind noise). Every one of the people I spoke to said they had wind noise from the windows. Is this a fluke or is this representative of what I can expect if I buy an acura?"

June 2014,"rbirns1 - I disagree with your observations and conclusions regarding watch/car metaphors.
On the other hand I violently agree with your right to your opinion and your right (unless someone here at Edmund's objects) to say it long and loud.
I believe the ""data"" and ""professional opinion"" supporting your conclusions about watches, however, would be difficult, perhaps nearly impossible to come by.
I do believe the same data-deprived statement could actually be made about cars, too -- please note I am NOT being serious here, just ironic or perhaps sarcastic (sometimes difficult to carry off in one of these postings without it inadvertently coming off as a personal criticism, which it is not meant to be):
""A car has just one function, and all cars pretty much handle that function the same.""
I sincerely hope no one here thinks that would even remotely be true.
But I do believe there is plenty of data and opinion to support the notion that [luxury] watches and cars (and even pens, damnit) have many attributes, not just a single one.
The metaphor suggested -- or was meant to suggest -- attributes or characteristics that would help provide ""color commentary"" about luxury or premium products, the marketing of said products and the market for same.
Like I said, about myself, ""I'm often wrong, just never (or seldom) uncertain.""
Cheers."
June 2014,"Both items have a specific, basic function. But, then, as you note, many facets and variations on a theme. Yes, cars offer more variables both by necessity, design and for profit.

June 2014,"I think disagreement regarding FWD is a good thing. I have had many -- or at least ""several"" FWD cars from US and German mfgrs over the years and I found them worthy of many things, perhaps even inclusion into the ELLPS and LPS rank and file.
Funny, sort of, it used to be that 4-cylinder motivated cars need not apply. Well, my my my how things have changed. I'd be (I've been) proud and pleased to have a 4-cylinder BMW or Audi and probably I'd be fine with an ATS with a 4-cylinder motivator too.
Right now, today, at this instant, however, I believe FWD vehicles need not apply -- regardless of how you and I may feel and think about the subject. I think the bias, right now, against FWD is so strong it may be ""stronger than dirt""! Evidence the Genesis ""brand"" -- Genesis eschewed anything but RWD for the first generation, now with the new ones, they're offering up both RWD and AWD in the 6-cylinder version and promised AWD in the 8 ""soon"". FWD, currently and based on much that I read here and by the pros is like an embarrassing tattoo you got one night when you were ""not quite right"" for some reason. You're working on getting rid of it ASAP, but these things take time.
On the other hand, who knows, the benefits (and there are many) of FWD may win out after all. Just remember that FWD was initially put in cars to make them cheaper (to make and buy). There is, for some, a stigma associated with ""FWD"" cars that aspire to be in the Premium, ELLPS, LPS, High-end luxury or Super luxury class. Same holds true for sports cars, super cars and exotics -- they are (or must be to not be posers) RWD or AWD. Mercedes did bring out the CLA as FWD, to be sure -- and there is some risk there (but it can be had with AWD); the A3 is also FWD (like most Audi models) and offers up AWD. At this point ALL incoming inventory for the A3's (here in Cincinnati) will be quattros. That may change.
The ATS and CTS were rendered from the get-go as RWD (with AWD available) because that is what is (NOW, today) expected.
Luxury may or may not = ""Snobbery"". We're talking, here, on this forum, about some variation of a type that contains the words: Luxury, Performance, Sedan -- entry level or not. Luxury is beyond (above? beside? below? -- pick one) being based on ""pure function"", I think is safe to say.
Luxury means to most of us, I assume, ""stuff"", features, amenities, capabilities, levels of refinement beyond what is ""basic"", beyond what is strictly necessary. If you think this equates to brand snobbery, even if I conceded (personally) your point, even if I 100% agreed with you, this is the place where ""we"" are going to discuss, debate, and perhaps even politely argue about luxury cars (that happen to also be capable of a decent amount of ""high"" performance).
So yes, brand snobbery is ""a"" criteria for this discussion, just not necessarily ""my"" criteria to be a member of ""the club"". However, I can somewhat sense saying ""If the shoe fits"" isn't an inappropriate thought.
I saw a very long and impressive video about the Chrysler 300C when it first came out -- and the Chrysler engineers involved in rendering this fine car kept comparing it to an Audi A8.
I love the 300C, especially the ones with the refreshed interiors and AWD, but Senator, ""I've known A8's and you ain't no Audi A8.""
The point is, we -- here -- are but PART of the market -- and we may disagree with the overall market's standards and definitions (and they keep changing all of the time) -- but we need to recognize, I think, the prevailing trends, ideas and standard-bearers. I'm operating under the assumption that this ELLPS forum is one of the places to be able to discuss certain brands and not have to apologize that they aren't in a more hoi polloi category in a manner of speaking."
June 2014,"Mark, I disagree about the blanket exclusion of FWD.
And I guess it is clear you require brand snobbery as part of the criteria, as opposed to being based on purely function."
June 2014,"The ELLPS Category is More Alive Now Than at Any Other Time in History (Part 2)
Can any sedan, regardless of pedigree, be inducted (or indicted) into the ELLPS hall of fame if it cannot be had with either RWD or AWD (FWD only cars need not apply); likewise can any sedan that is primarily, obviously and overwhelmingly badge engineered apply for ELLPS or LPS club membership (thinking of the current Lincoln MKZ which screams badge engineered Ford Fusion here)?
Hopefully, too, we can stipulate that to be in the ELLPS, even with all of the MSRP bracket-creep we’ve seen these past few years, that there is a “size component” we should probably consider. For example, even though today’s BMW 3 is pretty darn close in size to yesterday’s 5, we will accept a 3 series (no matter how pricey) as a member of the ELLPS clan in good standing, but we won’t admit any 5 series (even if it is configured to be less expensive – with a 4-cylinder turbo, and option stripped – than a 3 series) because the 5 series is simply too big (at least at this instant in history; and, let’s agree this could change as the 2’s, 3’s and 5’s morph into god knows what next).
And for pity’s sake are we going to point to something like the new A3 – which is exactly the same size as an earlier gen A4 – and say, “Nope, you’re not ELLPS, you’re a Premium car.” Personally, I’d exclude the A3 from the club, perhaps calling it an Entry-level ELLPS instead. But, that would be just plain silly.
Yet, for discussion purposes, I’m not sure I want to be engaging in conversations with those who aren’t interested in, ahem, “The right kind, or our kind” [of car] – you know, allowing them in here just might make the conversations even messier and perhaps occasionally, er, ""from time-to-time"", even more pugnacious and xenophobic than they are already (if that’s even possible).
So we’re left with [my] belief [and maybe yours too] that the American automobile consumer is faced with a segmented market (one that is growing more so all the time). Perhaps there are divergent opinions on this that follows: Virtually every car manufacturer on the planet wants to have cars that are in the ELLPS and LPS class – and granted ELLPS can mean different things for folks in Beijing and Buffalo. The reason for this LPS-Lust is simple: Premium compacts (like the new A3), ELLPS’s (like the Lexus IS 350 F-Sport) and LPS’s like the Mercedes E-class, etc. are where the profit margins soar. No wonder Hyundai (and KIA) are, with each successive generation, pushing hard, harder, hardest to be members of the Acura (for now), Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Infiniti, Lexus, Mercedes and possibly Volvo Club.
Why? So they can raise prices, natch.
Remember the Lexus playbook (bring in a car -- and give it a ""number"", not a name: LS400 -- that apparently has 100% of the Mercedes content down-pat and sell it at 75-80% of the price of the Merc)? The only thing that might be the “yes but” for the Korean’s is that they’re trying to become ELLPS and LPS club members without separate, purpose-built dealerships – this admittedly cost and time saving approach may ultimately not sit well with the ELLPS and LPS cognoscente or even the general car consuming hoi polloi; yet, the only person I know who has an Equus says the dealership experience has been superlative.
For now, we need not – here – concern ourselves with discussions or comparisons to the really high-end cars (like the Bentley mentioned above or other super-luxury brands from foreign lands). At this point in time, we’ve got some really interesting cars to discuss and an upcoming pipeline that is exemplified by Car & Driver’s recent article “25 Cars Worth Waiting For”.
The ELLPS category is more alive now than at any other time in history. At least that’s the way I see it.
Often wrong, never uncertain, I remain."
June 2014,"Watches and cars are not a good analogy. A car is for transportation, but has many facets (comfort, performance, features, etc.) that vary greatly from one to another. A watch has just one function, and all watches pretty much handle that function the same. Other that that it's all for show, literally just a piece of jewelry."
June 2014,"The ELLPS Category is More Alive Now Than at Any Other Time in History (Part 1)
I’m going to take exception to the suggestion that “ELLPS” as a category is “dead” – indeed, I think it is a very much alive and healthy category/segment; it is almost certainly growing and definitely aspirational category. Both consumers and manufacturers aspire – and often ardently aspire – in their own way to this category in fact.
“ELLPS's are like porn, I can’t define them, but I know them when I see them. . .”
We can’t go on unless some stipulations are made, and these stipulations are possibly made up of nearly equal parts of fact and opinion (I would agree if you said opinion is weighed more heavily should you be so inclined to make that argument). ELLPS autos are difficult to define – perhaps the [unintentionally ironic, I’m sure] quote above, a derivative of Justice Potter Stewart’s famous remark, “I know it [obscenity] when I see it, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that,"" captures the essence of the problem of figuring out what is and what is not an ELLPS.
I think I’ll just go with something like: An ELLPS is an automobile with more basic or “included” content or other “stuff”, one that is generally thought to be of higher quality (another “I know it when I see it” attribute, to be sure) with more “available” comfort/convenience/performance features and amenities, higher style/design attributes (ditto) and noticeably more precise fit and finish (tighter tolerances) than other vehicles that the ELLPS candidate can be measured up against. The dealership experience also bears noting too, as it is, or should be, a cut above, too.
The ELLPS is kind of an anomaly (or at least it was), since its creators want us to know it offers both luxury and performance, traits that used to be almost mutually exclusive. Perhaps an ELLPS candidate or incumbent is (or should be) like the tire type we call “Grand Touring”. But, then, even that metaphor falls short these days, as it certainly appears that one of the prices (pun intended) for entry into the 2014 ELLPS class is “higher performance numbers” than even a few short years ago in the 21st century. Maybe, today (for American consumers), the more correct tire metaphor for an ELLPS is “Ultra High-performance All-season”. Of course, we need be mindful of the “S” in ELLPS, which, of course stands for sedan (and I’ll put a stake in the ground that this means 4-doors, despite whatever model names some manufacturer comes up with – thinking of the name “4-door coupé” for instance).
Perhaps some attempt to say what is not an ELLPS would be helpful (as would a level setting question or two): A Bentley (any Bentley) is not an ELLPS (I would argue it is not an LPS either), nor is any Porsche (even a Panamera falls outside of even the most liberal definitions of both ELLPS and LPS, if you axe me) or a Hyundai. But does this exclude the somewhat stand-alone models named Genesis and Equus?
I think both the Genesis and Equus fall short on their “P” quotients, making them ineligible for either ELLPS or LPS inclusion, but maybe that’s just me and possibly this is a temporary situation – see the latest Car & Driver review of the Genesis sedan now with “suspension tuning by Lotus”).
Buicks don’t count either, right? But wait, what about the Regal GS with AWD and a few option boxes checked off – such as most all of the electronic safety nannies so popular with the presumptively bona fide ELLPS members from Germany, Japan (and Sweden)? Does said Regal GS merit an invitation into the hallowed ELLPS category or is it yet too soon to bestow this lofty ~yet perhaps increasingly dubious~ honor?"

June 2014,"Flight I traded my g in with just under 40k miles- had one 200 dollar belt issue- that's it. Had the Chance to get an s4 with bulk of warrantee - the comments are hurtful and crude- I never said it had any issues- please go back and check my views on the g. But as it got older I was afraid issues night arrive and like I stated was able to swap into a 13 s4 for much less then the price of a loaded 328x. - closer to the price of a 14 320x loaded, Btw this banter hurts at times- certainly if you want to get personal with no true statements behind.  And yes I could of also gotten a sonata turbo- but again like I stated I went used not new and was able to get a good deal."

Now too sure what to believe, but a 7 yr old car with 35K miles, can't have many issues. BTW, for the price of a used S4, you could have bought a new Sonata Turbo and had a 100K mile warrenty. Instead you bought a German car."
June 2014,"First off, sweeny is just *****everybody, he doesn't care, his questions come off as he does, then he writes something childish. Nothing changes..."
June 2014,My circumstance different then most- bot it used - reason I got rid of the g was I started to worry after 7 years of issues- mind you all I did with the car was oil changes and tires - the s4 kind of fell in my lap. If you are an old dude like a lot of people on this forums - and can get 9/10s Lexus LS for less the 75% of the price I don't see why you wouldn't look at k900 or genesis.
June 2014,"Sweendog, you often ask why does one ""need"" a more expensive X over a less expensive Y? You ""need"" food and water and oxygen. You want/desire/find pleasure or satisfaction with material things. Why buy an S4 when you could buy an R32? Or have kept your G37? Oftentimes, the ""badge"" represents attributes real and perceived that add much value to the individual buyer and their power to choose."
June 2014,"For some of the top companies in the world, their brand is basically the most important thing. For e.g., when a consumer buys an Apple product, they expect a certain level of quality and attention to detail, which you will not find in other company products. Take for e.g. Samsung, their main competitor in the cell phone area - even though a Samsung phone may have more features and may seem like a better value for money to lot of people, it just cannot compete with Apple in terms of quality and attention to detail. Samsung uses cheap plastic to make their phones. Apple will never do that. The engineers at Apple spend so much time on each small tine little thing, that when you hold their finished product, you can just feel how good it is.
Same holds true for cars, Lexus represents a certain brand, so does Audi and BMW. What brand does Hundai or Kia represent? Even though they may have more features than BMW or Lexus, they just feel cheap, because at their core they are a value brand. And there is no way a Sonata can match BMW in terms of handling or transmission or any of the stuff that makes a car fun to drive. If you care all about HP, then sure there are tons of other cars with that can beat a BMW with similar or lower price tags.
You can't avoid the dealership - you need to go their to buy the car and for regular maintenance. I lease my cars, so I am there at least once every 3 years, plus a few times in between. And you can feel the difference between a luxury car dealership vs. a value brand. I totally understand that I am ultimately paying for that experience and I am fine with it.
You basically get what you pay for!"
June 2014,I love the brand lovers but if this puppy can compete with the big dogs- talking about cars costing 20k over - no reason we should not comp a 30k turbo sonata with a 35k cheapo BMW 320 http://youtu.be/VTEZtkLtBw4 Again if you really need a nice dealership you have a lot of problems- the idea of owning a reliable car is to be away from dealership.
June 2014,"No one should name a car with the sound ""canine"" in it"
June 2014,"This is going to be very hard for KIA. Its very hard to change perception of people. And they are making it hard of themselves by selling cars like Optima, Forte from the same dealership as K900. When people go to a Lexus, BMW, Mercedes or Audi dealership, they except to see only luxury. That's not the case with Kia. I don't think any amount of marketing can change that perception, when you can see cheap Kia cars at the dealership or on the roads.
I just checked their website and they are advertising - ""KIA named best VALUE brand for 2014"" - not sure that's the thing luxury car buyers are looking for."
June 2014,"they might not win over current German owners, but should sell their allotment to existing hyunkia owners that want to move upscale."
June 2014,"Absolutely my comment to Sweeny answers this.
Kia will have a hard time getting people who own BMW's, Audi's, Lexus and MB to come into their dealership to look at the K900, the perception would be, the K900 isn't to the level of the Germans, but if one looks deep enough they will find out that they are. it would hard for a MB owner to see themselves driving a Kia.
I think Kia and Hyundia have a big uphill battle to deal with, it might have been for them to take a play out of Honda, Toyota and Nissan and make a luxury Brand outside of Kia and Hyundia. Mazda was going to have Amati as their luxury brand and didn't go through with it, I think this is why you wont see a 50-60K Mazda, Getting people to spend that kind of money for Mazada will be tough, very tough."
June 2014,"I would put the K900 and Equus into the Lexus type vehicle as well as the Genesis and Cedenza. Given how far the Koreans have come and these vehicles are the first of their type, the Koreans studied the play books very well.
Now Luxury is subjective, is the 320i as luxurious as say Ricks Genesis, NO. Is the 320i a luxury sedan compared to a Kia Forte, Yes. 
If someone goes from a Mid-level Atlima SV to a 320i they might say the 320i is more luxurious. I don't think you will ever see BMW ever advertise the 320i as a luxury sedan, even with Premium Package, Nav, Xenon lights, I would call it a Entry Level Luxury sedan. Just as you can't call the Genesis or Cedenza a Entry Level Luxury Sedan. Because of their price."
June 2014,Got it- so a k900 is not a sports sedan- it's probably closer to a Lexus ls type of rig. Is the 320 a luxury sedan then?
June 2014,"Don't you think a person's definition of ""performance"" or ""luxury"" really is based on where they are starting from in their particular experience level?"
June 2014,"The K900 is NOT a sports sedan lets get that out first. The K900 (which I really hate the name) was impressive, the 5 liter V8 has plenty of power and has a nice rumble to it, but nothing too loud, just enough to let you know it's there. The 8 spd transmission is the same unit in BMW (but of course gearing and software differences) shifts very smoothly and never had a problem with that. The Kia dealer came to our house with it (this was part of the scrpit from Intillishop) and the salesman (specially trained to sell K900s) was very good explaining the car to us, and he used certain ""key phrases"" when pointing features of the car. So just driving around town, the V8 is right in the smack of it's torque band. Merging onto the freeway the K900 moves well, but not as well as one would think with 420hp. The K900 is not a rocket ship, it can move if needed. Head room, leg room, hip room is bigger then a 5 series, it's more inline with a 7 series, but with a mid level 5 series price tag. The Nappa leather was supple, soft and felt very rich. Fit and Finish was first rate, everything was though of and placed perfectly. IF you are looking for a luxury car not much of a sports sedan then the K900 would be well worth the look. As I stated it is a home run, but not a grand slam...."
June 2014,"Didn't see you comment on the k900 besides saying it was a home run, but you have to agree Morpheus has a huge point here- which key do you choose flight?  it's like buying watches do you need the Tag if you have 3k when you can get a macys watch for 750 (with coupons less) and that said watch for 750 actually looks and performs better then a 3k tag? They both have the same warrantee - sure the dealer experience could be better at the tag dealer - but most people would rather not spend time at a dealer, unless they are getting paid."
June 2014,"Inellishop pays but not that well, for the amount work they require it's a joke. Rick enjoys it and so do I when I have time to go with him' Perception is everything, but status is another. As I wrote the K900 has everything anyone would want in a luxury car except the name."
June 2014,"I think this 30 sec clip explains everything

And @flightnurse does the intellachoice gig pay?"
June 2014,"Mid last year on a flight from Detriot to Miami my seatmate struck up a conversation with me regarding cars (I have all of the car mag's on my iPad.) His questions were odd, but focused. He asked what kind of car I had, when I told him none at moment, asked why, and if I'm in the market for a car. After about 20 minutes I asked him what he did. Come to find out he works for Intellishop, then we started talking about mystery shoppers and such. He asked if I would be interested in being a mystery shopper, but declined, but knew someone who would, Rick. We talk about him and my seatmate was happy. So for the past year Rick been a mystery shopper for Intellishop, this is where the testing of cars come from. It's been interesting so far the Kia K900 and E350 have been standouts, maybe not in the way you think.
K900 is a home run, but the biggest issue is getting people who can afford a $66K car to come into the dealer or think about Kia.
E350, the saleman was the worst but the car he showed us was absolutely stunning, the color combo worked on the car. That is the only positive thing Rick said about the whole MB experience. We weren't even offered a test drive, and haven't driven a E class in several years I was looking forward to it.
In regards to cross shopping, the Kia dealer ask this when we looked at the Cadzena and K900, no other dealer ask this question.
The interesting thing about Intellishop is you have a ""script"" already going into the dealership, and a certain car to look at. At the MB dealer, we had to look at the E350 ""gas"" so the new E350 Bluetec was out of the question, but really want to test drive this car...
This whole debate on what is and isn't a ELLPS is really a subjective thing, just like in the medical word, pain is a subjective. I had patients who would complain of the worse pain of their life, but couldn't keep theirs eyes open because of the heavy doses of pain medications they were on...
I'm with Dino, the ELLPS is dead, since one can buy a $27K hatchback that does 0-60 in the same time as a car that cost twice as much from the homeland."
June 2014,"In other, words people buy what they want. They don't care if other people don't think that ""it"" is worth the price. Conversely, other people cannot even comprehend why somebody would buy something like filltheblank because there is another filltheblank just as good (in their eyes, anyway) and cheaper. And it's all good.
There is another type of discussion we have here constantly - does filltheblank belong to ELLPS? Honestly, I don't really understand why people get so worked up if it does, or does not. Many people would cross shop cars that are not the same ""category"", so what... The line will always be blurred and they move. Yesterday's luxury is today's standard. Yesterday's benchmark of sportiness (like manual transmission) is becoming so rare that it's impossible to use as an actual measuring stick. Prices go up incessantly, so yesterday's 30K car is today's 40K. And so on. If somebody cross shops Ford Focus ST or Subaru WRX/STI with BMW 328i and somebody else cross-shops Lexus ES (not even IS) with same BMW, who am I to say they are ""wrong"" about looking at them? They'll choose what they like at the end, it may not be ELLPS, but who cares.
I say something much more revolutionary - ELLPS is dead, there is no ELLPS. There is bunch of former ELLPS, but they got so diverse that it's too wide. Some lost ""Entry Level"" pricing (long time ago, I might say), others lost performance, others went beyond ""Entry Level"" luxury. Then bunch of outsiders got to the 0-60 and horsepower game, keeping to horses on front wheels, but hey, it's still 250+ horses. There is also a small breed of AWD (some are FWD) bandits that are ""too small"" or don't have enough ""stuff"", but 30 years ago ""real"" ELLPS were just their size, had lesser 0-60, slalom time, crank windows, cloth seats and nobody was ranting they were no ELLPS. Just saying..."
June 2014,"Mark's writing reminds me of a friend, when he told a story he took the long way to get to the point, which I kind of like."
June 2014,"I would suggest, perhaps even argue, the dollar becomes progressively less of a major factor when we move into any incarnation of the Premium or Luxury class (especially where cars are concerned). Folks -- generally speaking -- don't shop for ellps or lps cars with much consideration for budget (however, even when buying an ellps, I assume we all stipulate $X dollars for the purchase -- of our new 3 series or new IS 350, etc). I would hope we all want to get the most we can for our dollar, and I assume we do. If, however, you want to spend less, it is quite possible to move down a rung and get, for instance, a Chrysler 300 -- and there is NOTHING wrong with that.
The reason the Escalade (for example) exists is because there are folks who are very happy to pay for the Caddy over the lesser GM offerings that lack the Wreath and Crest. Of course there are substantive differences (between the Cadillac and the GMC for instance), but if you read the profits story you know the margins ARE much higher the more you climb the lux/premium/ellps/lps ladder.
Perhaps the luxury goods represent a lesser ""value"" since they have higher profit margins -- but I'll wager if fill in the blank produces yet another vehicle with breathtakingly expensive MSRP's there will probably be no shortage of takers. Who would have thought an X6 would have a market -- well, not me. And, much as I love Audis, I test drove -- back to back -- an A6 and an A7 and until I opened the glove box and found the stack of bills, I kept hunting for the $10,000 premium the A7 commanded.
They can't keep the A7's in stock. If you had any concern about price for content, there would be far fewer A7 sales ""if you axe me!""
I have a few ""expensive"" pens (gifts from my wife, to repeat), I ""appreciate"" them, but would not buy them for myself. Like laurasdada, I see the ""value"" of the Omega or the IWC or the Tag, I also appreciate the Invicta and the Swiss Army -- in sum this particular forum is less about ""budget"" or ""value"" or ""MSRP"" than it is about folks who ""aspire"" to ""the next step up the ladder.""

June 2014,"Sween,
Small correction, I used the term ""strokable"" in my post, I'm not sure how it got translated to ""stokable"" -- I meant, by strokable, cars that are as described in the next post by 'm6user' who continued and gave an additional example of the point. Also it was a rip-off of a Wayne's World throwaway line by Mike Meyers.
Also, yes, these are entry-level LPS cars and they can be less expensive than the next step up. However, many if not all of these ellps cars can be easily optioned to numbers beginning with a 5 or a 6. So while it is true that ellps customers -- and want to be customers -- may be somewhat budget minded (since they're not shopping further up the MSRP scale, apparently) folks that shop and buy these vehicles are looking for ""better"" and/or ""more"" and/or a pretty hefty step up in luxury features and perceived quality of materials.
OK, the forum is about cars, not other luxury goods -- perhaps the analogies and some poorly written or expressed sarcasm or irony are misplaced. In response to the shopper who configures a Ford Taurus SHO and then remarks the ""fill in the blank"" ellps or lps isn't worth the extra $X-thousands, I had hoped the point would be punctuated by examples in other areas, e.g., outdoor grills, pens and watches. Some folks only buy Rolex's (not me, FWIW) and some see not one bit of extra value in a Rolex when they can have a far less expensive timepiece, etc, etc. Some folks wouldn't pay $1,000 more for an upgraded audio system in their new Mercedes C -- but might spring for the MontBlanc.
If someone wants to ""prove"" than a Subaru WRX is the equivalent of or superior to a BMW 335 X-drive, by configuring both ""similarly"" and then citing some performance stats, well have at it. The WRX, for all I know, may actually out-accelerate the Bimmer and so on -- but that doesn't make the Subie an ellps or lps by any stretch.
Anyway, if the grills, pens and watches analogies don't track, I'll endeavor to minimize such transgressions.
I do not, however know what ""enuf of the better then now stuff"" means. These cars, I think we all mostly agree, are better ""now"" than ""then."" I guess several of the reviews of the Q50 have suggested that it did not improve upon the G37 -- which may be what you were referring to.
We may all have our definitions of ellps or even luxury for that matter, which is why I say, most of the time, ""Drive it like you live. . . ."""

June 2014,"In other words......you get what you pay for. On paper a decked out Hyundai Sonata Turbo has the power, leather, panoramic moonroof, fancy bells and whistles that most of these ellps have but every switch, piece of leather. undercarriage part, latch, hinge, carpet etc etc is cheap compared to these cars. Other mainstream brands may be a little better but still don't approach the luxury brands. The dealer experience is not the same either. I had an Infiniti and have an Acura but have had tons of non-luxury brands and the dealer experience is much different. Yes, you pay for it but that is my point."
June 2014,"I do like, very much, my Victorinox Swiss Army watch -- I think it, in some ways, looks nicer than the Tag. But, the thing is, the Victorinox is not a ""luxury"" watch. A new Malibu LTZ (a very attractive looking car), is also not an Infiniti, Lexus, BMW, Audi, Mercedes -- it even doesn't fit in the same class as the Volvo S60.
We're here -- well some of us are -- in ELLPS land perhaps because we ""choose"" not to buy/lease an LPS automobile. Perhaps some of us -- as Alfred Sloan imagined -- would start with a Chevy and aspire to a Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick and ultimately a Cadillac. I suspect Sloan is the father of the term ""aspirational"" as it applied to cars.
We're here, I'll bet, because we either aspire to an ELLPS, have an ELLPS and aspire to an LPS or are just car-nuts who know the good stuff comes from Audi, BMW, Infiniti, etc.

I test drove a Phaeton (way back when) which was seriously discounted and sub-vented (and as a reminder I owned an A8) thinking I could get a ""new A8"" for a fraction of the cost by going with the Phaeton. The Phaeton was, closed eyes, an A8. Same sweeeet 4.2L V8, quattro (well, you know) etc. I just couldn't bring myself to pull the trigger -- probably the biggest bargain I'll ever see. Damn HUGE-[non-permissible content removed] ""VW"" emblem on the thing.
Instead of the bargain it probably was, I knew I would be thinking, ""I paid THIS MUCH for a VW?!? What was I thinking?""
You know I still think if you can't or won't go with an S4, the next best thing is the Acura TL SH-AWD Advance (and I assume the TLX is even better). Even my non-car loving friends called my TL ""a Honda."" Slamming the tinny doors was just enough of a confirmation of that notion to remind me that the Acura brand had slipped from Premium status.
My wife collects pens -- I have perhaps four or five (that were gifts from her) -- I probably would not go out and buy a new 4-figure MontBlanc, but I do notice when I see Brian Williams use one on the air. My MontBlancs (3 of them) are all the pens I need (one of them broke and I had to send it to Germany to get it fixed -- seems as good as new). My wife must get 6 new pens per year. I sort of get it. Until her current car (the SQ5 Prestige), she liked cars, but wasn't really ""passionate"" about them.
Get this, for about 15 minutes she actually considered a Subaru -- which was pretty nice, but kind of trucky and not at all luxurious or even terribly sporty. I knew she would love the price and by the time she needed her second tank of gas would be ""praying for the end of time"" (Meat Loaf).
Now, however, she is ""into cars"" and is unlikely to aspire to anything other than an Audi or a BMW -- I can't see reverse aspiration being a viable option (for her or for most people, in fact).
Anyway, this collection of ELLPS cars is perhaps the most exciting and ""strokable"" lot in all of cardom. It is here that we see innovation (often before the LPS offerings, even from the same brand), performance and often a huge leap up from even the top of the next lower line.
Remember the Phaeton, long live the Phaeton.
You know how to drive it . . . ."
June 2014,"The value of a money I guess means different things to different people. Acura at one time was a superior value to other lux cars and offered performance- still does-- now the mainstream cars, many of which use the same components as lux siblings cost thousands less and similar performance but I guess should not be compared because of a badge. 750 Macy watch sounds good to me, my timex just broke."
June 2014,"Miss a Few Days and You Miss a Lot!
Well I last posted on May 29. Whew! I think I am finally caught back up on the reading of the many -- mostly very good -- posts.
I have some take-aways that comes from speed-reading about 60 posts AFAP:
Talking with specificity about cars you haven't driven is like critiquing a movie after only seeing the trailers -- that's a good one, I will be swiping that with great enthusiasm and some frequency.
Going on and on about how a 5, 10, 15 year old or older car and proclaiming it is better than the current crop must've been said/written sarcastically or perhaps ironically. Not that everything new is better, but, well as a general rule things (like cars) have tended to be better along with the passage of time.
Stick shifts are great, ""no one"" buys them anymore because: see #2. Oh, somewhere I read that even in cars -- like the ELLPS's -- that actually do offer stick shifts, the take-up by actual paying customers continues to shrink and it is something less than 3% or perhaps 2%. Now that I have, in my garage, a 7-speed dual-clutch and an 8-speed tiptronic, I know the reason. If the best of breed 8-speed doesn't ""shift your opinion"" well today's 7-speed dual-clutch certainly will be virtually irresistible.
Some folks here will correctly note that they can option load-up a non-ellps car, note that it meets or beats the ""fill-in-the-blank"" ellps in content, performance and the big one, price and apparently end with an implied ""so how 'bout them apples"" or ""so there!""
Continuing:
In my experience ""people need those stinkin' badges!""
To make a, or perhaps ""the"" point: My MontBlanc pen uses a 3 or 4-dollar refill, the same one used in some other really ""way less expensive"" (I'll say) pens. In the same spirit, my Tag watch doesn't tell time any better than my $750 Swiss Army Watch I got at Macy's. That's not the point -- well, OK, it may be ONE point, but it's the overall ""certain something"" that makes luxury goods, well, hmm, ""worth more."" Once I get over ""needing"" a white and blue roundel or four interlocking rings, etc, well, I'll get a KIA of some sort.
I like coming back after a few days to see how we've advanced the discussion here.
I'm really gonna try to test drive more cars, 'cause y'all are BRUTAL!

June 2014,"Its good. Zero issues (but only 9k miles). Still LOVE the sound of it and its damned fast, but can hardly ever get on it. I'm jonesing to track it, but just can't take the time or money to do so.
Funny enough, my experiences with the 135 have put me off modding for the time being. Not that I blame the mods... guilt by association, I guess. My biggest challenge with the stang is traction. Even with the widest summer tires I could squeeze on the stock wheels (255s), it just smokes them at will. I would LIKE to do the BAMA tune, which is cheap and easy (OBD2 interface for under $400) and adds a fair bit of power for an NA engine (claimed 31hp/37tq) along with a pair of Outlaw mufflers ... but it all has to wait. Wider wheels should be first on the list and I don't have the $$ to spare at the moment with the family vacation looming in August.
BUT, we are way off topic. haha. I was behind an S60 this morning for a moment...I gotta admit, I think that might be my current top choice for ELLPS these days. Maybe I could get the wife one after the Leaf lease is up."
June 2014,"Hey Q, how is the mustang? Still fun and bulletproof? Any mods?"
June 2014,"I ran JB4 by itself for a while. (Then camber plates.) It was Ok for a few months, then started triggering limp mode once a week or so. Dealer replaced coils, plugs, and fuel pump (this was the car's second fuel pump) across 3 different trips for the limp mode problem. Seemed OK for a little while again.
After 1 track event where the car was plagued by overheating, I added a custom larger oil cooler and downpipes (thought maybe deleting the cats from so close to the engine could help with heat). But then the vanos solenoid problems began. While on my 3rd set of those, the car started making some very disturbing but faint noises from down deep within, so I gave up, quickly removed the downpipes and tuner, and traded her in. Total ownership period was 18 months.
With the JB4 by itself, I think they were claiming 340-350 hp, IIRC. With the DPs, it should have been somewhere in the 370hp range. Some folks were pushing far more through the N54 engine, but I didn't feel the need for that much. It was damned quick, and a great deal of fun when running right. I'm pretty sure, even in stock form, though, it wouldn't have been a reliable car in the long run."

June 2014,"Yep...I did. At the time I had it done, they had a ""special"" on the upgrade ($600). I added a dealer coupon to it, and I think I ended up paying $200 for it. The good news there, it was covered by BMW's warranty. Don't know if they still offer that upgrade. Don't know why they wouldn't, though.
As I look back, the situation that pushed me to get rid of it wasn't ideal. That's a car I wished I still had ('11 E92). Handled well....muscle car fast....comfortable....good looking.....didn't give me an ounce of trouble."
June 2014,"That could be true, except the 135i in stock tune isn't near it's limits, either.. BMW even offered a ""Performance"" upgrade that they could do at the dealership that bumped HP from 300 to 320. I think @graphicguy had that done..
I also wouldn't surmise that the 328i and 320i engines are indentical, except for the software.. The 328i could have (probably has?) beefed up engine internals, to handle the extra power."
June 2014,"320i engine is basically the same as 328i, but de-tuned, so its a somewhat different scenario vs. boosting 135, which may already be or close to its limit. I am no expert on this, just an observation..."

June 2014,"I liked the jb4 a lot...when the car worked. Unfortunately, as shifty points out, tweaking a car will expose its weak points. In my 135, at least, those weak points were vanos solonoids, brakes, and very poor stock engine/trans cooling. Moments of fun with everything working in synch were brief, so I de-modded it and traded it before it got really expensive."
June 2014,Hypertech's tune for the Mazdaspeed 3/6 is relatively safe because it doesn't push the small stock turbo past its limit of efficiency; I''ve only heard of one engine failure on a HT tuned car. This is almost certainly due to the fact that the tune cannot be modified by the end user- unlike the COBB AP or Versatune tuning devices; a little knowledge can prove to be very destructive...
June 2014,In looking at this I'm all for the 320- but would do a lot of research b4 strapping a performance mod even to a cheap lux sedan - 35k not a lot to spend on a car these days but I don't know if I could deal with the embarrassment of a blown engine and going to the dealership for replacement.
June 2014,"It's probably fine but as you all know, a turbo or supercharger will immediately exploit any unusual weakness inherent in the engine. You have maybe a higher mileage engine with a little weepiness in the head gasket? BOOM! That's gonna blow out of there. Carbonized engine? Bad tank of gas in your neighborhood? Not a good thing with over-boosted turbo.
The reason that BMW sets the boost level where it does is, of course, so that the car maintains that nice balance of reliability, nice manners and decent performance. They compromise, in other words, on the side of longer life, stable idle, good mpg, etc. They are looking at the consequences from hundreds of thousands of cars, not just one.
I don't practice what I preach. My MINI is jacked, too."
June 2014,"it would be impossible for them wiggle out of warranty work unless they have hard evidence that something was added.
They don't have to wiggle out of it... ""We show four examples of overboost, and now you have an internal engine failure and we deny your warranty claim"".
Unless your brother is a lawyer and works for free, you'll be out of luck. Don't get me wrong.. I wouldn't presume to suggest this is likely to happen. Just that your warranty won't be any good, if they can tie anything to your modifications. And, they don't have to ""prove it"". They can just refuse to fix it."
June 2014,"Again I think BMW knows what some people will do, they know about JB4, just because the ECU captures the over boost, it would be impossible for them wiggle out of warranty work unless they have hard evidence that something was added. How do you like the JB4 on the 135?"
June 2014,I posted two links to the manufacture web page so read all about it.
June 2014,"See my post above. The ECU tracks the boost and logs overboost events. The JB4 is exactly what I had in my 135i, and they knew it even after I cleared all codes and removed it.
Now, granted, he did not say ""we know you have a jb4."" He asked me. I asked why and he explained the above. I decided not to lie about it because 1) I'm not a jerk and 2) I could just imagine the amount of unnecessary work that could ensue if they were trying to stop a stock car from overboosting.

If it is so cost effective and does absolutely no harm, I wonder why BMW doesn't just offer it as an upgrade under warranty for about triple the price and make all that much more profit. Seems like a no brainer for BMW. Seems like there is more than meets the eye here.

The same could be said why does BMW only offer the Performance Pack for the 335 and not the 328. Over in Europe BMW has a Performance Pack for all boosted engines. There is talk over on Bimmerfest that a power upgrade might come to the 2016 320 and 328i as that is when the mid model refresh appears."
June 2014,"Yes, its the same. You can get the Sport package, which gives it the M Sport suspension and M steering. But you can't get DHP, I think for that you need to get 328."

June 2014,"Not really as I posted before I have the BMS Stage 1 plug and play on my car, 30+hp and 40 lbss+ more of Torque. All for $350. This drops the 0-60 time to 6 secs, and if you add this to the 328i, During closed course GPS VBOX testing Burger Motorsports 2012 F30 328i 0-60 times improved from 5.4 seconds to an incredible 4.9 seconds!. I have no doubt of the times, so moving up to a 328i over a 320 has to be more then just HP, there are other options that are only available on the 328 and not on the 320i.
Now granted most people wouldn't put the stage 1 on the car, I love it, I have driven a 320i with the stage 2, depending on the ""map"" chosen boost is increased another 3 PSI. 260 hp to the rear wheel, on a 328i 303 hp. For a total of $545."

I have no idea if this is true but it might be if (as I have read) the 320 motor is basically a de-tuned version of the one in the 328. It's amazing what a little extra boost can do for a turbo four."
June 2014,"If this was a forum about ELPS one would expect no power seats, no leather, no sunroolf, no high tech in the dash, etc. But most buyers, when they are looking for a luxury car, expect those kinds of things. Hard core rally guys could probably care less as all they really care about is does it run and is it fun to drive. But when one positions the discussion to talk about entry level LUXURY PERFORMANCE sedans then at least a moderate level of luxury should be expected or we might as well include Mazda6s and Honda Accord V6 in the discussion. Luxury cars are not strictly delineated by the car but by the dealer, warranty, service etc that also comes with the purchase of luxury nameplate.
The reason why many on here were opposed to the TSX being included here was that it didn't seem to have the performance side nailed down. However, it did have the luxury side nailed down pretty well as most of the things recently mentioned came standard on it.
I think when you buy(and pay extra for) a luxury car from a luxury nameplate there should be somewhat of a basic standard which one can expect without having to option the vehicle up to the hilt just to reach the standard that most other luxury brands start off with. Some here almost come across as denigrating those that do like a little luxury with their auto by making statements like ""if it doesn't come with it I don't need it or if I don't need it to shift gears, what good is it"". Not direct quotes but silly just the same."
June 2014,"I think its worth it for people looking for that extra hp. Its the same argument when going from 328 to 335. Is that extra hp worth the premium you pay? Only the person buying can decide that for themselves.
Another thing is that in reality the difference comes out to be more like $100 or more. The moment a dealer gets a car with Sport line or M Sport, they put some much other stuff that the car gets lot more expensive. I was hard pressed to find a 328i with just Sport line and nothing much more. So unless you are willing to custom order and wait, you would end up paying much more.

@plekto said:
So no manual. But, wait... everyone says that to be ELLPS it has to have manual...

I can bet 90% of people who buy the cars in the ELLPS category, whether BMW, Audi, Lexus, Mercedes, etc. get automatic (and also probably have never seen this forum). I haven't looked at any data on this, so if someone has anything to support or refute this, would appreciate that. I am just going on based on what I found on dealer lots when I was looking. So, in that case none of these cars would qualify to be a ELLPS, we might as well close this forum down 
And yes, I did get an automatic, but that's my personal preference. BMW does make it available in manual like their other 3 series."

On the other hand, I have a hot hatch that puts over 300 bhp through the front wheels. It is also fun, but in an entirely different way.
Of course many of the ""experts"" in this topic would dismiss all three cars because-oh the horror!-none of them have full leather power seats. The seats are extremely comfortable and have outstanding lateral support, but those attributes pale in comparison to the ability to push a button and move your seat 1mm forward or back..."
June 2014,"The article above said it perfectly...
""here’s who should also consider the 320i: urban commuters seeking BMW handling, luxury, connectivity and panache, and those upon whom the harsh realization has dawned that they don’t need a rocket car to satisfy their daily driving needs. From stoplight-to-stoplight, it would be rather nice to use less gas, and it’s equally nice to spend less money.""
There's a harsh bit of reality in all of that, though. The type of driver who is all of that will be buying the car with automatic virtually 100% of the time.(barring some oddball statistical freak who you find to come here on this forum just to dispute this)
So no manual. But, wait... everyone says that to be ELLPS it has to have manual...
So are we talking ""offered with manual so that I can say it qualifies, despite that nobody buys this model with manual"" or ""It's not the real thing unless it has manual - let me show you the pictures""?
So... no manual, no power, no luxury, and 30K?
Tell me how this qualifies. All I get out of this equation is ELS... Entry level sedan. If we are to believe that article, the driver who is satisfied with that for their daily driving needs would probably be happy with anything if it had the right badge on it to impress their co-workers for a few seconds.

BTW, isn't it interesting that today's car having track time of 1988 M3 (just 26 years) can be seen as having a ""weak engine""? Sure, things evolved and expectations today are somewhat different then 20+ years ago, but perhaps we went a bit too far. It is true that the competition honestly caught up with BMW in lot of aspects of that category, a lot of that started in arms race in brochure values of the horsepower, or straight line accelaration numbers combined with adding nice stuff to it. It is a new reality. Over 200 horses, 3000 lbs, we still complain too little of thise or that. Consumer is the king. BMW themselves also evolved in direction that many think lost some original appeal. But I simply cannot take your argument that just because some numbers don't align with your idea what ELLPS should be, it doesn't belong. Until I actually sit inside and try it, I don't know."
May 2014,"Don't mind the above response understandable wanting to save money, and get a rwd sedan & if you can due it with weather, but is this car a ELLPs under that configuration, no it's not - Lexus once sold a RWD is250 that could be had with a 6 speed - they sold it as a performance sedan- no one bought this configuration or cared- even caddy which is aiming big time at the bmw has a similar priced car and a base engine with similar weak power but neglected to give us the manual because it's not a real draw with the weaker engine-non-turbo, it's more of a pricing thing I guess. Real performance seekers would never opt for the 4 cyl 180 non turbo- it's bland. Also real lux seekers would never opt for a pleather, base stereo, no power seat car - doesn't add up- car is not Ellps. And at the bargain price of 35k really? And done"
May 2014,"@plekto‌ - Focus ST or G37 or GTI all are very nice cars in terms of handling and performance. I think it comes down to personal preference in what you like.
So who would pay BMW premium to get a 320i with lower horsepower? I am quoting from an article that I read online (http://www.bimmer-mag.com/issues/120/articles/practical-considerations?page=4#.U4odyagWeG0):
Beyond that entry-level buyer, here’s who should also consider the 320i: urban commuters seeking BMW handling, luxury, connectivity and panache, and those upon whom the harsh realization has dawned that they don’t need a rocket car to satisfy their daily driving needs. From stoplight-to-stoplight, it would be rather nice to use less gas, and it’s equally nice to spend less money. The 36-month lease payment is $50 less for the 320i than that for the 328i, and even though the latter is much quicker and potentially faster, you won’t miss that sitting in traffic. The two cars are virtually indistinguishable at light throttle under 40 mph. Why pay more?
That's me going from a BMW 335d to 320i. I save $200 per month on my lease and I am actually having more fun with the 320i. Maybe because its lighter, not sure, but it feels just more lively and the handling is so much more precise.
I could have gone with Focus ST or G37 and saved some more money (for some reason the GTI and A3 lease much higher due to really bad residuals), but decided to stay with BMW, since having had it before, I knew exactly what I was getting - a RWD sedan that handles great and is lot of fun to drive in around the city."
May 2014,"@plekto - forget about it- as flight explained in his genesis comments from May, its about brand has nothing to do with what you actually get. I would ask flight he bought a 320 while his partner got a genesis- 2 cars that are very close in price but far in spectrum."
May 2014,"OK, let's get serious for a minute. 4 doors and leather and nav and doesn't suck at handling?
I put every option that I could find on a Focus ST, plus the special paint, moonroof, and so on and got a Truecar price of $27K.
4 doors. Handles better, looks better, is faster. Almost 335i fast, in fact. Those full leather Recaro seats are also very comfortable, despite their color scheme. So if you want more performance, you have a better option for less money.
Or you can go the other way and want more luxury and better performance for the same money. Auto magazines compare the 335i and the G37 routinely. I think the poor 320i will end up roadkill vs even the base model G37.
It's not that BMW doesn't make good cars, it's that they did the same thing that Lexus did with the miserable IS250. It's so weak, bland, and uninspiring to drive compared to the bigger version that it really doesn't deserve to be in any category other than ""next""."

Very well said"
May 2014,"The 335 xdrive will come not so long from the launch, it already is on the pricing lists, just blacked out (or to be exact, yellowed) for now."
May 2014,@dino001‌ thanks for sharing that seems like a cool event. Just looked online @ 435 (grand) and the hatch body def improves overall looks. Looks like the bigger engine will not be avail at launch(?) with xdrive. Which I think is a little disappointing but I guess bmw has to cut something as they have the most complete line of vehicles out there.
May 2014,"I just attended BMW's drive event with 4-series, C350 coupe, S5 and Lexus IS. I drove 435 with Msport line, Benz and Audi. All three are very nice. S5 felt sportiest of them, the DSG shifts made sounds like computer game. Its supercharged engine had phenomenal note. Benz was plush, well balanced, still quite quick. BMW had everything in great balance, the sports suspension was what I like. The exhaust note more throaty than I remember on 335 I drove during the performance delivery in Spartanburg. They also had 428 Gran Coupe on display. It's gorgeous. Back seat headroom is too small for 6 feet tall person, but the extra utility of hatch is great. Love the looks. Couldn't drive it, as that one was preproduction European model, even had manual transmission, not available for US market. It's definitely on my list, but I'm not rushing in to put a deposit down.
BTW, I had a great conversation with the product rep about some features. They reportedly changed the start/stop feature defaulting to last setting, as opposed to previous always going back to active. It is reportedly US market only, in Europe they kept the old one due to carbon emission garbage. The shaking on restart is reduced and also depends on which cylinder restarts first."
May 2014,"I couldn't agree more. I just traded in my BMW 335d (M-sport package) and got a BMW 320i (Sport package) and I am loving it.
I was looking at other similar cars in the price range - Audi A3 2.0, VW GTI, Honda Accord, but none of these came close to fun that I had when I test drove the 320i with Sport package. I would have been able to get more standard options with all other models, but none of them came close to the handling and nimbleness that was there in the BMW (my opinion).
I also looked at 328i (Sport line and no line). The 328i Sport line was definitely faster compared to 320i, but only if you went at it hard. In normal to mid range driving (which is what I normally do), I found really no difference. 328i without sport package felt too soft.
I am actually having more fun driving the 320i than I had in my 335d, which had much higher HP and gobs of torque."
May 2014,"Tlong, you sound like me. I think a good word to use is Balance, along with control (you mentioned precision)."
May 2014,"Honestly sometimes the snobbery stereotypes of BMW drivers are apparent even in this forum. Really, your car doesn't measure testosterone levels.
I'm not particularly a huge fan of BMW, but I can admire their vehicles and what they've done in the marketplace.
To me, being ""sporty"" is NOT about horsepower or torque. Sure, that's nice, but if that were what was important I'd buy a Vette or a Camaro. Straight-line acceleration is not what makes an ELLPS appealing to me.
I admire and appreciate, shall we say, ""precision"". I like precise, tight steering. I like a reasonably comfortable, yet firm and precise ride. I like going around corners, not at 0.8g, but in a way that the steering feel is precise, I know exactly where the car is going to go, and I can feel the feedback through the steering wheel. I don't even particularly care to autocross my vehicles or pull high g's in corners.
So I also like a ""nice"" interior. I can get fairly lower-horsepower, ""precise"" vehicles at reasonable cost (the Mazda 3 comes to mind). But those vehicles usually don't have the ""nicer"" interiors that I like. It was all of these thoughts and characteristics that caused me to buy an A4 in the late '90's. And now I drive an '05 TL, and you know what - although the interior is ""nice"" and the horsepower is quite good, the driving dynamics are still a bit too floaty/boaty and lacking.
So I DON'T begrudge somebody liking a 320i. It's not all about testosterone, or horsepower, at least to some of us. And it's not about snobbery, either. We all have different needs and tastes. Insulting each others' rides - well, pretty childish IMHO."

May 2014,"@flightnurse‌
I know you are happy with your 320i. I believe you said you have even chipped it to make it faster for a not so unreasonable amount of money. I'm not knocking the 320i. I had one as a loaner once. For my daily driving needs it would suit me just fine. Around town I found it comfortable and docile. It rode smooth on the highway. I'm quite sure the current body style chassis is stronger and the 320i handles better than my 2011 328xi. I did find myself having to plan a little bit for passing maneuvers. I don't like the MASSIVE headrests or the giant screen stuck on top of the dashboard. I even think the 320i is a much better looking vehicle than the X1. I was simply stating that dollar for dollar, you get better acceleration on an X1 28i vs. a 320i and an X1 35i vs. a 328i.
I know that BMWs even in their ""base"" form are better driving cars than their competitors. Our 1st BMW was my wife's 2007 X3 that had 3 options: Heated Seats, Rear Privacy Glass, & Metallic Paint. We loved it. The fact that BMW offers a 320i with a dedicated RWD platform sets them apart from the competition.
I think it is amazing that a dealer stocks a 320i with a 6 speed stick & sport pkg. Around here, the cars all have X Drive and an automatic (I know why, I took my Prelude yesterday forgetting that it was a ""get away day""). A Sports Package around here with our Texas sized pot holes and crumbling roads is a no-no.
There are faster cars in the price range (Sonata Turbo, V6 Accord) for even less money. There are cars that offer more luxury features & gadgets for less money too. Just because they are faster, more powerful, and offer more gadgets doesn't make them better cars at all."
May 2014,"Yes the 4 series GC is a looker, and you are right they are under pricing it, and the one you prices is it 435? With the stage one mod on a 428i it's just as quick as a stock 335. The one I priced at was $50K, minus 8% for ED, plus BMWCC, USAA, and Grad money, one i built could be had for 42K and change."
May 2014,"Wow this discussion has just heated up-- love it. The tsx comment correct it should not be here- 
from May @flightnurse said: Graphic, when it comes to cars brand means a lot. Look at Hyundai, Rick's Genesis is a perfect example. It has the same content as a E class and 5 Series and the price is that of a mid level 3 series. The ride is on par with a Lexus GS, but it does not have the star on the hood or the roundel. So people could get a Accord over a CLA but wont.
Now we understand why people would pay 35k for basically a badge - thanks @flightnurse‌
and yes I was against buying an auto - but in reading reviews on the s4 I learned the car was faster and more efficient in auto form- and since I was buying used & I wanted one with audi select with rear sports dif, nav and upgraded b&o radio. Finding a car as equipped is like trying to find a 320 with no sunroof and a manual - impossible certainly up east."
May 2014,"The issue is that 99% of the posters here have never driven a 320i, they just see HP figures and make comments. In base form without my upgrade I never had a problem in everyday driving, 200lbs of torque comes on at 1250 (500 more then idle) and the 8 spd transmission really makes the car feel faster.
With my performance mod I have done, my 320i is faster then any stock E90 328i. The price I paid for my 320i with Mod is a bargain. All the ""luxury items I hear the 320i lacks, if i didn't get in the car, then I didn't need it. Premium package and leather is want I wanted, it gave me the sunroof, power seats (front) folding side mirrors, and all power down windows and comfort access.. The dealer could have gotten me a 320i sport with the Premium package, but I would have had to wait 5 days... I needed a car now. So I'm happy...

May 2014,"4-series Gran Coupe (low ride, 4 doors, rear hatch, stylishly sloped back) is already on BMW's website. Pricing is basically same as the normal coupe. They're probably underpricing it (in relative terms, of course as we all know BMW are too expensive in general, but that's a different discussion) vs. the established segments (there is more metal in GC than coupe). I like that, 435i GC is now on top of my list. Not quite ""entry level"", but not full luxury, either. After I add ""stuff"", the list price will be mid-to-high 50s. A lot, I know. I'll wait of course, never buy a new thing, let the market to sort it out. One thing missing is the manual tranny, but I already made peace with myself getting an automatic as my next car."
May 2014,"flightnurse: Quit taking it so personally and falling into other poster's traps. They are talking about a model of car, not specifically your actual car, and certainly not your child or partner. Chill brother. You have to admit that the 320 hardly could be called a performance car when many run of the mill midsize sedans have more room, power and bells and whistles than the basic 320. A lot of naturally aspirated I4s have more HP than the 320 and when optioned out are many thousands less than a similarly equipped 320. The two things that the 320 has going for it are the luxury nameplate and experience and possibly handling. I say possibly handling because the Mazda6 handles pretty darn well and has more HP than the 320.
So, really, one can say the 320 is an entry level luxury sedan but is lacking on the performance side. Heck, people on here used to complain that the TSX with a measly NA I4 with 200hp and shouldn't be included because it wasn't performance enough."
May 2014,"But you can't fit 4 adults in a X1. IF people are looking at a sedan just on power alone then just move up the B7 and be done with it. But we are talking Entry Level Luxury Performance Sedans are we not?
I get the fact that Sweeny like to hear himself talk and beat his chest, this is a person who wrote on this forum he would never buy a sport sedan that didn't have a manual transmission... What happened..
The 320i is a Entry Level Luxury Performance Sedans sure one could go out an buy a accord, Camry or cough Altima, that has more equipment for less money that goes for everybody on this forum, not just me, but the aren't sport sedans. We each have our likes and dislikes for cars, but what i don't get is people talking down other peoples cars, for now the 320i works for me, I'm happy with it that is all that matters."
May 2014,"@plekto‌ Personal criteria are just that. Can't say I agree with ""might as well get a Camry,"" though.
So basically it has to have 4 doors at the expense of every other option and criteria?
No. The point is 4-doors + RWD + new. That's the equation we keep talking about.
I agree with the comment that the X1 > 320i. But, yeah, I guess it doesn't precisely fit the sedan category.
EDIT: I just checked on X1 pricing ... you can't get a 28i sdrive with a manual trans?? Ugh.
And its not just a matter of living with 2 fewer doors. Even if I cut 2 more holes in my Mustang, it would not make the back seat much more inhabitable. I can live with it because my need of the back seat mostly amounts to taking my 4-yr-old 3 miles to the daycare. But I find myself driving one of my other vehicles on those 2 days a week when I pick up both kids in the evening.
Given the vast price difference, it was clear that the ""muscle cars"" of today don't handle anything like their namesakes.
I'm not following this comment. Sounds like you are saying a '60s Mustang handles better than a new one, but I'm sure that's not what you meant."

Along the same lines, for an ""as built"" MSRP of $41,700 (metallic paint, cold weather pkg, HK sound) I'd seriously look into an X1 35i with its super sweet turbo Inline 6 over a 328xi.
Just to stay on topic, I've only got 4 months left with my 2011 328xi. Time flies when you are having fun!"
May 2014,"So basically it has to have 4 doors at the expense of every other option and criteria? I can so live with two less doors and 10K less money spent for a car that drives better. (0-60 in 5.7 seconds vs 6.7?) The base model 3 series is just such a disappointment. 60 less HP just turns it into a slug that feels like you're driving an E30 with a almost thousand pounds added. Oh, wait...
And they make you pay for everything including color paint. The article mentioned above didn't clarify that your choices without spending $550 extra were plain black and white. Not just non-metallic paint, but spray-can basic black or white to add insult to injury.
$10K less and two fewer doors... If you need that easier back seat entry and exit that badly, you're better off just getting a SUV or a Camry.
Also, of note was the test of a V8 mustang vs a M3 that was done a while back. The reviewer gave the ""win"" to the M3, but it was 0.02 seconds around a track with everything turned off in the hands of a racing driver. And a loss of 6+ seconds(!) with the normal driving assists turned on (same driver - ouch). Given the vast price difference, it was clear that the ""muscle cars"" of today don't handle anything like their namesakes.
Sporty and performance? I'd take one of those ""muscle"" cars, add leather and all the goodies, and live with two less doors. And still be less money than a 320i with nothing on it."

Yep, you can almost always find something that seems to equal and often better the ""LPS"" and/or ""ELLPS"" -- call it whatever you want (including brainwashing), but folks frequently look at a fairly large swath of the market and then end up with a ""fill in the blank"" because it is a ""fill in the blank.""
I would suspect, as a somewhat related example, that the Macan S might cannibalize the SQ5's sales (especially if there are Macans on the lot for under $60K), because the Macan is a Porsche.
My friend, thinking he had an a-ha moment bought a Passat CC thinking he got so much more than he would have gotten (in this case) in an A4. Now, the truth of the matter is that he may be accurate in his Consumer Reports Clinical assessment of the two vehicles.
Perhaps ""hate"" is too strong of a word, but -- he hated the CC -- because it WASN'T an Audi. Same story goes for someone who did the same kind of thing with a Nissan instead of an Infiniti, they couldn't wait to early terminate the lease.
Several additional data points are certainly possible for me to share with y'all -- but you probably have your own data points and stories to tell about someone who ""saw the light"" and finally got the Infiniti instead of the BMW and then, almost immediately, was pining for a BMW (which would have been seriously de-contented when compared to the Infiniti -- which cost less money too.)
I sat in (didn't drive) a maxed out Avalon and sat in and drove the Lexus ""ES,"" concluding the Avalon was mo' car for less money. Now, in my case, I have little if any affection for the Lexus brand vs the Toyota ) Avalon -- so I would think of myself as opting for the Avalon seeing no advantage to the Lexus that would justify an extra charge.
But, somewhere back in back of my mind, I know so many ""top class"" folks who practically worship Lexi, so were I to be faced with the choice, I imagine I would ultimately cave (and opt for the Lexus.)
Funny (well sorta), I'll buy Kroger Brand every time vs the national brand if given the chance and if the Kroger Brand (pasta for instance) is cheaper. I buy Costco shirts for crissakes, but I wouldn't own a Costco gas grill -- gotta be Weber.
The badges on cars and many other things (and yes we do need those stinkin' badges) are quite an important part of selecting, buying, financing and ""enjoying the ride"" [of the new 'sheen.]
I have no idea why -- maybe I really have been brainwashed -- but I have no interest in a WRX at virtually any ""real life probable"" price. I'd rather have a bone stock ""fill in the blank"" ELLPS any day.

May 2014,"but a muscle cars you are talking about aren't sedans.
Its still a really simple equation. RWD + sedan + manual. Find another new one for less. The only chance is if street prices for the ATS or G are lower at any given time.
Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying its a good choice by any means. I'm just simply giving facts as I know them. You could get a Charger, but its a fat pig with auto trans. I honestly can't think of anything else. If Suby/Yota makes a sedan version of the BRZ/FRS, they'd be in a category of 1, I believe."
May 2014,"Oddly enough, if you're comparing a base model 320 to other options, the various ""Muscle Cars"" can be had with more options. They handle just as well and offer RWD and a manual transmission if you want it. And for as much as $5K less. And we're not even getting into VW, Infiniti, and others, which also usually come with large year end incentives.
I know this forum is about Luxury Performance cars, but the fact is that the 320 simply is so dreadful in its base form that it's not even as nice as a Civic EX. Now, with the bigger engine and more options, it's a great car, but anyone looking for a $30K or under car has a plethora of better choices."

I wish they still had the s4 wagon-"
May 2014,"Nope. Porsche engine, transmission -- lower HP and torque than SQ5 but offers the ability to option to over $90K with a super high output turbo V6 not offered by Audi.
SQ5 lifted ground clearance; Porsche ground clearance in ""hunker mode."" 33% of the Q5 lives on in the Macan. Offers from Porsche a seemingly price competitive version of the SQ5, if you play with the configurations possible, however, the Macan does cost more. The presumably typically optioned Macan S at the Porsche dealership (which owns the Audi dealership too) was about $64K. My wife's Prestige SQ5 was $63.5K or something close to that. An argument could be made that the Prestige SQ5 with several upgrades is still less ($5K) than a comparably equipped Macan S.
I would think, however, if you're looking at the two at sub $65K, the Macan may present itself as, well, a Porsche! And, even if the Audi is the ""deal"" it is still NOT A PORSCHE.
I would want to drive both and I would want to be fair with the option set up.
I am an Audi fan, to be sure, but the Macan could cannibalize the SQ5 -- not the mainline Q5's, the SQ5. Either Audi needs to up the ante (an RSQ5 perhaps) or be relegated to a rung lower in the giant pecking order in the automotive sky.
Funny, Audi has registered the name RSQ3, but as far as I can find out, NOT the RSQ5 -- can you say ""Marketing!"""
May 2014,"Isn't the Macan a virtual twin of the SQ5? Same powertrain and platform, right?"
May 2014,"Been so busy for weeks! Promised myself I would at least make a post when the '14 S4 reached 10,000 miles. Well, I'm about 400 miles away from 11,000 and I need to report to the collective that once again Audi has managed to build an engine that starts out strong, reboots itself somehow around 5,000 miles into a stronger (and more economical) version of itself, then settles in for another 5,000 miles before it again reboots itself into a noticeably more potent version.
My wife's SQ5 also has passed 10,000 miles and I am now fully able to discern the differences between her 8-speed tiptronic transmission and my 7-speed s-tronic.
In a nutshell: the 8-speed seems, to me at least, to offer the most balanced (of the attributes comfort and sport) presentation of goodness in ""D"" -- the thing is virtually always in its sweet spot in terms of torque on tap, although the downshift rev-matching seems to be, hmm, ""muted"" or somehow pushed out of the foreground. Conversely, the S4 in ""D"" seems hell-bent to hide the performance of the supercharged engine behind a penchant to always shift up a second or a second and half too soon. Also, the s-tronic, in ""D"" really doesn't seem to want you to notice when it downshifts as you are slowing down.
In ""S"" mode, the S4 can bear its teeth providing gobs of torque, a willingness to pull in second gear as if it were on a mission to pull a 100 year old tree stump out of hard dirt. Also, in ""S"" mode the S4 under even somewhat mild acceleration makes that delightful ""burp or fart"" sound upon up-shift, time after time. The s-tronic is a miracle of modern medicine in fact.
When I got into the SQ5 the other day, I felt the transmission attempt to provide velvety shifts (which it did virtually all of the time, except when I pressed it hard, not to). The slight differences in feel between the two transmissions are that the s-tronic can also provide velvety shifts, but they are just ""this much"" smoother somehow -- shifts that under light or moderate acceleration are more heard than felt. The differences are subtle when you're pressing lightly on the right pedal, but even the masterful Audi transmission programmers cannot completely make the tiptronic mimic the s-tronic's slick moves.
The sport seats in both Audi ""S"" models continue to impress with no break-in or break-down of any kind perceptible -- and, the interiors still look fresh despite the recent time I spent sitting behind the wheel of a Premium+ A3 (didn't get to drive it, however.)
The technology too is impressive, even though the choice of T-mobile as the in-car WiFi carrier (3G with very poor signal quality about 1/3rd of the time and 2G with even worse quality the rest of the time) impresses like a turd in a swimming pool.
I have repeatedly asked Audi for an upgrade to another carrier (AT&T, Verizon, cup and a string), I have to assume there is something that (for some fee) could be done to unlock the technology to get off of what has to be the worst cellular carrier ever (at least in SW Ohio). Of course when you get behind the wheel of a new A3 you notice NO T-MOBILE this time around. You can bet by 2016 all Audis will be divorced from T-Mobile. I'd keep my subscription if they'd price it in synch with its usefulness, perhaps $7.50 per month (in SW Ohio anyway). Instead they want $30 per month on a month-to-month basis.
That fellow ELLPS lovers is the only flaw in other-wise delightful pair of ""S"" Audi cars.
BTW - went to the Porsche dealer: finally they had ONE Macan S in stock -- hideous color combo, black on black on black (wheels), gawwd I thought goth was dead (I crack myself up).
However, we do want to drive the Macan to see how the SQ5 holds up against it pound for pound and dollar for dollar.
As always, drive it like you live."
May 2014,"I have an E28 brochure from the early '80s that contains the phrase ""That unfamiliar sensation you are feeling is called the road."""
May 2014,"The very term ""luxury performance"" is tricky--in one way of looking at it, they are at odds with each other, in another way, why can't you have both in equal measure?
For some, having a howling engine and gobs of feedback through your ears, hands and butt are anathema to ""luxury"", to others, any car lacking such things cannot be regarded as a ""performance"" car.
I hate to bring up ancient history but in this case it might be relevant. When Mercedes first starting getting serious about capturing the luxury car market in America (by serious, I mean, large sedans, leather, wood trim, AC, automatic, plenty of gadgetry, plenty of power)--this would be in the very late 1960s, early 1970s---they ran into some serious marketing problems with former Lincoln and Cadillac owners.
What was that? It was a lot of complaints about ""these cars ride too hard"" and/or ""the shifting i too firm"" and ""the seats are too stiff"".
What the American drivers were experiencing was ""performance"" --excellent brakes, precise handling and a rational cockpit designed to help you drive fast."
May 2014,"Vinyl or leather? I could not care less.
No hole in the roof? A MAJOR plus."
May 2014,Is a pleather non-sun roof 180 hp 4cyl considered lux or performance?
May 2014,"Is this the ELLS thread? Or the ELPS thread?
No!
Luxury and performance together.
We will never agree on what constitutes performance, or luxury.
Accord V6 will smoke a 320i - in a straight line.
Sonata limited comes standard with features you have to pay extra for on an A4 - if they are available at all.
We will all agree to disagree."
May 2014,"""funny thing though about the 320. People keep talking about it being a RWD, when in much of the country (at least the NE), almost every one at a dealer is an X drive.""  Would also bet most are auto, non sport and have a sunroof. - as this is BMW setup for sweet lease deal."
May 2014,"funny thing though about the 320. People keep talking about it being a RWD, when in much of the country (at least the NE), almost every one at a dealer is an X drive."
May 2014,"That's certainly true. Could get a mazda3 with more options than a base 320 and even save a chunk of change. Still doesn't mean it is a good substitute for someone wanting a RWD sporty sedan, though.
It's really so simple. Different shoppers have different orders of preference. Some folks put tech on top, some fuel mileage, some RWD/FWD/AWD."
May 2014,"When I bought my A4 way back in '98, one of the reasons I bought Audi instead of BMW was that even though the prices looked similar, the BMW didn't have ANYTHING standard. Not even a folding rear seat. I see that nothing has changed. Once you content it up, add $5K or $10K easily. If you want more sport than luxury, BMW is good. If you want some luxury, too, there are better values out there."
May 2014,"@roadburner @flightnurse - I ""agree"" to disagree - simple logic for me - if you pay 35k for a car why not compare to cars costing 35k and what you actually get/ or in the 320 case what you don't get. So ""I get"" the value of money. Just because you think its a great sports sedan doesn't mean its a great value. - as clarified by car and driver. I would also like to know how many 320s are being ordered with sport and stick- up east all Ive seen are awd and I'm assuming auto, dk about the sports package set up. 
I like facts as well"
May 2014,Agreed...
May 2014,"you just don't get it, but that is fine.. Just proves again you like to hear yourself talk."
May 2014,"RWD sure - but you could get a more powerful german - that's an all around better sports car?
And the double jeopardy answer alex- what is the vw golf R?
car has more of everything in a nice German shell- except for the nice bmw ""free maintence"" and let's not forget about the lease deals and nice dealerships- the vw has everything a value oriented performance person would want in a 4 door.
And motor trends take -...(and to be fair they did talk it up a bit going into this ending blurb)-
""A $35,000 3 Series sedan sounds like a bargain until you learn what's not included. Extra-cost options on a sport package-equipped $34,775 320i include a rear-view camera, navigation system, real leather, enhanced Bluetooth, HID headlights, a moonroof, hands-free keyless entry, and an auto-dimming rearview mirror. Though the sport seats have two-way adjustable side bolsters, fully power-operated front seats are extra. Heated seats cost more, too, unless you consider how hot the black leatherette gets after the car sits in the sun for a few hours. Then there's the aforementioned $550 for a selection of metallic colors. We don't expect any luxury automaker to include all of the above options as standard equipment, but new-to-BMW customers intrigued by the 320i model but familiar with more value-oriented luxury brands may be taken aback by the fact that none of the above is standard.""

May 2014,For the price point it's the entry level Sport Sedan that can he had with a manual transmission and sport package.
May 2014,"I agree $35k is alot of money... but, and maybe I'm forgetting something here, I believe the 320 is the cheapest RWD sport sedan on the market, regardless of luxury status."
May 2014,"In your world there are people who don't want all that but want a Sports Sedan, so they order a 320i with Sport Package, with 6 sod man and they are happy. Then there are people who take a 335i and load it up to 63K.... There isn't a right or wrong answer here. it's all about personal preference. I remember you stated you would never buy a ELPS without a manual transmission, but look you have a automatic.
Dealers are ordering 320i's with Premium Package and leather, that seems to be the bulk of what is on lots. This isn't the lease that is all over the net, but someone who understand leases can get this 320i for roughly $250/m on a lease with very little out of pocket usually tax and fee's."
May 2014,"@flightnurse - my whole argument was Price - 35k to get a car equipped as you stated- no sunroof - base stereo, no power seats or sunroof-select colors and no leather- missing 30 other items and same power as an 18k mainstream cruiser. When you say they are selling many? Where ?"
May 2014,"If you sole argument is technology then you should have bought a Q50 and not your S4... If someone wants a strip down Sports Sedan, which BTW, BMW is selling many 320i with just the Sports Package and 6 spd manual that is the way to go. Some people want a car just like it, others will load up the 320i with all options. One thing I give BMW over many other manufactures is, you can build your car how you want it."
May 2014,"Depends on the buyer; the presence or lack of power seats, leather, and nav have no influence on my choice. Once I'm spending over $30K RWD and three pedals are my minimum requirements.
That said, having extensively driven several iterations of the F30 I have to say that it leaves me cold; I much prefer my Club Sport and '02, not to mention my Mazdaspeed 3- and this comes from someone who has owned BMWs since 1983..."
May 2014,My point on technology was pretty clear a loaded accord with more hp and leather and nav kills a comp 320 in every aspect of tech as equipped- the Accord sport has power driver seat standard for 23msrp. Bmw no such luck- everything is an add on- I'm sure it's a bmw at heart but its expensive for a car with little standard. I wonder if this car is being crossed shopped vs bmw mini
May 2014,"This is why BMW has a la carte ordering system.. Sunroof is standard on the M235i, I too like that you can have it deleted if you want it."
May 2014,"I don't like that; I prefer manual seats. That said, bravo to BMWNA for offering a moonroof delete option on the M235i..."
May 2014,"Power seats are standard on the 328i (wasn't before), folding mirrors are also standard. The premium package is really the best package to get on the 3 series, but in the 320i leather is a stand alone option, leather is part of the premium package which make sense to add for only $1300."
May 2014,"The new 1.8l turbo is an all new unit and the reviews are very positive. On the VW side, it will replace the 2.5l 5 cycle they have been using. Better MPG and better power."
May 2014,"I don't think that it's missing so much as it's optional. A base 320i has very few standard features when compared to a top of the line Accord. To get them equipped similarly, the 3-series will end up priced in the upper 30's."
May 2014,"What lack of technology? Other than the detuned engine, what is missing from the 320?"
May 2014,"True. You reach a point where the HP can not be legally applied anymore. You'd have to branch out into track venues to enjoy the car. 180HP is more than adequate, but it does depend on the weight of the car of course. 180HP in a MINI is not the same as 180HP in a Lincoln Town Car."
May 2014,I would agree. I'd love to see BMW come out with a 220i. I think 180hp would be adequate in that car.
May 2014,"not the same 1.8l. all new motor. Same engine as in my son's Jetta, and it is a really nice unit.
why? So they can keep the base price down, of course. and frankly, that is plenty of motor for that car."
May 2014,"Just saw an A3 commercial. Looks like 1.8 liter is back. But, why?"
May 2014,"BMW Hecho in Mexico??
BMW to announce its first Mexican car plant in July: report"
May 2014,It's probably because the horsepower difference came mostly from better high end torque and longer rev range. This means Joe Sixpack will not see as much difference in his driving to a grocery store.
May 2014,"Yeah.. 180 vs. 240
But, when the E46 came in 325 or 330, the horsepower difference was 184 vs. 225. You could definitely tell the difference, but the 184 HP in the 325i certainly seemed adequate. I'm not a giant fan of the horsepower wars..."
May 2014,60 less HP though. I bet you'd notice
May 2014,"well, the 320 and 328 have the same engine. One is just in a higher state of tune. So like having a few less standard features, it really is the same car. Heck, 1/2 the people that get a 328 probably would never be able to tell if they got a 320i motor by mistake!"
May 2014,"I've leased both a BMW and Infiniti with payments in the $300s, and MSDs.
ELLPS aren't just leased by strivers, seeking to stretch their budget. Plenty of car enthusiasts, just looking for good value for their money."
May 2014,It didn't stick because it had a pathetic engine and price and not enough price difference with G35/G37. From reports I read 320 engine is not bad at all and the pricing difference makes better sense.
May 2014,"This is true, but people just need to dig a little and save a bunch.
So really there is no direct competitor for the 320i. I was looking at base price."
May 2014,"Except that the people BMW is targeting with a $319 lease deal on a 320i aren't the type that have the money to do multiple MSD's - they are going to have a hard time coming up with the $3800 needed to drive it away.
The A3 and the CLS are not targeted against the 320 in their base form - the real competition will be here next year as the next 1 series."
May 2014,Audi has an MSD program.
May 2014,"The interesting thing is people who know all about BMW leases can lease a mid level 328i for around $300/m. In fact, on Bimmerfest one of the Sponsor's which is a BMW Dealer has a great lease on a 528i for $465/m. A friend just did a Euro Delivery on his M235i, ZERO down, and payments of $502/m with tax, MSRP was $49K selling price was $45K.. BTW, yes these leases had 7 MSD's.. Which is the smart way to go.. I'm told Audi doesn't do MSD's which is ashamed it's a win win both both Audi and customer.
Now as I pointed out, Audi now has the A3, which will lease about the same.. Smaller car then a 320i..."
May 2014,"Possibly that impression of being a leaser dream comes from the automotive press, which has been sort of hammering the point:
""With a $33,475 base price, the 320i will allow BMW to advertise more affordable base-model lease deals, potentially with comparable pricing to second-tier competitors--Motor Trend
""BMW's new base 320i brings 3 Series ownership within reach of a lot more people than ever before"" -- LeaseBusters"
May 2014,"We get the320 is a 3 series, I remember Infiniti had a g25 at one point- that didn't last for long. bmw is set apart because its competitive leases, not nothing more"
May 2014,"The 320i is an entry level into a premium brand, just like the A3 is, however, the real difference is, the 320i isn't a smaller car like the A3 or CLA. It's the same F30 as the 328i which means you get a real back seat for two adults, something that the Audi and MB can not claim. This is what is setting BMW apart from Audi and BMW.
When it comes to leasing, the unknown will take the 3K down and $269/m deal, since if they went to a toyota dealer that is what they would have leased a Camry LE for."
May 2014,"Interesting comment coming from someone who never owned a BMW, just for the record, my loaner was a 328d, which had M sport package. The dealership I deal with had X1's, 328i, 328d's and a few X5's. No 320i's as loaners."
May 2014,"Worse still the 320 means you are likely getting a ""lame"" loaner car as a courtesy vehicle while getting your ""free"" BMW maintenance done."
May 2014,"""Mind showing where BMW has called the 320 a ""leaser dream""? I highly doubt they ever called it that..."" Bmw would never call it that, true they want you to think that you are getting a great lux car - 269 a month with 3k down for 36m/30k miles. Seems sweet until you see the lack of technology, power, lux vs a honda accord."
May 2014,"I like the TL, but I think the 3.7L needs a bit more juice. It's a fine engine, but I feel the weight of the TL and the larger engine when driving it. Also, the 6-speed auto seems like an antique, but it appears your real world mileage has bested the EPA estimates????
The main two problems I had with the TL were:
1) The exterior looks and style (or lack thereof)
2) The interior button layout and too many little buttons.
If they listen to my recipe, they'll have a real winner:
Boost HP and Torque 10-15%
Drop 300 lbs.
Fix the styling.
Better button quantity and layout.
More color selection (and better colors)
Boost EPA mileage 15%"
May 2014,"Mind showing where BMW has called the 320 a ""leaser dream""? I highly doubt they ever called it that..."
May 2014,On the accord / cla comments - I was also very vocal in the past as accord better then tsx and entre TL- I would Also say its prob better in v6 loaded form then the overly cheap 320- or as bmw likes to call it the leaser dream-

Most are driving MB, BMW, Audi, Jag's etc,, When he take them out in his car, they are all impressed with the Genesis on fit and finish, ride and comfort. Now has he turned any of them to sell their cars for a Genesis, I doubt it. The people who can afford these cars have been buying them for years. Mark is a perfect example, he is an Audi guy, I doubt he ever looked at a Genesis before buying his S4. This doesn't mean those who have bought a Genesis didn't have a MB or BMW in the past.
We all know that MB, BMW, Audi want the younger buyer, so if they are looking at a fully loaded Accord, then buying a A3 or 320 is within their reach..."
May 2014,"FN....I think over time, and having had a fair amount of cars in my driving lifetime, it becomes clearer to me in seeing, feeling, and experiencing differences in cars. I'd be hard pressed to pick a CLA over a loaded Accord for less money.....especially given on just about every metric you use, the Accord seems to be the better car.
As you note, however, perception is reality many times. The Genesis is a perfect example of that. I've yet to hear anyone state they went from the Mercedes or BMW dealership over to the Hyundai store to cross shop the 5/E/Genesis. On top of that, the new Genesis is quite the looker in its own right.
BTW...was on the interstate last night. Got the TL up to 80 MPH. It was turning right around 2,100 RPM. While driving last night, I was thinking having had the twin scroll turbo in the BMW and the S/C in the Audi, while not as fast, the 3.7L in the TL spurs on quite well, and sounds expensive to boot.
Andres....stay safe!!!!!!!"
May 2014,"Andres3 I was just in San Diego the flight out, I was in awe at all of the fires.. I'm hoping people will be safe. I remember the fires that Mt Laguna had in 1970 we could see the red/orange glow at night..
San Diego has had it's share of fires..."
May 2014,"I took my S4 in for the 5,000 mile service (oil change and tire rotation) at Audi Escondido yesterday afternoon. I'm supposed to pick it up this afternoon, but they said with all the fires going on around San Diego County, one of them is close enough to them that they have been ordered to evacuate; so another day and night without the S4 it'll be. I halfway have my fingers crossed the whole place will burn down so my diminished value claim will be eliminated and I can just get a new S4 
The 1,000 deductible will likely be less than my depreciation and diminished value losses, even after getting a check for diminished value, which could take a while with the speed of Mercury's decision makers."
May 2014,"Graphic, when it comes to cars brand means a lot. Look at Hyundai, Rick's Genesis is a perfect example. It has the same content as a E class and 5 Series and the price is that of a mid level 3 series. The ride is on par with a Lexus GS, but it does not have the star on the hood or the roundel. So people could get a Accord over a CLA but wont."
May 2014,"FN....I'll have to look. Not quite sure what RPMs it runs at 80 MPH. I know the last road trip I took from Cincinnati to Chicago (with a little in town driving-10%) I netted 28 MPG (manual calculations). Buzzing around town, I get about 21-22 MPG.
I've seen a couple of CLAs around here. They're lookers. Sat in one at the local auto show. Not bad, but I wonder if an Accord doesn't have a nicer interior?
A3....a looker also. S3, probably more my speed (literally). Still trying to get over my S4 experience, though.
Still anxious to see the new TLX in the flesh.
And, NYC, I do agree. The ELLPS that are hitting the streets (CLA, A3, 320i, etc) are, generally speaking, an exciting bunch, given their price points."
May 2014,Hey Graphic what is the TL running? It's in my BMW.
May 2014,@flightnurse - you have an s4? Or is that the 320? The corvette might the perfect sports car for the modern age- it runs with anything - is cheap - 55k for 450 plus hp and 29 mpg highway - sick
May 2014,"I don't think CLA is really going to work as well as Audi A3 or 320i. It has the looks, but that is about it. Haven't seen any in Phoenix or Tuscon, but in San Diego, I was surprised on how many I see."
May 2014,"For me at 80, I'm about 2150 also, Rick in the Genesis is about 2275 at 80. Now my vette at 80 was at 1750. At a 100 it was 2100..."
May 2014,"Same here, I was a bit underwhelmed by the CLA. Thought the A3 to be a handsome devil, however. A3 was on a pedestal at the NEIAS, so I could only admire from afar..."
May 2014,"After checking out both at the auto show, I vastly prefer the Audi. And the 320i BMW over the Benz."
May 2014,"Switching gears to the current crop of ELLPS. I'm starting to see more and more MB CLAs & a few Audi A3s on the road. The CLA definitely has the ""Look at me, I'm driving a Mercedes"" look going for it. While the Audi is much more conservatively styled. I actually like the way the Audi looks. This new breed of ELLPS v 2.0 definitely keeps one well within the confines of a mid $30K price range which is great because the price point has definitely escalated of the traditional ELLPS since this discussion started."
May 2014,"Maybe they changed the gearing for 2014's.... at 76.5 MPH I'm at 2K RPM in 7th Gear. At 80 just a smidge above, maybe 2,100-2,150."
May 2014,@andres3 amazing in comfort you can hover 80 and have the rpm under 2k - makes for a nice highway cruse
May 2014,I was able to average about 29 MPG travelling to Sacramento and back down to San Diego again. That includes miserable LA traffic. The S4 with the 7-speed dual clutch is the best drivetrain for my money. Love that mileage because I drive 80+ where possible.

May 2014,"Yes, some of the most expensive parts or labor items are as follows:

Center Grille Gray $740.00
Headlamp $980

RT Knuckle Cobrapress $700
Suspension Labor $504

It adds up quick, and all those new parts require new paint work in addition to there cost.
CA labor is high. CA Sales tax is high. Audi OEM prices on an S4 are fairly high.
CA labor quality is low. CA gas quality is low."

April 2014,
April 2014,"UPDATE: Today there was a puddle under my S4 a few hours after arriving at work. Looked under the hood and there was some puddling of liquid at the bottom of the pans. Coolant was well below minimum. Called body shop to tow the car back to them and give me a rental. 38 days at the shop, and I needed a tow truck only 6 days later.
Germans nearly 4.5 months, 4,100 miles, and no tow trucks.
Americans assemble and build it and it gets 6 days before a tow truck is needed!
Geico says my problem is that I'm nowhere close to getting a total because the ""repairs"" are cheap in comparison to the car's value. That they have to be consistent, fair, and adhere to standards.
I think I""ll have to fight with them on the definition of ""repairs/repaired.""
This is from one of the most reputable well regarded ""Audi Certified"" body shops in all of San Diego County.
Yes, I think I was right about the Insurance and body shop industry being a racket. One spoon feeds the other in a vicious cycle of lies. This incident coupled with my list of 20 ""issues"" has me fed up. The only thing keeping me sane is the body shop is on the hook for the rental I""m in now, and they were receptive to my issue.
Of course, I realize insurance would be expensive if Every Audi with significant damage had to be totaled the way it should be. Either that, or ship it back to Germany to be fixed correctly."
April 2014,"My experience with insurance companies is that they will allow the ""victim"" enough latitude to take the car to a body shop that the victim believes will satisfy their needs to return the car to the status of ""like it never even happened.""
Here in Cincinnati, there is ONE body shop that has gone through the Audi A8 (aluminum) certification and actually sent their techs to Germany for training and then to Chicago for follow up training.
I would use this body shop for any car.
Oddly, my Audi dealer does NOT have a body shop, but the dealer is part of a billion dollar dealer group that has a body shop at each of their Cadillac and Acura dealerships.
If I go to the dealer with a body shop need, they used to take the car to the Audi A8 certified shop -- now, unfortunately, they trot it on over to the Cadillac dealership which does a good job.
Good really is the enemy of great.
I had a minor hiccup (a scratch really) and ended up ""demanding"" the car go to the certified body shop. The dealer complied but not before they offered up the Cadillac (or the Acura) body shop.
I had a trim piece lose its luster on my 2009 A4, and Audi agreed to send me all new chrome trim -- since it was under warranty, I let the Cadillac body shop do the job (and they replaced the trim without incident.) There was no body work or painting involved, however.
If you have any Audi product, I urge you to at least investigate ONLY taking the car to an A8 certified body shop -- they seem to have been indoctrinated with the ""doing it the right way"" and good is not good enough philosophy.
Only great is great, despite the extra cost (which is NOT paid out of your pocket, typically.)
I assume such a body shop would also be ""superior"" for any brand since the degree of care required for an aluminum body certified shop certainly seems to be a step or two above and beyond."
April 2014,"I've seen the best of work and the worst of work done on expensive cars. I recently inspected a 2012 Porsche that had some rather severe damage, and I have to say the bodyshop did an outstanding job on this car. A few weeks later I saw a Lexus SUV and the work was borderline criminal. I could have stuck my finger through the hatch seam."
April 2014,"Sad to say, most people-even those who own premium/luxury/sport cars-aren't all that particular about the quality of bodywork or paint. One of my co-workers was involved in an accident and she asked me to check her car over when it was returned. It was a mess; orange peel, overspray, misaligned trim, and obvious tape lines- but she thought it looked just fine, even after I pointed out the atrocious work.
That said, I just delivered my Club Sport to my local ""BMW Certified Collision Repair Center"" to have a couple of dings repaired. Fortunately I know which tech is the most conscientious and meticulous, and I was able to specify that I only wanted him to touch the car. I'll report back when the car is returned..."
April 2014,"I signed the body shops paperwork noting multiple paint blemishes were noted, to be compiled later. I didn't sign anything from Gieco or Mercury yet."
April 2014,"On second thought, the car might not be as bad as I first thought. My list can be contained under 20. The door misalignment might only be 1/8"". The rocker panel isn't that bad, its decent work, just not Ingolstad standards. After further review, I wasn't noticing anything else I hadn't already noticed in the first 24 hours (although there was one missed/rough/abrupt shift; not repeatable or duplicatable). If they can get my list right, I think I might just be happy with the car (besides, it'll take 3 to 4 months to get one just like it; as I'd have to re-order it from Germany again). This successful outcome of course depends upon Mercury paying me decent DV, and Caliber Collision/European Autobody paying for a premium rental while they do the RE-work on my list.
The car drives and rides well, so mechanically it feels strong; then again I was flopping around in a meager 4 cylinder Altima for a while and that seemed to pale in comparison to a new Accord, let alone an S4. Forgot how sturdy and tight fitting the seats were too compared to the rental fodder; reminds me to lose weight, or at least not gain any more weight.
The main thing that upset me was the low hanging exhaust that isn't symmetrically low hanging. This is a bad rolling on the road advertisement for Audi, hence why I thought the shop should be uncertified."

April 2014,"Graphic I don't think he could have taken the car without signing paperwork.... BTW, we have Geico and could not be happier with them, Rick had a fender bender in the Genesis, Geico really took care of him and made sure he was happy with the repairs. We are switching over to USAA not because of the serivce, but rates for the cars and homeowner is less, plus we will get a $1250 discount on our X3 through USAA."
April 2014,"Andres...not surprising that the insurance co is being obstinate. I've made a mental note.....never buy Geico insurance.
They are on the hook to make the car right, regardless of where it was repaired. You didn't sign any release papers did you?"
April 2014,"@andres3‌
What you are going through absolutely sucks dude. You are being picky and have every right to demand nothing less than perfection from the body shop and insurance company that is fixing a ""dream car"" for you with only 4200 miles which before it got hit was still ""brand new.""
Did you say they cut you a check for diminished value? It just seems at this point that you aren't going to ever be 100% happy with the car. Have them fix whatever else they can, then take the car to CARMAX, take it to a couple of Audi dealers, sell it or trade it in. Even with a ""dirty carfax,"" it is still a low mileage S4.
Either way, good luck!"
April 2014,"I'm liking the idea of having a new car as that's the only way I'll get back to having a German built and assembled S4 which clearly is far superior to one built and assembled in Escondido, CA.
The insurance company seems to think they are off the hook and I need to sue my chosen body shop. I did point out the windshield cowl was on them since it was never on the estimate, and they said they would pay for stuff if it was missed in the original estimates or supplements. How do I get them to see it as potentially their problem again?
How would I go about getting a salvage title if they don't cooperate? I am missing a few links in the chain there. I suppose my argument is that Geico and Mercury's adjuster's erred incompetently in saying this vehicle was repairable for 15.5K in 28 days. 38 days of rental for nearly $1,400, and $20.3K in repairs later, and we are where we are now. I do think I'll contact Audi and let them know this shop should certainly be DE-Certified."
April 2014,"The other driver was at fault of course. I don't cause accidents, and I'm usually able to avoid them. You have to be a really horrible terrible driver to cause a collision with me.
When I told the adjuster and sent him 5 pictures of the first 5 things I noticed that were wrong (mostly paint scuffs/scratches/chips), he said Geico had paid the body shop, the body shop was my choice, and I'd have to deal with them on paint issues. Basically saying, you are on your own since you didn't choose one of our preferred shops, and our only obligation is to pay for repairs."
April 2014,"How does one post pictures on this forum, I thought by 2014 it would be as easy as attaching a pic to a text? Tutorial needed."
April 2014,"I second it and basically stated that in my posting. When a car has a repair tag of 20K which included frame (sub frame) work you are asking for issues. Since the car is basically new, it would never be the same. Now I don't remember, who was at fault in the accident?"
April 2014,"Andres....Just my personal opinion, but I think it's time to go to the insurance company and tell them you need a new car....for all the reasons listed. If they choose to fight (like with the tires, which to me is being rather nit-picky given all 4 tires should have the same tread depth), then you can tell them to give you a new car now, or risk having a car with a salvage title instead after you begin your proceedings."
April 2014,"Bigger problems than tires..... Got the car back yesterday afternoon. In a quick 15 minutes close eyeball inspection, I was able to find at least 10 things wrong with the car.
A small scuff/scratch on the black plastic windshield cowl, multiple black marks/paint blemishes on bumper edges/corners, a small minor white scratch that if not on the prior existing damage sheet, must of been caused during the shop's 38 day ownership of the car, a tiny chip on the roof, some rough slightly bumpy paint around edges such as around the fuel filling cap area, the underside of the hood has a paint blemish, and a general impression that orange peel is more prevalent or noticeable, but not bad, just not great.
I was expecting all that above and I'm sure most of that can be fixed in a 2nd trip to the body shop under warranty. However, I wasn't expecting the following:
Misaligned right doors (or at least the trim isn't lining up right) Haven't measured but I'd say around 3/16"" if I had to guess).
Lower Rocker panel fit and finish issues (increased gap, noticeable double sided sticky tape seeping through the wide uneven gap, paint blemishes at joint) They admitted that even with a brand new rocker panel, 9 new rivets, Audi's instructions, and new double-sided sticky tape, they've never been able to match what they do in Germany. They suggest it must be installed differently in the factory. Looks aftermarket now.
The exhaust was removed and reinstalled, and now both sets of exhaust tips appear to be hanging too low in relation to the back bumper diffuser, with the right two exhaust tips noticeably about 1/2""-3/4"" lower than the left pair of exhaust tips. 
Number 3 bothers me the most. They say if what you can see is bad and lacks QC, then perhaps what you can't see is even worse. Oh yeah, and there's still about a 4"" piece of masking tape on the lower edge of the front right door (detailer should be fired).
On the other hand, the mechanical work seems solid; that's the bright side. The car drives and runs well (of course the dealership did a large portion of that work). I'd say the only thing I can tell that might be a tad ever so slightly off is the steering wheel might just be like 1 degree off-center; very close. When I eyeball leveling the steering wheel, the car will move slightly right, then again, maybe my eyeballs are off by a degree or two."
April 2014,"They are saying I should pay a 20% betterment charge for getting two new tires replacing two tires that had 80% life left.
My argument is simply that since I want to change all 4 tires at the same time on the same rotation, the extra 2/32nd's on the front tires will provide me no betterment. I'm not going to delay changing the 2 newer tires when the older 2 are due for replacement just so I can eek out a ""betterment."" I will gain no benefit. If your always changing out your tires 2 at a time you are changing them out twice as frequently (in terms of shop visits and down time) than if you just change out all 4 at once.
I can assume and project all 4 tires will wear evenly since the car is AWD and all 4 tires measured at the same 20% wear."
April 2014,"@andres3‌ we going to see picks of this pig? Would love to see the damage myself ? 
Speed kills people stay safe.:"
April 2014,If I were your insurance company I would have the tire shop shave a tire to match up with your present tires and tell you you're good to go. IMO asking for 4 new tires where only one is damaged when the car has only 4200 miles is a reach. Why would you have to double your maint. frequency if the tires are within the 2mm spec. anyway?
April 2014,"So I got in a fight with my insurance company; I believe they've turned on me and they have 3 strikes in my book now. They found out the impacted tire wouldn't balance on the wheel and had to be replaced. They tried to get away with only replacing 1 tire saying the car only had 4,200 miles. I pointed out to Geico that they were deviating from the Owner's manual and Audi specifications that recommend replacing all 4 tires, but under no circumstances should tires be replaced in less than pairs on the front and/or rear axle. They must be within 2 MM to meet spec from front to rear. After sending a semi-nasty letter to Gieco, they realized the error of their ways, and said they'd pay for 80% of 2 tires, but 20% betterment charge to me (they are within the 2 mm spec.
20% betterment when staggered tires (2/32nd's difference) will result in reduced or at least altered performance? NO THANK YOU. Also, I won't get any betterment because I'm not going to double my maintenance frequency and hassle changing 2 tires at a time, especially when the manual says running different size tires (circumference) will result in reduced handling."
April 2014,"@andres3‌
Thanks for keeping us updated. Sorry you have to go through this whole ordeal."
April 2014,"Finally got the first supplemental estimate: Just north of $20K!!!!
Still, well below totaling even with 15% DV and $1,405 rental costs.
However, I find being off (first estimate was $15.5K) by so much, makes me think someone wasn't being honest with themselves early on. I know supplements are common, but one of nearly 25% extra? 28 day time estimate is way off too. Looks like it'll be 1 month and 4 days if they let me pick up next Tuesday."
April 2014,">
The S4 is a combination of aluminum, ultra high strength steel, and steel components. It appears the aluminum sub-frame of the suspension got knocked out of place affecting the left side though the impact was on the right. They said they were able to adjust it the 2nd day at the dealership to meet specs. I think unlike Toyota (in general), an Audi authorized body shop doesn't try to mess around and do things ""half-way."" There's only 3 body shops that qualify for ""Audi Certified"" in all of San Diego County. A good example is that on the first day at the dealership, they didn't try to magically adjust parts out of spec to meet spec. They admitted it didn't meet spec and worked on the car longer to get it right. In a way; this is a good thing; although my rental will now be around $1,400 due to the extended delays. I think they know the typical Audi owner is meticulous with attention to detail. After all, they didn't settle for a VW. 
The body shop will get the car back first thing Monday morning, do a test drive by driving the vehicle back to the shop (what happens if they wreck on the way back?) After that, he said they had a good 1.5 days of work finishing up the buffing, polishing, and detailing on the panels that were repainted (a majority of panels by the way due to blending).
I hope I don't face delays like you did, because the more that is eaten up by rental costs out of the guy's $10K insurance limit, the harder it will be for me to collect decent diminished value.
When I told Geico to put what they told me over the phone in writing (that they'd defer to me to be made whole first from the 10K, then come in afterwards), they balked. They said let's wait and see what Mercury agrees to pay for DV and other things first, then we'll talk. I sent a demand letter to Mercury for 15% of the total purchase price $55K (including fees/taxes) = $8,250 for DV alone. I added a caveat that this was to settle fast and quickly without me having to pay professional appraisers and incur additional costs. I told them if they force me to go further, I will no longer negotiate the highest of my consultants estimates, whereas right now I might negotiate down a bit to just get it over with.
If there are ongoing issues with the car, I think now is the time to state for the record I thought the car should of been totaled from the beginning. At least then I can say ""I told you so,"" and your adjuster was off by somewhere near 25% (incompetent or grossly negligent estimate)."
April 2014,"The problem isn't so much that the cars can't be fixed---they certainly can be made to look as good as new---, but that the insurance companies don't want to be trapped into, or locked into, supplemental repairs on a complex luxury car, weeks or months after the initial repair. So I think they assess the damage not only as to estimated repairs, but the type of car and the type of damage. You know, floods, fires, etc, give the insurance company pause."
April 2014,"Basically looking at near $30K or 60%. Still, too low to total, but my opinion is generally that cars are unfixable from significant accident damage. Maybe this body shop will change my mind; I'm hoping!


I have been in 5 accidents, 4 in cars (none my fault), one accident, I had to make a panic stop on I-8 west bound from La Mesa to Mission Valley, just picked up our truck from the dealership, truck was 6 months old, had 6K miles on, and a lady slammed into me at 65 mph, lucky for me, the truck was taller then her car, her insurance company was going to fix the truck, it needed a new frame, cost of said frame, $7900, then another $13K to R&R frame. My EX and I fought the insurance company to just total the truck, since the job was going to take roughly 3.5 months to complete.... So after 5 months (it took the dealership 2 months to complete the job) but each time I would take the truck out for a test drive I would find something wrong with the truck, after 5 months, of nit picking her insurance wrote a check for the truck. Andres3 be very picky and DO NOT sign a release unless you are 100% happy with the car, after a while, the adjuster might just say, lets forget this and write you a check... Doesn't your S4 have an aluminum frame?"
April 2014,Please keep us posted on the body shop's progress.
April 2014,"Oh, I'm not saying you don't have a case - we've had the diminished value discussion already and I think your car, if any, should qualify for it."
April 2014,"Yes, but when you add in Diminished value of around 15%, Rental Car expenses of about $1,250, and who knows how much extra could be needed before all said and done. And if the vehicle isn't quite right after all that effort; what then?
Basically looking at near $30K or 60%. Still, too low to total, but my opinion is generally that cars are unfixable from significant accident damage. Maybe this body shop will change my mind; I'm hoping!"
April 2014,$17K in damage repairs is still only about 33% of the value of the car; not even close to the threshold used by most insurance carriers to write it off.
April 2014,"My experiences with Audi have all been positive. Every company can have a bad apple. The real goal should be to buy a vehicle that never gives a company a chance to establish their customer service levels, as you never have to visit them. That's what happened my first 4,100 miles in the perfect 2014 S4, but a day before I'm supposed to pick it up at the body shop, I'm told the dealer is finding the left front side of the vehicle out of alignment spec, enough out of spec that they can't adjust to meet spec.
The accident was on the right side; this could spell trouble. Not Audi's fault of course, the Lexus driver is at fault. I will say I escaped the ordeal without as little as a bruise; the belt did what it's supposed to do. I'm told the tow truck could have caused the suspension damage.
All the fluids had to be refilled & recharged (coolant, transmission, transmission coolant, AC system). The driver's seat belt has to be replaced (one-time use with significant impacts). The air box had to be replaced. Might end up being more than 17K when all is said and done; I think they should have totaled it; we'll see."
April 2014,"I like the interior of the new TLX, and I wonder if not having a shift lever will be a plus or a minus in attracting customers. At this point, I don't have any experience with ""no shifter"" so I'll go with being neutral on the subject.
I am assuming the interior utilizes the upper and lower screen approach -- I run hot and cold on that, too, but probably more cold: I am more in favor of one screen generally speaking, but the TLX's interior does seem to send out most, if not all, of the queues that suggest it is a Premium car interior (an upgrade from my 2012)."
April 2014,"I owned an '05 TL for 6.5 years/85k trouble-free, fun and efficient miles. One of Honda/Acuras best designs imo (along with original Legend Coupe). Clean, elegant, sporty. I was so disheartened by the current design, did not consider it for even a moment. The toned down beak/shield is an improvement, but still wouldn't mind seeing it go the way of the Dodos... The TLX, from appearances, welcome back, Acura!
I""ve not owned nearly as many cars as I'd like (darn family responsibilities and fiscal conservatism!), but my '88 Integra and '05 TL remain two of my faves."
April 2014,So this is a paddle shifter?
April 2014,"Agreed. The shield/beak front felt repulsive, at least at first. It kind of grew on a little bit, but was never in a beauty contest. TSX actually looked just a tad better in this beak thing than TL. I also liked previous TSX.
BTW, TSX was a perfect size for me. Similar to older BMWs and Audis. I don't really carry passengers, but I like four doors (actually five). To me back seat size is not as essential, as driving experience, which those shorter wheelbase vehicles provided. Unfortunately, all those names grew to sizes reminding their bigger brothers 10 years ago. I think the whole category really shifted. When you get something like optioned-out 335, A4 or soon coming C-class, they aren't really entry level, they are still ""sporty"", but not really ""sports"". Same would be with CTS, TLX, or others.
Unfortunately, their smaller siblings, which some would now argue as ELLPS, come mostly in FWD setups, which is off for traditionalists. It becomes fact of life. It is true that contemporary FWD is not your mother's FWD - current advances in torque handling made those cars much better to drive. Many have or will have AWD option and better engines, which mitigates some of the issue."
April 2014,@stickguy‌ - right on best looking was that generation - bmw and mb lovers like to use product codes- so the UA6-UA7
April 2014,The TL I like was the 2004-2008 vintage. I was behind one today (in my 2000 TL) and enjoyed the view. Also like the interior much better (plus I fit much better).
April 2014,"I have never owned a TL, but personally, I think the current generation TL (2009 - 2014, especially post 2012) actually looks quite a bit better (exterior wise) than the new TLX in many area (size, stance, and presence). Yes the TLX looks a bit better than TSX, but that's about it..."
April 2014,"tsx Nothing more then a rebaged smaller accord-while a nice car- the new tlx looks great from the side but sorry the grill is still so pronounced it really takes away from the rest of the car like the TL, which by all accounts was a styling nightmare for the brand. & If they are going to make cars without shifters just put a seat in its place, let's make it a 6 seater------ push button drive, reverse, nav button, parking break - seems like they are trying to hard and I guarantee someone will leave this thing in gear at the wrong time."
April 2014,"Regarding the TLX: I like the grill now.
For me, I still don't dig the shield look, and it's kind of bulbous.....totally subjective, I know."
April 2014,"Having my 320i now since Oct and having over 12K miles on I can say that BMW did it's homework on a entry level Sports sedan. One can get a 320i with the Sports package, (it's really the M sport package) for $1300, a bargin... It can be had with a manual transmission out the door for roughly 5% less then MSRP, if the buyer knows how to haggle with the salesman and over on Bimmerfest, a lot of people know how to haggle. If you add the Premium package to said car, you have a nice ELLPS. Now on power, the 320i only makes 180, but installed the BMS Stage 1 ($395 and installs in 45 minutes) and the power difference between the 320 and 328 disappear. In fact, my 320i is faster then a E90 328i. Overall I'm very happy with this car, as I stated in the past, I don't plan to track the car, so not having a the sport package hasn't been a issue for me. I have been driving it lot between Phoenix and San Diego, Phoenix and Tucson, and I'm simply amazed at the highway MPG best been 36.6 MPG, with cruise set at 80 and A/C on. Is the face of ELLPS changing yes, and I think Acura was the first company to make it change with the TSX."
April 2014,"Michaeall...I see that same tail light treatment in the ILX, the RLX, and how the TLX. At first, I wasn't sure I liked the LED headlights, as Acura is using them as a design cue. They're starting to grow on me, though. Looks like the tailights are the LCD ""lite pipe"" variety replacing my LED tail lights. That interior is gorgeous.
Saw some other specs....
0-60 around 5 secs for the TLX SH AWD (about 1/2 sec quicker than my current TL SH AWD). MPG is 21/31. I get 21 in the city, now. So, not sure that is an upgrade. But, if the numbers are right, I'm getting 28 MPG on the highway. If they can hit 31 MPG with the new trans, that would be great.
3.5L. 290 HP and about 270 TQ. That HP and displacement is less than my durrent TL (305 HP, 3.7L), but apparently the new 9-speed trans and weight reduction is attributed to the higher performance.
TLX multi-link suspension replaces my TL's double wishbones. Not sure about that. Will have to drive to see how that affects ride/handling.
Probably stop by my dealer tonight to see when their roll out is going to be."
April 2014,I like the grill now. Interesting that there is no shifter. Overall though looks great and I'm anxious to see how they price it.
April 2014,Nice
April 2014,Wish they would have (drastically) changed the grill.
April 2014,"That is a handsome car - is it just me, or do I detect some semblance to the ILX around the C-pillar and trunk area in the side profile?"
April 2014,"Thanks, Dash. By appearance alone it's at the top of my next car shopping list."
April 2014,"Well, entry level is entry level. That definition is pretty clear cut. Sedan is pretty clear cut as well. The only thing that is questionable is the ""performance"" part. But it appears the A3 will perform just as well if not better than the A4. I think that was the hang up with the TSX being included in that it didn't really fit the ""performance"" model in a lot of people's minds. I had no problem with it being included because there are a lot of A4 w/ front wheel drive running around out west and down south that are very close on paper to a TSX. I know most people think of the Quattro when they talk Audi ELLPS but that's a choice of their own.
Doesn't really matter all that much to me. But technically, a lot of the cars that have been traditionally discussed here are no the the performance entry from that particular brand anymore. It's just so complicated isn't it."
April 2014,The new TLX: Definitely on my short list.
April 2014,"A3, CLA, 2-Series and who knows what else will come forth?
This forum, nominally, is the Entry-Level LPS forum. There is, of course, also an LPS forum. These names were fine when there was no CLA, A3, and etc. Now, we have more ""creep"" by several mfgs -- the new Mercedes C class is a big move up in its ""Premium-ness"", and even though the A4 (Audi's B class) was born in 2008, it too has upped its luxury content, and one can imagine that the upcoming calendar year 2015 A4 will take a page out of the A3's book and be pushed further upscale.
The new TLX (just coming to market) is, from the pictures at least, a big step up, and the same is the case (mostly) for the other ELLPS cars.
I never understood what justified the Acura TSX's inclusion as an ELLPS but I accepted it as a moderator's choice that just stuck.
A discussion forum here has a pretty wide latitude for discourse when there are multiple ostensibly competing cars to be commented on -- and that is fine with me. I do think, however, that the forums that include multiple cars should include cars that are typically cross shopped.
Example: I might have test driven a Ford Taurus SHO when I was looking to replace my TL SH-AWD; but this event was most likely an anomaly. The Taurus SHO is not an ELLPS by any definition I can think of, nor is it, despite its girth, a candidate for the LPS forum.
Therefore, at this point, the A3 and CLA and whatever else comes out BELOW the current A4, 3 Series, TLX, S60, IS, Q50 and so on should merit their own forum.
The other day, I was at my Audi dealer, looking at a heavily optioned A3 Premium+ (there is one step up from that , it is called Prestige, and one might argue the upcoming S3 might up the ante even furhter). The thing was somewhat MORE expensive than a stripped A4 Premium (quattro) model.
For the time being, perhaps, folks may cross shop the NEW A3 with the OLD A4 -- the replacement A4 however will, presumably, dissipate the overlap, if not always in price, certainly in its ability to be perceived as distinctly ""more premium"" than even the top o' the heap A3.
In any case, unless we want these forums to devolve into ""anything goes"", my vote is to put this new crop of sub-ELLPS cars into their own forum, perhaps something like Premium Sporty Compacts, PSC for short, or Sporty Premium Compacts, SPC, pick something, anything, just not ELLPS unless we make a new class in between ELLPS and LPS.
""Move along . . . these aren't the droids we're looking for."""
April 2014,"I think both can coexist, as long as the bigger models don't go too far upscale. So A3/A4, TSX/TL, are both close enough. Not sure there are really any others?"
April 2014,Good question @michael@edmunds. I would say its always been up to the moderator- acura has had 2 cars here from the beginning and my argument was/is the tsx really Ellps? Obv the word sedan needs to be addressed but I think you need a pricing band- say 30-40k starter (obv that is a huge range but it's something) - and it has to be somewhat sporty - we can all agree the Lexus ES and other fwd rebaged cars should not.
April 2014,"Back to ELLPS ... I've got a question.
It's been assumed that, from the start of this thread, that ELLPS refers to models such as the 3-series, C-class, A4, etc.
Now that there is a 2-series (OK, this is a coupe only at the moment, but I figure the 2-series ""gran coupe"" is just around the corner), the CLA-class and the new A3, what do we call them? Are they the new ELLPS, and the old (larger) ones now need a new name?"

April 2014,"@markcincinnati‌ ""Do the Manufacturers read our rants and raves?"" By the recent action on edmunds- not many people read any of these posts.
I think manufactures are paying closer attention to consumer reports-"
April 2014,"How wonderful would the world be if not those pesky customers. As we all know GM's customer duty is to buy, shut up and put up. You and your Mother. Who do you think you are? You have the nerve, mister - actually read terms of your contract and demand work when it's due... If we all did that, GM would be bankrupt... Wait the minute... They actually are, gee I wonder why"
April 2014,"For the record, it [the Audi S4 issue] was NOT my Audi. As I have stated to distraction, between my personal cars, company paid-for cars and my wife's cars, we've had, er, 31 Audis in our garage since late 1977. They have not all been perfect. Yet, there has never been a problem that Audi has NOT stepped up and fixed (and only one time did an Audi factory rep take a look at one of my cars, and his response was to authorize all new rotors for my braking vibration issues.)
I am NOT suggesting that I know some inside information -- but how do we know the mfgrs aren't paying attention to these posts (and posts made elsewhere)?
I would think the almost 100% vertical ""rise in importance"" of social media would virtually dictate that the mfgrs monitor the WWW for blogs, rants, raves, posts, tweets and so on.
It just doesn't seem likely we are just chatting with each other and that what we say is not even some small part of the mix of ""market research"" and data points that so many companies covet and spend governmental sums to acquire.
We, all of us collectively (via ""the vivid awareness of the relationship between personal experience and the wider society"", C. Wright Mills), can [potentially] ""move markets"" -- especially and unfortunately somewhat easily in the negative, more so than the positive.
Imagine if ""we all"" wrote nothing but ""hater"" tales about the ""DeSoto"" -- you know, pick one car or car company (we could all pile on GM in light of its recent bad publicity, for example) -- that could be dozens (or perhaps thousands) of taste makers in a short time telling the world that ""this [DeSoto] product"" sucks, under-performs, costs too much, drinks gas or costs a young fortune to maintain and spends more time in the dealer's garage than the owner's, for instance.
I would think once what we wrote was posted here and subsequently quoted or re-posted on Facebook or any social media outlet of note, the crud would hit the fan. It seems ""obvious"" (to me) that the mfgrs must be observing what is being said and weighing the requirements to react and/or respond.
I'm probably giving them too much credit -- maybe."
April 2014,"dino....you are so right. I can't remember how many times I'd call the dealer to ask the status of my repairs. After several days....the answers would be something along the lines of....""we haven't received instructions on how to fix your Audi"", or....""we're waiting for parts. Might take another week"". Or, ""we haven't been given the 'go-ahead' to fix your car"". How is this possible? The car was a year into the alleged ""bumper-to-bumper"" warranty. What's to authorize? You fix it.
One of the reasons I won't buy a Cadillac was the way they treated my late Mother. This was several years ago, but my Mother had bought an STS brand new. Granted, her only driving was to the hair dresser, the grocery store, the pharmacy, church on Sunday....LITERALLY A CAR DRIVEN BY A LITTLE OLD LADY.
It may sit for a day or two, but it was driven at least 3-4 times/week. It kept draining the battery. Cadillac dealer kept replacing the battery. A week or two after the new one was installed, it would go dead.
GM started doing the ""hokey-pokey"" with my Mother...blaming her for not driving it enough. So, she and I swapped cars. I drove her Caddy every day. Same thing happened when I drove it.
After having it towed yet again to the 3rd Caddy dealer to see if they could fix it, they authorized a new battery as the ""fix"". I asked the service manager if it didn't make more sense to do a diagnostics on the electrical system to see WHY the battery was being drained. He said all GM would reimburse them for was a battery replacement.
GM ended up eating that car after there was such a huge surge in the electrical system that the rear window defroster actually ""blew out"" the rear window after the surge.
When the buy back was authorized, I took the Caddy to the selling dealer as GM instructed. Dropping off the keys to the GM of the dealership, he said he wished he had never sold the car to my Mother.
Know what? So am I. That attitude has kept me away from the brand ever since."
April 2014,"I've seen many posts from GM customer service on brand specific Edmunds forums and I think also on the midsize cars forum. So, at least one manufacturer does read the forums. So the simple answer is yes some do. I'm sure some do but don't go as far as actually post. Now, why does GM do it and overtly at that? I don't know. One would like to think that they are trying to improve and/or fix product. But it may just be to cut potential lawsuits off at the pass. Obviously, it hasn't worked perfectly......much like their vehicles."
April 2014,"The short answer is no. The long answer is no. They don't care. As long as the sales are going up, they think everything is better than ever.
Regarding your dealer appearing disinterested in fixing your car, one possible explanation is that the manufacturer pays them just enough to break even on simple clear-cut issue (remove X, put new part back), but they may not get enough money to pay for diagnostic effort required when complex systems are involved. Then there may be manufacturers policy of putting head into sand when it comes to some issues, like MMI and such. If it's not direct safety (where they may get a big slap from media and/or government), they get less incentive to actually make it work. Moreover, complex electronic infotainment systems have a standing ""beta version"" stance. My observation is anytime software is involved, the sellers have some kind of indemnity - all those lengthy and unfair terms of use basically allow them to charge full price for a developmental product. So it goes like that: what da ya want - it's new, complex, it's gremlins, I dunno notin'."
April 2014,"Mark....you're preaching to the converted. It confounds me to no end the lengths some car manufacturers will go to keep from finding their products at fault. The recent GM ignition switch debacle is just the latest. IF you have a problem, fix it. If you can't fix it, replace it. If neither of those work....""here you go Mr/Ms customer....here's a check. We're sorry for the inconvenience. We hope to see you again under better circumstances"".
I think in my case, it was the Regional Rep who really was the ""putz"". While I had electronic gremlins that could have been alleviated with new ""parts"" (ones which they made a point of telling me were uber expensive), the really bothersome issue was the Quattro binding. I drove with them. They experienced the issue....admitted as much. Something electro-mechanical was amiss. After all the potential ""cheap"" fixes were exhausted, they turned to the mantra ""just bring it back when it totally leaves you stranded somewhere"".
2nd problem was how they drug their feet in making a decision on how to proceed. Yes, I had their loaner cars. But, I wanted MY CAR. Then, the Regional Manager tried to do a dance around the issue, denying any problems whatsoever (regardless of the obvious, clearly demonstrable issues).
As the old adage goes...""you only get one chance to make a good first impression"". Audi kind of blew that with me.
The two companies that I've had the utmost positive customer service with has been Acura and BMW. Probably more of a reflection of the individual dealerships than anything else. But, both have gone out of their way to make sure I was happy with my ownership experiences.
After years of not being loyal to any one manufacturer, it's becoming more of a priority for me to deal with the car companies that gives me the best customer service. Of course, to get me in the door to begin with, I have to like their products.
Again, no condemnation of your love of Audis. Your experiences have just been different than mine."
April 2014,"Do the Manufacturers read our rants and raves?
I shared the story of the S4 that couldn't (or wouldn't) be made right with my lawyer wife. The first thing she said was ""doesn't someone from Audi read the comments on Edmunds and Audiworld?"" She elaborated that it appears that it would be less expensive to have simply replaced the un-fixable S4 rather than have the story be posted in no small amount of detail on the web.
My own questions have to do somewhat with the dealer -- who was paid at the time of sale and is paid for warranty work. You'd think the dealer, who apparently is not losing any money on this customer would be interested in going the distance to get the customer's issue resolved. If the dealer was bleeding dollar bills, I could almost understand their reluctance to throw more money (mostly represented, I would assume, by time) at the problem.
Audi (and others) must have interns that read our posts, maybe even computer programs that comb the Internet looking for keywords (the Audi spiders?) and bringing stories to the attention of said interns. Unless they don't have such interns or programs, it would seem valuable -- in marketing terms alone -- to have addressed the ailing S4's issues rather than seeing them escalate to the point that the customer gives up in frustration.
I mean it was not like there were ""attacks"" or rants (without substantiation) posted; no name calling, etc. So for the wholesale cost of a new car the customer good-will would have, I can imagine, offset the ill-will and frustration laid out here for all to see.
The question stands -- do the manufacturers have folks who monitor what we write about their products and when there seems to be a less than positive issue, intervene?
On the subject of separation (by Audi from VW or by Infiniti from Nissan, for instance), it does indeed appear that when the Premium car maximizes its separation from the more humble ""parent"" they both win. Porsche, still in not very old memory, was building a number of cars that shared way too many VW components -- and those cars were damn near crucified by the motor reviewing press (and customers). Porsche virtually stopped this practice and the market responded positively.
These days there are still parts sharing (between and among car company's cousins), but when the Audi division began to separate itself further and further from VW, Audi's market and machines improved significantly. On the other side of this, Infiniti's G is born with RWD, I know of no Nissan analog, ditto the M -- but the JX was brought to market so quickly Infiniti had to base it on a Nissan product (FWD no less), and despite the JX's success (or lack of), it is probably not one of Infiniti's shining moments in marketing or manufactuing.
BMW has no sub-BMW division or parent which can be said to be a strength, but also may put BMW in a precarious position in the future as we see the global consolidation of car companies gather momentum.
Once there were 88, soon there may only be one-quarter that number [sic]."
April 2014,"Mark....The FWD A4s and A6s are price leaders. And, as has been mentioned, it's also a regional thing, too. In the sunny states, it's a rarity of find 4WD/AWD anything. Fact is, any Quattro A4/6 has it's beginnings as a FWD platform, just like SH AWD Acuras have their beginnings on FWD platforms.
I did rent a Jetta earlier this year. There are similarities to Audi...certain switches, handles, styling (especially the center stack and dash), etc. However, this is true for many brands. I don't see GM making different window switches for Cadillac when they can use the ones from Buick, just as one example.
Is a Honda a ""humble"" basis for an Acura? I dunno....depends on how you look at it. An Accord is certainly a very good starting point for an Acura.
I'm excited about the upcoming TLX. As I normally do, if in a couple of years, I decide to make a trade, the TLX will be tops on my list.
That's based on my experiences with both the S4 and the TL SH AWD. Does that make the S4 a bad car? No, not by a long stretch. It didn't work out all that well for me, and that may mean I have my own biases. But, that shouldn't and hasn't dissuaded you.
We'll wait and see what is unveiled today. I've seen the prototype pics. Acura is pretty good at sticking to pre-release versions of their production models. I like what I've seen. Then again, I liked the previous design, too.
5-sec 0-60, SH AWD, torque vectoring rear, 9 speed trans, Honda reliability, coming in at roughly $10K less than either a 335i or S4 equipped like for like, there's lots to love there."
April 2014,"where are you getting this on the 1.8? It isn't the old 1.8T motor, it is the new one that is in the Jetta and Passat now. Which is rated quite a bit higher than the 2.0T in the same model. a little less power true, but not much slower and does run on RUG."
April 2014,"Audi thinks Americans are dumb enough to get a FWD A3 with the mediocre 1.8T rather than the very good 2.0T Quattro A3.
Not only is the 1.8T down on HP and torque, but it also guzzles more fossil fuel than the 2.0T. And that is DESPITE the weight and efficiency disadvantage of the bigger engine and Quattro vs. FWD. The 1.8 FWD needs to be retired."
April 2014,"Just looked at local dealer inventory. It is a sample of one, one point of time. The A4 on the lot are 2:1 for AWD, so it seems its market share had already crept up."
April 2014,"It is regional, for sure. A local Tampa dealer once told me a few years ago that they sold mostly FWD cars, by units anyway. Considering most high end models are AWD standard, dollar figure may be different. I think even in Florida AWD is creeping up, but probably much slower than in other parts of the country."
April 2014,"Is there anyplace (on the web?) where the number of FWD vs Quattro Audis sold in the US can be found? I've been to Audi dealers in Dallas and there were NO FWD cars other than a TT and the previous model A3 on the lot -- AWD appears NOT to be a regional issue. The highest performance Porsches and Lambos (and even some other Italian exotics) are AWD are they not?
I know that I am an Audi-biased and even German car-biased person, but I would really like to know if there are any significant number (%) of FWD Audis of any configuration sold in the US -- something (maybe emotion) tells me the number of FWD A4s, 6s. 8s, etc sold are in the single digits (%). I think it would be difficult for Audi to have achieved -- after decades and the unintended acceleration setback -- Premium status if the cars were in any significant volume FWD. This FWD issue is a problem for Acura.
In the ""old days"" you needed to at least have ONE V8 in your lineup to be considered Premium; these days volumetric efficiency seems to have become an acceptable alternative to displacement, but there are Premium class identifiers that Acura seemed, for a time, to embrace and recently they seem to eschew.
They may very well be reliable and durable, but they need to be more difficult to be distinguished from their more humble Honda roots. Audis, for years, were often said to be ""higher cost Vw's"" -- an A4 (called an Audi 4000 on this side of the Atlantic) was somewhat of a hard sell compared to a Passat (called a Quantum) when the Quantum had an Audi 5 cylinder while the Audi had to settle for a four-cylinder. Only when Audi decided to de-VW its cars did it begin to get the respect and pricing power to be in the premium class.
Acura has (until today, hopefully) had way too much Honda in their cars -- placing them at the same place Audi was about 20 years ago.
It's time for Acura to get serious, eschewing FWD in the TLX would be a good start-- Acura needs to piss or get off the pot, in crude terms, to be blunt.
Of course, well, you know . . . . but never uncertain.
Drive It Like You Live."
April 2014,"For me the TLX looks great on paper and I like the styling of the prototype. There were a few spy shots that were not very flattering, but overall I'm happy with what I see so far.
The next big hurdle is the interior. I know we'll see that this week at the Auto Show here in NYC, maybe I should stop by myself come to think of it!
Having looked at a TL in 2011 when I was last in the market, the interior, beak and that... boomerang thing... on the trunk, drove me away. This time they're seemingly on the right track."
April 2014,"Mark...as always, appreciate your thoughts.
Of course, the proof is in the pudding. We won't know what it's like to drive until they hit the streets (May?). My dealer usually has big, invitation only rollouts with fanfare when a new model comes out. They have a string quartet, champagne, canapés, etc. They then have some of the new models for brief test drives. Last one I did was for the RLX (another nice car that's getting little love).
You're an Audi aficionado. I'm a little jaded because of what happened with mine. That shouldn't detract from your obvious love of the ones you've had, and continue to have.
I'm an Acura aficinado. Through BMWs, Audis, Cadillacs, etc, my Acuras are still among the best cars I've ever owned....and, like you, I've owned quite a few.
Your Audi is based on a FWD architecture. Yes, Quattro alleviates much of the FWD understeer. Still, day=to-day driving? You, me, anyone else would be hard pressed to say which wheels are motivating the car. They've become quite good at taming those bugaboos.
On paper at least, it looks like the new TLX will have what the Acura folks have been clamoring for.
While the 4 cyl will get the lion's share of volume, I'm more interested in the SH-AWD version, as always. Sticking to the formula of Good/Better/Best (standard/Tech/Advance) I just confirmed with the dealer that the Advance I'll be looking at will come in right around that $49K range (current Advance is $48K and change).
0-60 in 5 sec, Torque vectoring AWD, upgraded materials everywhere, lighter, LED headlights/tailights, high zoot stereo, sports leather seating, blind spot warning, integrated NAV that actually works right (and Siri enabled to fully integrate my iPhone), a little bit of this, a little more of that, at that price? Yep, it's at the top of my shopping list."
April 2014,"""Yes, I know the A4 is offered in an FWD configuration (somewhere) -- but of the 5 or so Audi dealers I am aware of there are NO, ZERO, NONE, NADDA, FWD A4's (I don't even know if you could order one if you tried) available and the dealers have no intention of ever having one (again, assuming you can get one, even.)""
Here in the desert sunbelt or in Fl., most of the A4's in stock are fwd., so I think it's a regional thing."
April 2014,"Acura TLX
There are (were) many good things to be said (and enjoyed) about the current TL SH-AWD (in Advance trim) -- trouble is (was) I often found myself ""apologizing"" for the Acura's styling and ""cheap looking"" (for the class it was aspiring to compete in) ""over-Honda-ized"" interior.
The concept version is quite the step up in the styling department; but, I think the same can be said for the Infiniti Q50, too. And, well, talk about piling on -- the Q50 can't get NO love from NOBODY, well maybe a little bit from Popular Mechanics.
I did then and still do today liken the TL in SH-AWD Advance form as Acura's S4 (for a lot less $). Now that I have a '14 S4, I do appreciate it [the S4] even more -- but the inherent goodness of the TL SH-AWD remains and, hopefully, will continue and grow in the updated TLX. If the price of the TLX SH-AWD Advance can stay under $50K, it ought to be a winner just so long as it [the TLX] doesn't lose the performance bits and driver involvement of the outgoing TL (this -- reduced driver involvement -- seems to be the main complaint about the Q50, as I recall).
I had thought Acura had all but given up wanting to compete with the premium Germans and the other premium Japanese offerings. It would seem the TLX could knock the Q50 to last place and maybe even breathe down the IS 350's neck (assuming the Acura in FWD trim is not compared with the IS in either rear or AWD configuration).
Perhaps things will get interesting again -- it was starting (for a while there) to look like the IS was going to be the only current Japanese Premium sporty sedan. This new TLX SH-AWD could turn the corner and the tide for that matter.
I'll probably not make any friends for saying this, but: in this class (A4, 3 series, C Class, ATS, IS, Q50 etc), there should be NO FWD only models (unless and only unless a customer wants to special order one). Yes, I know the A4 is offered in an FWD configuration (somewhere) -- but of the 5 or so Audi dealers I am aware of there are NO, ZERO, NONE, NADDA, FWD A4's (I don't even know if you could order one if you tried) available and the dealers have no intention of ever having one (again, assuming you can get one, even.)
The new A3 and the new ""baby Benz 4-door coupe"" may come as FWD models and the dealer body may elect to stock a few to attract more potential (and younger, perhaps?) customers, and that is fine. But at the ELLPS (Premium models) RWD and/or AWD are expected -- and here in Cincinnati AWD BMW's look to overtake the RWD versions soon if they haven't already (and the AWD trend is thus in Mercedes, Cadillac, Infiniti and Lexus for many models).
Having the TLX offered with FWD makes a statement -- something like ""take the 'P' out of ELLPS."" I would think it is a message Acura doesn't want to promote (given the overwhelming success -- he said sarcastically -- of the FWD RLX.)
In our fair city, the Honda dealership is ""real close"" (geographically) to the Acura store -- I would think some would shop a Honda after seeing the sticker on an FWD TLX. The TLX needs to make at least good run at being a performance model -- and it will be hard pressed, today, to do that as a front driver.
Of course, I could be wrong -- just not uncertain.

stickguy....yes, the 4 cyl from the now defunct TSX will go in the entry level TSX model. It will have a 9-speed DCT trans. Whereas the 3.5L will have an 8-speed trans.
Rumor is the 4 cyl and 6 cyl base cars will offer P-AWS-4 wheel steer from the RLX. The SH AWD will still be available but it's significantly lighter than before.
Interesting to note, the new TLX is supposed to be a 1/2 second faster to 60....pretty significant. That puts it smack dab in the middle of the lux/performance cars we always talk about here...like the IS350, Audi S4, BMW 335i, Infiniti G/Q.

in New York, they will ticket parked cars on the street with no front plate. They will also specifically pull you over for not having a front plate.
In Connecticut, you are required to have a front plate, but from what I understand (hearsay) the police will not specifically pull you over for not having a front plate. If you get pulled over for something else, then they'll give you a no front plate ticket as well."

March 2014,I have 18' winter and 19' summers (which I have yet to try) - both are uber aggressive sport - I guess it's a nature of that set up- I have base seats and which have good support and grip. The transmission very good for an auto - agree
March 2014,"I have the all-season tire option -- and the ride is firm, but compliant, not rough. My previous A4 had the 19"" 35 series tires (and the sport suspension, too) -- you were aware of every grain of sand on the road. The 18""s are 40 series, which are somewhat better since the sidewalls aren't quite as stiff and there is a bit more cushion between you and the road, given the higher/taller aspect ratio.
The potholes here in Cincinnati have multiplied like rabbits this year -- I dread the almost unavoidable consequences of hitting one. Last time I did that it cost me one new wheel and four new tires. On an Audi, everything is breathtakingly expensive. We're talking a number beginning with a 2 -- yikes! Damn potholes.
When I cruise down the highway with these tires, there is very little road noise and, being that the tire sidewalls are only stiff, not super-stiff, the ride is actually not an issue. I do, however, have the upgraded seats, which probably account for part of the comfort, too.
You're right, when you put the car in Sport mode and use the paddle-shifter to blast up and down the highway, the thing really feels like a sports car. The paddles, in fact, in this car, provide the only ""instant"" shift I have ever experienced with any car (I love the S-tronic trans.)

February 2014,"That's about it, it is the sue happy legal system in the Staes that tends to limit new technology for safety in cars coming as soon a s it is available ( I seem to recall it took several extra years for the Germans to bring things like ABS, Traction Control, and even airbags, after they were introduced in Europe. To be fair though the American companies have introduced a lot of technology in the lower end of the market first ( Chrysler with at least a driver side air bag in pretty much every car they sold way before anybody else put them in standard) and GM with ABS in the Cavalier as already mentioned, and I think they were one of the first with traction control as standard in some lower end cars as well ( grand ams for instance). At least there is no longer an Americans car to hat I know off that still comes with a four speed transmission ( unlike Toyota). The eight, nine, and ten speed transmissions are coming from the us manufactures, but it takes time to not only develop them, but to get suppliers to make the parts, and factories tooled to get them built, and to figure out how to make it cost effective to put them in lower end models, they aren't free after all. And why just pick on the American manufactures, where are the eight + speeds in the Japanese ( and even the German ) mainstream line up, some of them still only have 5 speeds in most of their line up. And Chrysler is the one who is offering eight and nine speed transmissions in their lower end cars first, so it is a little unfair to say that the American manufactures are putting technology in their cars, on the other hand I do agree that their high end models ( I.e. Cadillac and Lincoln at least) should have had this technology within a year or two of it appearing on the German makes, and I don't recall that happening so in that respect you are correct."

February 2014,"I think the issue was perception of safety as a priority. At that time it was not not perceived as such and stereo or power windows sold well, whereas ABS or airbags were considered ""fluff"". There were many examples of drivers choosing entertainment, or convenience options over safety when it was done as an alternative of ""free upgrade"", or simple limit of total price. It changed today, but it is still expected to be ""free"". In other words ABS or stability control should be ""free"" (i.e. included in price that is same as last year model), but leather or premium stereo, no problem as an option.
To best see how peoples' preferences changed is to watch evolution of Toyota cars. Toyota has almost six sense, when it comes to timing standard inclusion of equipment in the model vs. market demands. When Toyota offers something standard, it means the segment requires that as such. When it is still an expensive option, it means people will either be willing to pay extra or so without it. Detroit (GM especially) had an opposite problem - wrong timing. They'd put something on when nobody saw that necessary (e.g. ABS on Cavalier), but later they'd remove it when market was just about to demand it."
February 2014,"Glad to see ""us"" scratching our heads wondering why the nearly 13 year gap between working ABS in a Chrysler (I think it was only 2-channel ABS, but hey it worked) and the German's putting it in their top of the line models. I had a 1986 Audi 5000CS quattro and it had ABS -- indeed, it had an ""off on"" ABS switch on the dash. The owner's manual explained when ABS worked and when it was best to turn it off.
Of course they took the switch away when they found out that sometimes people would turn ABS off at inappropriate times because they thought there was something wrong with their brakes since they ""pulsed"" when ABS was activated.
A case of ignorance winning out over technology.
According to the owner's manual, you should turn your ABS off when driving in deep gravel or deep not packed (fluffy) snow, since you could use a locked wheel/tire to slow you down in deep gravel since a mound of gravel would pile up under the tires rapidly shedding speed. The mound-ing effect was cancelled by the action of the ABS, making the stopping more difficult in deep snow or gravel.
In any case, my confusion and perhaps even frustration is with the slow adoption of tech that is actually very inexpensive. And American mfgrs are some of the worst offenders. Hell, they'll jump on putting power windows in an el cheapo car, but delay for decades incorporating ABS, ESP, blind spot monitoring, etc etc etc. I would assume the cost of the hardware for power windows, power sunroofs and power door locks is more than the cost of a backup camera and blind spot monitoring, for example.
I'm pretty confident that the reason for the delay has something to do with perceived demand, costs and what the mfgr must see as their customers' perception of the value of such tech.
To me, this [safety and/or performance and/or convenience] tech is almost essential any more. Even though I think factory sat nav is outrageously priced, I wouldn't leave home without it -- but c'mon to add ""MMI"" to an Audi is $3,500 -- and for that you get sat nav, bluetooth and voice activation of several of the car's systems -- all nicely integrated. This has to provide Audi with a super high gross margin -- and, even knowing that, the majority of cars my Audi dealer sells (which are overwhelmingly Q5s and A4s) come with MMI, ""because that's what people want.""
Maybe things like ABS, when they were a $500 option, just didn't seem sexy enough, no matter how little it cost. Of course, now we're moving into a whole new era of auto tech -- autonomy. . . .

February 2014,"That's right--1971 Chrysler Imperial had ABS on all 4 wheels. And apparently, it worked quite well."
February 2014,"Mark, ABS was standard on MB S class in 1985, my 86 300SDL had them standard. Now did you know the Oldsmobile was the first US manufacture to have an Airbag as an option in the 70's. Needless to say, not many where sold...
I thought Lexus was the first manufacture to come out with the 8 spd in the LS430. I do agree with you Mark that US automakers really needed to see the benefit of the 8 or 9 spd auto. I know that my BMW wouldn't be as lively if it had the old 6 spd steptronic."
February 2014,"Oh, I dunno... the badges go really nicely with a snappy vest and a pocketwatch."
February 2014,"The Audi's backup camera screen shows trajectory lines that ""curve"" as the steering wheel is turned. The Acura? Straight lines, no curve, no match to steering wheel inputs.
Now, the Infiniti, it had front camera and rear camera and trajectory lines when the car was in reverse and drive -- of course, it also had the wonderful, fantastic, gotta have it, around-view monitor. Of course now both Audi and BMW offer this tech, but it is still not universal.
Of course, I recently read an article about how many times backup camera adoption has been pushed to a future year -- I guess we should feel good that the German and Japanese (premium) cars typically come standard with such tech and that it is pretty much ""available"" on the lesser cars from that mfgr.
Looks like backup cameras are ""probably"" going to be required as of January 2015 -- but don't hold your breath. By the time the backup camera is a requirement, the all-around or top-view systems will be the norm in the premium segment.
If you've not seen what an all-around top-view, etc, set-up can do, check out your nearest Infiniti showroom -- this is seriously cool tech that makes driving and parking in tight spaces, oh, only about a MILLION PERCENT easier and safer!
I graduated from college in 1973 (yep, I am old) and I took a course in 1971 where a new technology was introduced (in a Chrysler, no less): anti-lock brakes. 1971. Let that sink in -- the first car I was personally aware of that could actually have ABS as it came to be called was a 1985 model year BMW ""7"" series which, as I recall, came to the US market in calendar 1984.
What in the wide-wide world of sports took 13 years [for anti-lock brakes] to go from Chrysler (std equipment on the gas-turbine car they produced) to BMW (probably sourced from Bosch). The year following, ABS was offered on the Audi 200 (US name 5000S) quattro (and probably the FWD version too for that matter.) Yet, when was it that mere mortals could get ABS on their Blue Ovals and Bow Ties? It seems like it took decades!
Of course it took another automotive eternity to make ESP widely available, too. To a certain extent Audi took a helluva long time to bring ""torque vectoring"" (aka ""sport differential"") to market -- doing so, I believe, sometime after Acura announced their version of torque vectoring with the mouthful of a name -- SH-AWD.
I've had ABS, ESP, TPMS, sat nav, voice activation, blind spot monitoring, bi-xenon head-lights (except for the Acura), back-up or all-around view cameras and monitors and a whole host of other ""ought to be standard equipment"" stuff for longer than I can remember (and it is not -- yet -- due to a fading memory); this stuff is very cheap to make and probably all of this technology can fit in the space of one chip, with room to spare, these days. Why does the trickle down or even just the offering of the technology move at glacial speed for pity's sake?
Another technology that ""ought to be standard"" is the 7, 8 or 9 (or more) speed transmission. I believe a base 4-cylinder 2010 Audi A4 was offered with an 8-speed tiptronic transmission; and, I believe every or virtually every BMW can be had with an 8 speed unit, too. The 8-speed's reason for being is economy and performance, yes? Why didn't Chevy -- to name one -- do what these Germans did: go to ZF and buy the 8-speed units and tout their benefits in their brand new Impalas and SS's and, same question for Ford. The efficiency and performance gains alone should have made this worth doing -- instead we've got a whole bunch of new ""made in the USA"" cars with ""old"" 6-speed transmissions.

February 2014,"My BMW does this as well, infact when the car applys the brakes the brakes lights come on. I have been traveling between Phoenix and San Diego quite a bite as my father was in the hospital, and found this feature very helpful. I wonder why Acura do not do this.."
February 2014,"My wife's Mazda CX-7 does that as well ... will automatically downshift the automatic transmission to a lower gear to maintain the set speed on CC when going down hills. I agree, it's a nice feature to have - especially here in Colorado, where we have a fair amount of elevation change on the roads."
February 2014,"@sweendogy: I read an article about the ""individual"" settings that suggested the steering will perform at its best if set to Auto. I can't seem to locate the article, but I know it was in a fairly recent Car & Driver or Automobile or Road & Track, since those are the publications I subscribe to.
I don't know if I can honestly tell much of a difference, but for what it's worth, I set mine to Dynamic, Auto & Comfort (engine/transmission, steering, exhaust sound, respectively).
The primary (perhaps the ONLY) difference with the engine/transmission setting at dynamic is that the transmission will default to S mode which seems to hold in gear longer before upshift, perform obvious rev matches during downshifts and make the ""fart"" sound on upshifts more aggressive (hence my setting of ""comfort"" for the engine sound).
Now that I have passed 5,000 miles I am noticing better gas mileage, improved performance and a feeling of ""less friction"" overall. I had really missed the cruise control in the Audi -- when I set the CC to, say, 45MPH in the Acura TL SH-AWD and then find myself going down a rather steep hill seeing a curve at the bottom, the Acura would start freewheeling, so to speak and pick up more and more speed (based on the grade). Then, to negotiate the turn, I would have to brake -- which turned the cruise control off, of course. In the Audi, set the CC for 45MPH and go down a virtual vertical drop and the CC holds the speed at 45MPH, period. Then when reaching the base of the downhill, I can negotiate the curve without killing the cruise control.
It is a little thing, perhaps for some people. But my 2005 A6 and 2009 A4 had this feature and my 2011 Infiniti and 2012 Acura did not -- it seemed [on those Japanese premium cars] like a huge oversight.
Another thing I like about the Audi CC is if you've set it, say, at 75MPH and you come into a heavily monitored construction zone where the speed limit is reduced to 55MPH, you can toggle the CC stalk to 55 and the car brakes and resets itself at 55. With the Acura, for instance, you could only coast down or apply the brakes yourself.
I know there will be folks who are dead set against the car having this much ""intelligence"" or autonomy (and this ain't THAT much, folks), but it can simply be turned off if you don't want to ""enjoy"" a tiny bit smarter cruise control.
In any case, I keep forgetting just how much technology comes with these German cars -- and how it does its best to help you not get ticketed and remain in control. I give this feature alone an ""A"" for its contribution to safety.

You hit the nail on the head. You budget for repairs & maintenance. Most people don't do that.

They just blow their former car payment and then either put the next major repair on a credit card or trade the car in and take out a loan on a new car.
A lot of people don't look at big picture things like total cost of ownership, instead choosing to focus on the monthly payment amount."
